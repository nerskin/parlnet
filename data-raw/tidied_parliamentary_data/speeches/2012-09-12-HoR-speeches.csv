Ms MACKLIN
 (Jagajaga—Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister for Disability Reform) (09:02):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


This bill introduces several measures from the 2012 budget, along with some non-budget amendments that clarify current budget policies and improve the operation of existing legislation.




Extending
 Cape York Welfare Reform Trial



In the 2012 budget, the Gillard government provided $11.8 million to extend the Cape York Welfare Reform Trial for 12 months to 31 December 2013.


The trial is a partnership between the communities of Aurukun, Coen, Hope Vale and Mossman Gorge; the Australian government; the Queensland government; and the Cape York Institute for Policy and Leadership. It aims to restore local Indigenous authority, encourage positive behaviours and improve economic and living conditions.


To date, the trial has made a real and lasting difference in the lives of Indigenous people on the cape. Since it began in July 2008, the Cape York welfare reform communities have seen improvements in school attendance, care and protection of children, and community safety.


The Family Responsibilities Commission, which is established under Queensland government legislation, is a key plank of Cape York welfare reform. Local family responsibility commissioners hold conferences with community members, refer people to support services and, when necessary, arrange income management.


Currently, a person can be subject to income management under the trial only after a decision by the Family Responsibilities Commission made before 1 January 2013.


This bill extends that date to 1 January 2014. The extension provides an opportunity to build on the success of the initiatives already underway.


I am pleased that the Queensland government has agreed to continue funding for the Family Responsibilities Commission and will extend the Queensland legislation governing the operation of the commission.


An evaluation of the trial is currently underway and will help inform future efforts in Cape York.




Indigenous education payments



In a significant boost to Indigenous education, the bill also amends the Indigenous Education (Targeted Assistance) Act 2000 to increase the act’s legislative appropriation—by around $16 million combined for the 2012 and 2013 calendar years.


The increase to the 2012 and 2013 appropriations reflects the continuation of existing initiatives and new initiatives announced in the 2012-13 budget.


The increase in the appropriations for 2012 and 2013 will continue existing initiatives and provide funding for several new initiatives, including expansion of the Sporting Chance Program, Teach Remote Stage 2, Student Education Trusts delivered as part of the Cape York Welfare Reform Trial, and initiatives that support teachers, professional development and front-line services to improve Aboriginal children’s access to quality education.


The existing Sporting Chance Program uses sport and recreation to increase the engagement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students in their schooling. Students are rewarded for good school attendance or engagement through participation in sporting teams or access to certain intensive, high-quality, sports focused learning and development. New school based sports academies will now be established and operated to deliver the program for secondary school boys, and there will be additional programs for secondary school girls.


Additional funding under the Teach Remote Stage 2 initiative will expand Commonwealth funded assistance with building a high-status, high-quality, committed and competent teacher workforce in remote Indigenous communities that are under the National Alliance of Remote Indigenous Schools.


Additional funding will also extend for 12 months for the Student Education Trusts measures that form part of the Cape York Welfare Reform Trial. The Student Education Trusts are a financial management service whereby parents and care givers from the remote Indigenous communities in the Cape York area are supported and encouraged to save for their children’s education costs from their early years through to tertiary education.




Non-budget amendments



The bill also introduces some non-budget amendments to clarify current government policies and improve the operation of existing legislation.


These include a package of minor amendments to improve the operation of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal in the social security, child support, family assistance and paid parental leave jurisdictions. For example, some amendments will enable Social Security Appeals Tribunal members to release protected information to relevant authorities in certain circumstances where there is a risk to the life, health or welfare of a person.


Amendments also improve privacy protections for information and documents. The Social Security Appeals Tribunal principal member will be able to issue a non-disclosure order that applies to any information or documents obtained by a person at any time during the review process. Amendments also extend confidentiality obligations to all people providing services at the hearing of the review.


The objective of the Social Security Appeals Tribunal is to provide a mechanism of review that is fair, just, economical, informal and quick. Amendments clarify that this objective is to be pursued by the principal member in performing his or her functions and powers under the legislation.


Amendments are made by this bill to the child support legislation to confirm the longstanding policy and administration where the amount payable under a parent’s child support assessment is reduced because a court decides that the payer is not a parent of one of the children in their assessment, but the payer remains liable for another child in the assessment.


The policy is that the total amount previously paid for the period (including amounts paid for the child that was found to be not theirs) would be applied to their child support liability for any remaining children in the case, and any child support debt for those children. Any excess child support they paid may be recovered from the payee by applying for a court order under the existing child support legislation.


Finally, minor clarifications are made to portfolio legislation, including the Schoolkids Bonus legislation and the family assistance clean energy legislation—consistent with existing policy.


I commend the bill to the House.


Debate adjourned.

Mr JENKINS
 (Scullin) (09:47):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights I present the committee's second report of 2012, entitled Examination of legislation in accordance with the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011: Bills introduced 14-23 August 2012, Legislative Instruments registered with the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments 22 July-23 August 2012.


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Mr JENKINS:
  by leave—In this second report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, the committee has considered nine bills introduced during the period 14 August to 23 August 2012 and 146 legislative instruments registered with the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments between 23 July and 22 August 2012. Three of the bills do not engage human rights. One bill was introduced with a statement of compatibility claiming that the bill does not engage human rights but for which the committee considers it requires further information before it is able to form its own view. A further bill was introduced without a statement of compatibility. In each of these cases the committee proposes to write to the relevant minister and seek clarification before considering the bills further. The remaining four bills engage human rights. The committee considers that one of these bills is compatible with the rights engaged and that the committee requires further information to assist it in its consideration of the remaining three bills.


Once again I would like to emphasise that the committee seeks to work constructively with the proponents of bills as they familiarise themselves with these requirements. The committee is particularly mindful of the needs of private members and senators in this regard. Private members and senators do not have the benefit of the resources of departments to support them as they familiarise themselves with the new requirements. The committee would urge private members and senators to contact the committee secretariat to seek assistance in locating relevant reference material and templates.


In considering its first tranche of legislative instruments, the committee notes that most of these instruments do not raise human rights compatibility concerns and have been registered with statements of compatibility that the committee considers to be adequate. A number of instruments have been introduced with statements of compatibility that do not fully meet the committee's expectations. As the instruments in question do not raise human rights compatibility concerns, the committee proposes to write to the relevant minister in a purely advisory capacity providing guidance on the preparation of statements of compatibility. The committee hopes that this approach will assist in the preparation of future statements of compatibility that conform more completely to the committee's expectations. The committee has identified six instruments that it considers appear to be compatible with human rights but for which it proposes to seek further clarification from the relevant minister.


In closing I would like to take this opportunity to once again place on record my thanks to the deputy chair, the member for Hasluck, and the other members of the committee and the members of the secretariat for their approach to the work of the committee, which I think has proceeded in a constructive manner. I thank the House for its attention this morning.

"Hunt, Greg, MP",LP,2012-09-12,"



Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (09:51):  The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Declared Fishing Activities) Bill is not about the Margiris. This bill is about unfettered and arbitrary powers that are an attack on every recreational fishing community and every family fishing operation in Australia. This bill is not about protecting fish stocks and it has nothing to with the Margiris. It has everything to do with a Trojan Horse operation that introduces a new level of ministerial power that is extraordinary, arbitrary and unfettered. We in this place are custodians of good governance and we have to deal with the issues. But this bill is the likes of which we have not previously seen. The powers are arbitrary, they are unfettered and they are plenary, and the fishing community, as well as the general community, has been sold a pup, because it has nothing to do with the supertrawler. It has everything to do with a knee-jerk reaction that will not deal with the problem but that absolutely confers unlimited executive authority on ministers, without any reference either to fact or to the ability to appeal. It confers the ability to destroy any small family fishing operation on the basis of the slightest issue of social concern raised by the Greens.


I now turn to the concerns the opposition has on three fronts with the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Declared Fishing Activities) Bill 2012, because this is the 'arbitrary ministerial powers bill'. The first of our concerns is about unlimited arbitrary ministerial powers. The second is about a chaotic process after the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, in his previous role as minister for fisheries, invited the Margiris into Australia, when he called in October 2009 for large-scale factory fishing vessels to come into Australia. That was not us. That was not the fishing community. A paper was signed off by the minister calling for large-scale factory fishing vessels to come into this country.


So that is the sovereign risk issue, which has already seen the announcement by Seafish that 50 Australian jobs will now be terminated. The question for the government is, will they compensate the long-term unemployed who had finally found a job and who, as of today, will not have that job? Will the Prime Minister compensate the long-term unemployed as part of the 50 Australians who are now losing their jobs? This is the live cattle issue on steroids. And it is a Trojan Horse, because it is an attack on every family fishing operation and every recreational fishing community in Australia.


Let me do something a little unusual and turn to the deep and specific provisions within the bill. The operative provision is 390SD subparagraph (3)(a), which reads as follows:


(3)   The Minister must not make an interim declaration—


that is,  to cease operations, whether by recreational fishers or commercial fishers—


unless the Minister—


that is, the environment minister—


and the Fisheries Minister agree that:


and here is the critical quote:


(a)   there is uncertainty about the environmental, social or economic impacts of the fishing activity.


We spoke with the departmental officials and with officials from the two ministers' offices and asked, what is the definition of 'social uncertainty'? We asked that because this is a new level. To be fair, it was not for them to determine that. But nobody can define what social uncertainty means in the context of this act. And it is not just uncertainty; it is uncertainty in the mind of the minister. There are a number of ministers who live in a permanent state of uncertainty. But this is a new test: 'uncertainty in the mind of the minister'. Social uncertainty has been introduced into the environment act of Australia as the test for an arbitrary, plenary power which is unfettered in its application and can be implemented without notice, without pause, without evidence but simply on the basis of uncertainty.


That can be done, whether it is raised through a Twitter troll or whether it is raised in a letter from the Greens to the minister. There are no conditions, there are no limits, there are no barriers. But we thought long and hard about a definition of social uncertainty, and finally we realised that social uncertainty is when Kevin walks into a room where Julia is present. And that is precisely what happened on the weekend. Kevin walked into Julia's room and put in place social uncertainty by saying he would support the member for Fremantle's bill. And, voila! Two days later, the government reversed the position it had supported through three previous decisions. The government reversed the decision on the basis of social uncertainty, and now they bring in the legislation to justify that definition of social uncertainty.


So we now have an exemplar of the Ruddism that has infected the government: whenever the smallest issue is raised by opponents of fishing or of anything else, we have a decision which is immediate and which has human impacts in the form of 50 lost jobs as announced by Seafish—and those are just the Australian jobs that are to be lost. The vast bulk of those who will lose their jobs, I am advised, are the long-term unemployed out of Devonport. So I would ask the government—the Prime Minister, the minister for the environment and the minister for fisheries—to go to Devonport and meet those people who will lose their jobs as a consequence of this decision.


Let us go further into this notion of social uncertainty. The Environment Act is now guided by a new principle: social uncertainty. That means whatever the minister wants it to mean. 'Social uncertainty' means whatever the minister wants it to mean. A minister can now exercise powers that will close down and destroy a family fishing operation, which can close a recreational fishing ground, on no basis—simply that there is uncertainty. There is no requirement of proof of damage. There is no evidence required of fact. There is no evidence required of anything. It is a Trojan Horse to give the minister unfettered, arbitrary powers to be exercised without notice to the detriment of any fishing community.


I understand that people were genuinely and legitimately concerned about the issue of overfishing—but this bill does not address the quota at all. The quota today will be exactly the same as the quota of yesterday. But what has happened is that there is a new level of uncertainty. Let me give an example of this arbitrary power in the eyes of the fishing community. The Australian Marine Alliance have today issued a statement. Their headline is 'sustainable environmental economic'. They are supporting Australia's commercial and recreational sectors. They say:


We make no excuses for arguing that if this bill passes we will see dozens if not hundreds of businesses exit the industry. In our view the answer is not to give the department of the environment in Canberra greater control over fisheries management but rather for the fisheries portfolio to secure a competent minister who can effectively fulfil their duties as minister for fisheries. As an example, if this bill passes, it will give the department of the environment in Canberra the authority to stop recreational anglers all the way down the east coast from fishing for Bluefin tuna in Commonwealth waters.


That is a quote from the Australian Marine Alliance.


But let us take this further and go to the actual definition of 'uncertainty'—because there is no definition of 'social uncertainty'; it means whatever the minister wants it to mean. The government have created their own problem by inviting the Margiris in. The minister invited the Margiris in in October 2009 with the reference and the call for large-scale factory fishing vessels. They are not our words, but words from AFMA, in a paper signed off by the then minister for fisheries, the now Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities. They invited, they argued for, they created the problem, and now they are creating arbitrary powers.


But it goes further than that, because you then ask: how wide is the range of activities to which the social uncertainty clause can apply? I will turn to paragraph 2 of section 390SD 'Interim declaration' in the bill before us today. It reads:


(2)   When making an interim declaration, the Minister may identify a fishing activity by reference to all or any of the following:


(a) a method of fishing;


(b) a type of vessel used for fishing;


(c) a method of processing, carrying or transhipping of fish that have been taken;


(d) an area of waters or of seabed.


So let us understand this: we have an arbitrary power, an unfettered power, an absolute power, which can be used without any just cause, which is non-renewable, which cannot be questioned, and which applies to anything anywhere. So the first part is the power and the second part, as contained in paragraph 2, is the scope and the extent of that power. It says 'an area of waters or of seabed'—any part of Australia, any fishing activity, anywhere at any time. This is not about the fact that there has been damage; there only needs to be social uncertainty.


So we now have the environment act being run on the basis of social uncertainty—giving arbitrary powers for application anywhere, anytime, to anyone. If you are a recreational fisher you might have had legitimate and understandable concerns about the Margiris. I had raised those concerns myself in calling for an independent scientific panel, and there was a genuinely independent scientific panel. I was surprised by the result. The independent scientific panel came down some weeks ago. It was clear and categorical and I had called for it. I accept that.


But when we look at this, the government's response is the same as it was for live cattle. It is the same as it was for the home insulation program. It is the same as Green Loans and Green Start. It is this example—again and again—of a position taken on the basis of any small public campaign, but with no concern whatsoever for the human consequences. Today, of all of the legislation we have seen in the last nearly five years, this is the most arbitrary, most extreme and most unfettered. It is quite extraordinary.


I turn again to the words of the Australian Marine Alliance, which refers to this bill: 'The more immediate concern is the bill to be debated in parliament today that has been hastily drafted by Minister Burke and that will give the minister for the environment and his department almost unfettered authority over all forms of fishing.' So this is a new arbitrary power on the basis of social uncertainty. This government is defined by social uncertainty. The vast majority of ministers live in a permanent haze of social uncertainty, and we have just enshrined that as the basis for the destruction of the livelihoods of small fishers.


This bill has nothing to do with the Margiris, about which people have genuine concerns and for which we have a solution. It has everything to do with a rank extension of authority in an arbitrary and unfettered capacity over the livelihoods and the recreational habits of Australian fishers everywhere. That brings to Australia a broader risk. We heard much from government ministers last week about sovereign risk. This bill introduces sovereign risk on a grand scale in Australia. This bill came after three consecutive decisions from the government.


In October 2009 the fisheries minister at the time called for large-scale factory freezer vessels. The small pelagic fisheries harvest strategy released by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, signed off by the minister, revised in October 2009, refers to the 'economies of scale in the fishery and the most efficient way to fish may include large scale factory freezer vessels'. The Margiris has been in play for seven years and this was a green light. This strategy was a green light to say 'come on down' to Australia. We did not invite the Margiris, Minister Burke invited the Margiris. That is what large-scale factory freezer vessel means. The Margiris is the definition. It is the response. It is the outcome of the October 2009 decision to release this strategy.


Seafish, an Australian company, then worked with the government. At no point was there an indication, according to the owners, that they were outside of the law, or that they were even outside of the policy. They operated on the advice, on the belief, on the understanding that the government wanted them here.


What is the result? Seafish director Gerry Geen—and let's start with the human consequences—said today that unfortunately the decision would mean that 50 Australians, including the 45 people engaged in Devonport, would lose their jobs. He went on to say:


It is going to be hard to have to tell those employees, some of them who were long-term unemployed, that we no longer have a job for them.


So there is a direct, real human consequences to Australia's long-term unemployed people. He continued:


It seems that after we have met every rule, regulation and request made of us, after years of working with the relevant authorities, that in the end the government reacted to the size of the Abel Tasman and not the size of the quota and the science that supports it.


I want to emphasise a point about sovereign risk. This decision sends an awful message to all potential investors in Australia to be very, very afraid. It shows that this government will change the rules after you are committed to a venture, putting at risk the investment, jobs and all the hard work of many people over many years. Then, when you have met all the new rules and requests, they can still just shut you down. That is sovereign risk. Sovereign risk is where people rely on the word and the law and they act, to their detriment but to the benefit of the country, on the basis of the word and the law and of the undertakings of ministers. Then, the government takes it away with no warning, with no ability to adapt and with no concern.


This is a very serious moment in Australia's parliament. We had the live cattle decision, which by the way is wreaking havoc right now in Indigenous communities across Queensland and the Northern Territory, according to meetings I have had with their representatives in the last few weeks. Those communities of Indigenous pastoralists and Indigenous cattlemen and women still are being affected by the live cattle decision, because of the ramifications in Indonesia, which has cut the quota to Australia. The government will say, 'Gosh, it is just a coincidence they cut the quota to Australia after we slashed their protein in half and after we made an arbitrary decision.' It is not a coincidence. It is a direct response and anybody saying otherwise is in denial.


That was the live cattle decision, but this is worse because these unemployed people had been taken on board. They had been employed and the firm had acted on the basis of following every law. And the ministers encouraged them. How can anybody ever again trust this government? How can anybody ever again do business with this government? How can any firm ever again invest with confidence in Australia? Whether it is the carbon tax, the mining tax, the home insulation program, Green Loans, Green Start or live cattle or whether it is this instance, where there is arbitrary executive power over our fisheries, the rules change overnight on the basis of an email. That is the truth of it and that is the problem. That is why this government is no longer fit for office.


They have made Australia an international laughing stock in terms of sovereign risk. We have seen that in our plummet down the World Economic Forum lists in terms of reliability and wastefulness of governance. What more of a message could this government have had?


With regard to sovereign risk we see that the minister created the problem when, as fisheries minister, he called for large-scale factory freezer vessels. The ministers, both of the them, created the problem when they gave comfort, succour, aid and invitation to Seafish to bring the Margiris into Australia. We know about the discussion and the negotiations. This government invited the Margiris into Australia and then they turned around and made Australia a laughing stock. That is Ruddism. That is what has happened to the modern Labor Party. It does not matter who the leader is. There is a deep infection in the culture of a political party that no longer believes in anything.


I now turn to the issue of science. I want to deal with the statement AFMA made on their web site on the issue of the Margiris. That statement was updated on Monday of this week.


It is headed, 'Why is AFMA confident that the boat's operations would be sustainable'—this is the scientific agency—'Because', they say, 'these catch limits are strictly enforced by AFMA using high-tech systems', 'Australia's fisheries management is consistently ranked among the world's best by international experts', and:


AFMA has found no evidence that larger boats pose a higher risk to either commercial species or broader marine ecosystems when total catches are limited and the limits are enforced. This type of fishing, mid-water trawling, is one of the most selective, which means the bycatch will be very low. AFMA works closely with fishers to minimise bycatch, and they will be required to follow several rules to ensure wildlife isn't impacted …


And it concludes:


The science shows that localised depletion is unlikely in this fishery, but AFMA will be keeping a close eye on this issue, given the concerns raised.


That was Monday! And on Tuesday, the government said they were uncertain. On Monday there was an express statement on the science. But, just in case anybody missed it, other people have commented on this. Minister Ludwig said in the Senate on Thursday, 23 August:


The setting of catch limits in the small pelagic fishery are based on strong precautionary principle. Under the harvest strategy for this fishery, the catch limit is capped at a maximum of 20 per cent of the estimated available biomass …


He goes on to say:


This is a very conservative limit … Even with that cap, the current management plan sets the quota to less than 10 per cent … These stock limits are based on science and assessed by the experts.


He then went on to say, in relation to a disallowance motion on the quota for the relevant fishery:


The disallowance motion being moved by the Greens is misplaced and could harm fisheries across Australian Commonwealth waters.


…   …   …


This disallowance motion is a message that the Greens political party do not support sustainable catch limits based on science … As minister for fisheries, I will not allow the emotive politics of the Greens political party to run fisheries management policy in this country.


It could have been a work from Monty Python, given what happened, because the government then turned around and did completely the opposite.


But it is not just confined to that minister, because here is what Tony Burke said on Q&A on 3 September:


So what I have signed off on today is effectively the big vessel will have to fish with the rules so the impact it has on the environment is no more than for fishing like a small vessel.


How about that? So, in terms of the official targeting, that part has already been measured as sustainable.




The question with this one, though, is: instead of 20 boats going out to all different parts of a huge fishery that goes all the way around Queensland and South Australia, you get a different impact.



He then goes on to say, 'If there's a problem, they have to move on'—so he had a move-on provision.


So let us understand what all of this means. All of this means one thing: this decision today, perversely, means there will be not one fewer fish caught. The quota that was in place yesterday is the same today, only there will be more boats catching the same number of fish. How does that work? The government have led people to believe there would be a lesser catch of fish. That is what is actually said here. There is not. Their scientific agency does not believe there needs to be a lesser catch. The minister for fisheries does not believe there needs to be a lesser catch. The minister for the environment does not believe there needs to be a lesser catch. So, three boats, or five boats, or 20 boats can now catch exactly the same number of fish. As has been said in the media in the last 24 hours: it is not the size of the boat; it is the size of the quota that matters. And the size of the quota does not change; only that there will be more boats catching the same number of fish. So, as a matter of logic, it has reached a point of perversity. Science has been displaced.


To finish, let me deal with the Magiris. We have said that we would be willing to work with the government to amend the Fisheries Act to ensure that there are stronger move-on powers. We are happy to sit down with the government to give greater move-on powers under the Fisheries Act, and we would be happy to do that now, to walk out of this chamber and support greater move-on powers. We will be moving an amendment to that effect, and I will be moving an amendment to the effect that the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities should explain the reasons for his decision to reverse the policy that he introduced as fisheries minister in 2009 which stated that there are:


… considerable economies of scale in the fishery and the most efficient way to fish may include large-scale factory freezer vessels.


And he should explain why he invited the Magiris into Australia by promoting large-scale factory freezer vessels, and explain what actions he will take to compensate the 50 Australian workers who are losing their jobs as a consequence of this legislation. I move:


That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:


""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House calls on the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities to explain:


(1) the reasons for his decision to reverse the policy that he introduced as Fisheries Minister in October 2009 which stated: ""There are considerable economies of scale in the fishery and the most efficient way to fish may include large scale factory freezer vessels"";


(2) why he effectively invited the Margiris into Australia by promoting ‘large scale factory freezer vessels’; and


(3) what actions he will take to compensate the 50 Australian workers who are losing their jobs as a consequence of this legislation.""


However, knowing that we will also move an amendment to discuss the move-on provisions in the Fisheries Act immediately, we are happy to sit down with the government to provide a way forward for better protection on the Magiris today, this moment, this second—no problem. We will look for stronger actions. This bill keeps the same number of fish being caught. This bill creates sovereign risk. This bill, above all else, gives unlimited, arbitrary powers, an executive blank cheque, to the minister on the basis of social uncertainty. As of today we have a new standard in Australian legislative activity. Social uncertainty is the basis for executive absolute unlimited authority and that is why we oppose the bill.

"Cheeseman, Darren, MP",ALP,2012-09-12,"



Mr CHEESEMAN
 (Corangamite) (10:22):  I rise today to speak in favour of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Declared Fishing Activities) Bill 2012. This is in response to the super- trawler, the vessel that was once known as the Magiris and now referred to as the Abel Tasman, seeking to fish in Australian waters.


To put some facts on the table with respect to this particular vessel, it is 120 metres long, and it weighs close to some 10,000 tonnes. At 600 metres the super-trawler's fishing net is 97 metres longer than the arch of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. It has the capacity to store 6,000 tonnes of fish and can process 250 tonnes of fish a day. The company, Seafish Tasmania, has sought to fish 18,500 tonnes of blue mackerel, jack mackerel and redbait in the Commonwealth small pelagic fishery. This is, as I understand, about the half the quota allowed for these fisheries.


Once news broke that this particular vessel was seeking to come to Australian waters to fish in the small pelagic fishery Australians, quite rightly, became deeply concerned with the prospect of this particular vessel.


It became clear that the Margiris had, rightly or wrongly, developed a reputation elsewhere that had led to damage being done to fisheries in Europe and in Africa, and Australians became concerned. They became concerned from two perspectives. Recreational fishers were concerned that this vessel, with its capacity, would take substantial volumes of these species in areas where larger fish would pursue these smaller species as food. I became aware that tuna fishermen in Victoria were concerned that the Margiris had the potential to take a huge volume of these small species, which of course tuna target. Also, many Australians interested in marine conservation were concerned about the potential for bycatch—turtles, seals, dolphins and the like—being caught up and drowned in large numbers. This issue was raised with me.


The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, the responsible piece of legislation that sets out governance around these matters, is some 20 years old, and it was written at a time when it was not envisaged that these super-trawlers would come to Australia. It is quite appropriate for us to take the opportunity to look at the laws and ensure that they do reflect the views of modern Australia. As a consequence, the government has taken the necessary steps.


It became quite clear through the course of the public discourse on this matter that we were not clear on the science, we were not clear on the possible impact that a super-trawler—the second-largest fishing vessel on this planet—would have on Australia's fishery. We were clear, the science had been done, with respect to smaller vessels—the more traditional fishing vessels that are based in Australia.—but we have not seen a super-trawler in Australian waters, and we are unsure of the consequences. Quite rightly, we need to go away and review the science to try to determine what the impact of super-trawling in Australia might be. It is very important that we undertake that research.


My electorate of Corangamite is nestled between Geelong and south-west Victoria. We have many communities that enjoy recreational fishing. There is the port of Queenscliff, of course, which is a historic fishing port. The Department of Primary Industries in Victoria has a marine management centre there, a research institute, with a lot of marine scientists providing advice to the Victorian government about the Victorian fishery. With the state government cuts I understand some 15 scientists from there will unfortunately be losing their jobs. But we have other fishing communities and ports. We have Apollo Bay, home to crayfisherman and recreational fishers, and many other communities that enjoy recreational fishing.


I would particularly like to take the opportunity to acknowledge Garry Kerr, who is a rec fisherman and owns a fishing tackle shop in Anglesea, for his representations to me on this issue. He was particularly concerned about the consequences of a supertrawler and what it might mean for the tuna that he likes to target himself and that many of the clients of his fishing tackle shop like to tackle.


So I think the approach adopted by the government is the right one. I think the concern raised by the community from a broad and diverse perspective, from recreational fisherman on one hand through to environmentalists and conservationists on the other, very much demonstrates that the legislative arrangements and the science that is in place at this stage are not adequate to give confidence and comfort to the environment minister, to the fisheries minister and indeed to the Australian community as to the consequence of supertrawlers and—what they might mean for our fishery and what they might mean in terms of bycatch—seals, dolphins, penguins or the like.


It is true that Australia has a world-class reputation for fisheries management. I think it is true to say that we have some of the best-managed fisheries on this planet. If we look at examples overseas, whether in Europe, North America, South America or Africa, we can find many examples where fisheries have not been appropriately managed, which has led to very substantial localised depletion. Because we wish to exploit our fisheries in Australia—as we should—but also have proper oversight and proper management plans, based on science, we will be able to continue to manage our fisheries in a way that can provide a commercial return, that can feed our society and that can provide an export market for us in a way that is sustainable. The Margiris—or the Abel Tasman, or any other name the vessel may go by—very much calls into question the potential viability of this fishery. We do not know the consequences. Until the science is undertaken, as a precautionary measure we should not allow this particular vessel, or vessels of this size and scope, to continue to fish.


It is quite extraordinary that the recreational fishermen and the environment groups are at one on this. They have not historically been close. Often, in fact, they have been at loggerheads. I think when you have such diverse groups with diverse views coming together and lobbying members of parliament across the parliamentary spectrum, it is clear that the government needs to act—and indeed we did act.


But it is also very disappointing that politics are being played by the Liberal Party on this, and by the National Party. It is very clear that they do support super-trawler fishing in Australian waters, without the science being undertaken. Indeed, if they were in government, it is true and fair to say that this particular vessel—and other vessels of this nature—would be able to fish in Australian waters without the science being undertaken. Not only would this do great harm and damage to the fishery and create concern amongst environmentalists and conservationists but also, importantly, it would harm recreational fishermen who enjoy getting out on the water and targeting species such as tuna and the like. We will deal with those in due course.


The steps undertaken by both the ministers with respect to vessels of this nature are the right approach. It is the approach that I support and that Labor backbenchers have been lobbying for. I look forward to seeing this legislation pass. I am sure the Liberal Party and the Nationals will vote this down. I am confident that will happen. We will get to see their true colours on this matter. I am sure—

Mr Martin Ferguson:
  I think he should have a cup of tea.




Mr CHEESEMAN:
  I think he should, too. He should have a Bex and a good lie down; absolutely. I thank the ministers. I thank my friend Garry Kerr from Anglesea for the representations he has made to me as a recreational fisherman and someone who is commercially involved in recreational fishing. I thank all of those who have emailed me and made representations to my office on this. I look forward to seeing this legislation passed and Australia's fishery being protected for the commercial interests of all Australians. I certainly commend the legislation to the House.

"Cobb, John, MP",Nats,2012-09-12,"



Mr JOHN COBB
 (Calare) (10:37):  I rise to speak about the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Declared Fishing Activities) Bill 2012 proposed by the government. I wish I did not have to. Even though Australia has come to expect no bounds to the incompetence and knee-jerk overreaction of this government I do find myself despairing at this latest effort by them to undermine business in this country and at the scale of the sovereign risk it is subjecting its hard-working people to.


This is not just about foreign investment, this is about domestic investment. Let us be clear. This government's decision to shut down the fishing trawler is not based on science but simply on a massive sell-out of industry as they trawl for green votes. This decision is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut—a peanut. Instead of providing conditions for the ship's operation so that it would have no more a footprint on the environment than one of the five smaller boats it could have replaced, the minister is moving to deliver himself sweeping new powers that will enable him to shut down the fishing industry and destroy statutory fishing rights simply on the back of any media campaign, no matter how misinformed.


This bill allows the government to shut down any commercial or recreational fishing activity for 24 months if there is any level of uncertainty about environmental, social or economic impact of the fishing industry. As the old saying goes, there is nothing certain in life except death and taxes—and under this government that is a heck of a lot of uncertainty and a heck of a lot of taxes. There is always uncertainty, so there will always be an excuse to shut down the fishing industry. This will make the statutory fishing rights of our hard-working fishermen worthless and let me tell you that they are hard working.


This bill gives the minister unlimited powers and threatens every Australian commercial fishing operation at a virtual whim. In an attempt to address community concerns about the Margiris, the minister has gone to the extreme, by giving himself unlimited powers, which will impact on every family fishing boat around the country. The new powers will allow the minister to shut down industry for two years whenever there is social—in other words, perceived—uncertainty over the science, no matter how uniformed. Instead of ensuring conditions that could have ensured that the larger boat had no greater footprint than five smaller boats, this minister has just decided to shut down the industry for two years and leave it to another minster with a backbone to solve the issue.


Minister Ludwig has again been used as a doormat by the rest of the Labor Party to pander to the Greens—and as one of the better ones, Minister Ferguson, you know I am telling the truth. Rollover Joe is still reeling from the last time the government rolled him and made him shut down live exports completely devastating the industry and telling our major trading partners around the world that there is too much sovereign risk to trade with Australia and that they should take their business elsewhere. However, this time it is not just foreigners; it is Australian investors who are being told, 'Bad luck.'


Minister Burke was the Minister for Agriculture, when the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, in his portfolio—and, I understand, Minister Burke himself—approved the Small Pelagic Fisher Harvest Strategy. He did that as the Minister for Agriculture and now, as the Minister for the Environment, he is acting as someone who is totally unconcerned and uncaring about his previous strategies—basically inviting a ship of this type to come to Australia and provide efficiencies and now has changed his mind. What can you say? As the member for Flinders has already pointed out, this strategy—approved by Minister Burke in his previous portfolio as the Minister for Agriculture—clearly states on page two: 'There are considerable economies of scale in the fishery and the most efficient way to fish may include large-scale factory vessels.' I wonder what those opposite think of that when it comes to the legislation we are currently debating. That is a straight-out invitation to bring exactly that sort of ship here to Australia. What another Labor stuff-up! Minister Burke, as minister for agriculture, in fact appointed all the current board of AFMA—the authority he says he now cannot trust.


Minister Burke clearly invited this boat to Australia and has now changed his mind. Australian investors, with clear signals from Minister Burke on this, invested time and effort and significant resources to bring this boat to Australia. Over years, they complied with every requirement. This Australian company employed 50 Australian staff to drive the business. Seafish Australia has now been put in the terrible position of having to tell these staff they are no longer needed. Like the live exports debacle, this government has again sent a signal to all the countries of the world—and, in this case, the domestic investors in Australia, all our major trading partners and businesses large and small—that it is way too risky to do business in this country and that this government cannot be trusted. If Minister Burke had an ounce of gumption, an ounce of honesty, he would resign if he does not trust the authority he was responsible for—that he appointed, that he approved and that he agreed with. This is the authority he appointed, he approved and he agreed with. 


Australia's fisheries are independently benchmarked and recognised as one of the most sustainable in the world. The management strategies are developed from sound science and extensive consultation with a broad range of stakeholders. The coalition has every reason to have confidence in the quota and management conditions applied to the small pelagic fishery.


This decision will open a Pandora's box. This is a major precedent that opens the door to other natural resources. Will the minister seek the same sweeping new powers to be applied across other natural resource sectors? Mining could be stopped for two years because of a public campaign suggesting that a new mining method which may actually reduce the impact on the environment creates too much public uncertainty as to its actual impact. The irrigation sector could be shut down for two years while they finalise the Murray-Darling Basin Plan because there is community concern about the impact on the basin. Even worse, Minister Burke may shut down the farming sector for two years because of perceived social uncertainty about the impact of new farming methods aimed at improving soil management because of perceived uncertainty. This will not only shut down resource sectors but also stagnate research and development that would lessen the environmental impact and increase public uncertainty.


To use an analogy, with recreational fishing, this government is saying that not only do you have a bag limit but you are also not allowed to go fishing with your mates and the industry cannot conduct fishing competitions, as the collective impact could be too great. The recreational fishermen are also on this minister's hit list already with the world's largest national marine park network not based on science, and now the minister is saying he can shut down any fishing activity if there is uncertainty, regardless of the science. This has really undermined the good work of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority and their dedicated staff, who are committed to sustainable management of the fisheries within government policy. The key here is that they implement government policy, policy which was overseen for three years by Minister Burke—this very same minister—when he was minister of the agricultural portfolio. And he now says that AFMA cannot be trusted.


This is so like the live exports issue. This is groundhog day for this government. The ineptitude of this government never ceases to amaze me and never ceases to amaze the Australian people. But, when it comes to the agricultural, fisheries and forestry portfolio, you can add to that a distinct element of, 'I couldn't care less', and you begin to understand why the live export issue escalated to such an incredible crisis. I never thought I would say this, but I am not sure that this decision by Labor, this legislation that they are putting forward now, is not worse than their actions in relation to the live cattle trade.


That was one of the worst decisions ever made—and certainly the worst business decision made by a government up to this time. It set back international efforts for animal welfare, and the sovereign risk has alarmed our trading partners. Indonesia wanted to work with Australia, and publicly said so, to solve that issue and they picked up the paper and read that they had been told that they were no longer needed at that time and that they would have to wait for cattle because they were not getting them.


While this government—and every government—have struggled to deal with Aboriginal welfare issues, particularly in Northern Australia, they also crushed the livelihoods of tens of thousands of people both directly and indirectly affected by that government decision. The effect of that decision on the North—which at the time I thought could never be worsened, but I am not sure that it has not been now—on 82 Indigenous stations and a community of some 17,000 depending on this trade, was enormous. These people do not want welfare; they just want to get on with their lives. And I can assure you that the fishing industry does not want welfare; they want to get on with their lives.


This government are far more worried about the lefties within their party room than they are about our relationships with our neighbours and with business and whether or not Australia is able to proceed domestically, let alone whether in a foreign sense we can get investment in our country and investment in our businesses and be able to create jobs.


The government is seeking a new arbitrary power unfettered and with no chance of review for the decisions. The government invited the ship into Australia and has now backflipped on its own decision. Minister Burke should resign—in any moral situation you care to name. He oversaw the department that invited the boat to this country and is now saying that the decision was wrong. It was a decision that only last week, in fact I would say as recently as Monday, he agreed with.


The implications of this bill for our international reputation are catastrophic. The implications in terms of sovereign risk are catastrophic and enormous. I support the amendment by the member for Flinders and I implore the parliament to get behind it and bring common sense back into this debate. This is without doubt just about the worst decision I have ever seen been put to be ratified by the Australian parliament. The issues of principle here are just gigantic. You tell people what the rules are and invite them to participate and then, at a whim, you say, 'I have changed my mind.' Forget about the investment, the years for compliance, the fact that we set our own quotas and forget about the fact that we agreed with the authority we appointed, because we now suddenly do not think they are good enough. Why? There must be a social issue somewhere. I think it is a disgrace and a shame that we are debating this here today.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Declared Fishing Activities) Bill 2012</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2012-09-12,"



Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh) (10:51):  I think it is a disgrace and a shame that the opposition is not supporting this bill, that they are not supporting what is so clearly in line with community expectations and clearly in sync with community concerns—that is, to get answers to some questions on the impact of the second-largest and biggest fishing vessel on the planet to see what impact it would have on our environment, our fisheries and our industry. The public wants answers to questions concerning the operation of this supertrawler in Australian waters. How much will it deplete our waters of commercial fishing? How much will it deplete our waters of protected fish, mammals and even birds? How much would it deprive our long-term fishery operations and our recreational fishermen and women of their livelihoods and pursuits?


The people of my electorate want to know whether this or any other supertrawler can really operate within fishery and environmental rules, as they currently exist, and not wreak environmental destruction on our marine environment. That is all they want to know. I think it is a very legitimate question and the public have every right to an answer to that question. It is also clear that many members of the public, unlike the Abbott coalition, simply do not believe it is possible. Concerns have been raised on a continual basis for over a month. They have been expressed through multiple telephone calls to my office, many emails, letters in the media, communications with my electorate office and those of many other MPs. The minister also has received many communications on the matter. A substantial proportion of the public are clearly saying that they do not believe that a vessel with such a large processing and freezer capacity and that has the potential to pull out and process so much of the ocean's harvest on a continual basis—that is, within one geographic area in one fishing expedition without returning to port—can operate without a negative impact on the area in which they fish.


The minister has made it clear that this proposed event—the expedition of a supertrawler with such capacity—is unprecedented in Australian waters. It is clear that the proposal to have such as vessel operating in Australian waters, processing and freezing on board substantially larger volumes of catch in any one fishing expedition, is unprecedented. Fishing in this manner produces what people refer to as bycatch, the unintended catching of non-target fish. Some of the things caught by trawlers are protected mammals. The seals, dolphins and a whole range of other things—and of course the food on which they rely—are protected by Australian law. A sustained and concentrated fishing exercise would surely increase the incidence of bycatch—or do those opposite suggest the contrary, as we are hearing?


What devastation would be caused by substantially increased and geographically concentrated trawling on these protected species? That is one of the questions that cannot be answered. The question is new, as is the capacity of any super-trawler to fish in such a sustained and geographically concentrated way. How can the government be content with a guess or a hope, as those opposite are saying, that environmental law will continue to be observed and that the unintended consequences of said activity on such a large, continual and potentially concentrated basis will not damage those species we are required by law to protect?


We cannot give the assurances asked of us by the public and demanded by the law. The numbers and the impact of such an event are, as I have said, absolutely unprecedented. Uncertainty remains, despite the best efforts of those experts to whom these questions have been put. I believe the public have a right to have their questions answered. It is the public's fishery; it does not belong to any one person or any one trawler or any one industry. The public's environmental assets and their sustainability are key here.


I support the minister's decision to amend the legislative framework that will enable all these questions to be put and to seriously be investigated and enable answers to be given to all those who seek them. This government has only recently announced the creation of the world's largest system of marine reserves. The sustainability of our fisheries and the protection of our wonderful and unique environmental assets is clearly a very substantial priority of this government. We are delivering improved systems of protected areas, delivering sustainable and therefore better fisheries going forward, which is good for the fishing industry and good for the protection of our threatened world.


So it is totally logical that we here on this side of the House—the Labor Party, the one party in this place with a logical approach to sustainability of environmental, social and economic needs—would exercise care and due diligence when it comes to assessing the potential of a vessel that is the second-biggest fishing vessel on the planet and which has sailed over the horizon and looked to fish in our waters.


Fundamentally, this is a new situation being faced by our fisheries, our fishing industry and a marine environment created potentially by a very new fishing tool. We have not seen this tool being used before in our waters—Australian waters, not waters overseas or somewhere else. It is unprecedented. Naturally there is insufficient data as to the impacts. The hypotheses are untested, so suggestions as to what may be done—or what outcomes are most likely—simply cannot be relied on by those with a legal responsibility to ensure, as best they can, that the consequences most of us fear are never realised.


Since the minister announced his decision to seek changes to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, which will give him time to seek the conclusive answers to these questions, we have heard others in this and the other place make a number of points in the media. One party launched into an electronic media campaign announcing that they have delivered a great outcome in stopping the super-trawler from ever operating in Australian waters—and I have to tell you, nothing could be further from the truth. The super-trawler has not yet been stopped from going to sea and potentially wreaking havoc on protected mammals and their environments in our waters. That party should focus on results for a change and leave the multimedia mania for another time. I suggest that they focus on delivering their votes to successfully amend this law before they divert their attentions to prematurely announcing any achievement or bathing in greatness.


The Liberals, from what we have heard today, will be opposing the bill. There is a very real possibility that this amendment will not get the approval of the parliament and that the supertrawler will set sail in the months to come. From what we have heard today from the Liberal and National parties I suspect that they will say no—as they do to everything we bring before the House. We have heard a continuous echo—no, no, no, no, no—from the opposition. And we are hearing it again here today—to a bill to give the Australian public the answers they are seeking. What do we hear from the opposition once again? 'No.'


The shadow Treasurer was in the chamber last night speaking in favour of government legislation. He was devastated. I almost felt sorry for him because he was doing something his leadership team appears to have vowed never to do. He could hardly talk—which, for Joe, has to be evidence of acute psychological trauma. He was beside himself, unable to believe that the Liberal and National parties were actually going to vote with the government. They never intended to, irrespective of the merits of the cause. And so too here we can only expect the negativity already coming from the opposition.


I do not recall the last time the opposition voted in favour of enhancing environmental protections on land or at sea. They are against marine reserves. They are against the security of national parks. They are against doing a proper job of restoring the health of the Murray-Darling Basin and the River Murray's Lower Lakes and Coorong. They just hate the idea. They are against investment in school infrastructure. They are against investment in educational outcomes. Their party is against the NDIS. They are against the scientific process itself, and its conclusions—the well established and widely acknowledged consensus in the areas of climate and ecology. So we can only expect the opposition to vote against the amendment in this place and, quite possibly, do whatever it can to see that supertrawler set out to trawl our seas. We can only expect the opposition to unnecessarily and clumsily box itself in again to a position of ignoring the scientific questions, depriving itself of the means to improve its decision making, operating on the basis of spite and wilful opposition and, as a consequence, putting itself at odds with the will of the Australian public.


As I said earlier, I have not seen another bill in this place that is so clearly in line with community expectations and so clearly in sync with community concerns. The public wants answers to these questions. We need this amendment to seek those answers. We are all obliged to support the amendment because it is very important. All of us have heard from constituents in our electorates who are in support of ensuring that we get those answers. The Abel Tasman is the second biggest fishing vessel on the planet. I am pleased that people will not be rushed into decisions about it operating in our waters. The science behind current quotas is sound. However, the science behind the long-term effects of a vessel of this nature, of this size, are not. We are taking a cautious approach to this, prohibiting an activity while giving our fisheries managers and our environmental assessors the opportunity to give it proper consideration and get those answers that the public has been asking for. As I said, the public deserve those answers. We are adding the means by which such vessels can be assessed before any operations take place. We need a proper assessment and, if it is found to be unacceptable and threatening to our precious marine resources or to protected species, then the appropriate management responses would be implemented.


The government has introduced this legislation because there are unanswered questions. It is our duty as members of this parliament to seek answers to those questions and ensure that the public are satisfied. After all, all of us have been put here by the public. I have never seen another issue that has created such a great amount of correspondence to my office—continuous emails and phone calls from people who are concerned about having the world's second largest fishing vessel fishing in our waters. This bill will allow the government to seek out those answers and ensure that all the environmental impacts are known and we have all the information at our fingertips before any vessel like this is allowed to go out fishing in our waters.


The community need to be assured that the environmental controls in place are reflective of the expectations of the community. The expert panel will be able to assess the science to answer those very, very important questions. I am very pleased about this. I congratulate Minister Burke for acting on this after concerns were raised with him. I wrote many emails and letters to him on behalf of many constituents in my electorate over the last month. I am very pleased that he has taken that into account and ensured that he gets those answers for the thousands and thousands of constituents all around Australia who have been contacting our offices—and not just on this side; I am sure they are contacting people on the other side as well.


I am very pleased that this amendment bill has come to this House today to allow the government to seek those very important answers that will tell us what impact the world's second largest fishing vessel will have on our environment. As I said, this is a very important bill and I am very disappointed that the opposition is not supporting it—something which is so clearly in line with public perceptions and public views. I would encourage them all to rethink their position on this, to rethink what the public wants, to rethink what their constituents have been telling them and to vote in line with the Australian public, who put us in this place. I commend the bill to the House.

"Entsch, Warren, MP",LP,2012-09-12,"



Mr ENTSCH
 (Leichhardt—Chief Opposition Whip) (11:06):  I am somewhat taken aback by the contribution of my good friend the member for Hindmarsh. He states that the size of the catch and other issues have been raised and that there needs to be further science on the decision in relation to this large vessel that is currently moored at a port in South Australia. I find that unbelievable. Obviously, his minister is not communicating to him in any shape or form.


It was in 2009 that the minister made the statement that formally invited these people to come to Australia. They accepted that invitation. In the years since then they have gone through, backwards and forwards, working out the science, arguing on the arrangements that needed to happen. The arrangements had been totally concluded; why else would they have left their home port and steamed all the way to Australia if they were not of the understanding that they had that support from the Australian government? They were down here to catch fish and had actually been allocated a quota of some 18,000 tonnes. So there was no clandestine arrangement. The science had been done. On websites even as late as yesterday the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, AFMA, was defending the science, arguing that it was totally appropriate for this to occur. I understand that the quota was approved by the government's own caucus only yesterday: 'No problems whatsoever; let's make it all happen!' The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has continually defended his decision as being based on science. The hypocrisy in this whole debate has been second to none.


I am one of those who have been defending the fishing industry—all aspects of the fishing industry—for many years. I have seen rights being stripped away. I have seen opportunities for commercial, sporting and recreational fishing being continually reduced. I have seen that reduction used as a basis to determine that fishing is not sustainable and for taking away those rights completely. All of this has not been based on science. There has been no scientific evidence to back robbing these small Australian family businesses of their opportunity to continue to make a living. Many of these businesses are intergenerational; they have been there for many years. AFMA, for example, has continually argued that because of its world-class management fishing was totally sustainable. But this minister and this government have continued to erode these rights. We have no better example of that than the current marine park initiative, through which we are seeing the closure of the Coral Sea because it is becoming a no-take zone for fishing. That initiative was not based on science. It was based on an e-mail campaign generated by an American organisation, which I refer to as a 'gan-green' organisation, called the Pew foundation. The Pew foundation is an oil and gas funded American conglomerate that decided to make itself a little bit respectable in the environment world, so it has gone about looking after the marine environment. It would not do it in its own unsustainable and totally depleted fisheries because it did not have the political courage to do it. Instead it travels around looking for the lowest hanging fruit and of course it found that here in Australia, where there is a government that is totally subservient to the Greens.


The Pew foundation has now come here with a campaign of some 400,000 computer generated spam emails, which frightened the living hell out of the government and pushed it into making a decision that has effectively destroyed even further the livelihoods of people who have been in the industry for a long time. An example of this is Bob Lamason, who owns Great Barrier Reef Tuna in Cairns. Bob used to pay $2,000 to $3,000 per vessel for licence fees in the 1990s for his six or seven boats—his maximum cost was about $20,000. For that he had a licence to catch a range of species, including 1,200 tonnes of tuna each year, which he sold into the prime Japanese market and got very good returns. Back then, there were no bycatch restrictions, no wire traces and no VMS, vessel monitoring systems, and he was allowed to cover a very wide area. Since then, through the pressure of green groups, he has been restricted to areas which in many cases are non-productive and in which he cannot catch target species. He is now paying an average of $40,000 per year for each of his four vessels, $160,000 a year, to fish and he is now permitted to catch only 600 tonnes of tuna a year. Unfortunately, because he is not allowed to fish in areas where the fish actually congregate, last year he managed to catch only 300 tonnes. So with his higher fuel costs, having to fish further out and being restricted to a five-hook limit it has been made almost impossible for him. He is one of those we are going to lose because of this minister's incompetent handling of this whole process.


As Bob has said, we are catching less than half of one per cent of the Western Pacific yellowfin and big eye tuna and fishers are paying $160,000 a year to do it. In the other two-thirds of the Western Pacific, which includes Papua New Guinea, New Caledonia and the Solomon Islands, they take 2.4 million tonnes. You can imagine how much difference to the environment will be made by the 300 tonnes we are stopping Bob from taking. But we are going to destroy the family business in the process.


When you look at this bill, you have to be very concerned. The amendments will create a new chapter 5B of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, which will enable the minister, with agreement from the minister for fisheries, to declare a fishing activity to be a 'declared fishing activity' on an interim basis if both ministers agree that 'there is uncertainty about the environmental, social or economic impacts of the fishing activity'. We are talking about the environment minister putting this bill up. But he is now dealing with social and economic activities as well, which means that he can shut down any activity in any Commonwealth controlled waters, if he has a desire to do so, for a maximum of two years in the first instance. That is absolutely outrageous. That is in spite of the fact that we have seen a huge amount of science go into this.


With regard to this vessel, I had objections. I have concerns about bringing a vessel of this size into our waters and allowing it to take 18,000 tonnes of quota in one area. I think that there should be move-on provisions. If they had put move-on provisions in this, which ensured that this vessel had to take certain amounts out of different areas so that it did not totally deplete the stocks, that would have made a sensible management decision.




Mr Baldwin:
  Good fisheries management.




Mr ENTSCH:
  Yes, good fisheries management, not policy on the run like we are seeing with this, in a government that, again, is being influenced by a an email campaign run by the Greens and GetUp!. That is what this is about. It is not about fishing management. It is about the Greens and GetUp! putting the pressure on. They got in a panic. Yesterday it was fine. Suddenly, today, we are going to stop it. They have even changed the name to the Abel Tasman. If there had been sensible amendments which said, 'We will restrict where we can fish with these vessels,' I would have been absolutely supportive. I hope that we can put something up of a similar nature so that we can actually get back to appropriate management of this vessel rather than this other nonsense.


The other reason I oppose this is that we were told that all the science was done on this—and everything I have seen suggests the science is there. There may be a few little tweaks that we can do in relation to move-on provisions, but the science is there to suggest that this is okay. I have been arguing now for many years about decisions that have been made in my area based on email campaigns and not on science. I have argued very strongly that we should be using science and sustainability as the only criteria in relation to management of fisheries. This emotional claptrap that is being directed here by organisations such as the Pew foundation should be totally disregarded for the spam that it is. But, unfortunately, this government are a captive of the Greens and these interest groups because they do not know how to make a decent decision.


We have already seen sovereign risk issues in relation to the mining resource tax. That had a huge negative impact on confident investment in this country. Have a look at the debacle that the minister for agriculture was involved in in relation to live cattle exports and the sovereign risk in that, a shocking decision that was again made by interest groups and an email and video campaign. We are seeing exactly the same thing now being applied to our fisheries. The minister should hang his head in shame.


I have another impact in my area which I would like to raise. In 1964, Vic Oke and his brother Gordon bought the Cairns saltwater baths and they converted it into an oceanarium. From that time, with their love of diving, they started up a business which was followed on by Vic's daughter Bev, who married Lyle Squire Sr, and then that business became the Cairns marine aquarium. It is now owned by a third generation—Lyle Jr and his brother Cadel. Between them they have six children, all with a strong interest. So there was a possibility that this business could go for four generations. They have been catching reef fish for aquariums and have been taking fish from the same reefs for three generations. It has been recognised as being absolutely world's best practice and totally sustainable. They have been taking the same species from the same area for three generations.


What has happened? First of all, they were shut down by green zones and moved from that area. They were paid $3.8 million in compensation to allow them to buy bigger vessels so that they could move out into the Coral Sea to operate and to set up infrastructure at a Cairns base. Now with the new Coral Sea marine reserve restrictions it is likely that out of the 16 operators that are currently working there only three will be able to continue. This is an organisation that is recognised as world's best practice. The casualties of these limits in the Coral Sea marine reserve will include line and trap fisherman, rock lobster and beche de mer fisheries, and one other aquarium operator. The main problem that these guys face now is that because there is 100 per cent cost recovery the total cost of managing this fishery, which is $300,000, will be spread over three people instead of 16, which means it will be totally unsustainable for them.


It is interesting because I was talking only a while ago to strategic projects manager Ryan Donnelly from the Cairns marine aquarium and he said to me, 'Warren, the funny thing about it is that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority still holds us up as the poster child for the fishing industry in the Great Barrier Reef. These are the people who you would think would want to stop us from fishing on the reef. If we are forced out of the Coral Sea, the infrastructure, the boats, the buildings, our Stratford site and all our staff will have to go.'


These are the sorts of impacts that we are seeing from decisions being made because of populist calls by interest groups like Pew, GetUp! and the Greens. On the one hand, the government makes these decisions on the run without any consideration whatsoever of science. And then, on the other hand, they suddenly get the science and the vessel's operators make an absolute commitment over two years. They steam halfway around the world to be here to start the operation. There are 50 new jobs created et cetera. It needs some tweaking done, but then of course there is another campaign by another lot of interest groups and suddenly the government reneges on the deal. How good does that make us look? It is an absolute disgrace. The minister should hang his head in shame and those on the other side should be condemned for supporting this ridiculous legislation.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2012-09-12,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (11:21):  I speak in support of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Declared Fishing Activities) Bill 2012. Unlike the previous speaker, I commend the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry not only for working together through this issue but for noting the very legitimate concerns of Australians around the country and responding with this legislation. I also commend the member for Fremantle for bringing this issue forward with her intent to bring in a private member's bill. Of course, that is no longer necessary.


I note that the opposition will not be supporting this bill, which I have to say not only disappoints me but surprises me, given that this is in fact good legislation, legislation that takes a cautious approach to fisheries management in this country and an approach that at this point in time is appropriate. I note that in opposing this legislation the opposition have moved an amendment. The amendment effectively calls for reasons as to why this legislation has been brought into the House. Can I say to members opposite: if you want to know the reasons why this legislation has been brought into the House, simply read the minister's second reading speech. It is all explained there if you care to read it. It is outlined in a very clear way why this legislation is necessary and why it is responsible legislation.


Australia does indeed have a very good fisheries management record and a very good regime in place and has had so for many years. The reality is that circumstances change, and when circumstances change governments have a responsibility to respond to those changes. It has become clear that under existing legislation there is insufficient scope to deal with current fishing practices that we are seeing, including but not restricted to the use of supertrawlers such as the Margiris, now badged as the Abel Tasman. We have also seen in recent years the action taken by state and federal governments around the country to designate specific areas as marine reserves. They have done that again in recognition that changes are taking place and that, if we want to manage our fisheries properly, we need to ensure that they remain sustainable. The only way to do that is by continuous intervention, having assessed the impacts to date of what is currently happening.


Whilst the legislation is not specific to the size of fishing vessels, it does empower the minister to declare a fishing activity, which triggers a 24-month prohibition of fishing whilst an expert panel carries out a scientific investigation of the impacts of the particular fishing activity. Whilst some have argued that section 91 of the Fisheries Management Act provides the minister with additional powers under exceptional circumstances, I accept the minister's advice that that section does not provide sufficient scope to deal with issues such as that of the Margiris.


There has also been considerable debate about the scientific evidence which underpins sustainable fishing policy, and I will make some comments in respect of all of that. Firstly, there is the question about quotas. The issue of quotas has been discussed at length by several of the speakers thus far. That is one of the issues and perhaps the issue that most people focus on. It is the issue that immediately comes to mind. It is, however, not the only issue under consideration with respect to this legislation, and I will talk a little bit more about that in a moment.


The second and equally important issue is how the fish are caught and what impact the activity itself has on the marine environment. The impact of the activity needs to be managed just as much as the quota needs to be managed. For example, the impact of a very large vessel which has the ability to remain in one location for extended periods of time would likely be very different to the impact of several smaller vessels fishing in the area for short periods. These are issues which the expert panel will be asked to report on.


I will turn for a moment to the question of the Margiris, because this legislation has indeed arisen because of the application by the Margiris to fish in Australian waters. The Margiris is a 142-metre vessel weighing 9,500 tonnes. It can process over 250 tonnes of fish each day and has a cargo capacity of 6,200 tonnes. I understand it was brought to Australia by Seafish Tasmania, which has secured an 18,000-tonne quota for jack mackerel and red bait. I also understand that the Margiris will tow a net some 300 metres in length. The 18,000-tonne quota is half of the entire allowable catch for the area of coastline which extends from south-western Western Australia to Queensland—roughly from Perth to Brisbane. 


The use of supertrawlers is not new to fishing. What is interesting is that today the experience has led to trawlers being banned in several other parts of the world. I understand that that has previously been the case also with the Abel Tasman. In 1999 the Abel Tasman, then named the Atlantic Star, lost its right to fish in US waters after trading its US flag for a Dutch flag. Indeed, the vessel has an interesting history. Let me just take you through that history. Between 1991 and 1995 I understand that the vessel was named the Apollo Two. Between 1998 and 2002 the vessel was named the Siberian Enterprise. Between 1999 and 2008 it was also named the Atlantic Star, and from 2006 onwards it was named the Annelies Ilena. It then comes to Australia as the Margiris and again changes its name to the Abel Tasman.


The interesting thing about all those name changes is: why would you need to continuously change the name of the vessel if it is not to perhaps run away from a reputation that you do not want attached to the vessel? I would have thought that if the vessel was proud of its history it would retain its original name and wherever it went it would use that name—but not so. The vessel seems to change its name whenever it moves from one location to another. I have to ask the question: why does it need to do that?


Can I return to the issue of quotas. I pointed out earlier on that the area that the vessel was seeking a licence for extends roughly from Perth to Brisbane.


If most of the catch—the 18,000-tonne limit that it is seeking a licence for—were to come from one specific location, that would have a significantly different impact on the fishing stocks than if the catch came from an area evenly spread right across from Brisbane to Perth. Those are the kinds of questions and issues that the scientific panel needs to respond to before a licence should be granted. Those are the kinds of concerns that I believe are properly being raised by people across the community and by this government.


Likewise, if the vessel were to remain in one location for extended periods of time, what would it do to fishing stocks in that particular location—including the bycatch, which others have talked about—not to mention the other environmental impacts of having a large vessel like that operating from one specific point? What environmental impacts would result from all that? Again, we do not have answers to those questions. We do not have answers to those questions because we have never had in Australia a vessel of this type. There is no history to go by. There is no precedent to use in order to try and find answers to these questions, so therefore we rely on speculative assessments as to what might or might not happen if we allowed the vessel to fish under the current licence. Frankly, estimates are not good enough. We need to have more reliable information.


Interestingly, on that very issue, I understand that not long ago in New Zealand a similar experience was had in respect of a Korean supertrawler that was allowed into New Zealand waters. It turned out that, even with the very strict conditions that New Zealand applied to their licence, those conditions proved ineffective and that trawler exceeded its quota. I am unable to say what other breaches occurred, but, if the quota itself could not be monitored, then I have to question how well you can monitor each of the other conditions that are attached when a licence is issued to such a vessel.


But it is not just about quotas. Regrettably, too many of the speakers opposite have just focused on the issue of quotas. On the issue of quotas, I accept the science that has been put together by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority. My concerns are not with respect to the quotas. I understand the 18,000-tonne quota that has been sought by this vessel in Australia represents half of the total catch of that particular type of fish, and that that in turn only represents about 7½ per cent of the total fish stocks in our waters. So that is not my concern. My concern is about the impact that a single vessel of this type will have on the environment.


Speakers opposite have also talked about the 50 or so jobs that might be lost if this licence is not approved. If this ship does not catch the fish that are in the waters, other ships will. If that means that we have to license several smaller vessels, I suspect the total number of jobs created by doing that will far exceed the 50 it is suggested will be lost if we refuse the licence to this operator. In fact, it is because of its efficiencies that this large trawler is being brought in. It is in effect to save costs, and in my view that means it will reduce the number of jobs that will be created.


Recreational fishers have also raised their concerns, certainly in my state of South Australia, with respect to the intrusion of a large vessel of this type into our waters. The South Australian government and the Tasmanian government have both expressed their opposition to this vessel fishing in waters within their jurisdictions. Certainly Minister Paul Caica from South Australia has made it absolutely clear that he does not want this vessel in South Australian waters.


There are a number of other matters that are of concern with respect to this issue. The experience of large trawlers around the world leads me to be very concerned about the impact that such trawlers have. I understand that several countries have already, after having large trawlers in their waters, banned those trawlers from re-entering their waters. It is true they may not have the same fishing management guidelines and regulations in place as Australia does, but nevertheless the fact that these types of vessels are being banned in several parts of the world raises the question as to why. It is clear that we have not had a vessel like this in our waters and therefore the impacts of such a vessel are indeterminable. The scientific panel that will be put together hopefully will be able to address many of the questions that have arisen in the course of the discussion on this issue over the last few weeks and enable the government, if it decides that a licence will be issued, to at least issue the licence with appropriate conditions, which may be stricter and more enforceable than those that are being sought right now.


It is also the case, as we have seen on many other occasions, that it does not matter how good and how tight you think your regulations are; breaches of the regulations are always a possibility. It is always a possibility, even with the best of intentions, that issues such as the bycatch will also prove to be much more serious than the operators of this vessel claim they will be. This legislation simply puts into place a precautionary approach to managing an event that we have never had to manage in the past. It makes more sense to be cautious than to regret the decision after the event, when perhaps the damage has been done and cannot be undone. I commend the legislation to the House.

"Neville, Paul, MP",Nats,2012-09-12,"



Mr NEVILLE
 (Hinkler—The Nationals Deputy Whip) (11:37):  I too would like to talk on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Declared Fishing Activities) Bill 2012. I support the amendment moved by shadow minister Hunt. But let me first say that I am totally and utterly bewildered at the rank hypocrisy of the government on this issue. I have never seen the like. I really thought the live cattle export thing was one of the greatest disasters we had encountered, and in economic terms it probably is, but, on a scale of integrity, this must be close to rock bottom.


Since 2009, the government has been aware of this company. In fact, it has almost encouraged it to come to this country, to bring the Margiris here. You have statements by Mr Burke. You have statements by Minister Ludwig. You have statements by AFMA, our peak fishing authority. Not only that, but the personnel of AFMA would have been appointed by those two ministers. For heaven's sake, it has your fingerprints all over it. So the Margiris comes to Australia. It complies with all our rules and regulations. Fifty employees are nominally employed. And then we drop the axe on it. And now we have spent the debate today, starting with the member for Corangamite and going down to the last speaker, talking about and demonising the Margiris.


If you want to know where I stand, I am not a great fan of large factory vessels. I make no apology for that. But that is not the debate we are having today. The debate we are having today is about whether this company came to Australia appropriately, almost at the invitation of the government, complied with its requirements, was given a quota of 18,000 tonnes—which, by the way, I think is excessively high—and then was told to stop. And how was it told to stop?


This legislation that the government is proposing and that we intend to amend gives the minister almost unfettered powers, powers that can be used in a draconian way or in a capricious way. The definitional powers in it are just so wide that you could drive a bus through them. First, the minister has the authority to declare a fishing activity a 'declared fishing activity', so he can pick anything out, anywhere in Australia. It is not just the Margiris; this is just the start of a new regime in fish management. And then, on the very flimsiest of grounds, he can bring his powers into play on environmental, social or economic impacts. The effect of that could be devastating. Contrary to what members of the government have been saying today, we are opposing this bill not so much because of the Margiris situation, bad as that is, but because this introduces a new level into fish management—and into primary industry management, for that matter—the like of which we have never seen.


I want people to get a bit of an understanding of what a vessel like the Margiris is capable of. In Queensland we have, through a whole series of state, state-federal, federal and now federal offshore activities, a whole regime of control of the fishing industry which is, quite frankly, draconian and which has drummed countless good people out of the industry. On top of that, we have people who the member for Leichhardt spoke about this morning who are hanging on by the skin of their teeth because of what this government has done already. The longline tuna fisherman that the member for Leichhardt referred to has seen his quota go from 1,200 to 600 tonnes and, because of where he has been allowed to fish, effectively down to 300 tonnes. Let us just note that: 300 tonnes. One hourly sweep by the Margiris could catch that man's entire yearly output—one hourly sweep of the Margiris. Frightening stuff, isn't it?


I am not here to demonise the Margiris but to show you the strict nature of what fishermen have been placed under in this country without any concern for them. Some of these families of Australian fishermen, as has been pointed out today, have been there for three or four generations serving this country with quality product and being subjected to the most extraordinary rules and regulations. We had a thing called the east coast trawl plan, which reduced the number of trawlers on the Queensland coast from 750 to 500—in fact, it reduced it even more, to 460. We were told that the reef was now sustainable, 'But we need a little bit more of the area of the marine park for scientific and other purposes,' and that was to be an absolute maximum of 20 per cent. When the maps came out, was it 20 per cent? No, it was 34 per cent.


Where I live—where the Gladstone, Bundaberg, Hervey Bay and Tin Can Bay fishermen live, who use the southern part of the Barrier Reef—effectively fishermen were losing 70 per cent of their fishing area. These guys have been through hell. Some of them went and bought new trawlers, so that they could go where? To the largely unregulated Coral Sea. But, once again, Labor was ready for them. We have heard from the member for Leichhardt today how the longline tuna fishermen have been slowly squeezed out of the business. Various green groups come to me and say that the longliners really wanted to get out of the business. In the end they did want to. Why? Because the number of hooks they could use was restricted, where they could fish was restricted and how many tonnes they could catch was restricted, to the point where it was not an industry anymore. Of course they would take compensation—the poor devils had nothing left.


Then we had the effects of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park annual research plans program, which hopefully sometime in the future will be reviewed. Some people took compensation from the program, or sold their smaller vessels and got into larger vessels to go into the Coral Sea. But what did we find there? We then had about 30 trawlers owned by about 20 entities—not a lot of people at all. I know one fisherman who has a capacity of 30,000 to 50,000 tonnes in a year; I suppose there might be the capacity, with all those vessels, to take about 300,000 tonnes. But the member for Leichhardt told us today that in Papua New Guinea waters alone one million tonnes is taken; in New Caledonia waters the figure is 1.4 million tonnes. What sort of idiots are we? We are not saving the planet. We are fattening up the fish in our part of the Coral Sea for the people who can come into the international waters on the northern side and fish it out.


If any honourable members really want to see what goes on in the world, go and have a look at the Tokyo fish market. Go and see those huge igloos—like Second World War air force igloos—with the rows and rows of tuna and the auctioneer going along on a little stool and knocking down every single fish. There are rows of them, every day—tens of thousands of tonnes. Then look at what we do. Down the whole east coast of Queensland, not just in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, we have various types of prawns, including eastern king prawns, tiger prawns and endeavour prawns. The total output of that whole strip of coastline is about 4,400 tonnes. If you add 600 tonnes of scallop meat, it is about 5,000 tonnes. The Margiris can hold in its coldroom 6,200 tonnes. The Margiris can hold in its coldroom more than the entire prawn and scallop production of Queensland in a year. I am saying that not to demonise the Margiris but to demonstrate the extent of the controls we have imposed unfairly and unnecessarily on Australian fishermen. They are ridiculously draconian, ridiculously constrictive, to the point where in our own supermarkets we are buying 72 per cent foreign fish. Here we are, the great clean, green marine environment in the South Pacific, and we cannot catch enough fresh fish for ourselves. What a ludicrous situation.


I come back to my original theme. This is draconian, capricious legislation that will not just stop with the Margiris; it will be a double-edged sword that will cut a swathe into many other areas where this government want to pander to the Pew foundation or some element of the green industry or the Greens party. It will put our fishermen in situations that might be embarrassing for the government. We have seen their grand gestures like closing down live cattle exports, like putting pink batts in roofs, and now they are closing down the Margiris for two years—but not on any grounds of science. For God's sake, they had three years to examine the science, yet now we have in the House today this rushed piece of legislation. This legislation should be tossed out but, in the event that we cannot toss it out, we will at least do our very best to amend it.

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2012-09-12,"



Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Government Whip) (11:51):  The member for Hinkler's contribution to this debate on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Declared Fishing Activities) Bill 2012 was one of the most interesting I have ever heard. He put a very strong argument for endorsing the government's legislation, yet he then turned around and said he opposes it. He argued that bad fishing practices in other parts of the world—practices which have led to the depletion of fishing stocks—are a reason for Australia to have bad fishing practices as well. It was a very confused contribution. He argued against sustainable fishing whilst, on the other hand, pointing out the problems that exist. He pointed out the Margiris's enormous capacity—6,200 tonnes—and talked about the problems faced by the fishing industry in Australia. But he then said that he does not support this legislation to prevent the Margiris from fishing in Australian waters.


I come from a coastal electorate. We have had issues with fishing within the Shortland electorate. Lake Macquarie is at the heart of the Shortland electorate. Over the years, issues surrounding fishing have been very much on the table. In my electorate I have been approached by many fishers, both professional and recreational, and they have all put compelling arguments to me that we cannot allow this ship to fish in Australian waters. 




Mr Baldwin:
  So why, yesterday, did you vote in the Senate to approve it?




Ms HALL:
  I hear the member for Paterson. Hopefully he is offering his support for the recreational and professional fishers in his electorate. The father of a fisher from his electorate was the first person to hit my office complaining about this ship fishing in Australian waters. If the member for Paterson were in tune with his electorate, he would know the depth of feeling fishers have towards this ship fishing in Australian waters.


Australia has a long and proud record as a leader in sustainable fishing. The legislation before us today recognises that decisions on fisheries need to be based on scientific fact, not on emotion. This legislation is about ensuring that scientific facts are collected before any decision is made. If we were not interested in the science, we would either allow fishing to continue—without having any true knowledge base—or, alternatively, we would ban it up-front. In two years, we will have that information. I am quite sure that, when that information is collected, it will lead to a ban on ships like the Margiris fishing in Australian waters.


This ship has been forced to change its name on numerous occasions in various parts of the world. It has a storage capacity of 6,200 tonnes. That means it is capable of catching 20 bus loads of fish each day. It is twice the size of any boat currently fishing in Australia, and this boat would be fishing in direct competition with Australian fishers—fishers such as those in the member for Paterson's electorate. The potential for bycatch is enormous—turtles, dolphins, seals and undersized fish. One of the key factors in fishery management is making sure that the fish caught are the correct size so as to ensure that breeding can continue. 


I think the sustainability of our fishing industry is extremely important and something all members of this parliament would like to ensure. Having a sustainable fishing industry means that those of us who do not fish can continue to enjoy the fish which come from our ocean and that those who work in the industry can maintain their jobs. I want to see the professional fishers in my electorate able to continue fishing. 


I mentioned Lake Macquarie earlier. Some 15 years ago, professional fishing in the lake was causing a depletion of fishing stocks and there were issues relating to bycatch. There was enormous division within the community between professional fishers and recreational fishers. The outcome was that professional fishing was banned in Lake Macquarie. We still have a strong professional fishing presence in the area—the professional fishers have moved to ocean fishing. The difference the ban has made to fishing stocks in Lake Macquarie has been enormous. Fish stocks in the lake have increased. That has helped maintain the lake as an enjoyable spot for recreational fishing. As a result, tourism to the area has increased. So there are enormous benefits from ensuring sustainable fishing. 


So sustainable fishing in Lake Macquarie has gone from being on the edge of falling over, when we had professional fishers fishing in the lake, to the point now where we have a very healthy lake, with the fish stocks increasing on a daily basis. If you extend that to the fishing trawler dealt with in this legislation—which has the ability to take large stocks of fish—you can see that the impact on the sustainability of our fisheries would be enormous. What happened on that small level in Lake Macquarie will happen on a much bigger level on the Australian coastline as a whole.


So the legislation we have before us today is very important, and I am disappointed—very disappointed, actually—that the opposition are not supporting it. We on this side of the House know that the strategy of the opposition is to oppose for opposition's sake, so every time we put up a piece of legislation we are ready for them: we have the expectation, shall I say, that the opposition will oppose it. I spoke last night on the charities and not-for-profits bills, which I thought the opposition would support. But, no, it opposed them. Today I am talking about sustainable fishing, about ensuring that our fish stocks are not depleted by the Margiris coming into Australian waters. However, rather than having any vision and looking to the future, I would argue strongly that the opposition are opposing this bill for opposition's sake, and without having spoken to their communities. This bill is about assuring the community that environmental controls are in place, which reflects the community's expectations.


The bill will set up an expert panel that will assess the science to answer the very important questions being asked about this supertrawler. As legislators—I repeat, as legislators—we have the obligation to assure the communities that we represent that adequate controls are in place and that we will have sustainable fisheries into the future. I believe the legislation we have before us today will do just that.


The Margiris—or, should I say, the Abel Tasman, because it is has changed its name again—was being assessed under a 20-year-old act. Since then, of course, many changes have taken place, and so the minister needs to take into account new or different types of considerations. It is very important that we are able to look at this from a different perspective. The legislation does not say 'new fishing activities'; it says 'specified fishing activities'. That is because there may be a change in the way that a past activity is playing out.


It is really important that this legislation gets through this parliament, and quickly, because it is vital for the future. We cannot allow uncertainty about fisheries to continue, and this bill is about making certain that we will have a sustainable fishing industry into the future. We need to look at all the implications—social, environmental and economic—associated with this supertrawler operating in our waters. One of the strong points of this legislation, I think, is that both the minister for the environment and the minister for fisheries must look at imposing these conditions and there has to be agreement before we can go down this track, as there is in this case. We cannot allow uncertainty—not on issues like this.


I do not think any issue has engendered such wide-ranging debate in my electorate as this one has, given that, as I said at the beginning, it is a coastal electorate and we have had issues around fishing in the past. I can share with this House that not one person has contacted my office to say that the Abel Tasman, as it is now called, should be allowed to operate freely in Australian waters. I agree with my constituents. I think that a very, very strong case against that has been put forward, but to make sure that that case is based on scientific fact we need to go down this path.


I commend the minister for bringing this bill before the parliament to deal with an issue that is so important to the community that I represent and to the Australian community as a whole.

Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson) (12:06):  I rise to speak on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Declared Fishing Activities) Bill 2012. Hypocrisy reigns supreme in this parliament, because Minister Burke, as the minister for fisheries, in 2008 released the Australian Fisheries Management Authority discussion paper Small pelagic fishery harvest strategy. That report was revised in October 2009. The report says, on large factory freezer vessels such as the Margiris, now the Abel Tasman:


… there are considerable economies of scale in the fishery and the most efficient way to fish may include large scale factory freezer vessels. 


Hypocrisy reigns supreme not just because the minister who is now moving this bill was the fisheries minister who appointed the AFMA commissioners in whom he now says he has no faith; hypocrisy reigns supreme within the Labor Party because Senator Ludwig, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, reaffirmed the 18,000-tonne quota on 23 August, and on 10 September the Labor government voted to support the quota. Why the shift, in two days?


This bill is not based on science. It is based not on sound management nor on good governance. This bill is based on hypocrisy, because the government do not believe what they are saying; nor do they believe in what they are doing. I have concerns about this bill because it is bad policy being brought upon us by a bad government, driven by the wrong reasons. The measures in this bill, in effect, were debated in the Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012. I spoke to that bill on 16 August:


The amendments to the bill will allow for emergency power to be introduced to partly close or close a fishery without stakeholder consultation in case of emergency. 


The minister for fisheries already has these powers—voted on, supported. Now this government wants to override the minister for fisheries, to override AFMA and to introduce new powers for the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities. I would have thought that the left hand might have spoken to the right hand, that there might have been a whole-of-government approach.


The member for Shortland raised the recreational fishing industry. I do a lot of work with the recreational fishing industry. I am part of their group. What concerns them is the ad hoc way in which this has been put together. In division 2, subdivision A, at 390SC, the bill says:




What is a


declared fishing activity
?





(1) A 
declared fishing activity
 is a fishing activity that is specified in:





It goes through a range of measures and then says:





(2) A 
fishing activity


means an activity that constitutes fishing.



Then, in subdivision B:




390SD Interim declaration





Making an interim declaration





This is the part that concerns me:





(1) The Minister may, by legislative instrument, make a declaration 
… 
that a specified fishing activity is a declared fishing activity.





(2) When making an interim declaration, the Minister may identify a fishing activity by reference to all or any of the following:





(a) a method of fishing;





(b) a type of vessel used for fishing;





(c) a method of processing, carrying or transhipping of fish that have been taken;





(d) an area of waters or of seabed.



From my reading and understanding of this legislation, these measures can apply to recreational fishermen. This minister, at a whim, without any science and without any consultation can shut down entire areas, not just for commercial fishing but for recreational fishing as well. The minister will no longer be required to go through the management processes for marine parks. He can just shut down at a whim the entire Coral Sea, the entire Great Barrier Reef, all of the Commonwealth waters off New South Wales and all of the Commonwealth waters off Victoria and Tasmania. He can shut down all the waters off South Australia, off Western Australia, off the Northern Territory and off Lord Howe Island. This minister will have unfettered powers which are not restricted to commercial fishing; they can apply equally to recreational fishing.


If you want to understand how concerning this is, look at the first part of this bill, which talks about the penalties. If this minister decides that an area is to be shut down for, let us say, recreational fishing, the civil penalty is:




390SA Civil penalty—declared fishing activities





…
   …
   …





(a) for an individual—5,000 penalty units;





and then:





390SB Offence—declared fishing activities




(1) A person commits an offence if:




(a) the person takes an action; and





(b) the action is taken in a Commonwealth marine area; and





(c) the action is a declared fishing activity.





Penalty: Imprisonment for 7 years or 420 penalty units, or both.




So now,

because of the mismanagement of this government—the lack of understanding in what they have done, the failure to consult—we see a situation where recreational fishing can be captured by this bill. The members of the Labor Party talk about good fisheries management and say that they have done the science. I have concerns about the science by the independent commissioners appointed by Minister Burke and the scientists who have said that the science is correct. It has been reaffirmed this week. In fact, Minister Ludwig said in the Senate this week that the science is correct. If the science is correct and they have concerns, who will drive this legislation—which can shut down a fishery based on social concerns? It could be people such as GetUp!; it could be people such as the Pew foundation. It could be anyone who creates a social concern, which then gives the minister the leeway to shut down or declare invalid a whole fishery—not just for commercial fishing but also for recreational fishing.


People target the Margiris; I too have concerns about the size of the vessel. I would much rather that 10 smaller vessels employing 10 times the number of people worked an area. But this government and, in particular, this minister for the environment when he was minister for fisheries, sought vessels of the size of the Margiris to undertake the fishing of 18,000 tonnes of mackerel and redbait. The difference is that this capture will be used and frozen for human consumption rather than just for baitfish. If indeed they wanted to apply better fisheries management, they would have a move-on provision—in other words, they would specify that only a certain amount of the 18,000-tonne catch could come from certain areas, which would be broken up by the size of the catch. That would spread the risk of overfishing in one area across the whole of the nation.


There is no argument that the 18,000-tonne haul is a concern. People have concerns over the size of the vessel and the size of its haul, and I can understand that. The recreational fishing people have expressed that concern to me. But, in my discussions with them, people from the recreational fishing industry and the main peak bodies said to me, 'If there were move-on provisions, it would lessen the heat and the argument.' This government has not listened to the people who are affected; it has listened to the green groups, such as GetUp! and Pew. This bill gives so much potential to cause damage to an individual minister, who is irresponsible and hypocritical. As I said, this is the minister who appointed the ACMA commissioners and this is the minister who in the Small Pelagic Fishery Harvest Strategy went out and sought vessels of the size of the Margiris. He now wants to stop fishing by such vessels on the basis of social concerns. Either you base things on science and then manage the science and the expectations or you play to populist politics.


Why did none of the members here stand up before Minister Ludwig spoke in the Senate and approved this legislation on the 10th? Why did they show no concern? In fact, one of their own members, the member for Braddon, an area that is affected, said in the Advocate on 4 August:


Sometimes you've got to stick with what you believe is right when popular opinion might not agree. You have faith in your institutions and you demand they be accountable, but if through sheer populist sentiment you push your institutions aside, what hope have you got?


That statement was made by one of the parliamentary secretaries—a man who has the port of Devonport in his electorate. But hypocrisy knows no bounds, because on 11 September he put out a press release which said:


Sid Sidebottom … today welcomed the news today that the Federal Government will introduce legislation to toughen up environmental controls on vessels like the super trawler.




Mr Hartsuyker:
  You can count on Sid!




Mr BALDWIN:
  You can count on Sid! He's always there to be depended upon! So, when his own community is depending on him, what does he do? He takes an each-way bet.


What you need to consider in environmental management of fisheries is regional total allowable catches. In other words, only so much can come out of each area. That spreads the risk over a broader area. What you need to understand is that people such as the Australian Marine Alliance have problems with this draconian bill. The chief executive of the AMA, Dean Logan, said:


The explanations given by ministers Ludwig and Burke throughout a range of media interviews over their knowledge and handling of the so-called super trawler have been watched closely by all involved.


He went on to say:


The majority of comments raise very serious concerns about whether both ministers, especially Minister Burke, have actually misled the Australian community. Perhaps more on this will be exposed by a freedom of information request and almost certain court action.


What people want is good management and a solid, secure pathway. Those who invested on the basis of an express approach by Mr Burke, who wanted the ship in here in the beginning when he was fisheries minister want is low sovereign risk. This bill denies it. The recreational fishers want a realistic outcome, which can be achieved in relation to this fishery by having move-on provisions—in other words, regional total allowable catches. The recreational fishers also want exclusion from this bill. The recreational fishing industry wants not to be caught up in this form of politics. As I said at the very beginning, this minister, with an express wish, can shut down any fishing. He could shut down snapper fishing more than three miles offshore because someone says that it is socially unacceptable. He could shut down the recreational shark fishing in Victoria because somebody says, 'We don't think that's socially acceptable'. He can shut down any fishing. As I said, he can shut down the entire Great Barrier Reef for recreational fishing as well as for commercial fishing without having to go through any due process. After the minister has made a decision to do that, he has to report to a committee. But there are no guidelines in this bill as to who can be on the committee and what qualifications they must have. The committee, as I said earlier, could consist of the Greens, the GetUp! Movement, the Pew foundation or anyone who wants to get involved in the social politics.


This government needs to stand firm on its commitment and address its own bill by adding to it move-on provisions and, in particular, by amending the bill to exclude recreational fishers. I call on the government to walk in here today and move an amendment to its own bill, before we do so, to exclude recreational fishing activities from being caught up in this legislation.

"Wilkie, Andrew, MP",Ind.,2012-09-12,"



Mr WILKIE
 (Denison) (12:21):  The federal government's decision to stop the supertrawler operating in Australian waters for up to two years is, I believe, a very significant and a very positive development. I applaud the government and the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities in particular for finally acting in this matter. The case against the supertrawler is, in my opinion, overwhelming. For a start, there are doubts over the science. 


Can I say up-front that I have enormous respect for the Australian scientific community and for the work that it does and I am very mindful of the fact that, in my electorate, I have a disproportionate number of marine scientists and fisheries experts—in fact, one of the highest populations of such people, pro rata, of any city in the country. But the fact is that the views in the scientific community are divided; there is not a clear consensus one way or another in this matter. For example, in Tasmania, our own Dr Andrew Wadsley has done some very good work picking apart the science behind the quota and has found many errors. Further afield, Professor Jessica Meeuwig, who is a research professor at the University of Western Australia, has had this to say:


But we are largely ignorant about the effective population structure of these species. Of the four species considered for exploitation, the population structure of blue mackerel is uncertain, and jack mackerel and redbait are believed to have eastern and western subpopulations. No dedicated population studies have been conducted on redbait nor is any information available for Peruvian jack mackerel. Moreover, little is reported about adult movements of any of these species except that larger jack mackerel are found in deeper waters.


That is one opinion from a very highly regarded Western Australian professor. I will quote again, this time from a friend of mine from Hobart, John Biggs. In an online blog comment this morning, he wrote:


Science's role is to provide the information on which policy can be made, its role is not to create policy. Policymakers certainly need to take the science into account, which means they are satisfied it is fully up to date … But policymakers also need to take into account a range of other factors, including the opinions of the public who elected them. Science may tell us what can happen but that does not mean to say it should happen. And in any case, the science here is focused on a specific species, not the whole ecosystem, is out of date and statistically wrong according to Dr Wadsley and others.


There are also doubts, in my opinion, over the effectiveness of the government's safeguards and, in particular, the promise of an observer onboard the supertrawler Margiris. To save money, the government is moving to replace fishing observers with electronic monitoring through the Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1), which passed this House in August and is now before the Senate. The government variously described the conditions it had imposed on the Margiris as 'tough', 'stringent' and 'best practice' but the reality is that the key condition of an onboard observer was nothing more than a facade. In introducing the bill, Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Sid Sidebottom, told parliament:


Trials and cost-benefit analyses have shown that the more data that is required for a fishery, the cheaper it will become to use e-monitoring systems, rather than observers. 


There are also doubts about the risk of localised stock depletion. This is one of the most important reasons that a single large vessel is much more problematic than a number of smaller boats filling the same quota. I suggest it is self-evident that one very large vessel with one very large net going into a relatively small fishery will have a disproportionate effect compared to a smaller number of vessels, which would probably operate across a broader area by comparison. 


Another problem with the supertrawler Margiris—and I will call it Margiris because I think renaming it Abel Tasman was downright offensive, particularly to the Tasmanian community—was that it had no social licence. Very few Tasmanians in particular wanted the vessel. That is not at all surprising, considering there are well over 100,000 recreational fishers—men, women and children—in Tasmania in a population of only half a million. I understand that elsewhere in Australia there are similar levels of concern with supertrawlers. This is very important. We in this House should represent our communities. It is too easy to simply say, 'Some government agency at arm's length knows more and we will disregard the view of the community.' That is not our job and we should not do that; it should only be done in extreme circumstances. It should not have been done in this case.


There has also been the problem of the misconduct by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority when setting the quota relevant to the Margiris. I refer here to AFMA advisory committees. The outcomes of the February meeting of the resource assessment group were not accurately recorded and concerns by at least two members of the group were not communicated up the chain to the management advisory committee. We know that because the concerns of at least two members of that committee are now on the public record. Their concerns went to what is called the South East Management Advisory Committee. We know that at its meeting in March—the key meeting when the recommendation for the quota relevant to the supertrawler Margiris was finalised—the committee did not comply with the Fisheries Administration Act. We know that the proponent for the supertrawler, Mr Gerry Geen of Seafish Tasmania, a man with a direct conflict of interest, remained in that meeting—which in my opinion was entirely improper, but it was allowable as long as the committee had explicitly given him approval to remain in the meeting, and they had not. When I challenged the CEO of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority about this, remarkably the CEO said that AFMA does not take its act literally—that, in fact, it has developed in-house workaround arrangements because it has difficulties with the act. 


I have taken these concerns to the ombudsman, and I am pleased that the ombudsman feels there is enough substance to my concerns about the conduct of AFMA that it is currently investigating the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, in particular its conduct regarding the setting of the quota relevant to the supertrawler Margiris.


Finally, there is also a question mark over the big picture and the fact that AFMA blocked the supertrawler Veronica in 2005 with the support of the Howard government. In fact, at about the same time, the proponents for the supertrawler Margiris commenced their work. 'So what?' you might ask, Mr Deputy Speaker. Well, the proponent for the Margiris, Mr Gerry Geen, was on at least one of the AFMA advisory committees in 2005 when AFMA blocked the Veronica. If that does not raise serious questions about the conduct of AFMA and whether a supertrawler should operate in Australian waters then I do not know what will.


I am not saying that Mr Geen has done anything wrong in these matters. In fact, I am genuinely concerned that Mr Geen has been allowed to do a lot of work, spend a lot of money and give employees a lot of hope when his expectations really should have been cut short long ago by either the Howard government, the Rudd government or, much earlier, the Gillard government. No, my issue here is with fisheries management in Australia and the fact that far too many people with direct conflicts of interest are allowed to occupy positions on key advisory bodies. Remember that Mr Geen, from Seafish Tasmania, the proponent for the supertrawler Margiris, was heavily involved with AFMA when a competitor vessel, the Veronica, was stopped, and he was again heavily involved more recently when the quota relevant to the Margiris was set. Surely, this is entirely improper of AFMA and should not be allowed to continue.


I urge the government to turn yesterday's announcement into law as quickly as possible—and I urge my crossbench colleagues to support the government. I also urge the government to ensure that this two-year assessment process which has been identified is done effectively and is absolutely beyond question. And given all the uncertainty over the setting of the quota for the supertrawler Margiris I also urge the government to revoke that quota and not allow any other vessel to fish it in the interim. Regrettably, I would also add that, while the government's announcement yesterday is to be applauded, I think it could have gone much further. Ultimately I will be supporting an amendment I expect to be moved by the member for Melbourne which would seek to ban supertrawlers permanently.


I would like to quote from a Greenpeace fact sheet on some of the issues we need to consider about toughening up the government's bill and banning supertrawlers permanently. The supertrawler Margiris is 142 metres long, twice the size of any vessel that has fished Australian seas previously. It is six times longer than the average Australian fishing vessel. It can process—and this is a typical supertrawler—up to 250 tonnes of fish a day and store 6,200 tonnes of fish before it has to return to port. This is fishing on an industrial scale never before seen in Australia—nor should it be. Fishing on such a scale has an enormous bycatch that kills a large number of very precious animals. For example, in the past 15 years, bycatch from the 20 supertrawlers fishing off West Africa has killed an estimated 1,500 critically endangered turtles, more than 18,000 giant rays and more than 60,000 sharks. And not only are they destroying these precious animals, they are destroying jobs. Supertrawlers are inherently machinery intensive and personnel light. They are job killers, not job creators. They have done enormous damage around the world where they have been allowed to operate. For example, they collapsed the South Pacific fishery. I am still quoting from the Greenpeace fact sheet here. 'Scientists said there were so many jack mackerel in the South Pacific that the fishery was impossible to overfish. But supertrawlers, including the Margiris, fished so much that in 2006 the Pacific fishery collapsed to 10 per cent of healthy stocks. Fisheries managers are calling for fishing to be cut by half, with some scientists arguing for a five-year total ban in that fishery.' They have also effectively wiped out West Africa's commercial fish stock. 'Since supertrawlers, including the Margiris, started fishing off the west coast of Africa, most commercial fish stocks have become fully exploited or overexploited.' In other words, there are effectively no more fish for commercial fishing—and that is what supertrawlers have done in recent years in other parts of the world.


Frankly, it should be up to the proponents of such vessels to prove to us that they are environmentally and economically sensible, rather than the current situation where it is up to the government to prove that such vessels are inappropriate. I believe that if we were to amend the government's bill and ban supertrawlers permanently it would put the onus on any future proponent of a supertrawler to make a strong enough case to convince a future government to change the law. It should not be up to us to work out how to say no. The onus has to be reversed. It should be up to the proponents of supertrawlers to convince us in the future that they have changed their ways and things are better. It should be up to a future proponent of a supertrawler, if they want to have one operate in Australian waters, to persuade a future government to change the law to allow it.


I will wind it up there. I will finish by saying that yesterday's news was great news for a great many Australians, certainly for the overwhelming majority of Tasmanians that I am aware of. I applaud the government for doing it and I call on my crossbench colleagues to understand that the government's bill should be applauded. And the issue of science is a fair point, but remember that there is uncertainty even within the scientific community.

"Ley, Sussan, MP",LP,2012-09-12,"



Ms LEY
 (Farrer) (12:36):  I am pleased to speak on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Declared Fishing Activities) Bill 2012, which those listening to the broadcast would assume concerns the activities of the supertrawler Margiris. And I guess, in one sense, it does, except that, when you look at the extraordinary powers that this bill will give to the minister for the environment, you could be forgiven for thinking that he, with his partners the Greens, has taken this opportunity for a giant regulatory overreach. That regulatory overreach will give the Australian government, in the form of its environment minister, control over fishing activities anywhere, in any capacity, done by any body, organisation or individual on the basis of a new term, 'social uncertainty'. It is a term that I have not encountered in legislation.


Like most people in my electorate of Farrer, some of whom have contacted me today, when I look at images of the supertrawler I do not like what I see. That is an instinctive reaction. It is the kind of instinctive reaction that many people would get when they visit an abattoir or see some of the perfectly legal and perfectly humane activities that are carried out in the farming industry. There are parallels between this issue and the live cattle debacle engineered by this government. But we cannot stand in this place and react on the basis of instinct. We can use our instinct to look again at a situation, to analyse it, and to say to our scientists and departmental experts: 'What's going on here? What really is happening? Do you have any ability to make changes?' We can and we should do those things. I am sure that, up to a point, the minister has done those things. But what has been produced for the parliament to consider today is not that.


If the minister particularly wanted to target a piece of regulation or legislation aimed at the supertrawler Margiris he could have done that. He could, for example, have introduced some provisions to make the ship move on—in other words, not stay in the same catchment area for longer than a certain period of time. He did not do that. He could have, and it has been done, legislated for a particular vessel on a particular occasion. There are many reasons why that would be a bad public policy approach, but he could have done that. In an attempt to address community concerns about the Margiris this minister has gone to the extreme. He has given himself almost unlimited powers, which will impact on every family fishing boat around the country.


I do not represent any ocean. The electorate of Farrer comprises 30 per cent of the state of New South Wales and it is all a long way from the sea. But I do represent recreational fishers and I do represent communities that love angling, that have seen the invasion of the concept of inland marine parks, that have seen a horrible, complicated bureaucracy grew up around just wanting to go out on a Sunday afternoon and throw a line in the waters of Lake Hume, the Menindee Lakes or the Murray River. Those communities are being attacked by the bureaucracy from every side.


The reason I want so strongly to speak against this bill is to recognise not only the appalling principle that is being engineered by this government but the rights of people in my electorate to carry on fishing and angling, and to carry on doing their business. They want to be able to that in a way that does not leave them with a federal environment act overseeing their every single move, an act that has the ability to stop the activity, to limit it and to put in place something so unrealistic that the very Australian activities of recreational fishing can no longer take place.


I have talked about principle. One of the principles we are seeing in this is a government that is making policy on the run. In the process, it has given the minister unlimited powers, but what has really happened is that a social media campaign, very successfully engineered by GetUp! and the green movement, has pushed this government into action. Social media is an amazing opportunity for people to make their point. From relative obscurity they can suddenly be in the public eye. It is something we have to countenance and resist up to a point. It is policy-making on the run; it is quite interesting to see. Every family fishing operator and every recreational fisher will be impacted by this.


Let us look at the language of the minister's bill. Clause 390SD(2) says:


… fishing activity by reference to all or any of the following:


(a) a method of fishing;


(b) a type of vessel used for fishing;


(c) a method of processing, carrying or transhipping of fish that have been taken;


(d) an area of waters or of seabed.


The minister will be able to overturn any fishing activity on the basis of even the slightest social complaint. There does not have to be any evidence. An uncertainty can be created by a complaint from a political source, from a lobby group interest group or from a social media website. This absolute power can apply to economic or environmental complaints. There is no indication what the term 'uncertainty' means in this legislation. It provides scope for the minister to stop any fishing activity without any substantive case. That creates a cloud over our entire fishing industry.


This bill, by stealth, accident or sheer incompetence, will impose the most extraordinarily draconian powers on basic rights, which is why all parliamentarians in this place should oppose it. The minister is saying that he will decide who fishes, and where, when and how they do so. It does not matter what investment may have gone into a pipeline to provide the opportunity for people to work in the fishing industry, what investment there may have been to get a ship, a boat, a trawler out into the waters. I am not talking about the supertrawler; I am talking about any fishing vessel. Nobody can have certainty. You could have gone to all this expense. You could have worked-up the ship and the crew. You could have provided jobs to long-term unemployed, which I understand is what the supertrawler has done and which many fishing vessels do in areas where unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, is quite high. You could have done all those things and you could have a lot of skin in the game as a small business, which a lot of our fishing enterprises are, and see the minister decide that, because of a complaint, because of a whim, it is all going to be ended. There is no point in members of the government saying: 'That's not what this is about. That's not what this minister would do.' That is not the point. The point is that we in this place should not give ministers this undue power. We have the Australian Fisheries Management Authority. We have had the science, we have had the advice, we have appointed independent experts. We appoint independent experts in this place to death because we know that we are not the experts. Yes, we can make decisions based on what they tell us. We should not contract out the decision-making, which is something this government does very well. We should not contract out the decision-making to independent bodies, but we should rely on their advice.


Where this advice tells us, as it has in the case of the fisheries, that this is one quota that will not result in more fish being extracted from our seas and that this is in line with every international and national agreement and piece of policy that we have at this point in time, why would the minister race in here on a whim reacting in a moment of horror in the face of what is just an environmental campaign? It has been writ very large by social media, admittedly, but it is a campaign nevertheless, not based on fact, principle or any good public policy.


We have no idea what the parameters of this 'uncertainty'—and the term in the legislation is 'social uncertainty'—might be. As I asked before, will it apply to a lake in the middle of my electorate? Will it apply to every lake in Australia until the minister's assessment of that uncertainty rests? Does it affect the Murray or Darling rivers, which also flow through my electorate? We have already seen the greatest level of uncertainty since Federation occur up and down the lengths of these mighty rivers with the government's wrecking-ball approach—the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. This has already knocked irrigation communities for six, through the uncertainty created by the government's completely unrealistic water diversion targets.


As other speakers have noted, a similar knee-jerk reaction occurred with last year's live export ban to Indonesia. During the last parliamentary sitting I met with a group from Gulf Horizons. To hear their description of how an entire pastoral region of Northern Australia is on its knees because of that live cattle decision was truly horrifying—another knee-jerk reaction, another reaction of 'Oh, my God, what do we do about this? There's something that has appeared in the media; we have to act now,' without consideration of process, all the facts or just the appropriate rationale. Millions of dollars have been taken out of farming and freight livelihoods forever in one single swoop. Then of course the agriculture minister went, 'Oops!'—it was another of those moments—and he tried to backflip. This is exactly what we are seeing here with this decision.


Under this amendment before the House, potentially we will see every family fishing operator and every recreational fisher waking up in the morning and wondering what sort of social uncertainty the minister might be experiencing on the other side of the country. Rumours already abound through inland Australia about the possibility that Labor's marine park legislation for our coastline could somehow extend and infiltrate into inland streams and lakes.


If recreational fishing takes any more of a hit in my electorate in western New South Wales then that might be more than the small towns that rely on it for tourism and income can stand. It would be the last nail in the coffin for some of them. If you look at the inland rivers now with plenty of water in them and the country blooming, it is a fantastic place for families to take their children to camp, fish, sit in the sun and have a really good-value Australian holiday—not on the coast, not in Bali and not anywhere offshore but actually to support rural Australia when it needs it but also when it can offer so much.


The minister's intention to extend his powers means that he can do that at any time on any whim. We know that when this government gets a knock on the door from their partners the Greens they react—and they react in a way that is not in their own interests either and certainly not in the interests of the people of Australia.


In making a few calls to local fishing groups and businesses around my electorate this morning I found that no-one is really aware of the extent of these changes the minister is planning to foist on them. That is because there has not been any consultation. How surprising! This government is ramming through legislation with apparently unintended consequences. The fisher who pops his boat out on Lake Hume on a Sunday morning with his son can be penalised for pulling out a trout instead of a yellow belly or a cod simply because some fish libertarian felt socially concerned over the removal of non-native fish stocks! Of course they have not been consulted. What would their response have been? It would have been, 'Please do not go ahead with this draconian and stupid piece of legislation.' As one local fisher told me, you would want the minister to have to jump through a few more hoops before they could bring in anything like this. That is the point. There has not been consultation. There has simply been this awful, knee-jerk reaction designed purely to respond to a populist campaign. As we have seen so many times before, when the dust settles, when the truth—as it always does—gets out, people will realise, 'Oops, perhaps we shouldn't have done that. Look at these unintended consequences for our country, for our investment and for our fisheries.'


I will end where I began. Instinctively, I am like everyone else. I look at the supertrawler and think, 'I'm not sure about that.' But that is not what we are talking about here today. Ostensibly what we are talking about is an opportunity to give this government an enormous new regulatory power in the area of the environment. If people think that the green groups that have agitated so successfully for this will stop at this and will stop at a vessel of this size without wanting to go the line and look at vessels of different sizes in different fisheries carrying out different activities for different purposes they are crazy. This would only just be the beginning. We should resist it at all costs.

 (Bradfield) (12:51):  I am pleased to rise to speak on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Declared Fishing Activities) Bill 2012. To any objective observer, this is a really puzzling bill. We have a long established system for regulating fisheries in Australia which is recognised around the world for being rational, science based and allowing for a proper balance of commercial and economic considerations on the one hand and environmental and sustainability considerations on the other.


Under the operation of that system, a company based in Tasmania was awarded a quota to fish for certain species of small pelagic fish. The company decided that the way it would exercise its rights to fish up to the limit set by the quota was to bring to Australia a large fishing vessel called the Margiris, now renamed the Abel Tasman. What happened next was that activist groups like Greenpeace and GetUp!, with the enthusiastic support of the Greens political party, started an advocacy campaign designed to raise public concerns about the activities of this vessel, even though its activities will make no difference to the total amount of fish caught.


As recently as Monday of this week the Gillard government was defending the current system. The fisheries minister, Joe Ludwig, had this to say in the Senate:


This government, like those before it, takes the position that output controls, particularly individual transferable quotas, are the preferred approach to fisheries management.


He went on to share with the Senate the advice he had received from 'eminent fishery scientists' of their 'confidence that food-web impacts of the small pelagic fishery on predators and the small pelagic fishery species themselves, including through localised depletion, are unlikely'. In other words, he advised the Senate on Monday that his expert scientific advice was that it was unlikely that there would be adverse impacts on the food web from this fishery activity which had been previously authorised under the existing regulatory arrangements.


Yesterday, however, there was a complete change of position from the Gillard government, leading to the bill which is before the House today and which we are now debating. According to the minister's second reading speech, this bill would:


… incorporate a new chapter into the EPBC Act—


that is, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act—


that will allow the environment minister to prohibit a declared fishing activity while an independent expert panel undertakes an assessment of the potential environmental, social or economic impacts of the activity.


However, this can only happen if:


… the environment minister and the fisheries minister agree that there is uncertainty about the environmental, social or economic impacts …


The other thing that the minister tells us in his second reading speech is that this prohibition can last for 24 months. That is to say that the effect of making this declaration is that fishing activities as specified in the declaration, in that particular area and using the specified methods, are prohibited for up to 24 months. This is truly policymaking on the run, overturning a well-established and world respected system of evidence based policymaking in Australian fisheries management, and the coalition therefore opposes this bill.


In the time available to me I want to make three points. Firstly, we are seeing here from the Gillard government a panicked reaction. The minister's attempts to justify the measures in this bill are threadbare indeed. Secondly, the sweeping new power which this bill would grant the minister for the environment creates great uncertainty for both the entire commercial fishing sector and the recreational fishing community. It should be opposed on its merits. Thirdly, this dramatic backflip by the Gillard government—by no means their first and, I suspect, not their last—adds to the already high perceptions of sovereign risk for those doing business or seeking to do business in Australia.


Let me start firstly with the proposition that what we are seeing here is a panicked reaction to a political advocacy campaign. I have already cited the remarks of Fisheries Minister Ludwig in the Senate just on Monday of this week defending the current system. In addition, Environment Minister Burke just a few days ago issued what at that time was understood to be the definitive response to some of the public concerns expressed in this political advocacy campaign. His measures would have imposed new restrictions on the methods that this vessel could use as it fished. For example, as he told the ABC's Q&A program, if the vessel were to catch a dolphin—something it is not permitted to do—it would then be required to cease fishing and move 50 nautical miles away before it could start fishing again.


Just a few days later it turned out that that policy response was not his definitive policy response and he now wants new and even wider powers to deal with the issues posed by the proposed activities of the Abel Tasman. Why is it that he now wants these new powers? According to his second reading speech, it is firstly because of:


… the nature of this vessel and in particular its capacity to remain in the same area of ocean for extended periods of time …


It is also apparently because of the following:


Experience over the last couple of months has however shown that the act does not provide sufficient powers to suspend a fishing activity where there is uncertainty as to the potential environmental, social and economic impacts of the activity …


It really is very odd that Minister Burke would say this now when just three years ago, as the minister responsible for fisheries at the time, he oversaw the issuing by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority of something called the Small pelagic fishery harvest strategy. When you read the Small pelagic fishery harvest strategy it describes its purpose as follows:


The development of the Small Pelagic Fishery (SPF) Harvest Strategy (HS) reflects obligations under the Commonwealth's Fisheries Harvest Strategy Policy and Guidelines … the HS is to provide—


that is to say it is required to provide—


the Australian community with a high degree of confidence that commercial fish species are being managed for long-term biological sustainability and economic profitability.


This document issued under the auspices of then Fisheries Minister Burke went on to say:


SPF species—


small pelagic fish species—


are an important food source for many threatened, endangered and protected species (TEPs) and other species and it is therefore important that the SPF HS takes into account the ecosystem role of these species …


Finally, this document went on to say:


there are considerable economies of scale … and the most efficient way to fish may include large scale factory freezer vessels.


I need hardly add that 'large scale factory freezer vessel' is a good description of precisely the kind of vessel which is now the subject of controversy.


In other words, there has already been a thorough process carried out which balances up the commercial considerations on the one hand and environmental and sustainability concerns on the other, a process overseen for much of the period, as it happens, by Minister Burke. We are now expected by Minister Burke to believe that, when this process occurred, nobody thought about or considered the possibility that a vessel of the size of the Abel Tasman might be used, and nobody thought about or considered the possibility, which is now so alarming to him, that it could stay in one place longer than smaller vessels. Nobody gave this a second thought, even though such vessels are now and were at that time, just three years ago, in common use in many parts of the world.


If Minister Burke were genuinely concerned about this issue, there are a range of other measures that he could use to address it, including, for example, imposing additional conditions requiring the vessel to move on from a particular location after a particular period. But the reality is that he is clutching at straws, desperately trying to find a justification for this measure, which in substance is a response to a short-term political campaign. It is difficult to understand the rationale for the mechanism set out in the bill, which is that, under clause 390SH, there will be an expert panel established to look into the declared fishing activity. We know that the establishment of an expert panel is a preferred tactic of the Gillard government. We saw it with Julia Gillard's 'citizens' assembly', which was going to achieve a 'deep and lasting consensus' on climate change; we saw it in her appointment of Angus Houston and other panellists in an attempt to cover up her backflip on asylum seekers; and now we see the same preferred tactic being used here. On any analysis, it is an empty charade when you consider the very thorough and comprehensive process already undertaken to assess the relevant fisheries activity, including its environmental and sustainability impact.


The second point I would like to make in the brief time I have is about the extent of the uncertainty created for the entire commercial fishing sector, on the one hand, and the recreational fishing community, on the other, by the wide provisions set out in this bill. Under this bill, if it passes into law, the minister will be able to make a declaration that he and the fisheries minister agree that 'there is uncertainty about the environmental, social or economic impacts of the fishing activity'. That is in clause 390SD(3). 'Uncertainty' is a very low bar indeed. It means that the minister will be able to overturn any fishing activity on the basis of even the slightest social complaint. Everyone who has ever dropped a line over the side, and every commercial fishing operator anywhere in Australia, should be alarmed about the potential for their intended fishing activities to be banned at short notice based on 'social' considerations. The wording appears to have been specifically chosen to give the minister the power to act in response to political campaigns by particular activist groups. The mere existence of such campaigns will automatically qualify as generating uncertainty about the 'social impacts' of the fishing activity.


One point that strikes you on reading the bill is whether there is any limit on the minister's power to use this mechanism repeatedly. Nowhere in the bill is there a provision that the declaration can only be made in respect of a particular fishing activity if no such declaration has previously been made. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that this mechanism is really a smokescreen for the real motivation of delaying the activity which has caused political offence. It is also noteworthy that nowhere in the bill is there any provision requiring the minister to have any regard to, or do anything in response to, the report of the expert panel once he receives it, other than to publish it on his website and table it in the parliament, under clause 390SL.


My third point is to join with my coalition colleagues in highlighting the way that this dramatic backflip by the Gillard government yet again adds to perceptions of sovereign risk. In industry after industry we have seen the same story play out: businesses invest to carry out lawful operations, and then the Rudd or Gillard government in a political panic changes the rules. We saw the abrupt cancellation of Home Insulation Program after many operators had invested heavily and built up inventory in reliance on the existing rules. We saw the sudden decision to cancel the live cattle export trade, also involving this inglorious Minister Ludwig. And now we see this abrupt eleventh-hour reversal of position on the conduct of fisheries activities by the holder of an entitlement to fish and to catch a certain amount of fish, an entitlement issued by the government under the law after a thorough analysis of the relevant commercial and environmental factors and after setting total catch limits based on scientific evidence. This decision creates sovereign risk issues for anybody who holds a licence to fish in Australian waters and it is likely to dramatically reduce the confidence of Australia's commercial fishing industry to continue to invest—if any quota or licence can be overturned at the whim of the minister. Today's decision makes a mockery of the entire Australian Fisheries Management Authority process on which the government relies for its scientific advice.


I conclude as I started, by noting that this bill is a panicked political response to a campaign initiated by certain groups of activists. It is policymaking on the run. It overturns a well-established, world-respected system of evidence based policymaking in Australian fisheries management. The coalition opposes the bill.

"Parke, Melissa, MP",ALP,2012-09-12,"



Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (13:06):  Fremantle has long been a fishing community and it has long been a leader in environmental protection and sustainability. My community has been thrilled with the federal government's recent announcement that Australia will establish the world's largest network of marine sanctuaries in Commonwealth waters. That is why, from the moment I heard that a supertrawler was en route to Australia and was seeking to operate in those same Commonwealth waters, serious alarm bells began to ring about what this might mean for local fishers and for marine biodiversity.


When one considers the scale and indiscriminate nature of this kind of operation—with its potential to exact damaging localised depletion of fish species for which we have imperfect or non-existent data; with its potential to wreak havoc on the existing food chain and marine ecosystems; and its potential to kill large numbers of animals like seals, dolphins, sea lions and seabirds as the bycatch victims of its enormous drag nets—there can be no question but that the precautionary principle must apply.


And, when one looks into the history and practice methods of supertrawler operations elsewhere and considers the impacts they are likely to have on the distinctive features of Australia's marine environment, there could be no option but to address the legislative inadequacy that has until now prevented the ministers responsible from acting to protect Australia's oceans and fisheries. I am glad that, through the galvanising events of recent weeks, the government has found a way to give the environment minister that power.


For me, the urgency and clarity of taking action—of proposing a private member's bill, together with a number of my Labor colleagues, as part of that galvanising process—was further reinforced by a number of considerations. First, I represent an electorate, and I come from a state, that is within the proposed area of operation for this veritable Godzilla of the sea. The fishing community I represent was quick to make its concerns known about the nature and scale of a supertrawler operation. Commercial fishers in Fremantle, and in WA more widely, are only too conscious of the preciousness and fragility of our fisheries, and they have undergone a series of complex and difficult adjustments over at least the last 10 to 15 years in recognition of the changes required to ensure that our fisheries and our oceans are sustainable into the future. This process has certainly not been without a fierce and frank debate involving fishers, scientists, regulators and conservationists, and it has not been without some economic and social consequences for a number of long-time fishing families in Fremantle, and yet, through that process and the advocacy of marine scientists, there is no doubt that both the recreational and the commercial fishing communities have become acutely aware that our oceans deserve and require stewardship of the highest quality.


A supertrawler fails that standard with its onboard fish-processing and storage capacity of 6,200 tonnes, which means that the vessel can stay in a particular area of the sea for extended periods and trawl it dry. A supertrawler represents the very antithesis of the approach that sustainable Australian fishery management requires and that maritime conservation demands. It is the marine equivalent of strip mining or clear-felling, depleting the oceans of life with industrial scale and efficiency.


My Labor colleagues and I have received the message loud and clear from our communities. This has been one of those issues where a strong public consensus has formed instinctively and decisively around the common-sense view—which is also, I might add, the scientific view—of marine scientists like Professor Jessica Meeuwig; namely, that a supertrawler operation like the one presented by the MV Margiris is unsustainable and presents unacceptable risks to marine ecosystems and local fisheries.


I want to acknowledge the input of literally thousands of people, from experts to ordinary people from all walks of life, in Fremantle and around the country. I thank those who have sent me emails and letters, those who have phoned my office or visited my office to express their concerns and those who have attended rallies and written to newspapers. I recognise with gratitude, too, the support and advice I received from a number of people and organisations, including the team at Greenpeace; the Wilderness Society; Sea Shepherd; Environment Tasmania; the Save Our Marine Life coalition, especially David Mackenzie, Michelle Grady, Tim Nicol, Paul Gamblin and Chris Smyth; Perth barrister Greg Mcintyre SC; ANU professor Andrew Macintosh; and dozens of local fishing organisations that have written to me on this issue. I also want to thank my Labor caucus colleagues with whom I have worked very closely on this issue, particularly my Tasmanian colleagues the member for Franklin and senators Carol Brown and Lin Thorp. I also want to mention the member for Wills, who was going to second my private member's bill if we had gone ahead with it.


Finally, I want to acknowledge Professor Jessica Meeuwig, the Director of the Centre for Marine Futures at the Oceans Institute, University of Western Australia, and a Conservation Fellow of the Zoological Society of London. Professor Meeuwig provided invaluable and clear-sighted advice on this matter, as she has done in the past, and I want to quote from the letter that she provided to the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities on 27 August. It says:


Increasing the total allowable catch to 18,000 tonnes represents an unsupported 10-fold increase over previous landings. This is a significant increase from one year to the next. The calculation of this new quota assumes that the estimates of biomass are reliable. It is notable that the estimates are generally based on old information (blue mackerel in the East 2004), inferred from other species (jack mackerel—East), or actually entirely absent (jack mackerel—West, Peruvian jack mackerel, redbait—West). It is thus likely that biomass estimates (and associated quotas) are much more uncertain than is currently reported.


Further:


This proposal for a super trawler is clearly an example where significant uncertainty exists in biological knowledge, both in terms of the species themselves and their unfished biomass. The entry of the Margiris is appropriately considered a new fishery from an ecological perspective given it represents effectively a new gear and the Western region is largely unfished and as such, should not be initiated. Moreover, precautionary spatial closures are not yet in place. As such, the Forage Fish Taskforce recommendations do not appear to support entry of a super trawler into Australian waters.


Professor Meeuwig ends her letter to the minister as follows:


In closing, I had the privilege of introducing the documentary ""The End of the Line"" for a showing at Parliament's theatre in 2011. At the time, I was asked ""how is this relevant to Australia? We don't have this kind of highly industrialized supertrawling here."" I answered that the film provided a salutary lesson in terms of the negative impacts that such fishing can have on ocean health and how important it is to protect Australia's oceans because they are still relatively healthy. At a time when Australia is leading the world in marine conservation by establishing a legacy network of reserves, it seems incredibly counterproductive and short sighted to introduce more unnecessary opportunities for the overexploitation of our oceans.


I think that makes the argument as well as it can be made, and I know that the minister himself, who, along with his staff and department, deserves enormous credit for the painstaking work that went into the creation of the historic marine protection in the south-west marine bioregional area, has been seriously exercised by the need to prevent the supertrawler from undermining that achievement.


I have no doubt that it was a great relief to hundreds of thousands of concerned Australians to hear yesterday that the government will create the additional powers under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to allow the minister for the environment to stop the supertrawler operating for up to two years while the environmental, social and economic impacts are assessed by an expert panel. This length of time is needed because of the present lack of scientific evidence and data regarding the target species and their unfished biomass as well as bycatch impact. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has also initiated a root-and-branch review of Australia's fisheries management system to put in place the appropriate processes to deal with issues such as new fishing methods, technologies and vessel types and sizes as they arise.


Among those who will be celebrating this outcome are the students of Fremantle primary school who last week, on a blustery morning at South Beach Cafe, presented the Prime Minister with a card that said, 'Thank you for introducing the world's largest network of marine sanctuaries.' That achievement, which will resonate far into our future, is one of the most significant achievements of this Labor government. It was partly by seeing the importance of our oceans through the prism of that reform process and its outcome that I and many others welcomed the precautionary approach that will prevent the operation of the wandering, plundering MV Margiris—or the FV Abel Tasman, as it has now renamed itself, for what I understand is the fifth time—until environmental, social and economic assessments have been carried out.


There is often a kind of cynicism and doom and gloom when it comes to the political process and its capacity to address problems when they arise, so I would like to finish by recognising that we do have, by and large, a healthy and responsive system of decision making in Australia and that this has been one of those cases where representatives and the people they represent have worked together to find a solution.

"Chester, Darren, MP",Nats,2012-09-12,"



Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland) (13:15):  I rise to speak very strongly in opposition to the government's proposed amendment to the EPBC declared fishing areas. With all due respect to the member for Fremantle, who I do respect, I am afraid we are going to have to differ very strongly in this case.


I have followed this debate very closely and I am strongly opposed to both the process the government has undertaken in relation to bringing the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Declared Fishing Activities) Bill 2012 before the House, and also the actual intent of this legislation and the uncertainty it creates. Quite frankly, this is an absolutely appalling mess. It is chaotic, it is confusing, it has created uncertainty and sovereign risk for the entire fishing industry, and it is illogical.


I was interviewed today by journalists as I walked into Parliament House, and I spoke about the appalling process we have witnessed over the past 48 to 72 hours. Let us cast our minds back to Monday, when the front pages of newspapers were full of headlines about Labor MPs muscling up to the Greens. It was all very hairy-chested stuff. They were going to take on the Greens. Also on Monday we had the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in the Senate, Minister Joe Ludwig, extolling the virtues of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority as an independent body responsible for the sustainable management of Australia's fisheries. In all his comments on Monday and leading up to Monday, he was standing by the science. In all of his public comments, that is what the minister was doing. Then we had this collapse yesterday—this absolute, abject failure of governance—as the government caved in, once again, to a little bit of pressure from the Greens and GetUp! 


I am not sure why Labor members actually bother going to Labor caucus meetings anymore; they only need to log on to GetUp! to find out what their policy position is going to be; they only need to go to a Greens' party meeting to actually find out what they are going to be voting for next week. This root-and-branch review, which was also part of the minister's announcement yesterday, has just opened the door again for more Green madness. This is a classic example of a jellyfish cabinet: there is not a spine amongst them, and, just like a jellyfish, they will cave in the moment there is any pressure whatsoever. Just like a jellyfish, they will float along wherever the political current of the day may take them. And, just like a jellyfish, I am afraid they have not got the brains to chart their own direction. This is an appalling move by the minister for the environment. I knew the minister for the environment had leadership aspirations; I just didn't realise he wanted to lead the Greens!


Let us get to the substance of the issue before the House today. Let us look at the substance of the legislation and what it means to the Australian fishing industry and quite possibly the recreational sector as well. This bill, if it goes through the House today, will provide unfettered power to the minister to act on the basis of what is described as 'social uncertainty'. What is ostensibly an environmental act, the EPBC Act, will now have a clause allowing the minister to take action based on 'social uncertainty'. For the life of me, I am not too sure what that even means. I heard the shadow minister trying to describe it; he said social uncertainty was when Kevin Rudd walked into a room with Julia Gillard, and that is probably as good a definition as I have seen so far. It appears to me, though, that social uncertainty basically relates to being government by Facebook. It is government by GetUp! If you can whip up a bit of public concern on any issue, create some 'social uncertainty', the minister will have unfettered power to shut you down—and not based on any environmental considerations—based on 'social uncertainty'.


It made me think. It gave me pause for thought. Who in Australia right now is good at whipping up public concern with misinformed, emotional, half-baked campaigns? That would be the Australian Greens. The member for Petrie may laugh, but she knows it to be a fact: the Australian Greens are famous for whipping up public concern on half-baked emotional arguments. This amendment is an enormous folly by this government because it plays straight into the hands of their greatest enemy, the Australian Greens, who are the greatest threat to jobs in regional Australia. If this legislation is passed today, this will not be the end of it. The so-called supertrawler will be the sideshow to the big game as far as the Greens are concerned. This will not be the only project that is affected. This will flow on to the entire Australian commercial fishing fleet. If members opposite doubt me, they can just reflect for a moment on the Australian Greens' performance when it comes to the forestry industry. We have seen this all before. They are insatiable—they will never be satisfied. What is to stop the Greens from using this legislation to take on other sectors of the fishing industry which do not meet with their approval and their radical agenda? They can go out there now and start complaining about the size of wheat harvesters. Perhaps they will be complaining that mining excavators are too large.


The Greens exist as a party of protest. The Special Minister of State may snigger, but he knows it to be a fact as well. They are a party of protest. That is the only way they can exist. They cannot exist unless they have something to fight. Just like GetUp!, the entire structure of the Australian Greens is based around running campaigns, calling for donations to run those campaigns, and fighting for something—fighting for anything. They are not a party of responsible government. And the day that this Prime Minister signed a power-sharing agreement with the Greens was a dark day for regional Australia and it was a dark day for the Australian Labor Party, and there are many members opposite who know that. There are many members of the Australian Labor Party who regret that day, who regret that appalling scene where the Prime Minister gave up the prime ministerial courtyard to allow the Greens come in, all beaming smiles as they took charge. There are many members opposite who know that was a huge mistake and a fundamental flaw in the judgement of the current Prime Minister.


The potential impact of this amendment to the act is obvious to anyone who has had any association at all with commercial fishermen. It effectively throws science out the door. It throws the principles of sustainable fisheries management out the door and it virtually throws AFMA out the door as well. It is a vote of no confidence in AFMA by this government.


We have got ourselves into an appalling situation. This nation already has a tightly regulated fishing industry which is one of the most sustainable in the world. I know that to be true because I have heard the minister say it himself. I heard the environment minister, who was previously the minister for fisheries, say that himself. I have heard the current minister say that himself. So we already have a tightly regulated fishing industry—among the most sustainable in the world—but GetUp! does not like one particular allocation of quotas to one particular vessel and the Greens do not like it either; therefore we cave in. Minister, grow a spine. 


The Lakes Entrance fishing fleet in my electorate is, in many ways, no different to this so-called supertrawler. Every fisherman in my electorate understands this. They should be worried about the impacts of this amendment to the act. Just as the so-called supertrawler does, they each have what is called a statutory fishing right attached to their boat. They have a quota, as part of the statutory fishing rights, for species in a small pelagic fishery. Then, to generate what is called the total allowable catch, they have a harvest strategy—and the stock being harvested has been assessed by the CSIRO. So we have leading Australian scientists, recognised as some of the best in the world, making assessments. When the data is considered too old—as has occurred at times in the past—they have adopted what is called the 'precautionary principle' and reduced the total allowable catch. That is exactly the same process which has been applied to this application. That is a process the responsible minister has supported and it is a process which applies to all commercial fishing vessels operating in Commonwealth waters around Australia. That is why all those fishermen in my electorate today are deeply alarmed by the direction this government is taking.


Both the current fisheries minister and the previous minister, who is now bringing this flawed amendment to this chamber, have extolled the virtues of that system—of the way our fisheries have been run for the past five years—ever since they have been ministers. Both of them have extolled the virtues of Australian fisheries and how they are being managed in a sustainable manner. They have described it as world's best practice. Both ministers have spoken in support of AFMA on many occasions. We have had a process which has provided a level of certainty, enabling fishermen right around Australia to invest in the industry with certainty. They have had confidence that decisions affecting the future of their industry would be based on science and that the government was committed to supporting the industry. But, as of yesterday, and as we debate this bill here today, all of that certainty has been thrown away by this government. 


This amendment to the act is reflective of a government in total disarray and in panic. This is a government which falls apart under pressure. I fear that this is the live cattle export issue all over again. It would not be so bad if this were just about politics, but this is about people's lives. Already we know, from the proponent of this particular supertrawler, that 50 jobs will be lost as a direct result of this government's decision. I believe the uncertainty created in the rest of the industry will lead to further job losses. 


The government has form. The live cattle issue had disastrous impacts on the cattle industry. Members opposite say they care about outcomes for Indigenous Australians and I believe they do. But did they consider, in supporting the government's reckless ban on live cattle exports, the impact that would have on Indigenous stockmen? Many lost their jobs.


If we do not have a government which can provide certainty and be responsible in the face of adversity, the Australian people have no reason whatsoever to have faith in any decision this government makes. If we do not have a sustainable fishing industry based on science, what do we base it on? Do we base it on the number of emails we receive? Do we base it on the number of tweets on Twitter? Do we base it on the number of people who have signed the electronic petitions posted by GetUp!? 


A government with any spine whatsoever would go out there and start arguing its case. You could go out there and start arguing the case based on the quota concept. You could argue that the quota has been allocated according to science and that there will be no extra fish caught just because the vessel might be larger. That is a fact. I do not think anyone opposite would argue against that point. So you could make a case based on that argument. Hell, we have done that for the last 20 years or so. That is an approach the government might like to take. 


The government might want to mention that we have an independent authority in place called AFMA and that AFMA is using the best available science Australia can provide. It might want to argue the case on that basis. The government might want to argue the case on the basis that AFMA has found this application acceptable on environmental grounds. Instead the government just caves in—too gutless to make a decision and stick with it. The government could have pointed out that Australia has a long and proud history of sustainable fishery management. It might have pointed out that the Australian fishing industry pays millions of dollars in levies every year to fund these independent assessments and scientific evaluations. It could have done that—or it could just cave in to GetUp! and the Greens. Clearly the environment minister has chosen the latter course of action. 


It is especially disappointing to me because I represent, based at the port of Lakes Entrance, the largest fishing fleet in Australia. Today I have had the chance to speak to fishing industry representatives and they are worried about this government. They are worried the government has closed the door on science and opened the door to the environmental radicals. They know that the quota was sustainable and very precautionary. They know that many scientists, both within AFMA and independent, have made public comments supporting the quota. They make the point, quite rightly, that fisheries management must be based on science and not on politics. They also make the point—and this is the kind of point that fishermen would make—that fish do not actually care if they are killed by a large boat or a small boat. The size of the quota does not change according to the size of the boat. It is the quota allocation which matters; it is the science which matters. 


In conclusion, I will let AFMA themselves provide the final words. As you would expect, AFMA have put out some media releases during the course of this debate. One from 31 May said: 


Quotas are set at sustainable levels using the best available science that takes broader ecosystem impacts into consideration.


Because total catch levels are strictly limited by total allowable catches not quota, the size of the boat does not matter from a sustainability perspective.


…   …   …


As always AFMA will apply strict management, monitoring and compliance powers to ensure any boat operating in the fishery is doing so sustainably.


On Monday, they put out a further statement which said:


As an independent government regulator, AFMA takes advice from Australia's and the world's best scientists to set sustainable catch limits. Total catch limits are less than 10 per cent of the fish stock, which is far more stringent than internationally accepted standards.


…   …   …


This type of fishing, midwater trawling, is one of the most selective which means the bycatch will be very low. AFMA works closely with fishers to minimise bycatch and they will be required to follow several rules to ensure wildlife isn't impacted.


The science shows that localised depletion is unlikely in this fishery but AFMA will be keeping a close eye on this issue given the concerns raised.


It says 'AFMA will be keeping a close eye on this issue' because that is what AFMA does. It is a tightly regulated industry. AFMA will often have observers on our boats. In this case, I understand, there is going to be some video monitoring of the activities. 


We had a system in place. People understood it. It provided certainty, it provided confidence, and the fishing industry could invest in the future knowing that the government would stand by it—until yesterday and until this bill came before the House this morning.


In closing, I simply say: the coalition support sustainable fisheries management and sustainable fisheries practices. All fishermen should be concerned that the powers in this bill could be used against any of them and, indeed, that they could easily be extended to further reduce access to any natural resource in the future. This legislation is just another sad example of this government caving in to the Greens. It is just another tool for the Greens and other environmental groups who campaign against our fishing industry and another example of why Australians want an election. They simply do not trust this government to get anything right.

Mr KELVIN THOMSON
 (Wills) (13:31):  Last week, I participated in a debate at the University of Melbourne where the Institute of Public Affairs spokesman attacked the Labor government as being elitist, out of touch with ordinary people, out of touch with their supporters. But today I heard Liberal Senator Abetz on the radio, attacking the bill before the House as 'populist' and a 'knee-jerk reaction' to public opinion. Well, make up your mind, guys. You cannot have it both ways. Either Labor are out of touch with what people want or we are doing what people want. In this case, it is blindingly obvious that we are indeed doing what the public wants—and what, Senator Abetz, is wrong with that?


What is wrong with doing what fishermen want us to do? What is wrong, Senator Abetz, with us listening to Colin Stephenson of Spreyton, in your home state of Tasmania, who says that stocks of Australian salmon in Bass Strait were overfished by trawlers in the 1960s and took decades to recover? What is wrong, Senator Abetz, with us listening to Burnie fishing store owner Rodney Howard, also in your home state, who said that he and other commercial operators feared for their livelihoods if the supertrawler was permitted to operate, saying, 'There will be a huge decline in game fishing because if bait isn't there, the big fish won't be either'? What is wrong, Senator Abetz, with the government listening to the 350 recreational fishermen who towed 100 boats from Devonport to Burnie in July, or the 200 cars which drove through Hobart or the 150 cars with boats attached which travelled by convoy through Launceston on the same day? Senator Abetz might not be interested in listening to the views of his Tasmanian constituents, but we are. And what is wrong with listening to the recreational anglers of Warrnambool in western Victoria, or the Warrnambool city councillors, who said there was potential for the supertrawler to take most of the food supply for fish targeted by recreational anglers in western Victoria?


In the same vein, I was intrigued to hear some of the media questioning of the government ministers yesterday along the lines of, 'Aren't you caving in to public pressure?' Are the questioners suggesting that there is something noble and honourable about thumbing your nose at public opinion? They imply and suggest that we should overlook or ignore public opinion, yet they are the first to accuse us of being out of touch and to foster cynicism about the political process and its failure to deliver what people want from it. That is fundamentally undemocratic and elitist. Frankly, governments should make a habit of caving in to public opinion. They would get elected and re-elected more often if they did.


To listen to those opposite spitting the dummy over this bill, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Declared Fishing Activities) Bill 2012, is very revealing. They cannot bear the idea of a win for people power. For them, it is a revolutionary threat to business's cosy, predictable domination of political discourse. For them it is unbearable, quite intolerable.


I want to quote at some length Tim Winton's speech to MPs here in Canberra back on 9 May, because, try as I might, I cannot improve on his words:


Think of your happiest moments, your most vivid memories. A holiday. Summer. It's always summer, isn't it? 


…   …   …


In mine I'm always standing on a beach, beside an estuary, on a jetty. Holding a fishing rod. Or a net, a mask and snorkel. Hunting and gathering is in my blood. As a boy I loved the freedom, the direct engagement with the physical world, the feeling of competence. Now, I didn't know it at the time but I'd inherited two great treasures: a cultural tradition and the living ocean that sustains it.


…   …   …


Australians are islanders. Coastal people. Almost all of us live on the edge of the world's biggest island. On the veranda of the continent. … This is what we tap into when we go on holiday now. … That yearning is deeply embedded. We still want to engage with our physical surroundings. And the thing is we can. In the developed world that's rare.


…   …   …


During my own lifetime the world's oceans have suffered a terrible decline. I've read about it. And I've seen it up close and ugly. When I lived in Greece I saw the results of oil spills, dynamite fishing, lax regulation. I've surfed in raw sewage in Indonesia and putrid medical waste in Brazil. And I've wondered: am I swimming in the future? Will my grandkids inherit a sea of … plastic? The global trends aren't great. Collapsing fisheries, dying corals, gyres of plastic the size of entire countries, catastrophic oil spills that ruin the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of fishing families and poison the food chain for decades.


He went on to say:


We all know we're pushing the ocean too hard. And the pressure to relegate marine protection—to defer it—that pressure is intense. And the balance is not in the ocean's favour. Taking a loss has become business as usual. …


We have to stop spending beyond our means. Robbing Peter to pay Paul. Otherwise we'll be the generation—the richest, most mobile and well-educated generation in Australia's history—that passes on a dud inheritance, and leaves the estate in arrears. Bequeathing a loss to a family, a community, a nation, that's a despicable thing to do. 'Kids, all this … plastic is yours. Don't spend it all at once.'


It is being claimed that this bill represents a repudiation of the science and a repudiation of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, the experts. I want to draw the attention of the House to a letter from Professor Jessica Meeuwig, Conservation Fellow of the Zoological Society of London and Director of the Centre for Marine Futures, Oceans Institute, University of Western Australia, in which she makes the following points:




Increasing the total allowable catch to 18,000 tonnes represents an unsupported 10-fold increase over previous landings. This is a significant increase from one year to the next. The calculation of this new quota assumes that the estimates of biomass are reliable. It is notable that the estimates are generally based on old information (blue mackerel in the East 2004), 
inferred from other species (jack mackerel
—
East) or actually entirely absent (jack mackerel
—W
est, 
Peruvian jack mackerel, redbait—
West). It is
 … 
l
ikely that biomass estimates … 
are much more uncertain than is currently reported


...


such assessments do not allow us to infer that the populations


will remain sustainably fished with a sudden 10-fold increase in landings as would be allowed under the new quotas.





To address concerns around localized depletion and hyperdepletion that may occur when super trawlers are active, we need to understand population structure (how do young fish recruit across the region?) and adult movements (will adults replenish depleted areas?). Yet again, our information is uncertain. Of the four species considered for exploitation, the population structure of blue mackerel is uncertain, whilst jack mackerel and redbait are believed to have eastern and western subpopulations
.


In addition no dedicated studies have been conducted on redbait, and no stock structure information is available for Peruvian jack mackerel, a species that is often assumed to behave like its cousin, the jack mackerel, despite having very different 
life history characteristics.





N
othing is known about adult movements in any of these species except that larger jack mackerel are found in deeper waters. In the event of localized depletions by the super trawler, we therefore have no evidence that these regions will be replenished by eith
er mobile adults or recruits—





M
any forage fish have been or are being overexploited; their rapid growth rates and high reproductive output are not sufficient to protect them against the sustained rates of harvest of super trawlers


... the species available to the super trawler (blue mackerel, jack mackerel, Peruvian jack mackerel and redbait) are larger, live


longer, and feed higher up the food chain than do species typically classed as forage fish


... the species potentially allocated to the super trawler show great similarity with cool water, reef-associated species already recognized as vulnerable to overexploitation


... in Western Australia.





Bycatch is a concern. In a study fur seals, interacted—





which is a polite word for 
'
killed
'
—





with over 50% of all mid-water trawl shots ... most fishing activity occurred on the shelf ... within the animals diving range... It is unclear... how fur seals would respond to a much larger net in terms of their ability to maintain orientation and exit the net, particularly given its substantially larger size.





We have a set of species that we know little about that are relatively vulnerable to overfishing based on their life history... We do know from global experience that super trawlers are incredibly efficient and can cause local depletions, from which these species may not recover quickly. We also know that super trawlers have been  problematic globally in terms of their sustainability. Opening Australian waters to a super trawler at a time when our knowledge base for this species is uncertain is risky and inconsistent with the precautionary principle.





This proposal for a super trawler is clearly an example where significant uncertainty exists in biological knowledge, both in terms of the species themselves and their unfished biomass.





She says she had the privilege of introducing the documentary 
The End of the Line
 for a showing at Parliament's theatre in 2011. At the time, she was asked
: 'H
ow is this relevant to Australia? We don't have this kind of highly industrialized super trawling here.
' 
She concludes by saying:





At a time when Australia is leading the world in marine conservation by establishing a legacy network of reserves, it seems incredibly counterproductive and short sighted to introduce more unnecessary opportunities for the overexploitation of our oceans.





There have been claims made that banning the 
super
trawler will lead to job losses. However
,
 I have been advised by the Australian Maritim
e Officers Union, Jan Thompson—
no relation
—
that the 
super
trawler is crewed by about 50 Croatian nationals.


Sea Fish has shown no interest in a collective agreement with the union, save fo
r last week saying it wanted a m
aster and chief engineer for approximately one month. Sea Fish has said the workers on the vessel are 
tec
hnically sub
contractors who do not work for wages but for a percentage of the catch. This raises questions about the applicable 'market salary rate' in the event that such workers were to apply for 457 visas, not that there
 i
s any sign that they have.


If t
he Liberal Party genuinely want
 to help these Croatian workers, they should start advocating that
,
 while the vessel works in international waters
,
 the workers should be paid the minimum rates as per the International Transport
 Workers'
 Federation 
a
greement.





I want to pay tribute to some of my colleagues who have spoken previously in this debate. I was first contacted about this issue by the 
m
ember for Corangamite, Darren Cheeseman, who explained to me the 
super
trawler proposal and the level of opposition to it coming from both environmental groups and fishermen. I was subsequently contacted by environmental groups about the issue, and wrote to Minister Ludwig about it in July. At the invitation of Julianne Bell of Protectors of Public Lands, I attended a protest rally at St Kilda Beach on what was described as Stop the Super Trawler National Day of Action
,
 on 11 August.





I
 also
 want to pay tribute to the 
m
ember for Fremantle, Melissa Parke, who prepared a private member
'
s bill to stop the 
super
trawler, which has been a wonderful catalyst for government action. In their five years here both Darren and Melissa have proved to be courageous and articulate advocates for the
 environment and animal welfare—
quite outstanding. I should also acknowledge the other 
g
overnment speakers
—
the 
m
ember for Hindmarsh, Steve Georganas, the 
m
ember for Makin, Tony Zappia, and the 
m
ember for Shortland, Jill Hall. I want their constituents and people right around Australia with a concern for the environment or animal welfare to know that they have committed and courageous 
representatives who stand
 up on these issues, both when it is fashionable and when it is not.





When you stand up and advocate the cause of ot
her living things like seals, 
dolphins or sea birds, these other living things are blissfully ignorant that you
 a
re doing it, so the political reward for your actions is often unclear and the political cost is often very clear.


But
,
 in acknowledging the work 
both of 
the 
Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities and of 
the 
m
ember for Fremantle, the 
m
ember for Corangamite, the 
m
ember for Hindmarsh, the 
m
ember for Makin
 and
 the 
m
ember for Shortland,


these colleagues 
who have
 helped bring about this 
b
ill, I want to return to some
 words from Tim Winton:





When your grandkids ask you what you did as a member of parliament some of them, I'll admit, will be entranced by your stories of tax reform. Stands to reason. They'll love the story about
 that parliamentary committee. 
But think of the day when you help your granddaughter reel in her first flathead, the day you take your nephew to the aquarium, the morning you take your grandkids snorkelling in a marine sanctuary and their eyes are out on sticks. There's always that quiet moment you get on the way home. After they've seen that turtle, those dolphins, the rockpool full of life. That'll be when you let it slip. Offhand. You know, real casual, about what you did when you were in parliament. You helped save Australia's oceans.





With marine parks and with this 
b
ill,
 these members
 have helped save Australia's 
o
ceans, and whatever else 
they 
do in 
their p
arliamentary careers, 
their children and grand
children will be very much indebted to 
them 
and Australia 
will be 
a better place for 
their 
contribution to it.





The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Order! The debate is interrupted in accordance with standing order 43. The debate may be resumed at a later hour.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Declared Fishing Activities) Bill 2012</title>,BILLS,2,1
"Hunt, Greg, MP",LP,2012-09-12,"



Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (09:51):  The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Declared Fishing Activities) Bill is not about the Margiris. This bill is about unfettered and arbitrary powers that are an attack on every recreational fishing community and every family fishing operation in Australia. This bill is not about protecting fish stocks and it has nothing to with the Margiris. It has everything to do with a Trojan Horse operation that introduces a new level of ministerial power that is extraordinary, arbitrary and unfettered. We in this place are custodians of good governance and we have to deal with the issues. But this bill is the likes of which we have not previously seen. The powers are arbitrary, they are unfettered and they are plenary, and the fishing community, as well as the general community, has been sold a pup, because it has nothing to do with the supertrawler. It has everything to do with a knee-jerk reaction that will not deal with the problem but that absolutely confers unlimited executive authority on ministers, without any reference either to fact or to the ability to appeal. It confers the ability to destroy any small family fishing operation on the basis of the slightest issue of social concern raised by the Greens.


I now turn to the concerns the opposition has on three fronts with the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Declared Fishing Activities) Bill 2012, because this is the 'arbitrary ministerial powers bill'. The first of our concerns is about unlimited arbitrary ministerial powers. The second is about a chaotic process after the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities, in his previous role as minister for fisheries, invited the Margiris into Australia, when he called in October 2009 for large-scale factory fishing vessels to come into Australia. That was not us. That was not the fishing community. A paper was signed off by the minister calling for large-scale factory fishing vessels to come into this country.


So that is the sovereign risk issue, which has already seen the announcement by Seafish that 50 Australian jobs will now be terminated. The question for the government is, will they compensate the long-term unemployed who had finally found a job and who, as of today, will not have that job? Will the Prime Minister compensate the long-term unemployed as part of the 50 Australians who are now losing their jobs? This is the live cattle issue on steroids. And it is a Trojan Horse, because it is an attack on every family fishing operation and every recreational fishing community in Australia.


Let me do something a little unusual and turn to the deep and specific provisions within the bill. The operative provision is 390SD subparagraph (3)(a), which reads as follows:


(3)   The Minister must not make an interim declaration—


that is,  to cease operations, whether by recreational fishers or commercial fishers—


unless the Minister—


that is, the environment minister—


and the Fisheries Minister agree that:


and here is the critical quote:


(a)   there is uncertainty about the environmental, social or economic impacts of the fishing activity.


We spoke with the departmental officials and with officials from the two ministers' offices and asked, what is the definition of 'social uncertainty'? We asked that because this is a new level. To be fair, it was not for them to determine that. But nobody can define what social uncertainty means in the context of this act. And it is not just uncertainty; it is uncertainty in the mind of the minister. There are a number of ministers who live in a permanent state of uncertainty. But this is a new test: 'uncertainty in the mind of the minister'. Social uncertainty has been introduced into the environment act of Australia as the test for an arbitrary, plenary power which is unfettered in its application and can be implemented without notice, without pause, without evidence but simply on the basis of uncertainty.


That can be done, whether it is raised through a Twitter troll or whether it is raised in a letter from the Greens to the minister. There are no conditions, there are no limits, there are no barriers. But we thought long and hard about a definition of social uncertainty, and finally we realised that social uncertainty is when Kevin walks into a room where Julia is present. And that is precisely what happened on the weekend. Kevin walked into Julia's room and put in place social uncertainty by saying he would support the member for Fremantle's bill. And, voila! Two days later, the government reversed the position it had supported through three previous decisions. The government reversed the decision on the basis of social uncertainty, and now they bring in the legislation to justify that definition of social uncertainty.


So we now have an exemplar of the Ruddism that has infected the government: whenever the smallest issue is raised by opponents of fishing or of anything else, we have a decision which is immediate and which has human impacts in the form of 50 lost jobs as announced by Seafish—and those are just the Australian jobs that are to be lost. The vast bulk of those who will lose their jobs, I am advised, are the long-term unemployed out of Devonport. So I would ask the government—the Prime Minister, the minister for the environment and the minister for fisheries—to go to Devonport and meet those people who will lose their jobs as a consequence of this decision.


Let us go further into this notion of social uncertainty. The Environment Act is now guided by a new principle: social uncertainty. That means whatever the minister wants it to mean. 'Social uncertainty' means whatever the minister wants it to mean. A minister can now exercise powers that will close down and destroy a family fishing operation, which can close a recreational fishing ground, on no basis—simply that there is uncertainty. There is no requirement of proof of damage. There is no evidence required of fact. There is no evidence required of anything. It is a Trojan Horse to give the minister unfettered, arbitrary powers to be exercised without notice to the detriment of any fishing community.


I understand that people were genuinely and legitimately concerned about the issue of overfishing—but this bill does not address the quota at all. The quota today will be exactly the same as the quota of yesterday. But what has happened is that there is a new level of uncertainty. Let me give an example of this arbitrary power in the eyes of the fishing community. The Australian Marine Alliance have today issued a statement. Their headline is 'sustainable environmental economic'. They are supporting Australia's commercial and recreational sectors. They say:


We make no excuses for arguing that if this bill passes we will see dozens if not hundreds of businesses exit the industry. In our view the answer is not to give the department of the environment in Canberra greater control over fisheries management but rather for the fisheries portfolio to secure a competent minister who can effectively fulfil their duties as minister for fisheries. As an example, if this bill passes, it will give the department of the environment in Canberra the authority to stop recreational anglers all the way down the east coast from fishing for Bluefin tuna in Commonwealth waters.


That is a quote from the Australian Marine Alliance.


But let us take this further and go to the actual definition of 'uncertainty'—because there is no definition of 'social uncertainty'; it means whatever the minister wants it to mean. The government have created their own problem by inviting the Margiris in. The minister invited the Margiris in in October 2009 with the reference and the call for large-scale factory fishing vessels. They are not our words, but words from AFMA, in a paper signed off by the then minister for fisheries, the now Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities. They invited, they argued for, they created the problem, and now they are creating arbitrary powers.


But it goes further than that, because you then ask: how wide is the range of activities to which the social uncertainty clause can apply? I will turn to paragraph 2 of section 390SD 'Interim declaration' in the bill before us today. It reads:


(2)   When making an interim declaration, the Minister may identify a fishing activity by reference to all or any of the following:


(a) a method of fishing;


(b) a type of vessel used for fishing;


(c) a method of processing, carrying or transhipping of fish that have been taken;


(d) an area of waters or of seabed.


So let us understand this: we have an arbitrary power, an unfettered power, an absolute power, which can be used without any just cause, which is non-renewable, which cannot be questioned, and which applies to anything anywhere. So the first part is the power and the second part, as contained in paragraph 2, is the scope and the extent of that power. It says 'an area of waters or of seabed'—any part of Australia, any fishing activity, anywhere at any time. This is not about the fact that there has been damage; there only needs to be social uncertainty.


So we now have the environment act being run on the basis of social uncertainty—giving arbitrary powers for application anywhere, anytime, to anyone. If you are a recreational fisher you might have had legitimate and understandable concerns about the Margiris. I had raised those concerns myself in calling for an independent scientific panel, and there was a genuinely independent scientific panel. I was surprised by the result. The independent scientific panel came down some weeks ago. It was clear and categorical and I had called for it. I accept that.


But when we look at this, the government's response is the same as it was for live cattle. It is the same as it was for the home insulation program. It is the same as Green Loans and Green Start. It is this example—again and again—of a position taken on the basis of any small public campaign, but with no concern whatsoever for the human consequences. Today, of all of the legislation we have seen in the last nearly five years, this is the most arbitrary, most extreme and most unfettered. It is quite extraordinary.


I turn again to the words of the Australian Marine Alliance, which refers to this bill: 'The more immediate concern is the bill to be debated in parliament today that has been hastily drafted by Minister Burke and that will give the minister for the environment and his department almost unfettered authority over all forms of fishing.' So this is a new arbitrary power on the basis of social uncertainty. This government is defined by social uncertainty. The vast majority of ministers live in a permanent haze of social uncertainty, and we have just enshrined that as the basis for the destruction of the livelihoods of small fishers.


This bill has nothing to do with the Margiris, about which people have genuine concerns and for which we have a solution. It has everything to do with a rank extension of authority in an arbitrary and unfettered capacity over the livelihoods and the recreational habits of Australian fishers everywhere. That brings to Australia a broader risk. We heard much from government ministers last week about sovereign risk. This bill introduces sovereign risk on a grand scale in Australia. This bill came after three consecutive decisions from the government.


In October 2009 the fisheries minister at the time called for large-scale factory freezer vessels. The small pelagic fisheries harvest strategy released by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, signed off by the minister, revised in October 2009, refers to the 'economies of scale in the fishery and the most efficient way to fish may include large scale factory freezer vessels'. The Margiris has been in play for seven years and this was a green light. This strategy was a green light to say 'come on down' to Australia. We did not invite the Margiris, Minister Burke invited the Margiris. That is what large-scale factory freezer vessel means. The Margiris is the definition. It is the response. It is the outcome of the October 2009 decision to release this strategy.


Seafish, an Australian company, then worked with the government. At no point was there an indication, according to the owners, that they were outside of the law, or that they were even outside of the policy. They operated on the advice, on the belief, on the understanding that the government wanted them here.


What is the result? Seafish director Gerry Geen—and let's start with the human consequences—said today that unfortunately the decision would mean that 50 Australians, including the 45 people engaged in Devonport, would lose their jobs. He went on to say:


It is going to be hard to have to tell those employees, some of them who were long-term unemployed, that we no longer have a job for them.


So there is a direct, real human consequences to Australia's long-term unemployed people. He continued:


It seems that after we have met every rule, regulation and request made of us, after years of working with the relevant authorities, that in the end the government reacted to the size of the Abel Tasman and not the size of the quota and the science that supports it.


I want to emphasise a point about sovereign risk. This decision sends an awful message to all potential investors in Australia to be very, very afraid. It shows that this government will change the rules after you are committed to a venture, putting at risk the investment, jobs and all the hard work of many people over many years. Then, when you have met all the new rules and requests, they can still just shut you down. That is sovereign risk. Sovereign risk is where people rely on the word and the law and they act, to their detriment but to the benefit of the country, on the basis of the word and the law and of the undertakings of ministers. Then, the government takes it away with no warning, with no ability to adapt and with no concern.


This is a very serious moment in Australia's parliament. We had the live cattle decision, which by the way is wreaking havoc right now in Indigenous communities across Queensland and the Northern Territory, according to meetings I have had with their representatives in the last few weeks. Those communities of Indigenous pastoralists and Indigenous cattlemen and women still are being affected by the live cattle decision, because of the ramifications in Indonesia, which has cut the quota to Australia. The government will say, 'Gosh, it is just a coincidence they cut the quota to Australia after we slashed their protein in half and after we made an arbitrary decision.' It is not a coincidence. It is a direct response and anybody saying otherwise is in denial.


That was the live cattle decision, but this is worse because these unemployed people had been taken on board. They had been employed and the firm had acted on the basis of following every law. And the ministers encouraged them. How can anybody ever again trust this government? How can anybody ever again do business with this government? How can any firm ever again invest with confidence in Australia? Whether it is the carbon tax, the mining tax, the home insulation program, Green Loans, Green Start or live cattle or whether it is this instance, where there is arbitrary executive power over our fisheries, the rules change overnight on the basis of an email. That is the truth of it and that is the problem. That is why this government is no longer fit for office.


They have made Australia an international laughing stock in terms of sovereign risk. We have seen that in our plummet down the World Economic Forum lists in terms of reliability and wastefulness of governance. What more of a message could this government have had?


With regard to sovereign risk we see that the minister created the problem when, as fisheries minister, he called for large-scale factory freezer vessels. The ministers, both of the them, created the problem when they gave comfort, succour, aid and invitation to Seafish to bring the Margiris into Australia. We know about the discussion and the negotiations. This government invited the Margiris into Australia and then they turned around and made Australia a laughing stock. That is Ruddism. That is what has happened to the modern Labor Party. It does not matter who the leader is. There is a deep infection in the culture of a political party that no longer believes in anything.


I now turn to the issue of science. I want to deal with the statement AFMA made on their web site on the issue of the Margiris. That statement was updated on Monday of this week.


It is headed, 'Why is AFMA confident that the boat's operations would be sustainable'—this is the scientific agency—'Because', they say, 'these catch limits are strictly enforced by AFMA using high-tech systems', 'Australia's fisheries management is consistently ranked among the world's best by international experts', and:


AFMA has found no evidence that larger boats pose a higher risk to either commercial species or broader marine ecosystems when total catches are limited and the limits are enforced. This type of fishing, mid-water trawling, is one of the most selective, which means the bycatch will be very low. AFMA works closely with fishers to minimise bycatch, and they will be required to follow several rules to ensure wildlife isn't impacted …


And it concludes:


The science shows that localised depletion is unlikely in this fishery, but AFMA will be keeping a close eye on this issue, given the concerns raised.


That was Monday! And on Tuesday, the government said they were uncertain. On Monday there was an express statement on the science. But, just in case anybody missed it, other people have commented on this. Minister Ludwig said in the Senate on Thursday, 23 August:


The setting of catch limits in the small pelagic fishery are based on strong precautionary principle. Under the harvest strategy for this fishery, the catch limit is capped at a maximum of 20 per cent of the estimated available biomass …


He goes on to say:


This is a very conservative limit … Even with that cap, the current management plan sets the quota to less than 10 per cent … These stock limits are based on science and assessed by the experts.


He then went on to say, in relation to a disallowance motion on the quota for the relevant fishery:


The disallowance motion being moved by the Greens is misplaced and could harm fisheries across Australian Commonwealth waters.


…   …   …


This disallowance motion is a message that the Greens political party do not support sustainable catch limits based on science … As minister for fisheries, I will not allow the emotive politics of the Greens political party to run fisheries management policy in this country.


It could have been a work from Monty Python, given what happened, because the government then turned around and did completely the opposite.


But it is not just confined to that minister, because here is what Tony Burke said on Q&A on 3 September:


So what I have signed off on today is effectively the big vessel will have to fish with the rules so the impact it has on the environment is no more than for fishing like a small vessel.


How about that? So, in terms of the official targeting, that part has already been measured as sustainable.




The question with this one, though, is: instead of 20 boats going out to all different parts of a huge fishery that goes all the way around Queensland and South Australia, you get a different impact.



He then goes on to say, 'If there's a problem, they have to move on'—so he had a move-on provision.


So let us understand what all of this means. All of this means one thing: this decision today, perversely, means there will be not one fewer fish caught. The quota that was in place yesterday is the same today, only there will be more boats catching the same number of fish. How does that work? The government have led people to believe there would be a lesser catch of fish. That is what is actually said here. There is not. Their scientific agency does not believe there needs to be a lesser catch. The minister for fisheries does not believe there needs to be a lesser catch. The minister for the environment does not believe there needs to be a lesser catch. So, three boats, or five boats, or 20 boats can now catch exactly the same number of fish. As has been said in the media in the last 24 hours: it is not the size of the boat; it is the size of the quota that matters. And the size of the quota does not change; only that there will be more boats catching the same number of fish. So, as a matter of logic, it has reached a point of perversity. Science has been displaced.


To finish, let me deal with the Magiris. We have said that we would be willing to work with the government to amend the Fisheries Act to ensure that there are stronger move-on powers. We are happy to sit down with the government to give greater move-on powers under the Fisheries Act, and we would be happy to do that now, to walk out of this chamber and support greater move-on powers. We will be moving an amendment to that effect, and I will be moving an amendment to the effect that the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities should explain the reasons for his decision to reverse the policy that he introduced as fisheries minister in 2009 which stated that there are:


… considerable economies of scale in the fishery and the most efficient way to fish may include large-scale factory freezer vessels.


And he should explain why he invited the Magiris into Australia by promoting large-scale factory freezer vessels, and explain what actions he will take to compensate the 50 Australian workers who are losing their jobs as a consequence of this legislation. I move:


That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:


""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House calls on the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities to explain:


(1) the reasons for his decision to reverse the policy that he introduced as Fisheries Minister in October 2009 which stated: ""There are considerable economies of scale in the fishery and the most efficient way to fish may include large scale factory freezer vessels"";


(2) why he effectively invited the Margiris into Australia by promoting ‘large scale factory freezer vessels’; and


(3) what actions he will take to compensate the 50 Australian workers who are losing their jobs as a consequence of this legislation.""


However, knowing that we will also move an amendment to discuss the move-on provisions in the Fisheries Act immediately, we are happy to sit down with the government to provide a way forward for better protection on the Magiris today, this moment, this second—no problem. We will look for stronger actions. This bill keeps the same number of fish being caught. This bill creates sovereign risk. This bill, above all else, gives unlimited, arbitrary powers, an executive blank cheque, to the minister on the basis of social uncertainty. As of today we have a new standard in Australian legislative activity. Social uncertainty is the basis for executive absolute unlimited authority and that is why we oppose the bill.

"Cheeseman, Darren, MP",ALP,2012-09-12,"



Mr CHEESEMAN
 (Corangamite) (10:22):  I rise today to speak in favour of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Declared Fishing Activities) Bill 2012. This is in response to the super- trawler, the vessel that was once known as the Magiris and now referred to as the Abel Tasman, seeking to fish in Australian waters.


To put some facts on the table with respect to this particular vessel, it is 120 metres long, and it weighs close to some 10,000 tonnes. At 600 metres the super-trawler's fishing net is 97 metres longer than the arch of the Sydney Harbour Bridge. It has the capacity to store 6,000 tonnes of fish and can process 250 tonnes of fish a day. The company, Seafish Tasmania, has sought to fish 18,500 tonnes of blue mackerel, jack mackerel and redbait in the Commonwealth small pelagic fishery. This is, as I understand, about the half the quota allowed for these fisheries.


Once news broke that this particular vessel was seeking to come to Australian waters to fish in the small pelagic fishery Australians, quite rightly, became deeply concerned with the prospect of this particular vessel.


It became clear that the Margiris had, rightly or wrongly, developed a reputation elsewhere that had led to damage being done to fisheries in Europe and in Africa, and Australians became concerned. They became concerned from two perspectives. Recreational fishers were concerned that this vessel, with its capacity, would take substantial volumes of these species in areas where larger fish would pursue these smaller species as food. I became aware that tuna fishermen in Victoria were concerned that the Margiris had the potential to take a huge volume of these small species, which of course tuna target. Also, many Australians interested in marine conservation were concerned about the potential for bycatch—turtles, seals, dolphins and the like—being caught up and drowned in large numbers. This issue was raised with me.


The Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, the responsible piece of legislation that sets out governance around these matters, is some 20 years old, and it was written at a time when it was not envisaged that these super-trawlers would come to Australia. It is quite appropriate for us to take the opportunity to look at the laws and ensure that they do reflect the views of modern Australia. As a consequence, the government has taken the necessary steps.


It became quite clear through the course of the public discourse on this matter that we were not clear on the science, we were not clear on the possible impact that a super-trawler—the second-largest fishing vessel on this planet—would have on Australia's fishery. We were clear, the science had been done, with respect to smaller vessels—the more traditional fishing vessels that are based in Australia.—but we have not seen a super-trawler in Australian waters, and we are unsure of the consequences. Quite rightly, we need to go away and review the science to try to determine what the impact of super-trawling in Australia might be. It is very important that we undertake that research.


My electorate of Corangamite is nestled between Geelong and south-west Victoria. We have many communities that enjoy recreational fishing. There is the port of Queenscliff, of course, which is a historic fishing port. The Department of Primary Industries in Victoria has a marine management centre there, a research institute, with a lot of marine scientists providing advice to the Victorian government about the Victorian fishery. With the state government cuts I understand some 15 scientists from there will unfortunately be losing their jobs. But we have other fishing communities and ports. We have Apollo Bay, home to crayfisherman and recreational fishers, and many other communities that enjoy recreational fishing.


I would particularly like to take the opportunity to acknowledge Garry Kerr, who is a rec fisherman and owns a fishing tackle shop in Anglesea, for his representations to me on this issue. He was particularly concerned about the consequences of a supertrawler and what it might mean for the tuna that he likes to target himself and that many of the clients of his fishing tackle shop like to tackle.


So I think the approach adopted by the government is the right one. I think the concern raised by the community from a broad and diverse perspective, from recreational fisherman on one hand through to environmentalists and conservationists on the other, very much demonstrates that the legislative arrangements and the science that is in place at this stage are not adequate to give confidence and comfort to the environment minister, to the fisheries minister and indeed to the Australian community as to the consequence of supertrawlers and—what they might mean for our fishery and what they might mean in terms of bycatch—seals, dolphins, penguins or the like.


It is true that Australia has a world-class reputation for fisheries management. I think it is true to say that we have some of the best-managed fisheries on this planet. If we look at examples overseas, whether in Europe, North America, South America or Africa, we can find many examples where fisheries have not been appropriately managed, which has led to very substantial localised depletion. Because we wish to exploit our fisheries in Australia—as we should—but also have proper oversight and proper management plans, based on science, we will be able to continue to manage our fisheries in a way that can provide a commercial return, that can feed our society and that can provide an export market for us in a way that is sustainable. The Margiris—or the Abel Tasman, or any other name the vessel may go by—very much calls into question the potential viability of this fishery. We do not know the consequences. Until the science is undertaken, as a precautionary measure we should not allow this particular vessel, or vessels of this size and scope, to continue to fish.


It is quite extraordinary that the recreational fishermen and the environment groups are at one on this. They have not historically been close. Often, in fact, they have been at loggerheads. I think when you have such diverse groups with diverse views coming together and lobbying members of parliament across the parliamentary spectrum, it is clear that the government needs to act—and indeed we did act.


But it is also very disappointing that politics are being played by the Liberal Party on this, and by the National Party. It is very clear that they do support super-trawler fishing in Australian waters, without the science being undertaken. Indeed, if they were in government, it is true and fair to say that this particular vessel—and other vessels of this nature—would be able to fish in Australian waters without the science being undertaken. Not only would this do great harm and damage to the fishery and create concern amongst environmentalists and conservationists but also, importantly, it would harm recreational fishermen who enjoy getting out on the water and targeting species such as tuna and the like. We will deal with those in due course.


The steps undertaken by both the ministers with respect to vessels of this nature are the right approach. It is the approach that I support and that Labor backbenchers have been lobbying for. I look forward to seeing this legislation pass. I am sure the Liberal Party and the Nationals will vote this down. I am confident that will happen. We will get to see their true colours on this matter. I am sure—

I thank all of those who have emailed me and made representations to my office on this.

"Cobb, John, MP",Nats,2012-09-12,"



Mr JOHN COBB
 (Calare) (10:37):  I rise to speak about the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Declared Fishing Activities) Bill 2012 proposed by the government. I wish I did not have to. Even though Australia has come to expect no bounds to the incompetence and knee-jerk overreaction of this government I do find myself despairing at this latest effort by them to undermine business in this country and at the scale of the sovereign risk it is subjecting its hard-working people to.


This is not just about foreign investment, this is about domestic investment. Let us be clear. This government's decision to shut down the fishing trawler is not based on science but simply on a massive sell-out of industry as they trawl for green votes. This decision is using a sledgehammer to crack a nut—a peanut. Instead of providing conditions for the ship's operation so that it would have no more a footprint on the environment than one of the five smaller boats it could have replaced, the minister is moving to deliver himself sweeping new powers that will enable him to shut down the fishing industry and destroy statutory fishing rights simply on the back of any media campaign, no matter how misinformed.


This bill allows the government to shut down any commercial or recreational fishing activity for 24 months if there is any level of uncertainty about environmental, social or economic impact of the fishing industry. As the old saying goes, there is nothing certain in life except death and taxes—and under this government that is a heck of a lot of uncertainty and a heck of a lot of taxes. There is always uncertainty, so there will always be an excuse to shut down the fishing industry. This will make the statutory fishing rights of our hard-working fishermen worthless and let me tell you that they are hard working.


This bill gives the minister unlimited powers and threatens every Australian commercial fishing operation at a virtual whim. In an attempt to address community concerns about the Margiris, the minister has gone to the extreme, by giving himself unlimited powers, which will impact on every family fishing boat around the country. The new powers will allow the minister to shut down industry for two years whenever there is social—in other words, perceived—uncertainty over the science, no matter how uniformed. Instead of ensuring conditions that could have ensured that the larger boat had no greater footprint than five smaller boats, this minister has just decided to shut down the industry for two years and leave it to another minster with a backbone to solve the issue.


Minister Ludwig has again been used as a doormat by the rest of the Labor Party to pander to the Greens—and as one of the better ones, Minister Ferguson, you know I am telling the truth. Rollover Joe is still reeling from the last time the government rolled him and made him shut down live exports completely devastating the industry and telling our major trading partners around the world that there is too much sovereign risk to trade with Australia and that they should take their business elsewhere. However, this time it is not just foreigners; it is Australian investors who are being told, 'Bad luck.'


Minister Burke was the Minister for Agriculture, when the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, in his portfolio—and, I understand, Minister Burke himself—approved the Small Pelagic Fisher Harvest Strategy. He did that as the Minister for Agriculture and now, as the Minister for the Environment, he is acting as someone who is totally unconcerned and uncaring about his previous strategies—basically inviting a ship of this type to come to Australia and provide efficiencies and now has changed his mind. What can you say? As the member for Flinders has already pointed out, this strategy—approved by Minister Burke in his previous portfolio as the Minister for Agriculture—clearly states on page two: 'There are considerable economies of scale in the fishery and the most efficient way to fish may include large-scale factory vessels.' I wonder what those opposite think of that when it comes to the legislation we are currently debating. That is a straight-out invitation to bring exactly that sort of ship here to Australia. What another Labor stuff-up! Minister Burke, as minister for agriculture, in fact appointed all the current board of AFMA—the authority he says he now cannot trust.


Minister Burke clearly invited this boat to Australia and has now changed his mind. Australian investors, with clear signals from Minister Burke on this, invested time and effort and significant resources to bring this boat to Australia. Over years, they complied with every requirement. This Australian company employed 50 Australian staff to drive the business. Seafish Australia has now been put in the terrible position of having to tell these staff they are no longer needed. Like the live exports debacle, this government has again sent a signal to all the countries of the world—and, in this case, the domestic investors in Australia, all our major trading partners and businesses large and small—that it is way too risky to do business in this country and that this government cannot be trusted. If Minister Burke had an ounce of gumption, an ounce of honesty, he would resign if he does not trust the authority he was responsible for—that he appointed, that he approved and that he agreed with. This is the authority he appointed, he approved and he agreed with. 


Australia's fisheries are independently benchmarked and recognised as one of the most sustainable in the world. The management strategies are developed from sound science and extensive consultation with a broad range of stakeholders. The coalition has every reason to have confidence in the quota and management conditions applied to the small pelagic fishery.


This decision will open a Pandora's box. This is a major precedent that opens the door to other natural resources. Will the minister seek the same sweeping new powers to be applied across other natural resource sectors? Mining could be stopped for two years because of a public campaign suggesting that a new mining method which may actually reduce the impact on the environment creates too much public uncertainty as to its actual impact. The irrigation sector could be shut down for two years while they finalise the Murray-Darling Basin Plan because there is community concern about the impact on the basin. Even worse, Minister Burke may shut down the farming sector for two years because of perceived social uncertainty about the impact of new farming methods aimed at improving soil management because of perceived uncertainty. This will not only shut down resource sectors but also stagnate research and development that would lessen the environmental impact and increase public uncertainty.


To use an analogy, with recreational fishing, this government is saying that not only do you have a bag limit but you are also not allowed to go fishing with your mates and the industry cannot conduct fishing competitions, as the collective impact could be too great. The recreational fishermen are also on this minister's hit list already with the world's largest national marine park network not based on science, and now the minister is saying he can shut down any fishing activity if there is uncertainty, regardless of the science. This has really undermined the good work of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority and their dedicated staff, who are committed to sustainable management of the fisheries within government policy. The key here is that they implement government policy, policy which was overseen for three years by Minister Burke—this very same minister—when he was minister of the agricultural portfolio. And he now says that AFMA cannot be trusted.


This is so like the live exports issue. This is groundhog day for this government. The ineptitude of this government never ceases to amaze me and never ceases to amaze the Australian people. But, when it comes to the agricultural, fisheries and forestry portfolio, you can add to that a distinct element of, 'I couldn't care less', and you begin to understand why the live export issue escalated to such an incredible crisis. I never thought I would say this, but I am not sure that this decision by Labor, this legislation that they are putting forward now, is not worse than their actions in relation to the live cattle trade.


That was one of the worst decisions ever made—and certainly the worst business decision made by a government up to this time. It set back international efforts for animal welfare, and the sovereign risk has alarmed our trading partners. Indonesia wanted to work with Australia, and publicly said so, to solve that issue and they picked up the paper and read that they had been told that they were no longer needed at that time and that they would have to wait for cattle because they were not getting them.


While this government—and every government—have struggled to deal with Aboriginal welfare issues, particularly in Northern Australia, they also crushed the livelihoods of tens of thousands of people both directly and indirectly affected by that government decision. The effect of that decision on the North—which at the time I thought could never be worsened, but I am not sure that it has not been now—on 82 Indigenous stations and a community of some 17,000 depending on this trade, was enormous. These people do not want welfare; they just want to get on with their lives. And I can assure you that the fishing industry does not want welfare; they want to get on with their lives.


This government are far more worried about the lefties within their party room than they are about our relationships with our neighbours and with business and whether or not Australia is able to proceed domestically, let alone whether in a foreign sense we can get investment in our country and investment in our businesses and be able to create jobs.


The government is seeking a new arbitrary power unfettered and with no chance of review for the decisions. The government invited the ship into Australia and has now backflipped on its own decision. Minister Burke should resign—in any moral situation you care to name. He oversaw the department that invited the boat to this country and is now saying that the decision was wrong. It was a decision that only last week, in fact I would say as recently as Monday, he agreed with.


The implications of this bill for our international reputation are catastrophic. The implications in terms of sovereign risk are catastrophic and enormous. I support the amendment by the member for Flinders and I implore the parliament to get behind it and bring common sense back into this debate. This is without doubt just about the worst decision I have ever seen been put to be ratified by the Australian parliament. The issues of principle here are just gigantic. You tell people what the rules are and invite them to participate and then, at a whim, you say, 'I have changed my mind.' Forget about the investment, the years for compliance, the fact that we set our own quotas and forget about the fact that we agreed with the authority we appointed, because we now suddenly do not think they are good enough. Why? There must be a social issue somewhere. I think it is a disgrace and a shame that we are debating this here today.

"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2012-09-12,"



Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh) (10:51):  I think it is a disgrace and a shame that the opposition is not supporting this bill, that they are not supporting what is so clearly in line with community expectations and clearly in sync with community concerns—that is, to get answers to some questions on the impact of the second-largest and biggest fishing vessel on the planet to see what impact it would have on our environment, our fisheries and our industry. The public wants answers to questions concerning the operation of this supertrawler in Australian waters. How much will it deplete our waters of commercial fishing? How much will it deplete our waters of protected fish, mammals and even birds? How much would it deprive our long-term fishery operations and our recreational fishermen and women of their livelihoods and pursuits?


The people of my electorate want to know whether this or any other supertrawler can really operate within fishery and environmental rules, as they currently exist, and not wreak environmental destruction on our marine environment. That is all they want to know. I think it is a very legitimate question and the public have every right to an answer to that question. It is also clear that many members of the public, unlike the Abbott coalition, simply do not believe it is possible. Concerns have been raised on a continual basis for over a month. They have been expressed through multiple telephone calls to my office, many emails, letters in the media, communications with my electorate office and those of many other MPs. The minister also has received many communications on the matter. A substantial proportion of the public are clearly saying that they do not believe that a vessel with such a large processing and freezer capacity and that has the potential to pull out and process so much of the ocean's harvest on a continual basis—that is, within one geographic area in one fishing expedition without returning to port—can operate without a negative impact on the area in which they fish.


The minister has made it clear that this proposed event—the expedition of a supertrawler with such capacity—is unprecedented in Australian waters. It is clear that the proposal to have such as vessel operating in Australian waters, processing and freezing on board substantially larger volumes of catch in any one fishing expedition, is unprecedented. Fishing in this manner produces what people refer to as bycatch, the unintended catching of non-target fish. Some of the things caught by trawlers are protected mammals. The seals, dolphins and a whole range of other things—and of course the food on which they rely—are protected by Australian law. A sustained and concentrated fishing exercise would surely increase the incidence of bycatch—or do those opposite suggest the contrary, as we are hearing?


What devastation would be caused by substantially increased and geographically concentrated trawling on these protected species? That is one of the questions that cannot be answered. The question is new, as is the capacity of any super-trawler to fish in such a sustained and geographically concentrated way. How can the government be content with a guess or a hope, as those opposite are saying, that environmental law will continue to be observed and that the unintended consequences of said activity on such a large, continual and potentially concentrated basis will not damage those species we are required by law to protect?


We cannot give the assurances asked of us by the public and demanded by the law. The numbers and the impact of such an event are, as I have said, absolutely unprecedented. Uncertainty remains, despite the best efforts of those experts to whom these questions have been put. I believe the public have a right to have their questions answered. It is the public's fishery; it does not belong to any one person or any one trawler or any one industry. The public's environmental assets and their sustainability are key here.


I support the minister's decision to amend the legislative framework that will enable all these questions to be put and to seriously be investigated and enable answers to be given to all those who seek them. This government has only recently announced the creation of the world's largest system of marine reserves. The sustainability of our fisheries and the protection of our wonderful and unique environmental assets is clearly a very substantial priority of this government. We are delivering improved systems of protected areas, delivering sustainable and therefore better fisheries going forward, which is good for the fishing industry and good for the protection of our threatened world.


So it is totally logical that we here on this side of the House—the Labor Party, the one party in this place with a logical approach to sustainability of environmental, social and economic needs—would exercise care and due diligence when it comes to assessing the potential of a vessel that is the second-biggest fishing vessel on the planet and which has sailed over the horizon and looked to fish in our waters.


Fundamentally, this is a new situation being faced by our fisheries, our fishing industry and a marine environment created potentially by a very new fishing tool. We have not seen this tool being used before in our waters—Australian waters, not waters overseas or somewhere else. It is unprecedented. Naturally there is insufficient data as to the impacts. The hypotheses are untested, so suggestions as to what may be done—or what outcomes are most likely—simply cannot be relied on by those with a legal responsibility to ensure, as best they can, that the consequences most of us fear are never realised.


Since the minister announced his decision to seek changes to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, which will give him time to seek the conclusive answers to these questions, we have heard others in this and the other place make a number of points in the media. One party launched into an electronic media campaign announcing that they have delivered a great outcome in stopping the super-trawler from ever operating in Australian waters—and I have to tell you, nothing could be further from the truth. The super-trawler has not yet been stopped from going to sea and potentially wreaking havoc on protected mammals and their environments in our waters. That party should focus on results for a change and leave the multimedia mania for another time. I suggest that they focus on delivering their votes to successfully amend this law before they divert their attentions to prematurely announcing any achievement or bathing in greatness.


The Liberals, from what we have heard today, will be opposing the bill. There is a very real possibility that this amendment will not get the approval of the parliament and that the supertrawler will set sail in the months to come. From what we have heard today from the Liberal and National parties I suspect that they will say no—as they do to everything we bring before the House. We have heard a continuous echo—no, no, no, no, no—from the opposition. And we are hearing it again here today—to a bill to give the Australian public the answers they are seeking. What do we hear from the opposition once again? 'No.'


The shadow Treasurer was in the chamber last night speaking in favour of government legislation. He was devastated. I almost felt sorry for him because he was doing something his leadership team appears to have vowed never to do. He could hardly talk—which, for Joe, has to be evidence of acute psychological trauma. He was beside himself, unable to believe that the Liberal and National parties were actually going to vote with the government. They never intended to, irrespective of the merits of the cause. And so too here we can only expect the negativity already coming from the opposition.


I do not recall the last time the opposition voted in favour of enhancing environmental protections on land or at sea. They are against marine reserves. They are against the security of national parks. They are against doing a proper job of restoring the health of the Murray-Darling Basin and the River Murray's Lower Lakes and Coorong. They just hate the idea. They are against investment in school infrastructure. They are against investment in educational outcomes. Their party is against the NDIS. They are against the scientific process itself, and its conclusions—the well established and widely acknowledged consensus in the areas of climate and ecology. So we can only expect the opposition to vote against the amendment in this place and, quite possibly, do whatever it can to see that supertrawler set out to trawl our seas. We can only expect the opposition to unnecessarily and clumsily box itself in again to a position of ignoring the scientific questions, depriving itself of the means to improve its decision making, operating on the basis of spite and wilful opposition and, as a consequence, putting itself at odds with the will of the Australian public.


As I said earlier, I have not seen another bill in this place that is so clearly in line with community expectations and so clearly in sync with community concerns. The public wants answers to these questions. We need this amendment to seek those answers. We are all obliged to support the amendment because it is very important. All of us have heard from constituents in our electorates who are in support of ensuring that we get those answers. The Abel Tasman is the second biggest fishing vessel on the planet. I am pleased that people will not be rushed into decisions about it operating in our waters. The science behind current quotas is sound. However, the science behind the long-term effects of a vessel of this nature, of this size, are not. We are taking a cautious approach to this, prohibiting an activity while giving our fisheries managers and our environmental assessors the opportunity to give it proper consideration and get those answers that the public has been asking for. As I said, the public deserve those answers. We are adding the means by which such vessels can be assessed before any operations take place. We need a proper assessment and, if it is found to be unacceptable and threatening to our precious marine resources or to protected species, then the appropriate management responses would be implemented.


The government has introduced this legislation because there are unanswered questions. It is our duty as members of this parliament to seek answers to those questions and ensure that the public are satisfied. After all, all of us have been put here by the public. I have never seen another issue that has created such a great amount of correspondence to my office—continuous emails and phone calls from people who are concerned about having the world's second largest fishing vessel fishing in our waters. This bill will allow the government to seek out those answers and ensure that all the environmental impacts are known and we have all the information at our fingertips before any vessel like this is allowed to go out fishing in our waters.


The community need to be assured that the environmental controls in place are reflective of the expectations of the community. The expert panel will be able to assess the science to answer those very, very important questions. I am very pleased about this. I congratulate Minister Burke for acting on this after concerns were raised with him. I wrote many emails and letters to him on behalf of many constituents in my electorate over the last month. I am very pleased that he has taken that into account and ensured that he gets those answers for the thousands and thousands of constituents all around Australia who have been contacting our offices—and not just on this side; I am sure they are contacting people on the other side as well.


I am very pleased that this amendment bill has come to this House today to allow the government to seek those very important answers that will tell us what impact the world's second largest fishing vessel will have on our environment. As I said, this is a very important bill and I am very disappointed that the opposition is not supporting it—something which is so clearly in line with public perceptions and public views. I would encourage them all to rethink their position on this, to rethink what the public wants, to rethink what their constituents have been telling them and to vote in line with the Australian public, who put us in this place. I commend the bill to the House.

"Entsch, Warren, MP",LP,2012-09-12,"



Mr ENTSCH
 (Leichhardt—Chief Opposition Whip) (11:06):  I am somewhat taken aback by the contribution of my good friend the member for Hindmarsh. He states that the size of the catch and other issues have been raised and that there needs to be further science on the decision in relation to this large vessel that is currently moored at a port in South Australia. I find that unbelievable. Obviously, his minister is not communicating to him in any shape or form.


It was in 2009 that the minister made the statement that formally invited these people to come to Australia. They accepted that invitation. In the years since then they have gone through, backwards and forwards, working out the science, arguing on the arrangements that needed to happen. The arrangements had been totally concluded; why else would they have left their home port and steamed all the way to Australia if they were not of the understanding that they had that support from the Australian government? They were down here to catch fish and had actually been allocated a quota of some 18,000 tonnes. So there was no clandestine arrangement. The science had been done. On websites even as late as yesterday the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, AFMA, was defending the science, arguing that it was totally appropriate for this to occur. I understand that the quota was approved by the government's own caucus only yesterday: 'No problems whatsoever; let's make it all happen!' The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has continually defended his decision as being based on science. The hypocrisy in this whole debate has been second to none.


I am one of those who have been defending the fishing industry—all aspects of the fishing industry—for many years. I have seen rights being stripped away. I have seen opportunities for commercial, sporting and recreational fishing being continually reduced. I have seen that reduction used as a basis to determine that fishing is not sustainable and for taking away those rights completely. All of this has not been based on science. There has been no scientific evidence to back robbing these small Australian family businesses of their opportunity to continue to make a living. Many of these businesses are intergenerational; they have been there for many years. AFMA, for example, has continually argued that because of its world-class management fishing was totally sustainable. But this minister and this government have continued to erode these rights. We have no better example of that than the current marine park initiative, through which we are seeing the closure of the Coral Sea because it is becoming a no-take zone for fishing. That initiative was not based on science. It was based on an e-mail campaign generated by an American organisation, which I refer to as a 'gan-green' organisation, called the Pew foundation. The Pew foundation is an oil and gas funded American conglomerate that decided to make itself a little bit respectable in the environment world, so it has gone about looking after the marine environment. It would not do it in its own unsustainable and totally depleted fisheries because it did not have the political courage to do it. Instead it travels around looking for the lowest hanging fruit and of course it found that here in Australia, where there is a government that is totally subservient to the Greens.


The Pew foundation has now come here with a campaign of some 400,000 computer generated spam emails, which frightened the living hell out of the government and pushed it into making a decision that has effectively destroyed even further the livelihoods of people who have been in the industry for a long time. An example of this is Bob Lamason, who owns Great Barrier Reef Tuna in Cairns. Bob used to pay $2,000 to $3,000 per vessel for licence fees in the 1990s for his six or seven boats—his maximum cost was about $20,000. For that he had a licence to catch a range of species, including 1,200 tonnes of tuna each year, which he sold into the prime Japanese market and got very good returns. Back then, there were no bycatch restrictions, no wire traces and no VMS, vessel monitoring systems, and he was allowed to cover a very wide area. Since then, through the pressure of green groups, he has been restricted to areas which in many cases are non-productive and in which he cannot catch target species. He is now paying an average of $40,000 per year for each of his four vessels, $160,000 a year, to fish and he is now permitted to catch only 600 tonnes of tuna a year. Unfortunately, because he is not allowed to fish in areas where the fish actually congregate, last year he managed to catch only 300 tonnes. So with his higher fuel costs, having to fish further out and being restricted to a five-hook limit it has been made almost impossible for him. He is one of those we are going to lose because of this minister's incompetent handling of this whole process.


As Bob has said, we are catching less than half of one per cent of the Western Pacific yellowfin and big eye tuna and fishers are paying $160,000 a year to do it. In the other two-thirds of the Western Pacific, which includes Papua New Guinea, New Caledonia and the Solomon Islands, they take 2.4 million tonnes. You can imagine how much difference to the environment will be made by the 300 tonnes we are stopping Bob from taking. But we are going to destroy the family business in the process.


When you look at this bill, you have to be very concerned. The amendments will create a new chapter 5B of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, which will enable the minister, with agreement from the minister for fisheries, to declare a fishing activity to be a 'declared fishing activity' on an interim basis if both ministers agree that 'there is uncertainty about the environmental, social or economic impacts of the fishing activity'. We are talking about the environment minister putting this bill up. But he is now dealing with social and economic activities as well, which means that he can shut down any activity in any Commonwealth controlled waters, if he has a desire to do so, for a maximum of two years in the first instance. That is absolutely outrageous. That is in spite of the fact that we have seen a huge amount of science go into this.


With regard to this vessel, I had objections. I have concerns about bringing a vessel of this size into our waters and allowing it to take 18,000 tonnes of quota in one area. I think that there should be move-on provisions. If they had put move-on provisions in this, which ensured that this vessel had to take certain amounts out of different areas so that it did not totally deplete the stocks, that would have made a sensible management decision.




Mr Baldwin:
  Good fisheries management.




Mr ENTSCH:
  Yes, good fisheries management, not policy on the run like we are seeing with this, in a government that, again, is being influenced by a an email campaign run by the Greens and GetUp!. That is what this is about. It is not about fishing management. It is about the Greens and GetUp! putting the pressure on. They got in a panic. Yesterday it was fine. Suddenly, today, we are going to stop it. They have even changed the name to the Abel Tasman. If there had been sensible amendments which said, 'We will restrict where we can fish with these vessels,' I would have been absolutely supportive. I hope that we can put something up of a similar nature so that we can actually get back to appropriate management of this vessel rather than this other nonsense.


The other reason I oppose this is that we were told that all the science was done on this—and everything I have seen suggests the science is there. There may be a few little tweaks that we can do in relation to move-on provisions, but the science is there to suggest that this is okay. I have been arguing now for many years about decisions that have been made in my area based on email campaigns and not on science. I have argued very strongly that we should be using science and sustainability as the only criteria in relation to management of fisheries. This emotional claptrap that is being directed here by organisations such as the Pew foundation should be totally disregarded for the spam that it is. But, unfortunately, this government are a captive of the Greens and these interest groups because they do not know how to make a decent decision.


We have already seen sovereign risk issues in relation to the mining resource tax. That had a huge negative impact on confident investment in this country. Have a look at the debacle that the minister for agriculture was involved in in relation to live cattle exports and the sovereign risk in that, a shocking decision that was again made by interest groups and an email and video campaign. We are seeing exactly the same thing now being applied to our fisheries. The minister should hang his head in shame.


I have another impact in my area which I would like to raise. In 1964, Vic Oke and his brother Gordon bought the Cairns saltwater baths and they converted it into an oceanarium. From that time, with their love of diving, they started up a business which was followed on by Vic's daughter Bev, who married Lyle Squire Sr, and then that business became the Cairns marine aquarium. It is now owned by a third generation—Lyle Jr and his brother Cadel. Between them they have six children, all with a strong interest. So there was a possibility that this business could go for four generations. They have been catching reef fish for aquariums and have been taking fish from the same reefs for three generations. It has been recognised as being absolutely world's best practice and totally sustainable. They have been taking the same species from the same area for three generations.


What has happened? First of all, they were shut down by green zones and moved from that area. They were paid $3.8 million in compensation to allow them to buy bigger vessels so that they could move out into the Coral Sea to operate and to set up infrastructure at a Cairns base. Now with the new Coral Sea marine reserve restrictions it is likely that out of the 16 operators that are currently working there only three will be able to continue. This is an organisation that is recognised as world's best practice. The casualties of these limits in the Coral Sea marine reserve will include line and trap fisherman, rock lobster and beche de mer fisheries, and one other aquarium operator. The main problem that these guys face now is that because there is 100 per cent cost recovery the total cost of managing this fishery, which is $300,000, will be spread over three people instead of 16, which means it will be totally unsustainable for them.


It is interesting because I was talking only a while ago to strategic projects manager Ryan Donnelly from the Cairns marine aquarium and he said to me, 'Warren, the funny thing about it is that the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority still holds us up as the poster child for the fishing industry in the Great Barrier Reef. These are the people who you would think would want to stop us from fishing on the reef. If we are forced out of the Coral Sea, the infrastructure, the boats, the buildings, our Stratford site and all our staff will have to go.'


These are the sorts of impacts that we are seeing from decisions being made because of populist calls by interest groups like Pew, GetUp! and the Greens. On the one hand, the government makes these decisions on the run without any consideration whatsoever of science. And then, on the other hand, they suddenly get the science and the vessel's operators make an absolute commitment over two years. They steam halfway around the world to be here to start the operation. There are 50 new jobs created et cetera. It needs some tweaking done, but then of course there is another campaign by another lot of interest groups and suddenly the government reneges on the deal. How good does that make us look? It is an absolute disgrace. The minister should hang his head in shame and those on the other side should be condemned for supporting this ridiculous legislation.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2012-09-12,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (11:21):  I speak in support of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Declared Fishing Activities) Bill 2012. Unlike the previous speaker, I commend the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry not only for working together through this issue but for noting the very legitimate concerns of Australians around the country and responding with this legislation. I also commend the member for Fremantle for bringing this issue forward with her intent to bring in a private member's bill. Of course, that is no longer necessary.


I note that the opposition will not be supporting this bill, which I have to say not only disappoints me but surprises me, given that this is in fact good legislation, legislation that takes a cautious approach to fisheries management in this country and an approach that at this point in time is appropriate. I note that in opposing this legislation the opposition have moved an amendment. The amendment effectively calls for reasons as to why this legislation has been brought into the House. Can I say to members opposite: if you want to know the reasons why this legislation has been brought into the House, simply read the minister's second reading speech. It is all explained there if you care to read it. It is outlined in a very clear way why this legislation is necessary and why it is responsible legislation.


Australia does indeed have a very good fisheries management record and a very good regime in place and has had so for many years. The reality is that circumstances change, and when circumstances change governments have a responsibility to respond to those changes. It has become clear that under existing legislation there is insufficient scope to deal with current fishing practices that we are seeing, including but not restricted to the use of supertrawlers such as the Margiris, now badged as the Abel Tasman. We have also seen in recent years the action taken by state and federal governments around the country to designate specific areas as marine reserves. They have done that again in recognition that changes are taking place and that, if we want to manage our fisheries properly, we need to ensure that they remain sustainable. The only way to do that is by continuous intervention, having assessed the impacts to date of what is currently happening.


Whilst the legislation is not specific to the size of fishing vessels, it does empower the minister to declare a fishing activity, which triggers a 24-month prohibition of fishing whilst an expert panel carries out a scientific investigation of the impacts of the particular fishing activity. Whilst some have argued that section 91 of the Fisheries Management Act provides the minister with additional powers under exceptional circumstances, I accept the minister's advice that that section does not provide sufficient scope to deal with issues such as that of the Margiris.


There has also been considerable debate about the scientific evidence which underpins sustainable fishing policy, and I will make some comments in respect of all of that. Firstly, there is the question about quotas. The issue of quotas has been discussed at length by several of the speakers thus far. That is one of the issues and perhaps the issue that most people focus on. It is the issue that immediately comes to mind. It is, however, not the only issue under consideration with respect to this legislation, and I will talk a little bit more about that in a moment.


The second and equally important issue is how the fish are caught and what impact the activity itself has on the marine environment. The impact of the activity needs to be managed just as much as the quota needs to be managed. For example, the impact of a very large vessel which has the ability to remain in one location for extended periods of time would likely be very different to the impact of several smaller vessels fishing in the area for short periods. These are issues which the expert panel will be asked to report on.


I will turn for a moment to the question of the Margiris, because this legislation has indeed arisen because of the application by the Margiris to fish in Australian waters. The Margiris is a 142-metre vessel weighing 9,500 tonnes. It can process over 250 tonnes of fish each day and has a cargo capacity of 6,200 tonnes. I understand it was brought to Australia by Seafish Tasmania, which has secured an 18,000-tonne quota for jack mackerel and red bait. I also understand that the Margiris will tow a net some 300 metres in length. The 18,000-tonne quota is half of the entire allowable catch for the area of coastline which extends from south-western Western Australia to Queensland—roughly from Perth to Brisbane. 


The use of supertrawlers is not new to fishing. What is interesting is that today the experience has led to trawlers being banned in several other parts of the world. I understand that that has previously been the case also with the Abel Tasman. In 1999 the Abel Tasman, then named the Atlantic Star, lost its right to fish in US waters after trading its US flag for a Dutch flag. Indeed, the vessel has an interesting history. Let me just take you through that history. Between 1991 and 1995 I understand that the vessel was named the Apollo Two. Between 1998 and 2002 the vessel was named the Siberian Enterprise. Between 1999 and 2008 it was also named the Atlantic Star, and from 2006 onwards it was named the Annelies Ilena. It then comes to Australia as the Margiris and again changes its name to the Abel Tasman.


The interesting thing about all those name changes is: why would you need to continuously change the name of the vessel if it is not to perhaps run away from a reputation that you do not want attached to the vessel? I would have thought that if the vessel was proud of its history it would retain its original name and wherever it went it would use that name—but not so. The vessel seems to change its name whenever it moves from one location to another. I have to ask the question: why does it need to do that?


Can I return to the issue of quotas. I pointed out earlier on that the area that the vessel was seeking a licence for extends roughly from Perth to Brisbane.


If most of the catch—the 18,000-tonne limit that it is seeking a licence for—were to come from one specific location, that would have a significantly different impact on the fishing stocks than if the catch came from an area evenly spread right across from Brisbane to Perth. Those are the kinds of questions and issues that the scientific panel needs to respond to before a licence should be granted. Those are the kinds of concerns that I believe are properly being raised by people across the community and by this government.


Likewise, if the vessel were to remain in one location for extended periods of time, what would it do to fishing stocks in that particular location—including the bycatch, which others have talked about—not to mention the other environmental impacts of having a large vessel like that operating from one specific point? What environmental impacts would result from all that? Again, we do not have answers to those questions. We do not have answers to those questions because we have never had in Australia a vessel of this type. There is no history to go by. There is no precedent to use in order to try and find answers to these questions, so therefore we rely on speculative assessments as to what might or might not happen if we allowed the vessel to fish under the current licence. Frankly, estimates are not good enough. We need to have more reliable information.


Interestingly, on that very issue, I understand that not long ago in New Zealand a similar experience was had in respect of a Korean supertrawler that was allowed into New Zealand waters. It turned out that, even with the very strict conditions that New Zealand applied to their licence, those conditions proved ineffective and that trawler exceeded its quota. I am unable to say what other breaches occurred, but, if the quota itself could not be monitored, then I have to question how well you can monitor each of the other conditions that are attached when a licence is issued to such a vessel.


But it is not just about quotas. Regrettably, too many of the speakers opposite have just focused on the issue of quotas. On the issue of quotas, I accept the science that has been put together by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority. My concerns are not with respect to the quotas. I understand the 18,000-tonne quota that has been sought by this vessel in Australia represents half of the total catch of that particular type of fish, and that that in turn only represents about 7½ per cent of the total fish stocks in our waters. So that is not my concern. My concern is about the impact that a single vessel of this type will have on the environment.


Speakers opposite have also talked about the 50 or so jobs that might be lost if this licence is not approved. If this ship does not catch the fish that are in the waters, other ships will. If that means that we have to license several smaller vessels, I suspect the total number of jobs created by doing that will far exceed the 50 it is suggested will be lost if we refuse the licence to this operator. In fact, it is because of its efficiencies that this large trawler is being brought in. It is in effect to save costs, and in my view that means it will reduce the number of jobs that will be created.


Recreational fishers have also raised their concerns, certainly in my state of South Australia, with respect to the intrusion of a large vessel of this type into our waters. The South Australian government and the Tasmanian government have both expressed their opposition to this vessel fishing in waters within their jurisdictions. Certainly Minister Paul Caica from South Australia has made it absolutely clear that he does not want this vessel in South Australian waters.


There are a number of other matters that are of concern with respect to this issue. The experience of large trawlers around the world leads me to be very concerned about the impact that such trawlers have. I understand that several countries have already, after having large trawlers in their waters, banned those trawlers from re-entering their waters. It is true they may not have the same fishing management guidelines and regulations in place as Australia does, but nevertheless the fact that these types of vessels are being banned in several parts of the world raises the question as to why. It is clear that we have not had a vessel like this in our waters and therefore the impacts of such a vessel are indeterminable. The scientific panel that will be put together hopefully will be able to address many of the questions that have arisen in the course of the discussion on this issue over the last few weeks and enable the government, if it decides that a licence will be issued, to at least issue the licence with appropriate conditions, which may be stricter and more enforceable than those that are being sought right now.


It is also the case, as we have seen on many other occasions, that it does not matter how good and how tight you think your regulations are; breaches of the regulations are always a possibility. It is always a possibility, even with the best of intentions, that issues such as the bycatch will also prove to be much more serious than the operators of this vessel claim they will be. This legislation simply puts into place a precautionary approach to managing an event that we have never had to manage in the past. It makes more sense to be cautious than to regret the decision after the event, when perhaps the damage has been done and cannot be undone. I commend the legislation to the House.

"Neville, Paul, MP",Nats,2012-09-12,"



Mr NEVILLE
 (Hinkler—The Nationals Deputy Whip) (11:37):  I too would like to talk on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Declared Fishing Activities) Bill 2012. I support the amendment moved by shadow minister Hunt. But let me first say that I am totally and utterly bewildered at the rank hypocrisy of the government on this issue. I have never seen the like. I really thought the live cattle export thing was one of the greatest disasters we had encountered, and in economic terms it probably is, but, on a scale of integrity, this must be close to rock bottom.


Since 2009, the government has been aware of this company. In fact, it has almost encouraged it to come to this country, to bring the Margiris here. You have statements by Mr Burke. You have statements by Minister Ludwig. You have statements by AFMA, our peak fishing authority. Not only that, but the personnel of AFMA would have been appointed by those two ministers. For heaven's sake, it has your fingerprints all over it. So the Margiris comes to Australia. It complies with all our rules and regulations. Fifty employees are nominally employed. And then we drop the axe on it. And now we have spent the debate today, starting with the member for Corangamite and going down to the last speaker, talking about and demonising the Margiris.


If you want to know where I stand, I am not a great fan of large factory vessels. I make no apology for that. But that is not the debate we are having today. The debate we are having today is about whether this company came to Australia appropriately, almost at the invitation of the government, complied with its requirements, was given a quota of 18,000 tonnes—which, by the way, I think is excessively high—and then was told to stop. And how was it told to stop?


This legislation that the government is proposing and that we intend to amend gives the minister almost unfettered powers, powers that can be used in a draconian way or in a capricious way. The definitional powers in it are just so wide that you could drive a bus through them. First, the minister has the authority to declare a fishing activity a 'declared fishing activity', so he can pick anything out, anywhere in Australia. It is not just the Margiris; this is just the start of a new regime in fish management. And then, on the very flimsiest of grounds, he can bring his powers into play on environmental, social or economic impacts. The effect of that could be devastating. Contrary to what members of the government have been saying today, we are opposing this bill not so much because of the Margiris situation, bad as that is, but because this introduces a new level into fish management—and into primary industry management, for that matter—the like of which we have never seen.


I want people to get a bit of an understanding of what a vessel like the Margiris is capable of. In Queensland we have, through a whole series of state, state-federal, federal and now federal offshore activities, a whole regime of control of the fishing industry which is, quite frankly, draconian and which has drummed countless good people out of the industry. On top of that, we have people who the member for Leichhardt spoke about this morning who are hanging on by the skin of their teeth because of what this government has done already. The longline tuna fisherman that the member for Leichhardt referred to has seen his quota go from 1,200 to 600 tonnes and, because of where he has been allowed to fish, effectively down to 300 tonnes. Let us just note that: 300 tonnes. One hourly sweep by the Margiris could catch that man's entire yearly output—one hourly sweep of the Margiris. Frightening stuff, isn't it?


I am not here to demonise the Margiris but to show you the strict nature of what fishermen have been placed under in this country without any concern for them. Some of these families of Australian fishermen, as has been pointed out today, have been there for three or four generations serving this country with quality product and being subjected to the most extraordinary rules and regulations. We had a thing called the east coast trawl plan, which reduced the number of trawlers on the Queensland coast from 750 to 500—in fact, it reduced it even more, to 460. We were told that the reef was now sustainable, 'But we need a little bit more of the area of the marine park for scientific and other purposes,' and that was to be an absolute maximum of 20 per cent. When the maps came out, was it 20 per cent? No, it was 34 per cent.


Where I live—where the Gladstone, Bundaberg, Hervey Bay and Tin Can Bay fishermen live, who use the southern part of the Barrier Reef—effectively fishermen were losing 70 per cent of their fishing area. These guys have been through hell. Some of them went and bought new trawlers, so that they could go where? To the largely unregulated Coral Sea. But, once again, Labor was ready for them. We have heard from the member for Leichhardt today how the longline tuna fishermen have been slowly squeezed out of the business. Various green groups come to me and say that the longliners really wanted to get out of the business. In the end they did want to. Why? Because the number of hooks they could use was restricted, where they could fish was restricted and how many tonnes they could catch was restricted, to the point where it was not an industry anymore. Of course they would take compensation—the poor devils had nothing left.


Then we had the effects of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park annual research plans program, which hopefully sometime in the future will be reviewed. Some people took compensation from the program, or sold their smaller vessels and got into larger vessels to go into the Coral Sea. But what did we find there? We then had about 30 trawlers owned by about 20 entities—not a lot of people at all. I know one fisherman who has a capacity of 30,000 to 50,000 tonnes in a year; I suppose there might be the capacity, with all those vessels, to take about 300,000 tonnes. But the member for Leichhardt told us today that in Papua New Guinea waters alone one million tonnes is taken; in New Caledonia waters the figure is 1.4 million tonnes. What sort of idiots are we? We are not saving the planet. We are fattening up the fish in our part of the Coral Sea for the people who can come into the international waters on the northern side and fish it out.


If any honourable members really want to see what goes on in the world, go and have a look at the Tokyo fish market. Go and see those huge igloos—like Second World War air force igloos—with the rows and rows of tuna and the auctioneer going along on a little stool and knocking down every single fish. There are rows of them, every day—tens of thousands of tonnes. Then look at what we do. Down the whole east coast of Queensland, not just in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park, we have various types of prawns, including eastern king prawns, tiger prawns and endeavour prawns. The total output of that whole strip of coastline is about 4,400 tonnes. If you add 600 tonnes of scallop meat, it is about 5,000 tonnes. The Margiris can hold in its coldroom 6,200 tonnes. The Margiris can hold in its coldroom more than the entire prawn and scallop production of Queensland in a year. I am saying that not to demonise the Margiris but to demonstrate the extent of the controls we have imposed unfairly and unnecessarily on Australian fishermen. They are ridiculously draconian, ridiculously constrictive, to the point where in our own supermarkets we are buying 72 per cent foreign fish. Here we are, the great clean, green marine environment in the South Pacific, and we cannot catch enough fresh fish for ourselves. What a ludicrous situation.


I come back to my original theme. This is draconian, capricious legislation that will not just stop with the Margiris; it will be a double-edged sword that will cut a swathe into many other areas where this government want to pander to the Pew foundation or some element of the green industry or the Greens party. It will put our fishermen in situations that might be embarrassing for the government. We have seen their grand gestures like closing down live cattle exports, like putting pink batts in roofs, and now they are closing down the Margiris for two years—but not on any grounds of science. For God's sake, they had three years to examine the science, yet now we have in the House today this rushed piece of legislation. This legislation should be tossed out but, in the event that we cannot toss it out, we will at least do our very best to amend it.

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2012-09-12,"



Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Government Whip) (11:51):  The member for Hinkler's contribution to this debate on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Declared Fishing Activities) Bill 2012 was one of the most interesting I have ever heard. He put a very strong argument for endorsing the government's legislation, yet he then turned around and said he opposes it. He argued that bad fishing practices in other parts of the world—practices which have led to the depletion of fishing stocks—are a reason for Australia to have bad fishing practices as well. It was a very confused contribution. He argued against sustainable fishing whilst, on the other hand, pointing out the problems that exist. He pointed out the Margiris's enormous capacity—6,200 tonnes—and talked about the problems faced by the fishing industry in Australia. But he then said that he does not support this legislation to prevent the Margiris from fishing in Australian waters.


I come from a coastal electorate. We have had issues with fishing within the Shortland electorate. Lake Macquarie is at the heart of the Shortland electorate. Over the years, issues surrounding fishing have been very much on the table. In my electorate I have been approached by many fishers, both professional and recreational, and they have all put compelling arguments to me that we cannot allow this ship to fish in Australian waters. 




Mr Baldwin:
  So why, yesterday, did you vote in the Senate to approve it?




Ms HALL:
  I hear the member for Paterson. Hopefully he is offering his support for the recreational and professional fishers in his electorate. The father of a fisher from his electorate was the first person to hit my office complaining about this ship fishing in Australian waters. If the member for Paterson were in tune with his electorate, he would know the depth of feeling fishers have towards this ship fishing in Australian waters.


Australia has a long and proud record as a leader in sustainable fishing. The legislation before us today recognises that decisions on fisheries need to be based on scientific fact, not on emotion. This legislation is about ensuring that scientific facts are collected before any decision is made. If we were not interested in the science, we would either allow fishing to continue—without having any true knowledge base—or, alternatively, we would ban it up-front. In two years, we will have that information. I am quite sure that, when that information is collected, it will lead to a ban on ships like the Margiris fishing in Australian waters.


This ship has been forced to change its name on numerous occasions in various parts of the world. It has a storage capacity of 6,200 tonnes. That means it is capable of catching 20 bus loads of fish each day. It is twice the size of any boat currently fishing in Australia, and this boat would be fishing in direct competition with Australian fishers—fishers such as those in the member for Paterson's electorate. The potential for bycatch is enormous—turtles, dolphins, seals and undersized fish. One of the key factors in fishery management is making sure that the fish caught are the correct size so as to ensure that breeding can continue. 


I think the sustainability of our fishing industry is extremely important and something all members of this parliament would like to ensure. Having a sustainable fishing industry means that those of us who do not fish can continue to enjoy the fish which come from our ocean and that those who work in the industry can maintain their jobs. I want to see the professional fishers in my electorate able to continue fishing. 


I mentioned Lake Macquarie earlier. Some 15 years ago, professional fishing in the lake was causing a depletion of fishing stocks and there were issues relating to bycatch. There was enormous division within the community between professional fishers and recreational fishers. The outcome was that professional fishing was banned in Lake Macquarie. We still have a strong professional fishing presence in the area—the professional fishers have moved to ocean fishing. The difference the ban has made to fishing stocks in Lake Macquarie has been enormous. Fish stocks in the lake have increased. That has helped maintain the lake as an enjoyable spot for recreational fishing. As a result, tourism to the area has increased. So there are enormous benefits from ensuring sustainable fishing. 


So sustainable fishing in Lake Macquarie has gone from being on the edge of falling over, when we had professional fishers fishing in the lake, to the point now where we have a very healthy lake, with the fish stocks increasing on a daily basis. If you extend that to the fishing trawler dealt with in this legislation—which has the ability to take large stocks of fish—you can see that the impact on the sustainability of our fisheries would be enormous. What happened on that small level in Lake Macquarie will happen on a much bigger level on the Australian coastline as a whole.


So the legislation we have before us today is very important, and I am disappointed—very disappointed, actually—that the opposition are not supporting it. We on this side of the House know that the strategy of the opposition is to oppose for opposition's sake, so every time we put up a piece of legislation we are ready for them: we have the expectation, shall I say, that the opposition will oppose it. I spoke last night on the charities and not-for-profits bills, which I thought the opposition would support. But, no, it opposed them. Today I am talking about sustainable fishing, about ensuring that our fish stocks are not depleted by the Margiris coming into Australian waters. However, rather than having any vision and looking to the future, I would argue strongly that the opposition are opposing this bill for opposition's sake, and without having spoken to their communities. This bill is about assuring the community that environmental controls are in place, which reflects the community's expectations.


The bill will set up an expert panel that will assess the science to answer the very important questions being asked about this supertrawler. As legislators—I repeat, as legislators—we have the obligation to assure the communities that we represent that adequate controls are in place and that we will have sustainable fisheries into the future. I believe the legislation we have before us today will do just that.


The Margiris—or, should I say, the Abel Tasman, because it is has changed its name again—was being assessed under a 20-year-old act. Since then, of course, many changes have taken place, and so the minister needs to take into account new or different types of considerations. It is very important that we are able to look at this from a different perspective. The legislation does not say 'new fishing activities'; it says 'specified fishing activities'. That is because there may be a change in the way that a past activity is playing out.


It is really important that this legislation gets through this parliament, and quickly, because it is vital for the future. We cannot allow uncertainty about fisheries to continue, and this bill is about making certain that we will have a sustainable fishing industry into the future. We need to look at all the implications—social, environmental and economic—associated with this supertrawler operating in our waters. One of the strong points of this legislation, I think, is that both the minister for the environment and the minister for fisheries must look at imposing these conditions and there has to be agreement before we can go down this track, as there is in this case. We cannot allow uncertainty—not on issues like this.


I do not think any issue has engendered such wide-ranging debate in my electorate as this one has, given that, as I said at the beginning, it is a coastal electorate and we have had issues around fishing in the past. I can share with this House that not one person has contacted my office to say that the Abel Tasman, as it is now called, should be allowed to operate freely in Australian waters. I agree with my constituents. I think that a very, very strong case against that has been put forward, but to make sure that that case is based on scientific fact we need to go down this path.


I commend the minister for bringing this bill before the parliament to deal with an issue that is so important to the community that I represent and to the Australian community as a whole.

"Baldwin, Bob, MP",LP,2012-09-12,"



Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson) (12:06):  I rise to speak on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Declared Fishing Activities) Bill 2012. Hypocrisy reigns supreme in this parliament, because Minister Burke, as the minister for fisheries, in 2008 released the Australian Fisheries Management Authority discussion paper Small pelagic fishery harvest strategy. That report was revised in October 2009. The report says, on large factory freezer vessels such as the Margiris, now the Abel Tasman:


… there are considerable economies of scale in the fishery and the most efficient way to fish may include large scale factory freezer vessels. 


Hypocrisy reigns supreme not just because the minister who is now moving this bill was the fisheries minister who appointed the AFMA commissioners in whom he now says he has no faith; hypocrisy reigns supreme within the Labor Party because Senator Ludwig, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, reaffirmed the 18,000-tonne quota on 23 August, and on 10 September the Labor government voted to support the quota. Why the shift, in two days?


This bill is not based on science. It is based not on sound management nor on good governance. This bill is based on hypocrisy, because the government do not believe what they are saying; nor do they believe in what they are doing. I have concerns about this bill because it is bad policy being brought upon us by a bad government, driven by the wrong reasons. The measures in this bill, in effect, were debated in the Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012. I spoke to that bill on 16 August:


The amendments to the bill will allow for emergency power to be introduced to partly close or close a fishery without stakeholder consultation in case of emergency. 


The minister for fisheries already has these powers—voted on, supported. Now this government wants to override the minister for fisheries, to override AFMA and to introduce new powers for the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities. I would have thought that the left hand might have spoken to the right hand, that there might have been a whole-of-government approach.


The member for Shortland raised the recreational fishing industry. I do a lot of work with the recreational fishing industry. I am part of their group. What concerns them is the ad hoc way in which this has been put together. In division 2, subdivision A, at 390SC, the bill says:




What is a


declared fishing activity
?





(1) A 
declared fishing activity
 is a fishing activity that is specified in:





It goes through a range of measures and then says:





(2) A 
fishing activity


means an activity that constitutes fishing.



Then, in subdivision B:




390SD Interim declaration





Making an interim declaration





This is the part that concerns me:





(1) The Minister may, by legislative instrument, make a declaration 
… 
that a specified fishing activity is a declared fishing activity.





(2) When making an interim declaration, the Minister may identify a fishing activity by reference to all or any of the following:





(a) a method of fishing;





(b) a type of vessel used for fishing;





(c) a method of processing, carrying or transhipping of fish that have been taken;





(d) an area of waters or of seabed.



From my reading and understanding of this legislation, these measures can apply to recreational fishermen. This minister, at a whim, without any science and without any consultation can shut down entire areas, not just for commercial fishing but for recreational fishing as well. The minister will no longer be required to go through the management processes for marine parks. He can just shut down at a whim the entire Coral Sea, the entire Great Barrier Reef, all of the Commonwealth waters off New South Wales and all of the Commonwealth waters off Victoria and Tasmania. He can shut down all the waters off South Australia, off Western Australia, off the Northern Territory and off Lord Howe Island. This minister will have unfettered powers which are not restricted to commercial fishing; they can apply equally to recreational fishing.


If you want to understand how concerning this is, look at the first part of this bill, which talks about the penalties. If this minister decides that an area is to be shut down for, let us say, recreational fishing, the civil penalty is:




390SA Civil penalty—declared fishing activities





…
   …
   …





(a) for an individual—5,000 penalty units;





and then:





390SB Offence—declared fishing activities




(1) A person commits an offence if:




(a) the person takes an action; and





(b) the action is taken in a Commonwealth marine area; and





(c) the action is a declared fishing activity.





Penalty: Imprisonment for 7 years or 420 penalty units, or both.




So now,

because of the mismanagement of this government—the lack of understanding in what they have done, the failure to consult—we see a situation where recreational fishing can be captured by this bill. The members of the Labor Party talk about good fisheries management and say that they have done the science. I have concerns about the science by the independent commissioners appointed by Minister Burke and the scientists who have said that the science is correct. It has been reaffirmed this week. In fact, Minister Ludwig said in the Senate this week that the science is correct. If the science is correct and they have concerns, who will drive this legislation—which can shut down a fishery based on social concerns? It could be people such as GetUp!; it could be people such as the Pew foundation. It could be anyone who creates a social concern, which then gives the minister the leeway to shut down or declare invalid a whole fishery—not just for commercial fishing but also for recreational fishing.


People target the Margiris; I too have concerns about the size of the vessel. I would much rather that 10 smaller vessels employing 10 times the number of people worked an area. But this government and, in particular, this minister for the environment when he was minister for fisheries, sought vessels of the size of the Margiris to undertake the fishing of 18,000 tonnes of mackerel and redbait. The difference is that this capture will be used and frozen for human consumption rather than just for baitfish. If indeed they wanted to apply better fisheries management, they would have a move-on provision—in other words, they would specify that only a certain amount of the 18,000-tonne catch could come from certain areas, which would be broken up by the size of the catch. That would spread the risk of overfishing in one area across the whole of the nation.


There is no argument that the 18,000-tonne haul is a concern. People have concerns over the size of the vessel and the size of its haul, and I can understand that. The recreational fishing people have expressed that concern to me. But, in my discussions with them, people from the recreational fishing industry and the main peak bodies said to me, 'If there were move-on provisions, it would lessen the heat and the argument.' This government has not listened to the people who are affected; it has listened to the green groups, such as GetUp! and Pew. This bill gives so much potential to cause damage to an individual minister, who is irresponsible and hypocritical. As I said, this is the minister who appointed the ACMA commissioners and this is the minister who in the Small Pelagic Fishery Harvest Strategy went out and sought vessels of the size of the Margiris. He now wants to stop fishing by such vessels on the basis of social concerns. Either you base things on science and then manage the science and the expectations or you play to populist politics.


Why did none of the members here stand up before Minister Ludwig spoke in the Senate and approved this legislation on the 10th? Why did they show no concern? In fact, one of their own members, the member for Braddon, an area that is affected, said in the Advocate on 4 August:


Sometimes you've got to stick with what you believe is right when popular opinion might not agree. You have faith in your institutions and you demand they be accountable, but if through sheer populist sentiment you push your institutions aside, what hope have you got?


That statement was made by one of the parliamentary secretaries—a man who has the port of Devonport in his electorate. But hypocrisy knows no bounds, because on 11 September he put out a press release which said:


Sid Sidebottom … today welcomed the news today that the Federal Government will introduce legislation to toughen up environmental controls on vessels like the super trawler.




Mr Hartsuyker:
  You can count on Sid!




Mr BALDWIN:
  You can count on Sid! He's always there to be depended upon! So, when his own community is depending on him, what does he do? He takes an each-way bet.


What you need to consider in environmental management of fisheries is regional total allowable catches. In other words, only so much can come out of each area. That spreads the risk over a broader area. What you need to understand is that people such as the Australian Marine Alliance have problems with this draconian bill. The chief executive of the AMA, Dean Logan, said:


The explanations given by ministers Ludwig and Burke throughout a range of media interviews over their knowledge and handling of the so-called super trawler have been watched closely by all involved.


He went on to say:


The majority of comments raise very serious concerns about whether both ministers, especially Minister Burke, have actually misled the Australian community. Perhaps more on this will be exposed by a freedom of information request and almost certain court action.


What people want is good management and a solid, secure pathway. Those who invested on the basis of an express approach by Mr Burke, who wanted the ship in here in the beginning when he was fisheries minister want is low sovereign risk. This bill denies it. The recreational fishers want a realistic outcome, which can be achieved in relation to this fishery by having move-on provisions—in other words, regional total allowable catches. The recreational fishers also want exclusion from this bill. The recreational fishing industry wants not to be caught up in this form of politics. As I said at the very beginning, this minister, with an express wish, can shut down any fishing. He could shut down snapper fishing more than three miles offshore because someone says that it is socially unacceptable. He could shut down the recreational shark fishing in Victoria because somebody says, 'We don't think that's socially acceptable'. He can shut down any fishing. As I said, he can shut down the entire Great Barrier Reef for recreational fishing as well as for commercial fishing without having to go through any due process. After the minister has made a decision to do that, he has to report to a committee. But there are no guidelines in this bill as to who can be on the committee and what qualifications they must have. The committee, as I said earlier, could consist of the Greens, the GetUp! Movement, the Pew foundation or anyone who wants to get involved in the social politics.


This government needs to stand firm on its commitment and address its own bill by adding to it move-on provisions and, in particular, by amending the bill to exclude recreational fishers. I call on the government to walk in here today and move an amendment to its own bill, before we do so, to exclude recreational fishing activities from being caught up in this legislation.

"Wilkie, Andrew, MP",Ind.,2012-09-12,"



Mr WILKIE
 (Denison) (12:21):  The federal government's decision to stop the supertrawler operating in Australian waters for up to two years is, I believe, a very significant and a very positive development. I applaud the government and the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities in particular for finally acting in this matter. The case against the supertrawler is, in my opinion, overwhelming. For a start, there are doubts over the science. 


Can I say up-front that I have enormous respect for the Australian scientific community and for the work that it does and I am very mindful of the fact that, in my electorate, I have a disproportionate number of marine scientists and fisheries experts—in fact, one of the highest populations of such people, pro rata, of any city in the country. But the fact is that the views in the scientific community are divided; there is not a clear consensus one way or another in this matter. For example, in Tasmania, our own Dr Andrew Wadsley has done some very good work picking apart the science behind the quota and has found many errors. Further afield, Professor Jessica Meeuwig, who is a research professor at the University of Western Australia, has had this to say:


But we are largely ignorant about the effective population structure of these species. Of the four species considered for exploitation, the population structure of blue mackerel is uncertain, and jack mackerel and redbait are believed to have eastern and western subpopulations. No dedicated population studies have been conducted on redbait nor is any information available for Peruvian jack mackerel. Moreover, little is reported about adult movements of any of these species except that larger jack mackerel are found in deeper waters.


That is one opinion from a very highly regarded Western Australian professor. I will quote again, this time from a friend of mine from Hobart, John Biggs. In an online blog comment this morning, he wrote:


Science's role is to provide the information on which policy can be made, its role is not to create policy. Policymakers certainly need to take the science into account, which means they are satisfied it is fully up to date … But policymakers also need to take into account a range of other factors, including the opinions of the public who elected them. Science may tell us what can happen but that does not mean to say it should happen. And in any case, the science here is focused on a specific species, not the whole ecosystem, is out of date and statistically wrong according to Dr Wadsley and others.


There are also doubts, in my opinion, over the effectiveness of the government's safeguards and, in particular, the promise of an observer onboard the supertrawler Margiris. To save money, the government is moving to replace fishing observers with electronic monitoring through the Fisheries Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1), which passed this House in August and is now before the Senate. The government variously described the conditions it had imposed on the Margiris as 'tough', 'stringent' and 'best practice' but the reality is that the key condition of an onboard observer was nothing more than a facade. In introducing the bill, Parliamentary Secretary for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Sid Sidebottom, told parliament:


Trials and cost-benefit analyses have shown that the more data that is required for a fishery, the cheaper it will become to use e-monitoring systems, rather than observers. 


There are also doubts about the risk of localised stock depletion. This is one of the most important reasons that a single large vessel is much more problematic than a number of smaller boats filling the same quota. I suggest it is self-evident that one very large vessel with one very large net going into a relatively small fishery will have a disproportionate effect compared to a smaller number of vessels, which would probably operate across a broader area by comparison. 


Another problem with the supertrawler Margiris—and I will call it Margiris because I think renaming it Abel Tasman was downright offensive, particularly to the Tasmanian community—was that it had no social licence. Very few Tasmanians in particular wanted the vessel. That is not at all surprising, considering there are well over 100,000 recreational fishers—men, women and children—in Tasmania in a population of only half a million. I understand that elsewhere in Australia there are similar levels of concern with supertrawlers. This is very important. We in this House should represent our communities. It is too easy to simply say, 'Some government agency at arm's length knows more and we will disregard the view of the community.' That is not our job and we should not do that; it should only be done in extreme circumstances. It should not have been done in this case.


There has also been the problem of the misconduct by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority when setting the quota relevant to the Margiris. I refer here to AFMA advisory committees. The outcomes of the February meeting of the resource assessment group were not accurately recorded and concerns by at least two members of the group were not communicated up the chain to the management advisory committee. We know that because the concerns of at least two members of that committee are now on the public record. Their concerns went to what is called the South East Management Advisory Committee. We know that at its meeting in March—the key meeting when the recommendation for the quota relevant to the supertrawler Margiris was finalised—the committee did not comply with the Fisheries Administration Act. We know that the proponent for the supertrawler, Mr Gerry Geen of Seafish Tasmania, a man with a direct conflict of interest, remained in that meeting—which in my opinion was entirely improper, but it was allowable as long as the committee had explicitly given him approval to remain in the meeting, and they had not. When I challenged the CEO of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority about this, remarkably the CEO said that AFMA does not take its act literally—that, in fact, it has developed in-house workaround arrangements because it has difficulties with the act. 


I have taken these concerns to the ombudsman, and I am pleased that the ombudsman feels there is enough substance to my concerns about the conduct of AFMA that it is currently investigating the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, in particular its conduct regarding the setting of the quota relevant to the supertrawler Margiris.


Finally, there is also a question mark over the big picture and the fact that AFMA blocked the supertrawler Veronica in 2005 with the support of the Howard government. In fact, at about the same time, the proponents for the supertrawler Margiris commenced their work. 'So what?' you might ask, Mr Deputy Speaker. Well, the proponent for the Margiris, Mr Gerry Geen, was on at least one of the AFMA advisory committees in 2005 when AFMA blocked the Veronica. If that does not raise serious questions about the conduct of AFMA and whether a supertrawler should operate in Australian waters then I do not know what will.


I am not saying that Mr Geen has done anything wrong in these matters. In fact, I am genuinely concerned that Mr Geen has been allowed to do a lot of work, spend a lot of money and give employees a lot of hope when his expectations really should have been cut short long ago by either the Howard government, the Rudd government or, much earlier, the Gillard government. No, my issue here is with fisheries management in Australia and the fact that far too many people with direct conflicts of interest are allowed to occupy positions on key advisory bodies. Remember that Mr Geen, from Seafish Tasmania, the proponent for the supertrawler Margiris, was heavily involved with AFMA when a competitor vessel, the Veronica, was stopped, and he was again heavily involved more recently when the quota relevant to the Margiris was set. Surely, this is entirely improper of AFMA and should not be allowed to continue.


I urge the government to turn yesterday's announcement into law as quickly as possible—and I urge my crossbench colleagues to support the government. I also urge the government to ensure that this two-year assessment process which has been identified is done effectively and is absolutely beyond question. And given all the uncertainty over the setting of the quota for the supertrawler Margiris I also urge the government to revoke that quota and not allow any other vessel to fish it in the interim. Regrettably, I would also add that, while the government's announcement yesterday is to be applauded, I think it could have gone much further. Ultimately I will be supporting an amendment I expect to be moved by the member for Melbourne which would seek to ban supertrawlers permanently.


I would like to quote from a Greenpeace fact sheet on some of the issues we need to consider about toughening up the government's bill and banning supertrawlers permanently. The supertrawler Margiris is 142 metres long, twice the size of any vessel that has fished Australian seas previously. It is six times longer than the average Australian fishing vessel. It can process—and this is a typical supertrawler—up to 250 tonnes of fish a day and store 6,200 tonnes of fish before it has to return to port. This is fishing on an industrial scale never before seen in Australia—nor should it be. Fishing on such a scale has an enormous bycatch that kills a large number of very precious animals. For example, in the past 15 years, bycatch from the 20 supertrawlers fishing off West Africa has killed an estimated 1,500 critically endangered turtles, more than 18,000 giant rays and more than 60,000 sharks. And not only are they destroying these precious animals, they are destroying jobs. Supertrawlers are inherently machinery intensive and personnel light. They are job killers, not job creators. They have done enormous damage around the world where they have been allowed to operate. For example, they collapsed the South Pacific fishery. I am still quoting from the Greenpeace fact sheet here. 'Scientists said there were so many jack mackerel in the South Pacific that the fishery was impossible to overfish. But supertrawlers, including the Margiris, fished so much that in 2006 the Pacific fishery collapsed to 10 per cent of healthy stocks. Fisheries managers are calling for fishing to be cut by half, with some scientists arguing for a five-year total ban in that fishery.' They have also effectively wiped out West Africa's commercial fish stock. 'Since supertrawlers, including the Margiris, started fishing off the west coast of Africa, most commercial fish stocks have become fully exploited or overexploited.' In other words, there are effectively no more fish for commercial fishing—and that is what supertrawlers have done in recent years in other parts of the world.


Frankly, it should be up to the proponents of such vessels to prove to us that they are environmentally and economically sensible, rather than the current situation where it is up to the government to prove that such vessels are inappropriate. I believe that if we were to amend the government's bill and ban supertrawlers permanently it would put the onus on any future proponent of a supertrawler to make a strong enough case to convince a future government to change the law. It should not be up to us to work out how to say no. The onus has to be reversed. It should be up to the proponents of supertrawlers to convince us in the future that they have changed their ways and things are better. It should be up to a future proponent of a supertrawler, if they want to have one operate in Australian waters, to persuade a future government to change the law to allow it.


I will wind it up there. I will finish by saying that yesterday's news was great news for a great many Australians, certainly for the overwhelming majority of Tasmanians that I am aware of. I applaud the government for doing it and I call on my crossbench colleagues to understand that the government's bill should be applauded. And the issue of science is a fair point, but remember that there is uncertainty even within the scientific community.

"Ley, Sussan, MP",LP,2012-09-12,"



Ms LEY
 (Farrer) (12:36):  I am pleased to speak on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Declared Fishing Activities) Bill 2012, which those listening to the broadcast would assume concerns the activities of the supertrawler Margiris. And I guess, in one sense, it does, except that, when you look at the extraordinary powers that this bill will give to the minister for the environment, you could be forgiven for thinking that he, with his partners the Greens, has taken this opportunity for a giant regulatory overreach. That regulatory overreach will give the Australian government, in the form of its environment minister, control over fishing activities anywhere, in any capacity, done by any body, organisation or individual on the basis of a new term, 'social uncertainty'. It is a term that I have not encountered in legislation.


Like most people in my electorate of Farrer, some of whom have contacted me today, when I look at images of the supertrawler I do not like what I see. That is an instinctive reaction. It is the kind of instinctive reaction that many people would get when they visit an abattoir or see some of the perfectly legal and perfectly humane activities that are carried out in the farming industry. There are parallels between this issue and the live cattle debacle engineered by this government. But we cannot stand in this place and react on the basis of instinct. We can use our instinct to look again at a situation, to analyse it, and to say to our scientists and departmental experts: 'What's going on here? What really is happening? Do you have any ability to make changes?' We can and we should do those things. I am sure that, up to a point, the minister has done those things. But what has been produced for the parliament to consider today is not that.


If the minister particularly wanted to target a piece of regulation or legislation aimed at the supertrawler Margiris he could have done that. He could, for example, have introduced some provisions to make the ship move on—in other words, not stay in the same catchment area for longer than a certain period of time. He did not do that. He could have, and it has been done, legislated for a particular vessel on a particular occasion. There are many reasons why that would be a bad public policy approach, but he could have done that. In an attempt to address community concerns about the Margiris this minister has gone to the extreme. He has given himself almost unlimited powers, which will impact on every family fishing boat around the country.


I do not represent any ocean. The electorate of Farrer comprises 30 per cent of the state of New South Wales and it is all a long way from the sea. But I do represent recreational fishers and I do represent communities that love angling, that have seen the invasion of the concept of inland marine parks, that have seen a horrible, complicated bureaucracy grew up around just wanting to go out on a Sunday afternoon and throw a line in the waters of Lake Hume, the Menindee Lakes or the Murray River. Those communities are being attacked by the bureaucracy from every side.


The reason I want so strongly to speak against this bill is to recognise not only the appalling principle that is being engineered by this government but the rights of people in my electorate to carry on fishing and angling, and to carry on doing their business. They want to be able to that in a way that does not leave them with a federal environment act overseeing their every single move, an act that has the ability to stop the activity, to limit it and to put in place something so unrealistic that the very Australian activities of recreational fishing can no longer take place.


I have talked about principle. One of the principles we are seeing in this is a government that is making policy on the run. In the process, it has given the minister unlimited powers, but what has really happened is that a social media campaign, very successfully engineered by GetUp! and the green movement, has pushed this government into action. Social media is an amazing opportunity for people to make their point. From relative obscurity they can suddenly be in the public eye. It is something we have to countenance and resist up to a point. It is policy-making on the run; it is quite interesting to see. Every family fishing operator and every recreational fisher will be impacted by this.


Let us look at the language of the minister's bill. Clause 390SD(2) says:


… fishing activity by reference to all or any of the following:


(a) a method of fishing;


(b) a type of vessel used for fishing;


(c) a method of processing, carrying or transhipping of fish that have been taken;


(d) an area of waters or of seabed.


The minister will be able to overturn any fishing activity on the basis of even the slightest social complaint. There does not have to be any evidence. An uncertainty can be created by a complaint from a political source, from a lobby group interest group or from a social media website. This absolute power can apply to economic or environmental complaints. There is no indication what the term 'uncertainty' means in this legislation. It provides scope for the minister to stop any fishing activity without any substantive case. That creates a cloud over our entire fishing industry.


This bill, by stealth, accident or sheer incompetence, will impose the most extraordinarily draconian powers on basic rights, which is why all parliamentarians in this place should oppose it. The minister is saying that he will decide who fishes, and where, when and how they do so. It does not matter what investment may have gone into a pipeline to provide the opportunity for people to work in the fishing industry, what investment there may have been to get a ship, a boat, a trawler out into the waters. I am not talking about the supertrawler; I am talking about any fishing vessel. Nobody can have certainty. You could have gone to all this expense. You could have worked-up the ship and the crew. You could have provided jobs to long-term unemployed, which I understand is what the supertrawler has done and which many fishing vessels do in areas where unemployment, particularly youth unemployment, is quite high. You could have done all those things and you could have a lot of skin in the game as a small business, which a lot of our fishing enterprises are, and see the minister decide that, because of a complaint, because of a whim, it is all going to be ended. There is no point in members of the government saying: 'That's not what this is about. That's not what this minister would do.' That is not the point. The point is that we in this place should not give ministers this undue power. We have the Australian Fisheries Management Authority. We have had the science, we have had the advice, we have appointed independent experts. We appoint independent experts in this place to death because we know that we are not the experts. Yes, we can make decisions based on what they tell us. We should not contract out the decision-making, which is something this government does very well. We should not contract out the decision-making to independent bodies, but we should rely on their advice.


Where this advice tells us, as it has in the case of the fisheries, that this is one quota that will not result in more fish being extracted from our seas and that this is in line with every international and national agreement and piece of policy that we have at this point in time, why would the minister race in here on a whim reacting in a moment of horror in the face of what is just an environmental campaign? It has been writ very large by social media, admittedly, but it is a campaign nevertheless, not based on fact, principle or any good public policy.


We have no idea what the parameters of this 'uncertainty'—and the term in the legislation is 'social uncertainty'—might be. As I asked before, will it apply to a lake in the middle of my electorate? Will it apply to every lake in Australia until the minister's assessment of that uncertainty rests? Does it affect the Murray or Darling rivers, which also flow through my electorate? We have already seen the greatest level of uncertainty since Federation occur up and down the lengths of these mighty rivers with the government's wrecking-ball approach—the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. This has already knocked irrigation communities for six, through the uncertainty created by the government's completely unrealistic water diversion targets.


As other speakers have noted, a similar knee-jerk reaction occurred with last year's live export ban to Indonesia. During the last parliamentary sitting I met with a group from Gulf Horizons. To hear their description of how an entire pastoral region of Northern Australia is on its knees because of that live cattle decision was truly horrifying—another knee-jerk reaction, another reaction of 'Oh, my God, what do we do about this? There's something that has appeared in the media; we have to act now,' without consideration of process, all the facts or just the appropriate rationale. Millions of dollars have been taken out of farming and freight livelihoods forever in one single swoop. Then of course the agriculture minister went, 'Oops!'—it was another of those moments—and he tried to backflip. This is exactly what we are seeing here with this decision.


Under this amendment before the House, potentially we will see every family fishing operator and every recreational fisher waking up in the morning and wondering what sort of social uncertainty the minister might be experiencing on the other side of the country. Rumours already abound through inland Australia about the possibility that Labor's marine park legislation for our coastline could somehow extend and infiltrate into inland streams and lakes.


If recreational fishing takes any more of a hit in my electorate in western New South Wales then that might be more than the small towns that rely on it for tourism and income can stand. It would be the last nail in the coffin for some of them. If you look at the inland rivers now with plenty of water in them and the country blooming, it is a fantastic place for families to take their children to camp, fish, sit in the sun and have a really good-value Australian holiday—not on the coast, not in Bali and not anywhere offshore but actually to support rural Australia when it needs it but also when it can offer so much.


The minister's intention to extend his powers means that he can do that at any time on any whim. We know that when this government gets a knock on the door from their partners the Greens they react—and they react in a way that is not in their own interests either and certainly not in the interests of the people of Australia.


In making a few calls to local fishing groups and businesses around my electorate this morning I found that no-one is really aware of the extent of these changes the minister is planning to foist on them. That is because there has not been any consultation. How surprising! This government is ramming through legislation with apparently unintended consequences. The fisher who pops his boat out on Lake Hume on a Sunday morning with his son can be penalised for pulling out a trout instead of a yellow belly or a cod simply because some fish libertarian felt socially concerned over the removal of non-native fish stocks! Of course they have not been consulted. What would their response have been? It would have been, 'Please do not go ahead with this draconian and stupid piece of legislation.' As one local fisher told me, you would want the minister to have to jump through a few more hoops before they could bring in anything like this. That is the point. There has not been consultation. There has simply been this awful, knee-jerk reaction designed purely to respond to a populist campaign. As we have seen so many times before, when the dust settles, when the truth—as it always does—gets out, people will realise, 'Oops, perhaps we shouldn't have done that. Look at these unintended consequences for our country, for our investment and for our fisheries.'


I will end where I began. Instinctively, I am like everyone else. I look at the supertrawler and think, 'I'm not sure about that.' But that is not what we are talking about here today. Ostensibly what we are talking about is an opportunity to give this government an enormous new regulatory power in the area of the environment. If people think that the green groups that have agitated so successfully for this will stop at this and will stop at a vessel of this size without wanting to go the line and look at vessels of different sizes in different fisheries carrying out different activities for different purposes they are crazy. This would only just be the beginning. We should resist it at all costs.

"Fletcher, Paul, MP",LP,2012-09-12,"



Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (12:51):  I am pleased to rise to speak on the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Declared Fishing Activities) Bill 2012. To any objective observer, this is a really puzzling bill. We have a long established system for regulating fisheries in Australia which is recognised around the world for being rational, science based and allowing for a proper balance of commercial and economic considerations on the one hand and environmental and sustainability considerations on the other.


Under the operation of that system, a company based in Tasmania was awarded a quota to fish for certain species of small pelagic fish. The company decided that the way it would exercise its rights to fish up to the limit set by the quota was to bring to Australia a large fishing vessel called the Margiris, now renamed the Abel Tasman. What happened next was that activist groups like Greenpeace and GetUp!, with the enthusiastic support of the Greens political party, started an advocacy campaign designed to raise public concerns about the activities of this vessel, even though its activities will make no difference to the total amount of fish caught.


As recently as Monday of this week the Gillard government was defending the current system. The fisheries minister, Joe Ludwig, had this to say in the Senate:


This government, like those before it, takes the position that output controls, particularly individual transferable quotas, are the preferred approach to fisheries management.


He went on to share with the Senate the advice he had received from 'eminent fishery scientists' of their 'confidence that food-web impacts of the small pelagic fishery on predators and the small pelagic fishery species themselves, including through localised depletion, are unlikely'. In other words, he advised the Senate on Monday that his expert scientific advice was that it was unlikely that there would be adverse impacts on the food web from this fishery activity which had been previously authorised under the existing regulatory arrangements.


Yesterday, however, there was a complete change of position from the Gillard government, leading to the bill which is before the House today and which we are now debating. According to the minister's second reading speech, this bill would:


… incorporate a new chapter into the EPBC Act—


that is, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act—


that will allow the environment minister to prohibit a declared fishing activity while an independent expert panel undertakes an assessment of the potential environmental, social or economic impacts of the activity.


However, this can only happen if:


… the environment minister and the fisheries minister agree that there is uncertainty about the environmental, social or economic impacts …


The other thing that the minister tells us in his second reading speech is that this prohibition can last for 24 months. That is to say that the effect of making this declaration is that fishing activities as specified in the declaration, in that particular area and using the specified methods, are prohibited for up to 24 months. This is truly policymaking on the run, overturning a well-established and world respected system of evidence based policymaking in Australian fisheries management, and the coalition therefore opposes this bill.


In the time available to me I want to make three points. Firstly, we are seeing here from the Gillard government a panicked reaction. The minister's attempts to justify the measures in this bill are threadbare indeed. Secondly, the sweeping new power which this bill would grant the minister for the environment creates great uncertainty for both the entire commercial fishing sector and the recreational fishing community. It should be opposed on its merits. Thirdly, this dramatic backflip by the Gillard government—by no means their first and, I suspect, not their last—adds to the already high perceptions of sovereign risk for those doing business or seeking to do business in Australia.


Let me start firstly with the proposition that what we are seeing here is a panicked reaction to a political advocacy campaign. I have already cited the remarks of Fisheries Minister Ludwig in the Senate just on Monday of this week defending the current system. In addition, Environment Minister Burke just a few days ago issued what at that time was understood to be the definitive response to some of the public concerns expressed in this political advocacy campaign. His measures would have imposed new restrictions on the methods that this vessel could use as it fished. For example, as he told the ABC's Q&A program, if the vessel were to catch a dolphin—something it is not permitted to do—it would then be required to cease fishing and move 50 nautical miles away before it could start fishing again.


Just a few days later it turned out that that policy response was not his definitive policy response and he now wants new and even wider powers to deal with the issues posed by the proposed activities of the Abel Tasman. Why is it that he now wants these new powers? According to his second reading speech, it is firstly because of:


… the nature of this vessel and in particular its capacity to remain in the same area of ocean for extended periods of time …


It is also apparently because of the following:


Experience over the last couple of months has however shown that the act does not provide sufficient powers to suspend a fishing activity where there is uncertainty as to the potential environmental, social and economic impacts of the activity …


It really is very odd that Minister Burke would say this now when just three years ago, as the minister responsible for fisheries at the time, he oversaw the issuing by the Australian Fisheries Management Authority of something called the Small pelagic fishery harvest strategy. When you read the Small pelagic fishery harvest strategy it describes its purpose as follows:


The development of the Small Pelagic Fishery (SPF) Harvest Strategy (HS) reflects obligations under the Commonwealth's Fisheries Harvest Strategy Policy and Guidelines … the HS is to provide—


that is to say it is required to provide—


the Australian community with a high degree of confidence that commercial fish species are being managed for long-term biological sustainability and economic profitability.


This document issued under the auspices of then Fisheries Minister Burke went on to say:


SPF species—


small pelagic fish species—


are an important food source for many threatened, endangered and protected species (TEPs) and other species and it is therefore important that the SPF HS takes into account the ecosystem role of these species …


Finally, this document went on to say:


there are considerable economies of scale … and the most efficient way to fish may include large scale factory freezer vessels.


I need hardly add that 'large scale factory freezer vessel' is a good description of precisely the kind of vessel which is now the subject of controversy.


In other words, there has already been a thorough process carried out which balances up the commercial considerations on the one hand and environmental and sustainability concerns on the other, a process overseen for much of the period, as it happens, by Minister Burke. We are now expected by Minister Burke to believe that, when this process occurred, nobody thought about or considered the possibility that a vessel of the size of the Abel Tasman might be used, and nobody thought about or considered the possibility, which is now so alarming to him, that it could stay in one place longer than smaller vessels. Nobody gave this a second thought, even though such vessels are now and were at that time, just three years ago, in common use in many parts of the world.


If Minister Burke were genuinely concerned about this issue, there are a range of other measures that he could use to address it, including, for example, imposing additional conditions requiring the vessel to move on from a particular location after a particular period. But the reality is that he is clutching at straws, desperately trying to find a justification for this measure, which in substance is a response to a short-term political campaign. It is difficult to understand the rationale for the mechanism set out in the bill, which is that, under clause 390SH, there will be an expert panel established to look into the declared fishing activity. We know that the establishment of an expert panel is a preferred tactic of the Gillard government. We saw it with Julia Gillard's 'citizens' assembly', which was going to achieve a 'deep and lasting consensus' on climate change; we saw it in her appointment of Angus Houston and other panellists in an attempt to cover up her backflip on asylum seekers; and now we see the same preferred tactic being used here. On any analysis, it is an empty charade when you consider the very thorough and comprehensive process already undertaken to assess the relevant fisheries activity, including its environmental and sustainability impact.


The second point I would like to make in the brief time I have is about the extent of the uncertainty created for the entire commercial fishing sector, on the one hand, and the recreational fishing community, on the other, by the wide provisions set out in this bill. Under this bill, if it passes into law, the minister will be able to make a declaration that he and the fisheries minister agree that 'there is uncertainty about the environmental, social or economic impacts of the fishing activity'. That is in clause 390SD(3). 'Uncertainty' is a very low bar indeed. It means that the minister will be able to overturn any fishing activity on the basis of even the slightest social complaint. Everyone who has ever dropped a line over the side, and every commercial fishing operator anywhere in Australia, should be alarmed about the potential for their intended fishing activities to be banned at short notice based on 'social' considerations. The wording appears to have been specifically chosen to give the minister the power to act in response to political campaigns by particular activist groups. The mere existence of such campaigns will automatically qualify as generating uncertainty about the 'social impacts' of the fishing activity.


One point that strikes you on reading the bill is whether there is any limit on the minister's power to use this mechanism repeatedly. Nowhere in the bill is there a provision that the declaration can only be made in respect of a particular fishing activity if no such declaration has previously been made. It is difficult to avoid the conclusion that this mechanism is really a smokescreen for the real motivation of delaying the activity which has caused political offence. It is also noteworthy that nowhere in the bill is there any provision requiring the minister to have any regard to, or do anything in response to, the report of the expert panel once he receives it, other than to publish it on his website and table it in the parliament, under clause 390SL.


My third point is to join with my coalition colleagues in highlighting the way that this dramatic backflip by the Gillard government yet again adds to perceptions of sovereign risk. In industry after industry we have seen the same story play out: businesses invest to carry out lawful operations, and then the Rudd or Gillard government in a political panic changes the rules. We saw the abrupt cancellation of Home Insulation Program after many operators had invested heavily and built up inventory in reliance on the existing rules. We saw the sudden decision to cancel the live cattle export trade, also involving this inglorious Minister Ludwig. And now we see this abrupt eleventh-hour reversal of position on the conduct of fisheries activities by the holder of an entitlement to fish and to catch a certain amount of fish, an entitlement issued by the government under the law after a thorough analysis of the relevant commercial and environmental factors and after setting total catch limits based on scientific evidence. This decision creates sovereign risk issues for anybody who holds a licence to fish in Australian waters and it is likely to dramatically reduce the confidence of Australia's commercial fishing industry to continue to invest—if any quota or licence can be overturned at the whim of the minister. Today's decision makes a mockery of the entire Australian Fisheries Management Authority process on which the government relies for its scientific advice.


I conclude as I started, by noting that this bill is a panicked political response to a campaign initiated by certain groups of activists. It is policymaking on the run. It overturns a well-established, world-respected system of evidence based policymaking in Australian fisheries management. The coalition opposes the bill.

"Parke, Melissa, MP",ALP,2012-09-12,"



Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (13:06):  Fremantle has long been a fishing community and it has long been a leader in environmental protection and sustainability. My community has been thrilled with the federal government's recent announcement that Australia will establish the world's largest network of marine sanctuaries in Commonwealth waters. That is why, from the moment I heard that a supertrawler was en route to Australia and was seeking to operate in those same Commonwealth waters, serious alarm bells began to ring about what this might mean for local fishers and for marine biodiversity.


When one considers the scale and indiscriminate nature of this kind of operation—with its potential to exact damaging localised depletion of fish species for which we have imperfect or non-existent data; with its potential to wreak havoc on the existing food chain and marine ecosystems; and its potential to kill large numbers of animals like seals, dolphins, sea lions and seabirds as the bycatch victims of its enormous drag nets—there can be no question but that the precautionary principle must apply.


And, when one looks into the history and practice methods of supertrawler operations elsewhere and considers the impacts they are likely to have on the distinctive features of Australia's marine environment, there could be no option but to address the legislative inadequacy that has until now prevented the ministers responsible from acting to protect Australia's oceans and fisheries. I am glad that, through the galvanising events of recent weeks, the government has found a way to give the environment minister that power.


For me, the urgency and clarity of taking action—of proposing a private member's bill, together with a number of my Labor colleagues, as part of that galvanising process—was further reinforced by a number of considerations. First, I represent an electorate, and I come from a state, that is within the proposed area of operation for this veritable Godzilla of the sea. The fishing community I represent was quick to make its concerns known about the nature and scale of a supertrawler operation. Commercial fishers in Fremantle, and in WA more widely, are only too conscious of the preciousness and fragility of our fisheries, and they have undergone a series of complex and difficult adjustments over at least the last 10 to 15 years in recognition of the changes required to ensure that our fisheries and our oceans are sustainable into the future. This process has certainly not been without a fierce and frank debate involving fishers, scientists, regulators and conservationists, and it has not been without some economic and social consequences for a number of long-time fishing families in Fremantle, and yet, through that process and the advocacy of marine scientists, there is no doubt that both the recreational and the commercial fishing communities have become acutely aware that our oceans deserve and require stewardship of the highest quality.


A supertrawler fails that standard with its onboard fish-processing and storage capacity of 6,200 tonnes, which means that the vessel can stay in a particular area of the sea for extended periods and trawl it dry. A supertrawler represents the very antithesis of the approach that sustainable Australian fishery management requires and that maritime conservation demands. It is the marine equivalent of strip mining or clear-felling, depleting the oceans of life with industrial scale and efficiency.


My Labor colleagues and I have received the message loud and clear from our communities. This has been one of those issues where a strong public consensus has formed instinctively and decisively around the common-sense view—which is also, I might add, the scientific view—of marine scientists like Professor Jessica Meeuwig; namely, that a supertrawler operation like the one presented by the MV Margiris is unsustainable and presents unacceptable risks to marine ecosystems and local fisheries.


I want to acknowledge the input of literally thousands of people, from experts to ordinary people from all walks of life, in Fremantle and around the country. I thank those who have sent me emails and letters, those who have phoned my office or visited my office to express their concerns and those who have attended rallies and written to newspapers. I recognise with gratitude, too, the support and advice I received from a number of people and organisations, including the team at Greenpeace; the Wilderness Society; Sea Shepherd; Environment Tasmania; the Save Our Marine Life coalition, especially David Mackenzie, Michelle Grady, Tim Nicol, Paul Gamblin and Chris Smyth; Perth barrister Greg Mcintyre SC; ANU professor Andrew Macintosh; and dozens of local fishing organisations that have written to me on this issue. I also want to thank my Labor caucus colleagues with whom I have worked very closely on this issue, particularly my Tasmanian colleagues the member for Franklin and senators Carol Brown and Lin Thorp. I also want to mention the member for Wills, who was going to second my private member's bill if we had gone ahead with it.


Finally, I want to acknowledge Professor Jessica Meeuwig, the Director of the Centre for Marine Futures at the Oceans Institute, University of Western Australia, and a Conservation Fellow of the Zoological Society of London. Professor Meeuwig provided invaluable and clear-sighted advice on this matter, as she has done in the past, and I want to quote from the letter that she provided to the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities on 27 August. It says:


Increasing the total allowable catch to 18,000 tonnes represents an unsupported 10-fold increase over previous landings. This is a significant increase from one year to the next. The calculation of this new quota assumes that the estimates of biomass are reliable. It is notable that the estimates are generally based on old information (blue mackerel in the East 2004), inferred from other species (jack mackerel—East), or actually entirely absent (jack mackerel—West, Peruvian jack mackerel, redbait—West). It is thus likely that biomass estimates (and associated quotas) are much more uncertain than is currently reported.


Further:


This proposal for a super trawler is clearly an example where significant uncertainty exists in biological knowledge, both in terms of the species themselves and their unfished biomass. The entry of the Margiris is appropriately considered a new fishery from an ecological perspective given it represents effectively a new gear and the Western region is largely unfished and as such, should not be initiated. Moreover, precautionary spatial closures are not yet in place. As such, the Forage Fish Taskforce recommendations do not appear to support entry of a super trawler into Australian waters.


Professor Meeuwig ends her letter to the minister as follows:


In closing, I had the privilege of introducing the documentary ""The End of the Line"" for a showing at Parliament's theatre in 2011. At the time, I was asked ""how is this relevant to Australia? We don't have this kind of highly industrialized supertrawling here."" I answered that the film provided a salutary lesson in terms of the negative impacts that such fishing can have on ocean health and how important it is to protect Australia's oceans because they are still relatively healthy. At a time when Australia is leading the world in marine conservation by establishing a legacy network of reserves, it seems incredibly counterproductive and short sighted to introduce more unnecessary opportunities for the overexploitation of our oceans.


I think that makes the argument as well as it can be made, and I know that the minister himself, who, along with his staff and department, deserves enormous credit for the painstaking work that went into the creation of the historic marine protection in the south-west marine bioregional area, has been seriously exercised by the need to prevent the supertrawler from undermining that achievement.


I have no doubt that it was a great relief to hundreds of thousands of concerned Australians to hear yesterday that the government will create the additional powers under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act to allow the minister for the environment to stop the supertrawler operating for up to two years while the environmental, social and economic impacts are assessed by an expert panel. This length of time is needed because of the present lack of scientific evidence and data regarding the target species and their unfished biomass as well as bycatch impact. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has also initiated a root-and-branch review of Australia's fisheries management system to put in place the appropriate processes to deal with issues such as new fishing methods, technologies and vessel types and sizes as they arise.


Among those who will be celebrating this outcome are the students of Fremantle primary school who last week, on a blustery morning at South Beach Cafe, presented the Prime Minister with a card that said, 'Thank you for introducing the world's largest network of marine sanctuaries.' That achievement, which will resonate far into our future, is one of the most significant achievements of this Labor government. It was partly by seeing the importance of our oceans through the prism of that reform process and its outcome that I and many others welcomed the precautionary approach that will prevent the operation of the wandering, plundering MV Margiris—or the FV Abel Tasman, as it has now renamed itself, for what I understand is the fifth time—until environmental, social and economic assessments have been carried out.


There is often a kind of cynicism and doom and gloom when it comes to the political process and its capacity to address problems when they arise, so I would like to finish by recognising that we do have, by and large, a healthy and responsive system of decision making in Australia and that this has been one of those cases where representatives and the people they represent have worked together to find a solution.

"Chester, Darren, MP",Nats,2012-09-12,"



Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland) (13:15):  I rise to speak very strongly in opposition to the government's proposed amendment to the EPBC declared fishing areas. With all due respect to the member for Fremantle, who I do respect, I am afraid we are going to have to differ very strongly in this case.


I have followed this debate very closely and I am strongly opposed to both the process the government has undertaken in relation to bringing the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Declared Fishing Activities) Bill 2012 before the House, and also the actual intent of this legislation and the uncertainty it creates. Quite frankly, this is an absolutely appalling mess. It is chaotic, it is confusing, it has created uncertainty and sovereign risk for the entire fishing industry, and it is illogical.


I was interviewed today by journalists as I walked into Parliament House, and I spoke about the appalling process we have witnessed over the past 48 to 72 hours. Let us cast our minds back to Monday, when the front pages of newspapers were full of headlines about Labor MPs muscling up to the Greens. It was all very hairy-chested stuff. They were going to take on the Greens. Also on Monday we had the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in the Senate, Minister Joe Ludwig, extolling the virtues of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority as an independent body responsible for the sustainable management of Australia's fisheries. In all his comments on Monday and leading up to Monday, he was standing by the science. In all of his public comments, that is what the minister was doing. Then we had this collapse yesterday—this absolute, abject failure of governance—as the government caved in, once again, to a little bit of pressure from the Greens and GetUp! 


I am not sure why Labor members actually bother going to Labor caucus meetings anymore; they only need to log on to GetUp! to find out what their policy position is going to be; they only need to go to a Greens' party meeting to actually find out what they are going to be voting for next week. This root-and-branch review, which was also part of the minister's announcement yesterday, has just opened the door again for more Green madness. This is a classic example of a jellyfish cabinet: there is not a spine amongst them, and, just like a jellyfish, they will cave in the moment there is any pressure whatsoever. Just like a jellyfish, they will float along wherever the political current of the day may take them. And, just like a jellyfish, I am afraid they have not got the brains to chart their own direction. This is an appalling move by the minister for the environment. I knew the minister for the environment had leadership aspirations; I just didn't realise he wanted to lead the Greens!


Let us get to the substance of the issue before the House today. Let us look at the substance of the legislation and what it means to the Australian fishing industry and quite possibly the recreational sector as well. This bill, if it goes through the House today, will provide unfettered power to the minister to act on the basis of what is described as 'social uncertainty'. What is ostensibly an environmental act, the EPBC Act, will now have a clause allowing the minister to take action based on 'social uncertainty'. For the life of me, I am not too sure what that even means. I heard the shadow minister trying to describe it; he said social uncertainty was when Kevin Rudd walked into a room with Julia Gillard, and that is probably as good a definition as I have seen so far. It appears to me, though, that social uncertainty basically relates to being government by Facebook. It is government by GetUp! If you can whip up a bit of public concern on any issue, create some 'social uncertainty', the minister will have unfettered power to shut you down—and not based on any environmental considerations—based on 'social uncertainty'.


It made me think. It gave me pause for thought. Who in Australia right now is good at whipping up public concern with misinformed, emotional, half-baked campaigns? That would be the Australian Greens. The member for Petrie may laugh, but she knows it to be a fact: the Australian Greens are famous for whipping up public concern on half-baked emotional arguments. This amendment is an enormous folly by this government because it plays straight into the hands of their greatest enemy, the Australian Greens, who are the greatest threat to jobs in regional Australia. If this legislation is passed today, this will not be the end of it. The so-called supertrawler will be the sideshow to the big game as far as the Greens are concerned. This will not be the only project that is affected. This will flow on to the entire Australian commercial fishing fleet. If members opposite doubt me, they can just reflect for a moment on the Australian Greens' performance when it comes to the forestry industry. We have seen this all before. They are insatiable—they will never be satisfied. What is to stop the Greens from using this legislation to take on other sectors of the fishing industry which do not meet with their approval and their radical agenda? They can go out there now and start complaining about the size of wheat harvesters. Perhaps they will be complaining that mining excavators are too large.


The Greens exist as a party of protest. The Special Minister of State may snigger, but he knows it to be a fact as well. They are a party of protest. That is the only way they can exist. They cannot exist unless they have something to fight. Just like GetUp!, the entire structure of the Australian Greens is based around running campaigns, calling for donations to run those campaigns, and fighting for something—fighting for anything. They are not a party of responsible government. And the day that this Prime Minister signed a power-sharing agreement with the Greens was a dark day for regional Australia and it was a dark day for the Australian Labor Party, and there are many members opposite who know that. There are many members of the Australian Labor Party who regret that day, who regret that appalling scene where the Prime Minister gave up the prime ministerial courtyard to allow the Greens come in, all beaming smiles as they took charge. There are many members opposite who know that was a huge mistake and a fundamental flaw in the judgement of the current Prime Minister.


The potential impact of this amendment to the act is obvious to anyone who has had any association at all with commercial fishermen. It effectively throws science out the door. It throws the principles of sustainable fisheries management out the door and it virtually throws AFMA out the door as well. It is a vote of no confidence in AFMA by this government.


We have got ourselves into an appalling situation. This nation already has a tightly regulated fishing industry which is one of the most sustainable in the world. I know that to be true because I have heard the minister say it himself. I heard the environment minister, who was previously the minister for fisheries, say that himself. I have heard the current minister say that himself. So we already have a tightly regulated fishing industry—among the most sustainable in the world—but GetUp! does not like one particular allocation of quotas to one particular vessel and the Greens do not like it either; therefore we cave in. Minister, grow a spine. 


The Lakes Entrance fishing fleet in my electorate is, in many ways, no different to this so-called supertrawler. Every fisherman in my electorate understands this. They should be worried about the impacts of this amendment to the act. Just as the so-called supertrawler does, they each have what is called a statutory fishing right attached to their boat. They have a quota, as part of the statutory fishing rights, for species in a small pelagic fishery. Then, to generate what is called the total allowable catch, they have a harvest strategy—and the stock being harvested has been assessed by the CSIRO. So we have leading Australian scientists, recognised as some of the best in the world, making assessments. When the data is considered too old—as has occurred at times in the past—they have adopted what is called the 'precautionary principle' and reduced the total allowable catch. That is exactly the same process which has been applied to this application. That is a process the responsible minister has supported and it is a process which applies to all commercial fishing vessels operating in Commonwealth waters around Australia. That is why all those fishermen in my electorate today are deeply alarmed by the direction this government is taking.


Both the current fisheries minister and the previous minister, who is now bringing this flawed amendment to this chamber, have extolled the virtues of that system—of the way our fisheries have been run for the past five years—ever since they have been ministers. Both of them have extolled the virtues of Australian fisheries and how they are being managed in a sustainable manner. They have described it as world's best practice. Both ministers have spoken in support of AFMA on many occasions. We have had a process which has provided a level of certainty, enabling fishermen right around Australia to invest in the industry with certainty. They have had confidence that decisions affecting the future of their industry would be based on science and that the government was committed to supporting the industry. But, as of yesterday, and as we debate this bill here today, all of that certainty has been thrown away by this government. 


This amendment to the act is reflective of a government in total disarray and in panic. This is a government which falls apart under pressure. I fear that this is the live cattle export issue all over again. It would not be so bad if this were just about politics, but this is about people's lives. Already we know, from the proponent of this particular supertrawler, that 50 jobs will be lost as a direct result of this government's decision. I believe the uncertainty created in the rest of the industry will lead to further job losses. 


The government has form. The live cattle issue had disastrous impacts on the cattle industry. Members opposite say they care about outcomes for Indigenous Australians and I believe they do. But did they consider, in supporting the government's reckless ban on live cattle exports, the impact that would have on Indigenous stockmen? Many lost their jobs.


If we do not have a government which can provide certainty and be responsible in the face of adversity, the Australian people have no reason whatsoever to have faith in any decision this government makes. If we do not have a sustainable fishing industry based on science, what do we base it on? Do we base it on the number of emails we receive? Do we base it on the number of tweets on Twitter? Do we base it on the number of people who have signed the electronic petitions posted by GetUp!? 


A government with any spine whatsoever would go out there and start arguing its case. You could go out there and start arguing the case based on the quota concept. You could argue that the quota has been allocated according to science and that there will be no extra fish caught just because the vessel might be larger. That is a fact. I do not think anyone opposite would argue against that point. So you could make a case based on that argument. Hell, we have done that for the last 20 years or so. That is an approach the government might like to take. 


The government might want to mention that we have an independent authority in place called AFMA and that AFMA is using the best available science Australia can provide. It might want to argue the case on that basis. The government might want to argue the case on the basis that AFMA has found this application acceptable on environmental grounds. Instead the government just caves in—too gutless to make a decision and stick with it. The government could have pointed out that Australia has a long and proud history of sustainable fishery management. It might have pointed out that the Australian fishing industry pays millions of dollars in levies every year to fund these independent assessments and scientific evaluations. It could have done that—or it could just cave in to GetUp! and the Greens. Clearly the environment minister has chosen the latter course of action. 


It is especially disappointing to me because I represent, based at the port of Lakes Entrance, the largest fishing fleet in Australia. Today I have had the chance to speak to fishing industry representatives and they are worried about this government. They are worried the government has closed the door on science and opened the door to the environmental radicals. They know that the quota was sustainable and very precautionary. They know that many scientists, both within AFMA and independent, have made public comments supporting the quota. They make the point, quite rightly, that fisheries management must be based on science and not on politics. They also make the point—and this is the kind of point that fishermen would make—that fish do not actually care if they are killed by a large boat or a small boat. The size of the quota does not change according to the size of the boat. It is the quota allocation which matters; it is the science which matters. 


In conclusion, I will let AFMA themselves provide the final words. As you would expect, AFMA have put out some media releases during the course of this debate. One from 31 May said: 


Quotas are set at sustainable levels using the best available science that takes broader ecosystem impacts into consideration.


Because total catch levels are strictly limited by total allowable catches not quota, the size of the boat does not matter from a sustainability perspective.


…   …   …


As always AFMA will apply strict management, monitoring and compliance powers to ensure any boat operating in the fishery is doing so sustainably.


On Monday, they put out a further statement which said:


As an independent government regulator, AFMA takes advice from Australia's and the world's best scientists to set sustainable catch limits. Total catch limits are less than 10 per cent of the fish stock, which is far more stringent than internationally accepted standards.


…   …   …


This type of fishing, midwater trawling, is one of the most selective which means the bycatch will be very low. AFMA works closely with fishers to minimise bycatch and they will be required to follow several rules to ensure wildlife isn't impacted.


The science shows that localised depletion is unlikely in this fishery but AFMA will be keeping a close eye on this issue given the concerns raised.


It says 'AFMA will be keeping a close eye on this issue' because that is what AFMA does. It is a tightly regulated industry. AFMA will often have observers on our boats. In this case, I understand, there is going to be some video monitoring of the activities. 


We had a system in place. People understood it. It provided certainty, it provided confidence, and the fishing industry could invest in the future knowing that the government would stand by it—until yesterday and until this bill came before the House this morning.


In closing, I simply say: the coalition support sustainable fisheries management and sustainable fisheries practices. All fishermen should be concerned that the powers in this bill could be used against any of them and, indeed, that they could easily be extended to further reduce access to any natural resource in the future. This legislation is just another sad example of this government caving in to the Greens. It is just another tool for the Greens and other environmental groups who campaign against our fishing industry and another example of why Australians want an election. They simply do not trust this government to get anything right.

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2012-09-12,"



Mr KELVIN THOMSON
 (Wills) (13:31):  Last week, I participated in a debate at the University of Melbourne where the Institute of Public Affairs spokesman attacked the Labor government as being elitist, out of touch with ordinary people, out of touch with their supporters. But today I heard Liberal Senator Abetz on the radio, attacking the bill before the House as 'populist' and a 'knee-jerk reaction' to public opinion. Well, make up your mind, guys. You cannot have it both ways. Either Labor are out of touch with what people want or we are doing what people want. In this case, it is blindingly obvious that we are indeed doing what the public wants—and what, Senator Abetz, is wrong with that?


What is wrong with doing what fishermen want us to do? What is wrong, Senator Abetz, with us listening to Colin Stephenson of Spreyton, in your home state of Tasmania, who says that stocks of Australian salmon in Bass Strait were overfished by trawlers in the 1960s and took decades to recover? What is wrong, Senator Abetz, with us listening to Burnie fishing store owner Rodney Howard, also in your home state, who said that he and other commercial operators feared for their livelihoods if the supertrawler was permitted to operate, saying, 'There will be a huge decline in game fishing because if bait isn't there, the big fish won't be either'? What is wrong, Senator Abetz, with the government listening to the 350 recreational fishermen who towed 100 boats from Devonport to Burnie in July, or the 200 cars which drove through Hobart or the 150 cars with boats attached which travelled by convoy through Launceston on the same day? Senator Abetz might not be interested in listening to the views of his Tasmanian constituents, but we are. And what is wrong with listening to the recreational anglers of Warrnambool in western Victoria, or the Warrnambool city councillors, who said there was potential for the supertrawler to take most of the food supply for fish targeted by recreational anglers in western Victoria?


In the same vein, I was intrigued to hear some of the media questioning of the government ministers yesterday along the lines of, 'Aren't you caving in to public pressure?' Are the questioners suggesting that there is something noble and honourable about thumbing your nose at public opinion? They imply and suggest that we should overlook or ignore public opinion, yet they are the first to accuse us of being out of touch and to foster cynicism about the political process and its failure to deliver what people want from it. That is fundamentally undemocratic and elitist. Frankly, governments should make a habit of caving in to public opinion. They would get elected and re-elected more often if they did.


To listen to those opposite spitting the dummy over this bill, the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Amendment (Declared Fishing Activities) Bill 2012, is very revealing. They cannot bear the idea of a win for people power. For them, it is a revolutionary threat to business's cosy, predictable domination of political discourse. For them it is unbearable, quite intolerable.


I want to quote at some length Tim Winton's speech to MPs here in Canberra back on 9 May, because, try as I might, I cannot improve on his words:


Think of your happiest moments, your most vivid memories. A holiday. Summer. It's always summer, isn't it? 


…   …   …


In mine I'm always standing on a beach, beside an estuary, on a jetty. Holding a fishing rod. Or a net, a mask and snorkel. Hunting and gathering is in my blood. As a boy I loved the freedom, the direct engagement with the physical world, the feeling of competence. Now, I didn't know it at the time but I'd inherited two great treasures: a cultural tradition and the living ocean that sustains it.


…   …   …


Australians are islanders. Coastal people. Almost all of us live on the edge of the world's biggest island. On the veranda of the continent. … This is what we tap into when we go on holiday now. … That yearning is deeply embedded. We still want to engage with our physical surroundings. And the thing is we can. In the developed world that's rare.


…   …   …


During my own lifetime the world's oceans have suffered a terrible decline. I've read about it. And I've seen it up close and ugly. When I lived in Greece I saw the results of oil spills, dynamite fishing, lax regulation. I've surfed in raw sewage in Indonesia and putrid medical waste in Brazil. And I've wondered: am I swimming in the future? Will my grandkids inherit a sea of … plastic? The global trends aren't great. Collapsing fisheries, dying corals, gyres of plastic the size of entire countries, catastrophic oil spills that ruin the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of fishing families and poison the food chain for decades.


He went on to say:


We all know we're pushing the ocean too hard. And the pressure to relegate marine protection—to defer it—that pressure is intense. And the balance is not in the ocean's favour. Taking a loss has become business as usual. …


We have to stop spending beyond our means. Robbing Peter to pay Paul. Otherwise we'll be the generation—the richest, most mobile and well-educated generation in Australia's history—that passes on a dud inheritance, and leaves the estate in arrears. Bequeathing a loss to a family, a community, a nation, that's a despicable thing to do. 'Kids, all this … plastic is yours. Don't spend it all at once.'


It is being claimed that this bill represents a repudiation of the science and a repudiation of the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, the experts. I want to draw the attention of the House to a letter from Professor Jessica Meeuwig, Conservation Fellow of the Zoological Society of London and Director of the Centre for Marine Futures, Oceans Institute, University of Western Australia, in which she makes the following points:




Increasing the total allowable catch to 18,000 tonnes represents an unsupported 10-fold increase over previous landings. This is a significant increase from one year to the next. The calculation of this new quota assumes that the estimates of biomass are reliable. It is notable that the estimates are generally based on old information (blue mackerel in the East 2004), 
inferred from other species (jack mackerel
—
East) or actually entirely absent (jack mackerel
—W
est, 
Peruvian jack mackerel, redbait—
West). It is
 … 
l
ikely that biomass estimates … 
are much more uncertain than is currently reported


...


such assessments do not allow us to infer that the populations


will remain sustainably fished with a sudden 10-fold increase in landings as would be allowed under the new quotas.





To address concerns around localized depletion and hyperdepletion that may occur when super trawlers are active, we need to understand population structure (how do young fish recruit across the region?) and adult movements (will adults replenish depleted areas?). Yet again, our information is uncertain. Of the four species considered for exploitation, the population structure of blue mackerel is uncertain, whilst jack mackerel and redbait are believed to have eastern and western subpopulations
.


In addition no dedicated studies have been conducted on redbait, and no stock structure information is available for Peruvian jack mackerel, a species that is often assumed to behave like its cousin, the jack mackerel, despite having very different 
life history characteristics.





N
othing is known about adult movements in any of these species except that larger jack mackerel are found in deeper waters. In the event of localized depletions by the super trawler, we therefore have no evidence that these regions will be replenished by eith
er mobile adults or recruits—





M
any forage fish have been or are being overexploited; their rapid growth rates and high reproductive output are not sufficient to protect them against the sustained rates of harvest of super trawlers


... the species available to the super trawler (blue mackerel, jack mackerel, Peruvian jack mackerel and redbait) are larger, live


longer, and feed higher up the food chain than do species typically classed as forage fish


... the species potentially allocated to the super trawler show great similarity with cool water, reef-associated species already recognized as vulnerable to overexploitation


... in Western Australia.





Bycatch is a concern. In a study fur seals, interacted—





which is a polite word for 
'
killed
'
—





with over 50% of all mid-water trawl shots ... most fishing activity occurred on the shelf ... within the animals diving range... It is unclear... how fur seals would respond to a much larger net in terms of their ability to maintain orientation and exit the net, particularly given its substantially larger size.





We have a set of species that we know little about that are relatively vulnerable to overfishing based on their life history... We do know from global experience that super trawlers are incredibly efficient and can cause local depletions, from which these species may not recover quickly. We also know that super trawlers have been  problematic globally in terms of their sustainability. Opening Australian waters to a super trawler at a time when our knowledge base for this species is uncertain is risky and inconsistent with the precautionary principle.





This proposal for a super trawler is clearly an example where significant uncertainty exists in biological knowledge, both in terms of the species themselves and their unfished biomass.





She says she had the privilege of introducing the documentary 
The End of the Line
 for a showing at Parliament's theatre in 2011. At the time, she was asked
: 'H
ow is this relevant to Australia? We don't have this kind of highly industrialized super trawling here.
' 
She concludes by saying:





At a time when Australia is leading the world in marine conservation by establishing a legacy network of reserves, it seems incredibly counterproductive and short sighted to introduce more unnecessary opportunities for the overexploitation of our oceans.





There have been claims made that banning the 
super
trawler will lead to job losses. However
,
 I have been advised by the Australian Maritim
e Officers Union, Jan Thompson—
no relation
—
that the 
super
trawler is crewed by about 50 Croatian nationals.


Sea Fish has shown no interest in a collective agreement with the union, save fo
r last week saying it wanted a m
aster and chief engineer for approximately one month. Sea Fish has said the workers on the vessel are 
tec
hnically sub
contractors who do not work for wages but for a percentage of the catch. This raises questions about the applicable 'market salary rate' in the event that such workers were to apply for 457 visas, not that there
 i
s any sign that they have.


If t
he Liberal Party genuinely want
 to help these Croatian workers, they should start advocating that
,
 while the vessel works in international waters
,
 the workers should be paid the minimum rates as per the International Transport
 Workers'
 Federation 
a
greement.





I want to pay tribute to some of my colleagues who have spoken previously in this debate. I was first contacted about this issue by the 
m
ember for Corangamite, Darren Cheeseman, who explained to me the 
super
trawler proposal and the level of opposition to it coming from both environmental groups and fishermen. I was subsequently contacted by environmental groups about the issue, and wrote to Minister Ludwig about it in July. At the invitation of Julianne Bell of Protectors of Public Lands, I attended a protest rally at St Kilda Beach on what was described as Stop the Super Trawler National Day of Action
,
 on 11 August.





I
 also
 want to pay tribute to the 
m
ember for Fremantle, Melissa Parke, who prepared a private member
'
s bill to stop the 
super
trawler, which has been a wonderful catalyst for government action. In their five years here both Darren and Melissa have proved to be courageous and articulate advocates for the
 environment and animal welfare—
quite outstanding. I should also acknowledge the other 
g
overnment speakers
—
the 
m
ember for Hindmarsh, Steve Georganas, the 
m
ember for Makin, Tony Zappia, and the 
m
ember for Shortland, Jill Hall. I want their constituents and people right around Australia with a concern for the environment or animal welfare to know that they have committed and courageous 
representatives who stand
 up on these issues, both when it is fashionable and when it is not.





When you stand up and advocate the cause of ot
her living things like seals, 
dolphins or sea birds, these other living things are blissfully ignorant that you
 a
re doing it, so the political reward for your actions is often unclear and the political cost is often very clear.


But
,
 in acknowledging the work 
both of 
the 
Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities and of 
the 
m
ember for Fremantle, the 
m
ember for Corangamite, the 
m
ember for Hindmarsh, the 
m
ember for Makin
 and
 the 
m
ember for Shortland,


these colleagues 
who have
 helped bring about this 
b
ill, I want to return to some
 words from Tim Winton:





When your grandkids ask you what you did as a member of parliament some of them, I'll admit, will be entranced by your stories of tax reform. Stands to reason. They'll love the story about
 that parliamentary committee. 
But think of the day when you help your granddaughter reel in her first flathead, the day you take your nephew to the aquarium, the morning you take your grandkids snorkelling in a marine sanctuary and their eyes are out on sticks. There's always that quiet moment you get on the way home. After they've seen that turtle, those dolphins, the rockpool full of life. That'll be when you let it slip. Offhand. You know, real casual, about what you did when you were in parliament. You helped save Australia's oceans.





With marine parks and with this 
b
ill,
 these members
 have helped save Australia's 
o
ceans, and whatever else 
they 
do in 
their p
arliamentary careers, 
their children and grand
children will be very much indebted to 
them 
and Australia 
will be 
a better place for 
their 
contribution to it.

Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (13:45):  I rise to speak on last weekend's Malayali Association of Townsville end-of-harvest festival. It was truly a great day. I was there with Councillor Pat Ernst, Bishop Michael Putney and a host of beautiful people. Malayali Indians are great learners and greater travellers. Many of Townsville's doctors, nurses, surgeons, engineers and radiologists are Malayali Indians. The first Malayali Indian arrived in Townsville in 1994; there are now over 170 Malayali families in Townsville. As a matter of fact, I sold Apeson Korah, who is the head radiologist at Townsville Hospital, his house at Alligator Creek.


Like Lent and Ramadan, the end-of-harvest festival is a feast after a fast. Malayalis are like Italians and Greeks—they are all about the family, the food and having fun with children. I thank them for their friendship and for including me in their festival. I thank them most of all for not allowing me to win the water-drinking competition; I would have been ashamed if I had won that one! I thank them for the song, the dance and the food. There was this ginger chutney which you could have eaten a kilo of on your own—it was absolutely magnificent.


The Malayali Indians are what is good about immigration. They are what is good about Townsville. They are what is good about multiculturalism and diversity in this country. I thank them for their friendship, and I hope that they are there forever.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
) (14:00):  Mr Speaker has asked me to thank the honourable member for Lyne for his question yesterday in relation to supplementary questions for the crossbench and has provided me with the following statement to read in reply:


While pursuant to Standing Order 101(b) the Speaker, or other occupant of the chair, has unfettered discretion with respect to supplementary questions, in an endeavour to make Question Time more spontaneous, on 7 and 8 February 2012 I outlined what would be my general approach to supplementary questions on a trial basis.


The effect of this approach means that usually:


(a) One supplementary question can be asked by the Leader of the Opposition or his or her delegate specifically, and up to one additional supplementary question can be asked by any opposition member, including the Leader of the Opposition, each day;


(b) Up to two supplementary questions can be asked by government private members each day;


(c) One supplementary question can be asked, each week by a non-aligned member.


This general approach does not override Standing Order 101(b) which gives the occupant of the chair unfettered discretion with respect to supplementary questions. In fact, I allowed two crossbench supplementary questions on 27 February 2012 and 1 March 2012 during the same sitting week, but this was not intended to be a regular practice.


As I considered the ability to ask supplementary questions had introduced a welcome dynamic into Question Time in a statement on 22 March 2012, I advised I was considering expanding the number of supplementary questions and also allowing one side to ask supplementary questions to an original question asked by the other side.


I have not yet had the opportunity to implement these further innovations but plan to consider them upon my return to the chair.


I trust this clarifies the matter raised by the Honourable Member for Lyne.

That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for North Sydney from moving the following motion forthwith:


That this House:


(1) condemns this Government for failing to adequately detail how it will pay for its $120 billion of new spending on disability services, additional funding for aged care, new funding for low-paid workers, increased costs of its border protection failures, funding of new defence projects, establishment of a new dental care scheme, and provision of additional education funding for everyone everywhere;


(2) calls on the Treasurer to immediately explain which new or increased taxes will be introduced to fund the Government's $120 billion Budget black hole; and


(3) further condemns the Government for refusing to release Treasury's taxpayer funded costings of Greens taxation policies, and rejects the Government's claims that the documents would ""allow a direct inference to be drawn about subsequent Cabinet deliberations"", and that they contained ""material prepared to inform deliberations of Government"".


This mob cannot continue to be hypocrites in the House. They need to come clean about their $120 billion hole. What—

Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Manager of Opposition Business) (15:28):  I second the motion. The Treasurer needs to come into the House and explain: where is the money coming from? The Treasurer appears to take his financial advice from Norman Lindsay. He seems to think there is a magic pudding somewhere and every time you take a slice it grows back. A government that promised before the last election, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead,' will never be believed by the Australian people that it will be able to fund its $120 billion of unfunded promises which it is using to bribe the Australian people at the next election. 




Mr Albanese:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I would ask that that comment be withdrawn.

  Madam Deputy Speaker, on a point of order, I refer to the sixth edition—for the first time, I think, in this chamber—of the House of Representatives Practice at page 261, which goes to the suspension of standing orders:

The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
) (15:42):  Mr Speaker has received letters from the honourable member for Lyne, the honourable member for North Sydney and the honourable member for Petrie proposing that definite matters of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion today. As required by standing order 46(d), Mr Speaker has selected the matter which, in his opinion, is the most urgent and important; that is, that proposed by the honourable member for Lyne, namely: 


The importance of education for regional and disadvantaged communities and concern about cuts in education budgets.


I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places.

"Oakeshott, Robert, MP",Ind.,2012-09-12,"



Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (15:43):  Normally everyone gets to their feet, so obviously this is a divisive topic. This is important, because for regional and disadvantaged communities education does matter. There is a great deal of concern in the mid-North Coast of New South Wales, as I know there is in many other regions of Australia, about cuts underway in the education budgets of various governments. 


I do not raise this point for any party-political reason. I am not advocating one side or the other. I am advocating the education strategy that has been taking place on the mid-North Coast over the last four years. It has been making a difference to the lives of many. It has been building resilience among many individuals who have previously faced generational disadvantage. As a consequence, this local strategy on education has been helping build the resilience of the community.


This is not to kick one political party or another. It is to try to get governments to recognise the value of education and the value of investment in education in public policy. Of all the areas not to cut first, it would be education. 


Yesterday we saw New South Wales cut $1.7 billion from the New South Wales public and private education sectors. I would imagine there will be other members speak in this debate about what is going on in other states. In New South Wales we have seen announcements of $116 million cut from independent schools over four years; $201 million cut from public schools over four years; 800 TAFE teachers to go; TAFE fees to increase by 9.5 per cent thus pushing up the cost of the lower level entry courses, the certificate I or II courses, by $44; adding $150 to advanced diplomas; and, subsidies for certain TAFE courses to be scrapped.


I also understand yesterday in New South Wales that the department of education announced they will shed 600 jobs from state and regional offices, and 400 jobs are to go as a result of an online management strategy. All of this totals 1,800 department jobs cut. This is in the context not of Australia being one of the world leaders investing in education; this is all in the context of Australia being ranked 18th in the industrial world in educational investment. This will now over time, more than likely, take us further backwards.


Part of raising this issue today is to start to challenge the myth that this is somehow being done for necessary savings in various state budgets. I put it to the House that this is not about savings of a necessary nature at all. When you look at various state budgets you see that, rather than being necessary savings across the board, this is more about choice. This is more about the lack of commitment to education as a public policy area compared to other areas in state budget spends.


In New South Wales, for example, we have seen, not only in the last 12 months, but for at least the last five and possibly 10 years, an intense focus on Sydney metropolitan transport needs and the investment needs of that area of public policy alone. In this year's New South Wales state budget, supposedly the tough-love savings budget, we have seen $8 billion committed to new Sydney metropolitan transport projects. One of them, the North West Rail Link—I fully understand, is a growth corridor in the Sydney urban area—is not recognised on the Infrastructure Australia planning priority lists. It is not recognised by the New South Wales infrastructure planning priority needs. It runs into a bottleneck called the Sydney Harbour Bridge which only has two lines across it. So it is only adding to the congestion problems of urban transport issues in Sydney. It is being done with an allocation this year of $3 billion.


So, the choice is between $3 billion going to a questionable, highly politically motivated infrastructure request for the North West Rail Link in Sydney or the Pacific Highway completion—the one item on the New South Wales infrastructure and Infrastructure Australia needs that is said to be a priority. The second item would be not to do the education cuts that were announced yesterday. It is not a necessary savings argument at all. This is a choice argument between education needs or completing the Pacific Highway, or a highly questionable—not on the infrastructure planning needs of New South Wales—highly politically charged $3 billion commitment to the North West Rail Link and say, 'Thanks for voting for the Liberal and National parties in New South Wales.' It is not savings—it is choice.



Mr Ruddock interjecting—




Mr OAKESHOTT:
  The implications of that choice are that many in disadvantaged areas right across New South Wales are going to miss out on the opportunities to aspire to education or to participate in the universities that the Father of the House attended. Those opportunities will be lost to many students in New South Wales as a consequence of political promises. That is not good public policy development and that is not fairness or equity at all.


There is very clear educational data that all political and parliamentary chambers in Australia need to recognise. We are letting down the future standard of living of Australia and losing many opportunities to allow generational disadvantage to be turned into opportunities via people engaging in education and building opportunities for those individuals. The educational data is in three very clear categories.


In New South Wales a National Party education minister directly challenges opportunities and makes cuts to opportunities for regional students. The educational data says there is about a 30 per cent gap in educational outcomes for those from regional areas compared to their metropolitan cousins. Likewise lower SES communities, poorer communities, compared to their more affluent cousins have roughly a 30 per cent difference in educational outcomes. The third very clear dataset is the comparison between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal communities with, again, roughly a 25 to 30 per cent difference in educational outcomes.


Yesterday's announcement in New South Wales does not help one zack. In fact, it makes it harder and it entrenches that gap. The choice between that lovely North West Rail Link promise, the $3 billion, or continuing to commit to building opportunity for regional New South Wales, for poorer communities and for Aboriginal students to engage in TAFE, in post school options and in vocational and tertiary education is now threatened, challenged and made more difficult by this choice that has been taken in New South Wales.



Mr Ruddock interjecting—




Mr OAKESHOTT:
  The Father of the House continues to bang on about it being a promise. I do not question that it was a promise, but you would then have to acknowledge that part of that promise—




Mr Ruddock:
  You wanted to be like the Labor government here.




Mr OAKESHOTT:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, the Father of the House is highly agitated. Part of that promise being committed to means more disadvantaged students will have less opportunity to engage in education. If the Father of the House is going to say we delivered on our promise, he has to acknowledge that part of that promise relates to a choice—there are cuts in education of $1.7 billion and that has implications for the standard of living in many communities right throughout New South Wales and other states where similar cuts in education have been occurring.


So this is a problem. We are trying to get agreement on a new funding model in schools. We are working in the post-Bradley environment to lift aspirations for vocational and tertiary education engagement. Early success stories are happening in that post-Bradley environment. The point of the exercise was to target those three areas—educational disadvantage, engage better, change funding models—and put some pressure on universities. Early results are saying that is delivering. Gonski is a similar model. It is basically targeting those three areas and placing some pressure on the education system to engage better than it has done in the past. So why in New South Wales would we introduce cuts when we are trying to change the funding model, add more money and really lift education outcomes for all has me and I know many in this chamber completely stumped.


As a local member I have worked hard in making education central to the strategy of not only lifting aspiration and opportunities for the disadvantaged but also, in parallel, driving to get better employment outcomes in the local area. The Mid-North Coast now has the lowest unemployment figures in the history of the electorate of Lyne. My view is that a big part of that is that many locals have participated in three education and skills forums that are now operating in three different communities. They have been trying to be strategic by getting the highly competitive schools sector working more closely together and the schools sector and the vocational and tertiary education sectors working more closely together, and actually trying to give meaning to many of those cliched lines like 'collaboration not competition' and 'building pathways', turning them into something of a practical nature that does deliver.


We have purposely through this process targeted many people who are the first in their family to ever go to a university. On the Mid-North Coast, surprisingly to some, only 12 per cent of 25-35 year-olds have a bachelor's degree or higher. That may be a different story in seats like the one the Father of the House represents, and therefore he may not understand what on earth I am talking about when I refer to engaging disadvantaged communities through education. It is a huge challenge. To be the first in the family to walk through the door of a university is a big step, a challenging step, and a step that quite often is easily lost through something as simple as paperwork, something as simple as some of those procedures like when to put in a form, how to put in a form or who to talk to. Many in this chamber may take that sort of thing for granted because they have been through that whole tertiary education experience. Targeting first in family has been a big part of our local strategy—that lifting aspiration within individuals, within households and within communities has been a big part of that strategy.


Yesterday's announcement does not help a zack—it pushes it backwards. I am frankly astounded that it is a National Party education minister and the National Party in New South Wales that has allowed this to happen. This is supposed to be the National Party market—the regional, poor and Aboriginal sectors are all supposed to be National Party heartland; they are all mainly, by comparison, populations represented by National Party MPs at a state level. It is time for them to step up. The state National Party MPs must fight their National Party education minister in New South Wales because it is their communities who are going to be hit most by these cuts and it is the children in those communities who will miss out on their opportunities in the short and the long term.


Education matters. Everyone says that, but what are we going to do about it? We have to invest in it and fight against cuts like those that happened in New South Wales yesterday and that have occurred in the Queensland budget and in the Victorian TAFE sector. These cuts seem to be happening right across the board with too much frequency. (Time expired)

"Garrett, Peter, MP",ALP,2012-09-12,"



Mr GARRETT
 (Kingsford Smith—Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (15:58):  I assure the member for Lyne that this Labor government recognises the crucial importance of education in the life of the nation, particularly for those who are at school and making their way along their learning journey. I agree with him that it is a clear question of choice—whether governments are prepared to make the necessary investments to ensure that all children in all schools are educated to the greatest capacity. He is right; I do note there is a significant gap for regional students. It is one that, as a government, we are very well aware of, as we are very well aware of the challenges faced by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students.


Education is the great enabler. That is something that this Labor government understands and believes in strongly, and we will do everything within our power to bring improvements in education to fruition.


It is the difference for many people between poverty and prosperity. It is a way out of disadvantage. Particularly for those living in communities away from the cities, perhaps with a lesser degree of service or opportunity, it is absolutely crucial to their capacity to be the kind of person they want to be and to have the jobs they desire for the future. And there is no question at all about the linkages that occur when we talk about education and productivity. Just by simply completing year 12, we are adding over 10 per cent to an individual's income. We can see that the jobs for highly skilled Australians are growing at a rate much greater than those for lower skilled employees. So for anyone listening to this debate, anyone concerned about the future prospects of young Australians, education is absolutely central.


I do note there are significant regional student disadvantages. We see non-metropolitan students scoring lower on the Australian Early Development Index, so that means fewer students going on to university than has been the case before; although, as the member noted, we are seeing welcome increases in parts of the country. The fact remains that in a state like New South Wales almost 35 per cent of students from metropolitan areas who complete year 12 go on to university; only slightly more than 10 per cent of students from non-metropolitan areas do. The necessity for us to make sure that we have an appropriate focus and level of support for students in remote, in rural and from disadvantaged communities is absolutely understood.


Look at what this government has already done in making sure that education sits right in the middle of our agenda and in providing the necessary reform, focus and investment nationwide. For the first time, we have a national curriculum. They said it could not be done. For the first time we have the MySchool website providing an unparalleled amount of information for parents, for communities and for teachers on how schools are travelling. The testing that is now done for the first time through NAPLAN provides an opportunity for us to get a strong sense of how our students are achieving and identifies what we as governments need to do to help them achieve better.


The quantum of funding from this Labor government has been significant—about $65 billion over a funding cycle, nearly double what was paid and invested by the previous Howard government. It is the case that the Gonski panel review found amongst other things that we now are in a period of educational decline in comparison to our international counterparts, a decline that is judged to start from around the year 2000, a decline which reflects in part the neglect on the part of the former government to make sure that education policy and investment was being applied in appropriate measure.


We have had national partnerships on literacy and numeracy for teacher quality into low-SES communities, national partnerships that have been applied across jurisdictions, into states and across school systems—government and non-government. It is particularly important for people to understand that not only has this government provided more investment but it has made sure that that investment is shared between states so that they are able to put into practice in their schools those programs that can make a difference, and shared across systems as well, government and non-government. The fact is we have been through a period of unprecedented reform and investment in education, a reflection of this government's understanding about how crucial education will be to the prospects of the nation in the future.


Let us think for a moment about the environment we inhabit: we have skills shortages identified as a crucial issue for us; we have the Asian century as it is called under way with a number of nations to our north competing vigorously, with their education systems performing well and with additional economic and political weight; we have a globalised economy where the tempo of economic activity in our region is increasing; and we have a concomitant requirement to make sure that every young Australian has the skills they need to get the high-paying jobs of the future to be able to compete in that global environment and to set us up as a nation for future sustainable prosperity. It is the young people going to school now who are our most important national resource for the future and it is those young people that we are focused on and have been focused on ever since we came to government.


We have announced that we are willing to sit down and start working with the states on what we call, rightly, the National Plan for School Improvement. This comes on the back of the first serious look at education funding we have had in the 40 years, the Gonski panel review into funding. Mr Gonski, a Sydney businessman, with an eminent panel of educationists from across the education sectors and across the political landscape delivered to governments and to this government a report with clear findings: we are experiencing education decline and there is a growing gap among students from low socio-economic communities and others in their educational attainment. The Gonski panel recommended we ought to give consideration to a way of funding education that is based on the identified needs of students in all schools, and we have agreed to do that. We are willing to do that and we are going to do that. But everybody has a role to play. It is about choice and it is about commitment. Our choice is for the students in Australian schools now and in the future. Our commitment is to ensure they have the support they need to be the best they can be. I was pleased to see Andreas Schleicher, the ED of the OECD Education Directorate, make some welcoming comments to the way in which this government has responded to the Gonski panel. It is particularly important given that we still sit a little below the OECD average when it comes to investment in education.


So I think that any fair-minded assessment of what this government, firstly, has done; and, secondly, intends to do, would need to recognise both the level of support and investment in education, the amount of reform that has happened for the first time—reform that has involved education stakeholders, the states and the Commonwealth—and also the challenge in front of us. And that is the most important challenge that this nation faces: how do we set ourselves up for the future, how do we make sure that every young Australian is educated to their full capacity and is able to get the jobs of the future which pay better and which contribute significantly to our national income?


We are very clear about the choices that we want to make as a government. I was pleased to be able to indicate to states that I think the loadings that were recommended by Gonski panel in relation to both low-SES and to Indigenous ought to be amended to provide additional opportunities for support for students in low-socioeconomic communities. We will potentially increase that loading from the 25 per cent quartile to the 50 per cent; and for the Indigenous loading, recognise that any Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander kid in any school deserves a level of support, and that is what we will be proposing and putting to the states.


The member for Lyne's matter of public importance addresses not only how significant education is for regional and disadvantaged communities but also concerns about cuts in education budgets. The fact is now that, wherever we look, and wherever there is a coalition government in power, the first thing that they do is apply cuts in education and cuts in health. In New South Wales we now have a $1.7 billion cut in education that has been put forward by the minister. The consequences and the scale of that cut are extremely significant: 600 jobs going from public education; 400 jobs from the front offices; $116 million that comes out from the non-government schools that the Leader of the Opposition believes is in his DNA to support, and that it is an injustice to support government schools—but I will let that go. But what this means, as that sector tells us, is fewer teachers, less support for disadvantaged students; and 800 jobs are to go from TAFE as well.


And we are seeing it in other states—in Victoria, stripping funding from schools to pay for things like excursions and pencils for children from low-income families; and in Queensland, cutting funding to principals and parents organisations, and to music and literacy initiatives. At the end of the day, I say to members opposite: you are judged in government and in opposition by the commitments you make to better the capacity for every Australian to do the best that they can and to have the best education made available to them.


When it comes to the question of choice, from coalition governments in states all we have seen so far is a willingness to cut education and other services. After 16 years of continuous investment in New South Wales—it has been 16 years since cuts of the magnitude that are proposed by the O'Farrell government have been in place—we hear very clearly the kind of impact that those cuts will have.


But I think, in concluding, it is important for us to join the dots. Because the fact is that we have had a commitment to education in this parliament that is significant, substantial and which we want to have endure. In order to do that, we have to look at what the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer and the shadow minister have got on offer on education. They have on offer already identified cuts in education of $2.8 billion. The shadow minister was jumping up yesterday saying, 'There are no cuts! There are no cuts!' I simply refer him to the announcements by the leader and by the shadow Treasurer in the budget reply. They are all there; on the record.


But there is more than that. When he has been asked about whether there will be additional cuts in education, the shadow minister has never ruled them out. When he was asked by Paul Bongiorno, he effectively conceded that that would happen. As well as that, when we were talking about the level of investment that had been a feature of New South Wales Labor governments in the past here in the House, the member for Sturt thought that this was a matter of some hilarity.


We stand at a really important point here because, if we are going to make sure that we set ourselves up for the future, everybody knows that an investment in education is absolutely necessary. If we are going to make sure that young Australians in school now are able to come through into those jobs in the future, they need the access to TAFE, they need the support within the school setting—and, if they are regional students, they need it especially. We have recognised that in our National Plan for School Improvement. We have indicated a willingness to contribute additional investment to ensure that the needs of every Australian student in education are met. It is those opposite, the Leader of the Opposition and state Liberal-National Party governments which are now, at this point in time, doing the complete opposite—sending us as a nation in the wrong direction and, as a matter of choice, applying cuts to the very things that we need to see supported in the future.


When the shadow Treasurer was asked this morning, three times, whether he would rule out cuts to education and called education 'a waste', he made perfectly clear the coalition's position on  this issue—and I have made ours perfectly clear as well. (Time expired)

"Tudge, Alan, MP",LP,2012-09-12,"



Mr TUDGE
 (Aston) (16:13):  There is a lot of hypocrisy that we have to put up with in this chamber, coming from the other side of the House, but perhaps the greatest hypocrisy we have seen today has come from the member for Lyne. We heard the member for Lyne speak for 15 minutes almost exclusively on issues concerned with chambers other than this one. In front of us today, the government has proposals to implement the Gonski review—a government the member for Lyne is holding up—whose proposals would see 3,254 schools lose funding. This is the main game in front of us today, because the predominant funding which is provided from the federal government to Catholic and independent schools, and the minority funding to public schools, is in front of us now. When the government signs off on this agreement, when this parliament passes this agreement, it will lock in funding for the next four years.


What this agreement is likely to do, according to analysis done by departments of education and the independent and Catholic school sectors, is that 3,254 schools are going to lose their funding. Hundreds of schools in regional Australia are going to be targeted. Very low fee Catholic schools in my electorate are going to be targeted. For example, St Luke's School, a small Catholic school in my electorate, which charges about $1,000 in fees, is going to lose $756 per student under the proposals which the minister just said that he was keen to implement. Our Lady of Lourdes, another small Catholic school in my electorate, is due to lose $576 per student under these proposals.


According to the modelling which has been done by the independent and Catholic school sectors and the education department, in the electorate of the member for Lyne, the member who moved this motion, there are 22 schools that would lose funding under the proposals that are currently being considered by the government. Bobin Public School, for example, is going to lose $135,000 and Taree Public School is going to lose $694,000. I would be pleased to table this list for the benefit of the member for Lyne so he can see the schools in his electorate that are potentially under threat if the government moves forward with the proposals that are in front of it today.


The front page of the Sunday Tasmanianhas the headline 'Gonski hit list'—more than 80 Tasmanian Catholic and government schools would lose funding under the proposals. This is what is in front of us today, in this chamber, proposed by this government with the support of the member for Lyne. But he did not mention that once in his 15-minute address. Instead he spent his entire time talking about activities which are going on in other parliaments in this nation over which he has no control.


This analysis which has been done on the Gonski proposals talks about what would occur in year one in terms of funding cuts for those schools. But it is not just about the immediate hit that would occur to schools; there is also the medium-term hit which would occur to schools under the government's proposals. In the medium and longer term, the key issue that schools look at is the indexation rate for future funding increases. We on this side of the House have guaranteed that schools funding will increase by six per cent—year on year on year. On the other side of the chamber they have acknowledged—and the Prime Minister said this the other day—that the indexation rate would no longer apply and, in fact, a lower indexation rate would be applied going forward. This has implications for every single school across the country. The reason we are committed to a six per cent increase is that it matches what school costs have been increasing by. If there is a lower indexation rate, that means every single school across the country will have funding increases which are lower than what school cost increases are. For Catholic and independent schools, that means fees will have to go up considerably.


That is the main issue in terms of what is in front of us today on Gonski. But this is not the only time when the government has cut funding to schools or, indeed, has broken promises of funding to schools. I would like to highlight, for example, the Reward for School Improvement program, which the government promised in the lead-up to the last election. It was a program to provide between $75,000 and $100,000 to high schools that showed fantastic improvement, with year one reward payments to be provided in 2013. But we know that this program has been quietly dropped by the government. We heard from officials at Senate estimates that no longer is it going to be delivered in 2013. We heard that it would be delivered in 2015 at the earliest.


This program was a key condition of Mr Oakeshott, the member for Lyne, signing up to put the Labor Party into government. I have the agreements in front of me. On page 7, under 'Regional Education Investments', it says that at least $125 million of reward payments would be awarded to schools in regional Australia that have shown the most improvement in student outcomes. It was a key condition of the member for Lyne signing up and keeping Prime Minister Gillard in the Lodge, yet it is no longer going to be delivered. If the member for Lyne had any integrity, he would hold the government to account for that—but he has not; he has not said a damned thing.


Can I also give a bit of advice to the government, to the Labor Party, while I am here. If they are going to break an election promise, can I suggest that they take their election commitments down from their website. It is still actively displayed on their website that they are going to deliver this promise by 2013. I know that they took down from their website their commitment to not having a carbon tax. I would suggest that, given that you are going to break this promise also, you take the Reward for School Improvement program down from your website. It is another broken promise that is not going to be delivered and, while it is on your government website, you provide false hope for schools and school communities right across the country.


Let me continue with other cuts. The Computers in Schools program, which was introduced with great fanfare by Kevin Rudd at the 2007 election, is no longer being talked about. It has quietly disappeared. It is not going to occur anymore. But we have not heard a thing from the member for Lyne or, indeed, the education minister in relation to what has happened to the Computers in Schools program. It is the same with the trade training centres program, another program that was introduced with great fanfare. It has been suspended. Maybe we should look at the 2012 budget papers, which show that, despite a promise at the 2010 election that there would be no staff cuts to the public service, 1,145 staff will be cut from the department of education.




Mr Broadbent:
  Hypocrites!




Mr TUDGE:
  They are absolute hypocrites. They come in here and talk about cuts in other jurisdictions, but they do not have the courage to talk about their own cuts. I could go on. I am sure the members after me will talk about youth allowance and about how the member for Lyne and the other Independents failed to follow up on our proposals to increase youth allowance and make it apply to more students across regional and rural areas.


It is great hypocrisy for the member for Lyne to come in here and complain about education cuts. He is helping to hold up a government that is doing exactly that. There are 3,200 schools across the country at the moment that are worried about what might happen in the future if this government continues. (Time expired)

Ms BIRD
 (Cunningham—Parliamentary Secretary for Higher Education and Skills) (16:23):  I rise to address what is obviously a very important matter of public importance. I will go to a few of the comments made by the member for Aston. I will first draw the House's attention to the fact that, as a Victorian member, he did not once mention TAFEs in his contribution on education. Given what has happened to TAFEs in Victoria, I am not at all surprised. I very much look forward to other Victorians' contributions and their attempts to explain the drastic cuts of the Baillieu government to TAFEs in Victoria.



Mr Tudge interjecting—



Mr Tehan interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Order! The member for Wannon is disorderly by interjecting outside of his place in this chamber. He will find himself out of the chamber if he does it again.




Ms BIRD:
  I would point out to my colleagues on the other side that despite extreme provocation during the contribution of the member for Aston I did not once interrupt his contribution. I would appreciate a similar courtesy. I have followed with great interest other MPIs in the debate that has been occurring about the Baillieu government's cuts to TAFE in Victoria. I have noticed that, on each occasion, they have failed to get Victorians to stand up and speak on them, by and large.



Mr Broadbent interjecting—




Ms BIRD:
  I look forward to the member's contribution today, because it is quite clear that the $300 million cut out of TAFEs in Victoria is having an extreme and extraordinary impact. I would take members beyond the contribution of people like TAFE Directors Australia, the TAFE unions in Victoria and the student body organisations. If their contributions are not ones that the members opposite would rely on, I might take them to comments made recently by Mr Innes Willox of the Australian Industry Group when he was addressing the National Press Club about the cuts to TAFE in Victoria. He said:


There have been significant changes made to TAFE in Victoria, for instance which have led to closures of dozens of courses at regional TAFE colleges within Victoria … It is of significant concern to industry that we won't be able to then drive that skills pool into the future and kids in regional Australia will miss out on opportunities to gain skills and then get into the workforce.


It is clear that there is a widespread view, including from the peak industry group, that the cuts to TAFE in Victoria have been dramatic, significant and contrary not only to the interests of individuals who are seeking to get skills for the future but also to the whole drive of the national agenda of raising the skills base in this country and of the matching of people with job opportunities by creating the opportunity for them to get the skills they need. 


There has been a contentious debate in this country in recent times about the use of foreign labour to fill skills shortages. One of the important issues that I would think would receive bipartisan support is that in the longer term we want to train Australians to meet the skills gap. How are we going to do that when at the same time that the federal government is putting significant new money—billions of dollars of new money—on the table for the vocational education and training sector, filling the bucket up to give young people across regional Australia a chance to match those job opportunities, state governments are pulling out the plug at the bottom? That is exactly what has happened in Victoria and it is exactly the problem that we will face as a nation if we cannot get people trained in the skills that they will need in the future.


As difficult as it is with one state perhaps going rogue—I can understand those on the other side not wanting to talk about what they were doing in Victoria; my colleague the member for Deakin, who is behind me, would know that even more effectively from his own direct experience in his electorate—now we are seeing the New South Wales government do the same thing. It is inconceivable that they did not learn the lesson from Victoria. No, Barry O'Farrell in New South Wales has now pulled funding out of TAFE as well. There are 800 jobs to go, courses to be cancelled and fees to rise. Again, more opportunities for young people in regional areas to gain the skills that they need have been dragged from underneath them.


I turn briefly, with the indulgence of the House, to my own area. The Illawarra is an important regional area. It has been very significantly affected by changes in the manufacturing base and the movement of jobs, which will require young people to get the new training and skills that they will need for the future. In the Illawarra Mercury today, the TAFE representative, Mr Terry Keeley said:


This is another broken election promise from this government.


Prior to this election they guaranteed an investment in TAFE funding and in quality teaching, and (said) they would ensure affordable access for all.


Now in a stroke of a pen, they have ensured that 800 teaching jobs will be cut over the next four years - that's 20 per cent of the workforce - which will probably mean up to 100 jobs will go at Illawarra campuses.


That is on the back of the investment in recent years by this government of significant money in TAFE institutes in my area. We have done that because we believe that vocational education and training is important and that at its base sits an effective public provider.


In my own area, for example, we have injected: at the Wollongong campus just over $2.8 million into upgrading outdated equipment there; $311,000 at Wollongong West in upgrading their equipment; at Dapto, $32,000 for upgrading lighting and power and the installation of voice over internet; $410,000 at Shellharbour campus, again for upgrading and the installation of voice over internet; and $475,000 at Yallah for photovoltaic cells, new toilet facilities, a low-height training roof and to install a hot water system. On top of that, we invested $9.8 million in the Illawarra Institute of TAFE's mechanical engineering, manufacturing and environmental technology faculties as part of providing the important skills needed for young people to get the apprenticeships and training they need.


It is all an investment that this government have made because, prior to 2007, we were very conscious of the constant warnings being made about two significant bottlenecks in the economic growth and opportunity and productivity of this nation. One was the infrastructure bottleneck. The minister for infrastructure has made the point to this House on many occasions that this Labor federal government over its term have invested more in infrastructure than anyone since Federation because we understand the importance of infrastructure.


Going along with that, there were numerous warnings to the previous Howard government about a bottleneck in skill shortages—that there were significant gaps emerging between the new job demands and skills and opportunities. We have injected an unprecedented amount not only into our schools system but also into our tertiary system, our vocational system and our higher education system.


On the back of doing all that investment, we presumed we could have national partnerships with the state governments. We presumed that they would have a commitment to the ongoing investment in our young people and in retraining workers who are in industries that are being restructured and need support to get training for new jobs. We presumed that there would be a common interest in achieving that. How wrong we were.


If there are members on the opposite side from Queensland who are going to contribute to this debate, I say to them: do not sit easy over there either. Do not sit easy if you are from Queensland. Indeed, we have seen in Queensland the skills and training workforce interim report to the state government there. What did it recommend on TAFEs? Perhaps it recommended increasing the investment because there is a growing mining industry that will need new skills in the mining sector? Perhaps it suggested that TAFEs should create more places and more opportunities for people? No, that is not what it suggested. It suggested cutting the TAFEs in half and going from 82 TAFEs to 44. Quite honestly, if that report is in any way claiming to contribute to economic growth and the development of the state then I think the government in Queensland would be well advised to throw it out before the final report comes out later this year. Those in Queensland should not rest easy thinking, 'Our TAFEs have been saved. We do not have to stand up in this place and justify our Liberal state government doing something really ridiculous in the face of a national skills shortage. We will leave that to our colleagues in New South Wales and Victoria. They can deal with the embarrassment of their state governments ripping the bottom out of skills training.' Do not sit comfortably at all, because that is exactly what is on the agenda in Queensland as well.


This government understands that our future growth, economic development, participation and productivity—quite simply giving a chance to the next generation to compete in the new world for the new jobs—requires skills. That means investing in places like our schools and our TAFEs, not ripping— (Time expired)

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2012-09-12,"



Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Opposition Whip) (16:33):  It is very interesting to listen to the members opposite talk about giving opportunity to the next generation. This is the same group who sat here and voted for this government to rip money out of education for rural and regional students through youth allowance. I did not see you lining up and saying, 'Oh, how dreadful it is for rural and regional students,' at all. For two years you have ripped away opportunity for young people in rural and regional areas because you changed the criteria for youth allowance.


For the other side of politics and, even more hypocritically, the member for Lyne, who voted with this government for those changes, to come into this place today and talk about disadvantage for rural and regional students in education is rank hypocrisy. I sat here because it was our students who were affected by this dreadful decision by this government, supported and encouraged by the member for Lyne. I was in this chamber, as were many of the members here. I live with the families and the students that this did so much damage to. I have listened to all sorts of waffle today about disadvantage, but how many of them stood up for rural and regional students then? Not one. What rank hypocrisy.


The member for Lyne, who brought this matter of public importance today, should hang his head in shame because he voted with the government. Where is he? Where was he when this was announced? Maybe when this was announced by the government and he supported them he was hiding under the desk. Maybe that is where he is now. Maybe he is hiding under the desk because he does not want to front up in this place and say he was complicit in taking money and opportunity away from rural and regional students. There were young people in my electorate and in his electorate who were affected, and yet he supported the government in this action.


In 2009, over and over again, we brought motions and amendments into this House. What did the member for Lyne do? He supported the government and voted against those motions. He voted against us considering them. Yet he has, as I say, the utter cheek and the gall to come in here today and lecture us about opportunity. How about those young people in my electorate? I had to deal with those young people, Member for Lyne and members on the opposite side. To this day I have those young people and their families saying to me that, as a result of the Labor government cutting their opportunity to access youth allowance, their whole future has changed.


At that time, there were students who knew their families could not afford to send them to university. They could not afford to send them without the support they would get from youth allowance. But that was supported by the member for Lyne and the members opposite. They were fine at the time with ripping money away from rural and regional students and their families. They were fine with the fact that some families, as they said to me, had to make those very tough decisions: 'Which one of our children will we allow to go to university? We can only afford to send one because of the government's changes.'


What do the member for Lyne and the members opposite say to those families now? What do the members opposite and the member for Lyne say to the people who, when these changes happened, actually changed the decisions they made about the pathways they would take in education? They knew their families could not afford to send them on to university, because they have to move, because of the extra costs and because the Labor government said, 'Equity of opportunity for you young people in rural and regional areas is not an issue that we focus on.'


I have heard this today and it really makes me cross. Two years it took. We gave the members opposite and the member for Lyne opportunity after opportunity to address this inequity. What did they do? We never heard from them. Every time we brought that type of opportunity to this place, in a motion or amendment, the members opposite were silent. It did not bother them that young people in my electorate and even in the member for Lyne's electorate did not have the opportunity to take up tertiary education. The government expected them to work two full years before they were eligible for youth allowance.


We know that there is already disadvantage in rural and regional areas. We know there are fewer students coming through the system because of the disadvantage they face in rural and regional areas. But this government made it worse, aided and abetted by the member for Lyne, who brought this matter into this place today. I am appalled by that. He should stand accountable for the actions he took during that debate, and he is not even here. As I said, he is hiding under the desk. Some of my young people did not get a chance to hide underneath the desk at a university because of the actions of the member for Lyne and the members opposite—this government. The government ripped away the opportunities. There are families affected by this constantly. It took two years to change. Then, to add insult to injury, the government include a means test for those families even now. Where is the opportunity in that?


We have to look at the issue for rural and regional families. It costs anything from $15,000 to $30,000 more a year. If you are a young person from a regional area, you have to leave home. You have to find somewhere to live. You have to pay for all of the things that young people who are able to live with their families take for granted. The other thing is that you are away from your family. You are away from your support base. You are away from the people who love and care for you and support you, particularly when you are going through a tough time, as you do, whether it is in exams, whether you have an assignment due, whether you just need to come home some days and blow off a bit of steam. You need people around you who love and care about you who are not going to respond to that. They are going to say, 'Okay, you must have had a bad day, but let's all get together and have a chat.'


That is what these young people face. They have to move away from home. They have additional costs, whether it is telephone costs to ring home to stay in touch or transport to get home. You try paying for an extra tank of fuel to get home when you are from a rural or regional area. My young people can be anything from two to three hours at least away from the university. Perhaps if they were not more than 90 minutes away then that would not be such an issue. You try driving every day. Yet that is what this government did, with the help of the member for Lyne.


I remember this process, but I also remember the fact that no member opposite stood up for their young people in this place. I find it appalling. Now we are being lectured, in a sense, by the member for Lyne and the members opposite when for two years they were quite happy to sit back and let young people who could not qualify for independent youth allowance either not go on to higher education or have their dreams completely dashed. It put so much pressure on them.


I had mums saying in the supermarket: 'My husband and I both work. We know we have to work to send our children to university, but we were relying on youth allowance. Now I have to find a second job.' I thought the most tragic ones were those who said to me: 'We have to choose which one of our children we can send to university.' I will repeat that: as a result of that decision, supported by the member for Lyne and the other side, parents had to choose which child they could send to university. I cannot get over the hypocrisy of this debate today. As I said, there were those who sat back and watched this happen, because there was a group of young people in rural and regional areas—




Mr Tehan:
  They knew it was wrong.




Ms MARINO:
  I would say yes, it was wrong. 


Where were you then? Why weren't you standing up for your young people the way that members on this side stood up for our young people? It took two years to drag you kicking and screaming, until there was enough shame. We kept at it and at it, and we had to, because that is what it took to get any form of an opportunity for those young people to access youth allowance. For them, the damage is done. They have changed their pathway. They have not gone on to university. That is the tragedy. It is only two weeks ago that I met a friend of one of those young people who said that that young person is now almost a lost soul. I hope she gets another opportunity, but I am appalled at the hypocrisy. (Time expired)

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2012-09-12,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley—Government Whip) (16:43):  Parents, teachers and students in New South Wales today have every right to feel betrayed and duped. When New South Wales voters went to the ballot box in March 2011 they were never ever presented with a policy proposal that would say to them they would be voting for a cut of close to $2 billion in school funding. No parent who sends their child to a Catholic school was told by the state government MPs in my area that those MPs were championing a funding cut. No parent who sends their child to an independent school in our electorate was told by the state member for Londonderry, Bart Bassett, that he was going to be secretly working on a cut to their funding. No parent who sends their child to a public school was told by the state member for Riverstone, Kevin Connolly, that he was holding a secret plan that would see funds cut from education. 


This has caused great outrage and grief in New South Wales. The Catholic Education Diocese of Parramatta, in their media release 'Funding cuts put State's future in jeopardy', spell out exactly the type of feeling they have about what is being done to them:


Executive director of schools in the Diocese of Parramatta, Greg Whitby, said he understands the deep level of anger in NSW school communities and sense of betrayal by a government which has shown a lack of understanding of what is needed to deliver quality learning and teaching in today’s world.


‘It is appalling to note that Australia already lags behind many of the OECD countries in its spending on education and now the O’Farrell Government has chosen to make even more cuts to this level of expenditure,’ Greg said. ‘The decision by the government not to invest in education jeopardises the very future of this state.’


That is the feeling from people at the coalface about what has happened to them. 


The state government, when in opposition, never had the decency to outline their education plans. Of the nearly 70 schools in the Chifley electorate, none was forewarned about the New South Wales government's agenda to cut funds. No-one who attends TAFE was told they would have to cop a fee hike. No-one who works for the New South Wales department of education or TAFE was given advance warning that their employment would be cut short. There is a simple reason: those opposite simply do not value education. They do not respect or appreciate how it transforms lives. To those opposite, education budgets are not a chance to invest; they are an opportunity for a saving; they are a chance for a cut. 


You can look at their track record in federal government. When the coalition federal government were there, they were told numerous times by the Reserve Bank of Australia that there would be an impact of capacity constraints on the economy. It was pointed out that skill shortages would throttle the economy, squeeze up inflation and have an impact on interest rates. That was the warning for the best part of the last decade. And what was their agenda? Their response to that type of warning was to fight universities. They were headlocking them to force staff onto Australian workplace agreements. That was their education priority: getting lecturers to sign individual contracts. Or, on the other hand, they were fighting state governments over vocational training funding, duplicating TAFEs by creating a system of training colleges that helped them dodge their responsibilities to properly fund vocational training in the states. That was their priority.


Labor in government has been exceptionally active in addressing the neglect that has been experienced. In Chifley, I am proud of the fact that, under the Building the Education Revolution program, the government has invested $137 million in 163 projects, benefiting nearly every single school in the electorate. Bear in mind that the BER funding is sneered at by those opposite, who deride the entire program as a waste. That has been their contribution when we have been reinvesting in schools.


There is the Schoolkids Bonus, from which 15,000 families have benefited. It is opposed by those opposite. The Schoolkids Bonus is designed to help students with their education costs. It is derided by those opposite. There are the trade training centres. Seven schools in Chifley are benefiting from three trade training centres, which are receiving $14.7 million. The schools are Evans High School, Doonside Technology High School, Loyola Senior High School, St Clair High School, St Agnes Catholic High School, St Andrews College and Tyndale Christian School. The National Secondary School Computer Fund has seen nearly 9,000 computers installed in schools across the electorate. That is what we have done. 


From those opposite, we have had basically derision for any investment in education and no plans of their own. Worse still, we get a taste of where they are headed in terms of education policy. Christopher Pyne, on Q&A back in late July started warming up the public to the notion that big class sizes are not a problem:


… for the last 10 years, we've been obsessed about class size and being obsessed about class size, when all the evidence suggests that when you get down to 25 students, going a lot lower than that makes no dramatic difference and, in fact, is tremendously expensive, clouds the other issues in education like teacher quality, like parental involvement, like a robust curriculum. 


So he is already getting the ground ready for the notion—as they seek to find $70 billion in cuts—that we are obsessed about class sizes and having teachers able to give quality focus and attention to students in smaller classes. While most people are trying to manage class numbers down, he is saying, 'No, you don't need to do that.'


In universities, we have already had the suggestion that they are looking to cap places and increase HECS. At UWS, that would have a dramatic effect. Bear in mind that, under us, 150,000 extra people have started attending university. At the University of Western Sydney, nearly half of the enrollees, I am proud to say, are the first person in their family who has gone to university. That is something to be proud of. Those opposite talk about capping places, increasing HECS and denying opportunity.


Let us focus on what else is on offer. At the state level, we have seen cuts of $1.7 billion for all schools, increases in TAFE fees of nearly 10 per cent, cuts to jobs in TAFE and education for cleaners, teaching assistants and support staff—2,400 public school and TAFE positions have gone. There have been cuts to the school infrastructure budget of $14.3 million this year alone. Two hundred and seventy-two schools have lost their special needs funding. At the federal level, the recipe is: no support for Gonski or the national school improvement plan, a nod and a wink for larger school sizes, capping university places, increasing HECS fees and not ruling out cuts, as part of this $70 billion push to cut government spending.


I worry about the impact not just for now but for the future. I want to read out a quote that should cause concern. It is from the front page of the Sydney Morning Herald today. In relation to the debate about what they are doing to cut funding, Pittwater MP Rob Stokes is quoted as saying:


I can't see why building the north-west rail link and keeping the [electricity] 'poles and wires' is more important than education. 


The debate in New South Wales is about whether or not the spending that has been committed by the O'Farrell government to an infrastructure project is starting to eat the government spending priorities.


We have seen them drag the chain on the National Disability Insurance Scheme. We are seeing cuts to funding on education. We have seen hikes in public-housing rents for the 5,000 pensioners in the electorate I represent and in other electorates as well. And, while no-one begrudges and everyone wants to see better transport in western Sydney, schoolkids should not be forced to foot the bill for it. As former Premier Nick Greiner has been apparently quoted as saying, the north-west rail project is a project that threatens to eat the government. What people want to know is: are school funds being cut to funnel a political commitment being made by the O'Farrell government? Are people losing their public-housing rents or being forced to pay more because funds are being diverted to the North West Rail Link? Are people being forced to suffer because they are not being included in the National Disability Insurance Scheme trial sites, again because money is being saved and being directed to a project of close to $30 billion in the north-west rail sector?


A suggestion was quoted in the Herald today. I see here that a friend of ours in the chamber, the member for Mitchell, Alex Hawke, was quoted as telling the Liberal Party party room that these state party education cuts would not have happened if a Liberal were in the education portfolio in New South Wales. What a slur to the National Party, but also what a convenient dodge, when a government that is led by a Liberal and made up with a coalition, has approved these cuts and is now trying to dodge it.


As I say, for us, education is critical, because it gave us on this side of the fence so much opportunity, and it is being denied by those opposite. (Time expired)

Mr BROADBENT
 (McMillan) (16:54):  I think the debate has gone right off the rails and is being used for base political purposes. It does not enhance the ambience of this place and certainly does not enhance the reputation of the member for Chifley—although I would never doubt the passion of the member for Cunningham for what she puts forward. So I just want to bring a bit of truth into the debate; that is all.


I just want to tell this parliament and the people that are listening to this debate the truth about what is happening, particularly in Victoria in regard to TAFE, because it has been raised by ministers and it was raised by the Prime Minister. If I am allowed to say so, the Victorian government, rather than cutting TAFE, have capped the expenditure on TAFE. They had to do it because the Labor government under Brumby and Bracks left them in the most disgraceful fiscal position since Joan Kirner left the last Labor government in exactly the same position. The Victorian government are actually spending an extra $250 million per year over the next four years on training. They are investing that in TAFE and other training facilities that will, in this case, have courses that do something amazing: they lead to jobs! They have changed the policy so that the courses that they are funding lead people into jobs.




Mr Tehan:
  How dare they!




Mr BROADBENT:
  How dare they do that! A job! The most interesting part, Mr Deputy Speaker, is that your own minister suggested to one of our ministers that it was a good idea to fund appropriate programs to put people into jobs.


If you want to know a premier of a state who has been left in a diabolical position, I name Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, which have all been left in most difficult fiscal positions in their budgets. They come in and they have to make a change. And you want to talk about those premiers today. Why don't you talk about the people that put them in the position where the state governments have to react in such a way? If you want your pet projects up, if you want your hospitals funded properly, if you want the new roads that need to be done right across this nation, and if they are the responsibility of the states, do not allow Labor governments to destroy the financial positions of those states until they hand them over to a Liberal-National coalition to fix the problem, to introduce programs into TAFE colleges right across Victoria that will supply—what?—jobs: jobs for people. They supply more apprenticeships for apprentices, although the downturn that is creeping across the nation is affecting the opportunities for those apprentices.


You know, I reckon every member of parliament in this place is feeling that. I reckon every member of parliament in this place is getting a bit of a message about what is going on out in their communities. We are all a bit tentative at the moment because our builders' phones have stopped ringing; our electricians' phones have stopped ringing—




Mr Ewen Jones:
  Get a plumber.




Mr BROADBENT:
  Well, you can get a plumber down our way at the moment. You can get a lot of plumbers at the moment, and that is a huge change.


I am just making the point: if you are going to talk about education and you are going to talk about it seriously, why is it that the first thing that every government does, when it talks about an education crusade or these things, is start attacking teachers? It is the first thing it does. It says, 'Oh, blame the teachers!' I can tell you that the members that are sitting here in this room—and they come from right across Australia at the moment—know very, very, very good teachers. They know teachers that teach with a vision and with a heart and a passion for the people that they serve within their schools and their communities.




Mr Ewen Jones:
  I'm married to one.




Mr BROADBENT:
  You are married to one? I did not know that, Ewen. What the Prime Minister did not know was this: school improvement plans in Victoria have been in place for—what?—a decade and a half. We have had school improvement plans, which the Prime Minister talked about. These are tied to principal and teacher performance plans, which is what the Prime Minister was talking about, and to the whole school and individual professional development programs. Those are what the Prime Minister is talking about in her crusade. For teacher registration with the Victorian Institute of Teaching, it is compulsory. This body mandates professional development of teachers as a condition of registration.


As for delivering a common curriculum attached to standards, providing individual learning plans, reporting to parents, and adhering to standardised testing in literacy and numeracy in years 3, 5 and 7, we are already doing it. Student teachers are already spending 15 weeks in training in schools. We are already doing it. So a lot of the Prime Minister's discussions were pure rhetoric.


What we forget—and every member of parliament knows this because they come across it every time they go to a school—is that our teachers and principals spend an inordinate amount of time dealing with behavioural, social and parenting issues, which detract from teaching time, of course. And why? Why do schools provide breakfast programs? Have you heard of breakfast programs? Why do schools provide breakfast programs? Because they have to, because the kids have come to school without any food. Teachers plead for more assistance from psychologists and speech therapists, and more assistance for disability programs and to deal with attendance issues, because if you are not at school you cannot learn. So the headwinds facing Labor in its response to Gonski are considerable.


I know the member for Gippsland would like to get on. I will get off and let him come forth, but first I just want to say one thing: we are all passionate about teachers and education. We run a crusade every day in our electorates for the betterment of our children and the betterment of our schools and the opportunities that we want to give the next generation. But you cannot have rhetoric and talk and not back it up with some money on the table for students to make a success of their lives.

"Owens, Julie, MP",ALP,2012-09-12,"



Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (17:01):  I am very pleased to rise to speak on this matter of public importance because it is, indeed, a matter of great importance. Education is the great enabler. I, myself, came through a public housing community into very good state schools. There were many children that I went to school with who had to leave school well before their 15th birthday because their parents could not afford to keep them in school. So, while I have been one of the lucky ones who managed to get a complete education and go on to university, I went to school with some very bright, articulate, witty and delightful children who will not have had the lives they could have had, because their educational experience was curtailed. So when we talk about education, we need to keep in mind that we are talking about perhaps the single thing, other than good parenting, which puts a child on a pathway to prosperity.


In my electorate, I have schools that carry considerable burdens. There is a delightful little primary school—which is now, since the last redistribution, just outside of my electorate—that has 150 children, and 75 of them come from African refugee camps. An extraordinary effort by that school is required to bring those children into what, in Australia, is considered quite normal, which is attending school every day and participating in education. I have schools in the south of my electorate that take the children that come out of Villawood. So they are constantly accepting new children that they have to find a way to bring into the school community. And then those children move on and new children come, so they have a continuous churn. There are schools that have extraordinary additional burdens—I use the word 'burdens', but I am not using that in any sense about the children. The children of course are not burdens; they are a delight, but they add considerably to the schools' workload because of the communities that the schools serve.


We have heard from the Leader of the Opposition over recent months—in fact, probably over recent years—on a daily basis, an extraordinary scare campaign. Every day he finds something to be outraged about, and if he cannot find anything that he can actually be outraged about he makes it up, and on more days than not he makes it up. The sky will fall! The world will end! Life as we know it will be over on Sunday! You name it. If there is not something to be outraged about, if he cannot find something, he will make it up—and does.


The extraordinary thing about the announcement by the state Liberal government yesterday is that it actually is scary, and it is factual. It has been put out in the words of the New South Wales Liberal government itself. It is probably one of the scariest things we have heard in a while, this extraordinary attack on our education system through our school system and our TAFE system—an extraordinary attack. If the Leader of the Opposition wanted to go out on his scare campaign tomorrow he certainly would not have to make any of this up. We have heard really clearly what the cuts will be. In New South Wales, thanks to the state government, we are looking at 1,800 jobs cut in education, 800 TAFE positions axed, TAFE fees increased by 9.5 per cent, an overall three per cent cut in education funding, a four-year education funding freeze on all government and non-government schools in New South Wales, and the dropping of subsidies for certain TAFE courses as well—a decimation of the system that provides our young people with the best possible opportunity to build a good life.


We heard the previous speaker on this matter, the member for McMillan, talk about the pressures on the state government. He was actually talking about the Victorian government, I think, and the Queensland government, as well as that of New South Wales. There are very few governments in the world at state or federal level at the moment that are not facing revenue shortfalls relative to what they would have had a number of years ago. The global financial crisis is still working its way through the global economy. The commodities prices are currently lower than they were in Australia. We also have the Australian dollar. There are forces at work, internationally and within our own economy, that make things tight for governments of all persuasions at the moment.


You can tell the character of a government not by what it does in the good times, because in the good times they can do lots of things—and that is great, that is terrific, in the good times. But when things get a little bit tough what you look at is what they decide to keep, because that is where their priorities are. Look at what we kept, under incredibly difficult circumstances: the biggest pension increases in 100 years; paid parental leave; increasing the tax-free threshold to $18½ thousand; the doubling of education funding, and the biggest investment in schools that we have ever seen in this country; massive increases in health, including the building of cancer centres right across this country; the National Disability Insurance Scheme; and the dental scheme. These are the things that we chose to keep, in the face of having nearly $250 billion cut off our bottom line by the global financial crisis. They are the things we chose to keep.


In contrast, look at what the state Liberal governments choose to throw away. The knife comes out for health, the knife comes out for front-line personnel across a range of sectors and the knife—remarkably, given the debate going on in this country at the moment about the future of education—comes out for the education system, our schools and our TAFEs. I say it is remarkable given the current debate because, as all of us in this House know, the federal government has in the last year undertaken a review of education. It was the biggest review in 40 years—something well overdue and something we need if we are going to position our children, our young people, for the future. 


We were one of the best countries in the world when it came to education. We were actually second in reading and we have slipped to equal seventh. The average 15-year-old maths student in Australia is now more than two years behind a 15-year-old in Shanghai. We have slipped from equal fifth to equal 13th in maths. We still see Australia as a country of opportunity, but the gap now between disadvantaged students and advantaged students in reading, maths and science is more than two years. Something needs to be done about this and this government is committed to doing it. 


I know that most people on the opposition benches know this is something we need to grapple with. We can argue about the details, but I know in my heart that the vast majority, if not all, of the people on the other side know that we have to do something about this. I know the opposition are in a bind. While we, as a federal parliament, are talking about lifting every school, their state colleagues are running around punching holes in the bottom of the bucket, putting a dish under it and trying to siphon off whatever money they can for other things. The opposition know that. This is as much about the politics of cost shifting as it is about anything else. It is being done in the context of a federal government which is committed to raising the standard of every school. 


I understand the bind the opposition is in. We have been in opposition when there were seven state and territory Labor governments. Both sides have been in the position the opposition are now in. But the opposition know as well as we do that our education system is falling behind and that there are schools carrying extraordinary additional burdens because of children with disabilities, drug and alcohol addicted parents, low socioeconomic status, generational unemployment and poor parental English language skills. The opposition know that we have massive amounts of work to do and that doing that work requires an increase in funding, not a decrease in funding—an increase in funding at the federal level and an increase in funding at the state level. It requires us all to get together. 


I was incredibly gratified when I received the media release from Greg Whitby, who is the executive director of schools in the diocese of Parramatta. That diocese covers not only my electorate but also Greenway and it goes right out to Penrith. Mr Whitby is with the Catholic Education Office, which deals specifically with Catholic schools, the schools which last week were seriously under threat of a $24.5 million cut in funding. In his press release, Mr Whitby has made it really clear what we should all know—that this is about all schools. 


Let's not let the state governments shift the focus from one sector to another. We are talking about all schools. All schools need to be lifted and every level of government needs to get behind this. The very future of our children is at stake. We are living in a world where our northern neighbours are advancing rapidly—the Asian century. We cannot fall behind. So I am urging you all to say what is in your hearts, which is that it is time for us all to get behind education and increase the funding. (Time expired)

Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland) (17:11):  I commend the member for Lyne for putting forward this matter of public importance and for his ongoing interest in education. The member for Lyne and I may not always agree on policy issues, but we do have a shared passion for education. I sincerely commend his work in regional education—in ensuring that systems put in place at state and federal level do not act in ways that disadvantage regional people and do, wherever possible, support those who need a helping hand to achieve their full potential. 


I do note, though, that the member for Lyne said at the outset of his contribution that he was not going to be party political. But he could not quite help himself. He got about a minute and 10 seconds into his speech before he just had to give the National Party a bit of a touch-up on the way through. So I am sure he will excuse me if I just make a little point of my own which may be interpreted as being a little bit party political. I do fear that sometimes the Independents live in a bit of a bubble. They never have to make the tough budgetary decisions. I do not think there is anyone at state level making these tough budgetary decisions right now who is enjoying that process. It is a simple fact of life that it is up to the Liberals and Nationals in Victoria, New South Wales and Queensland to clean up the mess which was left to them.

Mr RANDALL
 (Canning) (19:00):  I rise this evening to discuss an issue in my electorate which is also faced right across Australia—the Mediterranean fruit fly, or medfly. If left unchecked this harmful pest has the potential to inflict significant damage on Australia's fruit industry, and this is an issue that now has a heightened sense of urgency. Yesterday the Australian Pesticide and Veterinary Medicines Authority released their assessment for the chemical fenthion, the last remaining effective chemical that Australian fruit growers have at their disposal to control this fruit fly. The banning of fenthion was set in motion yesterday when the APVMA announced that it was moving to ban fenthion, in the same way that it banned the other effective fruit fly control chemical, dimethoate, in 2011.


One by one, effective control measures for fruit fly are being taken away from fruit growers in Australia. Any farming in Australia has become a tough business. The last thing that farmers want or need is further interference by our Commonwealth departments making it harder to control vermin on their properties. The APVMA yesterday handed down their decision to ban fenthion, and this will be a massive blow to growers in Western Australia—particularly those around the Perth Hills area, where fruit fly numbers are particularly high.


It has to be mentioned that fenthion is not a chemical that is causing significant grief throughout the community. In somewhat typical form, a government department has found that in large doses the chemical could be harmful. In fact, members of the Dimethoate and Fenthion Response Coordination Committee are being told that it is safe to eat any fruit and vegetables currently available in supermarkets. This demonstrates the fact that the concerns around fenthion are based on a worst-case scenario and not based on a danger currently posed by fruit that has been treated with fenthion. In other words, the fruit available on shelves today is deemed fine to consume, but, based on the concept that fenthion may be harmful to you in large doses, farmers can no longer use this most effective treatment.


To date there have been no reported incidents of Australians being harmed by ingesting fruit treated with fenthion. The better-safe-than-sorry approach may appease the hand wringers and nail biters among us. However, I wonder if consideration has been given to the long-term effects that such a decision will have on the Australian fruit-growing industry. Yesterday's move by the APVMA has left those growers in the Perth Hills in a terrible predicament. Growers already struggle to bring the fruit fly populations under control—and this is when fenthion remains available. Once this weapon is taken away, it is anyone's guess as to how growers will handle the looming threat of fruit fly epidemics. In WA, as the Dimethoate and Fenthion Response Coordination Committee acknowledges:


Medfly is a very serious production issue and many growers do not see a future without dimethoate and fenthion.


Currently there are talks underway between growers, state departments and lobby groups to come up with some kind of solution beyond fenthion to control medfly. This is a frustrating process for growers, given that they have not been presented with clear evidence as to why fenthion is so dangerous. In fact, the only justification seems to be that the chemical has been banned elsewhere in the world so Australia should follow suit. Nevertheless, it has become clear that reversing or opposing APVMA's decision is not something Minister Ludwig would be willing to consider. One wonders how Minister Ludwig can remain as Australia's Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry given the disgust his name engenders amongst farmers and other primary producers. The infamous debacle surrounding the live export trade suspension demonstrated both his disregard for and lack of basic understanding of those whose livelihoods are derived from farming. Minister Ludwig's history as a minister leaves growers in my area with little confidence that he will oversee a suitable replacement for the control of fruit fly once fenthion is gone.


Options being suggested to local fruit growers include increasing baiting and orchard hygiene. This is essentially telling growers to go and pick up dead fruit from the ground, keep grass levels below the trees to a minimum and setting up more baited traps to catch fruit fly. This is good and fine; however, orchardists are already employing these measures. Furthermore, suggesting that growers pick up fruit from the ground is comparable to telling a wheat farmer to try to eradicate Paterson's curse by walking to paddocks and picking it up by hand rather than spraying effective chemicals.


One option that may be a saviour to growers in Perth is the sterile fruit fly program. Essentially this involves releasing sterile male medflies into areas susceptible to high fruit fly populations. This may be a viable weapon in controlling fruit fly; however, investment is required to increase the program. Furthermore, we have an anomalous situation in Western Australia whereby we actually breed the sterile fruit fly in our state yet export the sterile progeny to South Australia, which is then used in their fruit fly eradication program.

Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (09:30):  It is a great pleasure to be able to advise the chamber of the official opening of the new $36.5 million Cannington Leisureplex in the electorate of Swan—the start of what I hope will be the development of Queens Park into a hub for sporting facilities south of the river. The grand opening was last Wednesday and it was fantastic to be there on behalf of the Cannington and Swan communities. The opening of the leisureplex is a significant event for the community and it was particularly pleasing for me on a personal level to be able to see the building come to fruition after I was able to announce before the last election that a federal Liberal government, if elected, would contribute $7 million towards that centre.


As I said to the mayor, Joe Delle Donne, at the opening, it seems like only yesterday that we stood on the site when it was an empty field and we tried to envision what the outcome would be. The leisureplex has effectively consolidated many of the existing sporting facilities from across the Cannington region into one place, a strategy advocated by the member for Bennelong when he spoke to the South Perth residents in my electorate recently about a local campaign for a city of South Perth aquatic centre. The member for Bennelong's concept of sports malling has certainly captured the imagination of the people of the city of South Perth and this is something as a community we will continue to work on in putting the case to local authorities.


With the successful opening of the leisureplex and the consolidation of Canning's facilities, the case has only grown for a similar sports mall in the city of South Perth for the benefit of the residents. The leisureplex has been built next to a railway line in Queens Park adjacent to the Coker Park athletics facility and has brought together an indoor sports arena, a 25-metre swimming pool, spa, library and creche. I was able to attend the official opening on Wednesday and inspect the facilities and they are of a high quality. There is also a gym and my local state colleagues Mike Nahan and Nick Goiran were quick to jump on the exercise bikes and try them out. I would have joined them except I had a recent cartilage operation, so I was only able to witness what they were doing.



Government members interjecting—




Mr IRONS:
  I hear the opposite side encouraging me and hoping I get over my operation as quickly as possible. Nick Goiran was there representing the Premier, Colin Barnett, who is currently doing a fantastic job in Western Australia, making decisions and going full steam ahead into the election next year.


The leisureplex itself is heated geothermally, and we were given the opportunity to inspect the exchange mechanism in the centre. The practical use of this technology in WA has been demonstrated by the leisureplex and I hope it will set a similar standard for facilities elsewhere in Western Australia.


With the limited time I have, I will give credit to the Rudd-Gillard government for providing the $7 million, which came after the state government's $2.5 million and Lotterywest's $1 million. Congratulations to everyone involved. For the community, the benefit of the leisureplex will continue for years to come.

Mr FITZGIBBON
 (Hunter—Chief Government Whip) (10:01):  I rise to join with the Acting Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition, the Minister for Defence and all members that have and will contribute to this very important and sad condolence debate. I rise therefore to pay tribute to Lance Corporal Stjepan 'Rick' Milosevic, Sapper James Thomas Martin, and Private Robert Hugh Frederick Poate.


We have now lost 38 very brave Australian people in Afghanistan, and collectively today we gather to speak about that bravery and their selfless contribution to our country. Thirty-eight lives lost is 38 too many. Indeed, the campaign in Afghanistan has become a very expensive one in human terms. For a country our size, 38 is a large loss. Later this morning or this afternoon we will also be speaking about Lance Corporal Mervyn John McDonald and Private Nathanael John Aubrey Galagher, who tragically lost their lives within 24 hours of the loss of these three fine soldiers.


These debates are always difficult for all of us in this place because it is us collectively who take the decision to send these young people to war, but I stand here today still very confident that we went to Afghanistan for the right reason, we remain in Afghanistan for the right reason and we are determined that we should finish our campaign in Afghanistan. We went there to make the world a safer place for all people, including of course Australians. We saw the carnage that can be set upon our people in places like Bali and Jakarta by people who were trained or had some association with Al Qaeda in Afghanistan. Afghanistan had became a lawless state—a state prepared to host and provide a training field and a launching pad for those prepared to perpetrate their acts of terror right around the globe, again including on Australians. It was the right thing to do to intervene on that lawlessness and everything that flows from it.


I believe we are making progress in Afghanistan—I have no doubt about that. We are not only building capacity to enforce the local rule of law but building a democracy, an economy, a health system, schools and a society, and therefore, hopefully, we are putting in place a setting for good things rather than bad things. It is hard. No-one said it would be easy. We were always going to lose lives, but there is one thing I am very confident about: all of our volunteers who go to Afghanistan go with enthusiasm and know all of the risks involved, but they do so very willingly and very keenly. I do not think I knew any of the three men—it is possible that I may have met them at some point as defence minister—but I do know that the local rule of law will also have applied to them. Having met many families on the occasion of earlier losses, I am confident that the families of these brave soldiers also knew the risk but supported their decision to take that risk. I would be very surprised if, like the soldiers themselves, the parents did not believe and do not believe in the mission and what their loved ones, friends and mates were doing.


Last night I had the pleasure of speaking at the reception to mark both the 93rd anniversary of the independence of Afghanistan and the 10th anniversary of the formal diplomatic relationship between Australia and Afghanistan. We were partly celebrating Afghanistan's progress—progress from a lawless state, as I said, towards what I am very confident will become a thriving society. It does have a potential economic base. It boasted, in the past, of being a land sitting on the Silk Route and flourishing, and I believe it will flourish again. We need to stay the course and help them through the next steps. It would be a terrible thing if we allowed 38 fine Australians to give their life in vain—in other words, if we do not finish what we are doing in Afghanistan. I think a precipitous withdrawal would be an enormous mistake. It would be a bit like not paying the final two payments on your mortgage. We have made the big investment, it has been costly, but that is all the more reason to finish the job. To walk away now before the Afghan National Security Forces are ready to enforce that country's own rule of law would be a very big mistake. 


I hear so often people say: 'You cannot win in Afghanistan. Alexander the Great was not able to win in Afghanistan. The Russians were not able to win in Afghanistan. The English did not have much success in Afghanistan.' Historically that might be true, but in this campaign we are working with the democratically elected government of the day in Afghanistan against a common foe. Sometimes the lines become blurred as to who is friend and who is enemy, and very sadly in the case of these three soldiers we have learned just how blurred those lines can be. It must be very hard for our troops to deal with the green on blue dynamic. I can think of nothing worse—as if it is not hard enough—than going to war without being absolutely sure that the guy who is marching alongside you is your friend. So this is difficult, and it is a challenge for the government and everyone participating in the campaign in Afghanistan. But it is another thing that we just need to manage, and I am sure that manage it we will.


I join with others in extending my deepest sympathies to Lance Corporal Milosevic's wife Kelly, his young daughters Sarah and Kate—it is so sad that there are such young people involved here—his mother Heather and his brother Milan and sister Danica; to Sapper Martin's mother Suzanne, sister Holly, step-brother Angus and grandparents Ralph and Lucille Thomas; and to Private Poate's parents Hugh and Janny and sister Nicola. Like others who have spoken, I also extend my sympathies to those in the 2nd/14th Light Horse Regiment (Queensland Mounted Infantry), the 2nd Combat Engineer Regiment and the 6th Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment, and to all those who trained and served alongside these very fine Australians.

Mr JOHN COBB
 (Calare) (10:09):  I say at the outset that I totally support everything said by the Chief Government Whip. A week or so ago I attended a dinner which was for a school reunion and when the apologies were read out one of those apologies was a very good friend of mine at school, Hugh Poate. We spent many years in the same house and the shooting team together. We had a lot of fun. We did a lot of silly things together. When the reason for his absence was given, it was that his son had died in Afghanistan, as one of the three killed by a rogue ANA sergeant. There is no decision we make in government and in parliament that you take as seriously as when you decide that you will commit Australian troops overseas into a war situation. I was part of the parliament and, indeed, the government who actually did that. I had never met Robbie. I rang Hugh as a very good friend and as somebody who had that responsibility. I realised Robbie must have been a pretty special person when Hugh just said, 'Do not be silly. Robbie was there because he wanted to be. He was there because he was a very good soldier and we are incredibly proud of him.' To be judgemental would have been a very forgivable and, in fact, natural thing for him to have been, but he and his family are just unbelievable. I said I would be honoured to speak on behalf of his family in the parliament about Private Robbie Poate and he accepted that, and what I am about to say now is what Private Robert Hugh Poate's family would want the parliament and the people of Australia to hear. His funeral is at one o'clock today in Canberra.


Private Robert Hugh Frederick Poate was one of three Australian soldiers killed by a rogue Afghan National Army solider at a patrol post in the Baluchi Valley, Afghanistan, on Wednesday, 29 August 2012. He was just 23 years of age. Robbie was sitting down with his mates playing cards after a long day at work when he was killed. Five soldiers were hit with automatic gunfire from the rogue ANA soldier. Three died instantly, Robert being one of them. The other two who died were 39-year-old Lance Corporal Stjepan Milosevic from Penrith and 21-year-old Sapper James Martin from Perth. All five soldiers were deployed to Afghanistan in June with the 3RAR task group. The two soldiers who were wounded in the incident are expected to make a full recovery.


Robbie is survived by his parents, Hugh and Janny, and his sister, Nicola. Robert Poate spent 15 years at Canberra Grammar School, graduating from year 12 in 2007 after completing his final four years as a boarder in Blaxland House. He was a superb all-round athlete and was awarded House Colours and the Mark Sowell Award for Outdoor Education. He was captain of the Open Grade Third XV Rugby team where he played as five-eighth, and he regularly played with the Second XV. In his final year Robbie won the open 400-metre race at the school athletic carnival and came second in the cross-country. He was also an excellent swimmer and a cross-country skier. At school, Robert was a very level-headed boy with a mature moral compass far ahead of his age, but he also loved to let his hair down and have fun with his mates. This fun-loving part of him continued into his young adult life. He knew how to balance his life responsibly. A one-minute silence was observed in Robert's honour at the final of the 1st XV Canberra School Boys Rugby Union match last Sunday.


After leaving school, Robert worked in the building industry for a year then decided that he would like to be part of the Anzac legend and he enlisted in the Australian Army. After completing basic training at Kapooka, and infantry training at Singleton, he applied to join 6 Battalion RAR in Brisbane, and hoped to get into D Company of 6 Battalion. He asked for this posting because of the proud history of D Company, 6RAR at the Battle of Long Tan in Vietnam. Of the 23 young men who applied, five were accepted, Robert being one of them. He had an enthusiastic quest for knowledge and completed an impressive list of Army training qualifications in a short period of time.


He went to Afghanistan as a commander of a Bushmaster armoured vehicle/troop carrier. In Afghanistan his senior staff had so much faith and confidence in his abilities that his vehicle became the lead vehicle in convoys and patrols. Robert would have had a very bright future with the Army had he survived.


In a statement issued by the Australian Defence Force, Rob was described as a wholly qualified soldier who was known for having outstanding leadership potential. Since enlisting in 2009, he had been awarded a number of honours and had completed a promotion course for Corporal in 2011. Robert will be fondly remembered by his 'Brothers of choice' in 6RAR as a very popular and highly skilled soldier of the Australian Army. 


Robert was proud of his family, his military service, his Canberra origins and his red hair, which he vehemently defended as being strawberry blonde. Robert was very gregarious. He loved to be with his mates and people loved to be around him. His nickname was Poate and he had a very quick and keen sense of humour with an incredible array of one-liners. Following Robert's death, his mates named his Bushmaster vehicle 'Poate' in his honour and this name is now painted on the side of his vehicle. 


His father, Hugh Poate, said: 'Robert certainly did the Anzac legend of Australian military service very proud.' He loved the Army where he was performing his supreme duty for his country and, tragically, he made the supreme sacrifice in the process. He was a delightful boy who grew and matured into a truly wonderful young man. He possessed a gentle, caring nature and only saw the good in people. He would have made a wonderful husband and father. Hugh also said: 'Since Robert's death, our family has been overwhelmed by the support received from immediate family, friends, Canberra Grammar School and the Army. Since the day Robert enlisted, we have been made to feel part of the Army family and this was particularly so during his deployment in Afghanistan. It is not only Janny, Nicola and I who have lost a son and a brother, but the Army has also lost a son and a brother, and I know that the Army is grieving with us. I have seen it and felt it. The motto of 6 Battalion is ""Brothers by choice"". The brotherhood of these young men is something very special, which I have also personally felt. We are receiving wonderful support at this very difficult time from Robert's Army colleagues, his senior officers and other areas of the Australian Defence Force.'


Private Robert Poate has been posthumously awarded the following service honours and awards: Australian Active Service Medal with Clasp, Afghanistan Campaign Medal, Australian Defence Medal, NATO Non-Article 5 Medal with Clasp ISAF and the Infantry Combat Badge. May he rest in peace, we will remember him.

Dr MIKE KELLY
 (Eden-Monaro—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (10:17):  It is another terribly sad occasion where we rise to commemorate and pass our condolences to these lost sons of Australia and their families. It was one of the most tragic days, as has been reflected upon, in the Australian Defence Force's history—certainly the largest loss of lives since Vietnam—in two separate incidents which we will reflect on in two separate motions. Three individuals, the subjects of this motion, were from three different units all based at Gallipoli Barracks—units that I have great familiarity with and also affection for from my time at Gallipoli Barracks, having played rugby in the 25th anniversary 6RAR rugby premiership winning team. I played often against 2nd/14 and worked with many of the soldiers and officers of them and 2CER as well. These three individuals encapsulate all that is fine and all that is the best of the traditions of those three units.


We heard a wonderful tribute by the member for Calare in relation to Private Robert Hugh Poate. Poate was a member of 6RAR. He mentioned the motto of that unit—'brothers by choice'—but the nickname is also 'blue dog'. The mascot of 6RAR is a blue cattle dog. They particularly chose a blue cattle dog because they wanted to focus people on the attributes that those dogs are known for: their tenacity, their faithfulness and their loyalty. Certainly, all of those qualities are encouraged, fostered and developed in 6RAR, and well exemplified by Private Poate.


The motto of the Royal Australian Regiment is 'Duty first', and no-one more exemplified that motto than Robert Poate. He was so focused on his career at that young age and performing extremely well. He was a protected mobility vehicle driver, driving one of those magnificent Australian Bushmaster vehicles which have protected and saved so many lives in Afghanistan and have been a tremendous tribute to Australian industry; the Bushmaster is also a weapons system and an asset that requires a great deal of skill to work with in an operational environment, and certainly Private Poate had that. As has been mentioned, one of the vehicles has been named 'Poatey'—that is painted on the side of the vehicle—and that is a tremendous tribute. His colleagues obviously will continue to and will always remember him for the wonderful member of the team that he was, and for his good humour and his professionalism, serving as he was on his first deployment. He was a young man who had not had time to build a life outside of the Army, but this was actually partly by choice. We know that he had said to his family that he was not particularly interested in trying to establish a long-term relationship at this point in time because he wanted to focus on the mission in Afghanistan, to focus on the job. He said to his father: 'I am not going to get emotionally involved because I don't want to take any baggage with me; I've got to be 100 per cent focused 100 per cent of the time because I am responsible for every person aboard that vehicle.' Nothing exemplifies this individual and the 'Duty first' motto better than those comments.


Interestingly, too, we are talking about a green-on-blue incident. It was revealed by the family that, in a phone call to his father, Private Poate actually described the ANA members that he was working with as a fantastic bunch of people—'They just love us Aussies. They play cricket with us. All you've got to do is respect their customs and there's no problems.' So Private Poate had had a very good experience of working with the ANA—until this point, of course. And there have been many thousands of ANA soldiers that our people have worked with, notwithstanding that we have had these incidents involving a couple of individuals. But I will come back to that point in a minute.


I turn now to Sapper James Martin, who was a member of the 2nd Combat Engineer Regiment, also based at Enoggera, as I mentioned. He was a very special person in many ways—a deep person; an intellectual soldier. The motto of the 2nd CER is 'The magnificent bastards', and certainly, in my experience of them, they were just that. Sapper Martin was magnificent in many ways as an individual, but it is important for all of us to understand the special role the sappers perform in Afghanistan. Their role requires nerves of steel: the daily tension and the daily risks that the sappers undertake in Afghanistan are extreme. I know many members, colleagues on both sides, who have been over to experience the parliamentary exchange program and have had the briefings about the improvised explosive devices and understand the daily test of these people's character, their nerves, their professionalism, and their ability to detect and defuse these weapons and protect our people. That requires very special skill, very special courage and very special nerves. Certainly, Sapper Martin had all of those things. He was a fine tribute to the traditions of the engineers, and there would be, no doubt, many members of the ADF who owe their protection, who owe their safety, who owe the fact that they are not injured and are still with us, to the work of Sapper Martin and what he was able to achieve in Afghanistan. We all send our best wishes to his family as well. I know that his regiment, a wonderful unit, will continue to preserve his memory.


Finally, I come to Lance Corporal Rick Milosevic, known as 'Milo' to the crew. Rick came to the Army late in life, at the age of 36, which was interesting and incredible in itself. He went through the whole recruit process at the age of 36, which is remarkable. And he was no slouch in that process, and was awarded most outstanding soldier at Kapooka and was presented with an award for the trainee of merit.


He had a family, of course, and he had been deployed in his short time in Iraq as well as Afghanistan. He also came from a very proud unit, the 2nd/14th Light Horse Regiment (Queensland Mounted Infantry), which has a history going back to 1860. It saw many proud campaigns in the Boer War and the First World War. It is a unit that proudly wears the emu feather, as Rick did.


Rick was a very keen participant in Army rugby. The Army is a family in itself, but certainly an even tighter family within that family is the Army rugby community, which I tremendously enjoyed being a part of. Rick will be closely remembered in that he was a classic forward build, a stocky chap—he had the right neck for it. Every year we play a curtain-raiser to the tri-service rugby competition between the Army rugby old boys and the Navy old salts. Before each game we toast the members of the rugby fraternity that we have lost in the preceding year through whatever cause. I can guarantee that next year our comrades and colleagues in Army rugby and Navy rugby will be toasting Rick Milosevic before the game. Well done, Rick, on a magnificent effort and a magnificent career. We are so proud of you. We extend our condolences to Rick's partner, Kelly; his daughters Sarah and Kate; and his mother, brothers and sisters. We will sadly miss Lance Corporal Rick Milosevic.


I did mention the issue of the green-on-blue situation, which has become deeply disturbing. I think a lot of Australians can accept combat casualties where men and women have their faces turned to the enemy, and they understand that that is part of the risk and sacrifice involved in a defence career. But it is hard to take situations where men and women have downed tools, effectively, and have taken off their combat body armour and are relaxing. Here they were, based in Patrol Base Wahab, relaxing with their colleagues when this incident occurred. That seems particularly cowardly to Australians and it is particularly hard to take in this context. If we are there to train and build the capacity of the Afghan National Army, then how is it that we would take casualties like this? Is it worth persevering with a mission to train these people if this is the way they are going to treat us? It is a natural instinct and it is also highly commendable that as Australians we continue to question whether we should be there and whether the sacrifices are worth it. That is entirely commendable and I would encourage Australians to continue to question. But, of course, in my role as Parliamentary Secretary for Defence I have responsibility for this Afghanistan transition. I have spent a lot of time there, as I have mentioned previously, and the mission is progressing well. The task of building the competency of the ANA is meeting the time lines and the criteria and is passing through the gateways that we have set.


There has been a big effort in creating comprehensive policies to try to mitigate these types of incidents. We are also conducting a cultural compatibility study, because the issue is that it is very hard to determine whether they are insurgent-inspired events or whether they are related to some other grievance, mental problem or cultural clash that has occurred. As far as we can eliminate these kinds of issues—any friction or cultural clashes that might feed these sorts of incidents, which are apparently a large part of what has happened in Afghanistan over recent months and years—then we will obviously make every effort to do that. We continually review force protection measures, all the time, and we have invested a great deal of money into trying to protect our people. I welcome the decision of the Afghan Ministry of Defence to remove many of those people who are suspect through their more rigorous vetting processes.


We do not know at this stage what was behind this individual attack on our people. But let us assume, for argument's sake, that it was an insurgent-inspired activity. What would be the consequence of changing our strategy of responding to an attack like this and pulling out in the face of such a strategy? All that it would do would be to encourage our enemy to pursue this strategy.


The best thing that we can do to fight a strategy like this is to not let it affect our approach to the mission in Afghanistan, to not let it affect us finishing this mission, which we are so close to. There are, effectively, only a few months left in the high-activity phase of our security operations for our own personnel as we are now seeking to intersect the situation where we reduce that security environment to a position where, as it was described to me, the grass is cut where the locals can maintain the lawn. That intersection is not far off and, once that occurs, we will be moving into an overwatch Ready Reaction Force type role. Our people will no longer be in the patrol bases. We will be much more secure in the main base at Tarin Kot and these risks will be fewer.


Here we are now, we can see that it is within our grasp to better secure our people to achieve that mission and to move on. So to bend to any kind of a strategy like this, if that were indeed what was at the heart of this, would only serve to encourage these kinds of attacks against our people, to only send a message to the world that yes, you can change Australia's policy, you can bend Australia to your will if you can set up incidents like this or conduct attacks like this and cause a certain level of casualty to achieve that objective. We need to send a message to our enemy, to our opponents, to those who wish us ill in the world that we will not bend to these tactics, if those were indeed the tactics that were employed in this event. 


We will not do that; we will not change our strategy. We will stick with our course and we will honour the legacy of those who have served this country before, in uniform, through dire times—through the direst of times in World War II when this nation was under threat and when sacrifices were made such that in the order of 48,000 people were killed in that conflict. We have shown in the past that we have the steel to see things through, to honour the legacy of people like this who have served our nation so well, to finish this mission, which is within sight.


I commend the service of these men and I pass on my condolences to their family. I know that nothing can really be said to dull the intensity of the grief that they are experiencing. I also honour their resolve as they pass on to us the task to see these missions through. We salute the service of these three individuals.

Mr McCORMACK
 (Riverina) (10:32):  It is in sad circumstances that, once again, we stand to acknowledge the loss of our best and our bravest. This time, tragically, it is not one soldier but five. 


On 29 August five Australian troops were killed in two separate incidents in Afghanistan. It was only the last sitting period in which we spoke of the courageous efforts of Sergeant Blaine Diddams and today we stand again to send what little words of comfort we can offer to the families of the five gallant men. I pay tribute to the eloquent words of the Parliamentary Secretary for Defence, the member for Eden-Monaro, and for his moving tribute to those men whom he knew. I know of his service to the nation and I know the loss which he is experiencing and which, indeed, he feels every time that one of our soldiers is tragically taken in Afghanistan. As parliamentarians we all feel a great sense of loss and also a great sense of responsibility because it is this parliament which sends those brave young men and women to these conflict situations and, sadly, we know we do that in the knowledge that some of them will not come home. 


When our service men and women leave this country to serve overseas it comes with a great element of risk. We know that and they know that. Unfortunately, that knowledge does little to ease the pain and these words of tribute do little to reduce the shock when the terrible news comes that our soldiers have been taken, particularly when they have been taken in rogue incidents such as this one. Not since the Battle of Nui Le in Vietnam, on 21 September 1971, has Australia lost five men in a 24-hour period. Lance Corporal Stjepan 'Rick' Milosevic of Penrith, Sapper James Thomas Martin of Perth and Private Robert Hugh Fredrick Poate from the 3rd Royal Australian Regiment Task Group were killed on 29 August and two other soldiers were wounded in a green-on-blue attack at a patrol base in Uruzgan province. The Brisbane based soldiers were playing cards in their tent at a patrol base when they were unexpectedly attacked by a rogue Afghan sergeant—someone they were soldiering alongside, someone they were training, encouraging and protecting. The three men arrived home on 5 September 2012 and received a ramp ceremony. That was not the way they would have liked to have come home and not the way that anyone would have expected them to come home.


Lieutenant General David Morrison described this moving return of these men as a 'cathartic moment' for the families. Lieutenant General Morrison said the families of these three soldiers, who had 'suffered so grievously', 'took huge pride in their service'. He said:


They're faced with the return of their loved one in a way they most certainly wished would never occur.


Lieutenant Colonel Mark Welburn described Lance Corporal Milosevic, or 'Milo', as he was affectionately known by his colleagues, as a 'practical, common-sense soldier', who was now 'forever part of the Light Horse'.


Born in 1972, Rick actually trained at Kapooka, where he was awarded the Most Outstanding Soldier Award. That is an award that comes with a lot of pain and effort, because at Kapooka they train our soldiers to be the best, the bravest and the brightest. In all of the world there is no better soldier than the Australian soldier, and certainly those turned out of Kapooka are the very best and the most gallant.


To his partner, Kelly, his daughters Sarah, aged just eight, and Kate, aged six, his mother, brothers and sisters, I offer my deepest condolences and certainly those of all the people of the Riverina. You think of his daughters, aged eight and six, having to grow up without the love of a father or the comfort of a dad. It is a terrible thing, but they will know that their dad was one of the greatest. I am sure their mum will remind them always of what a great man he was and what a great man he could and would have been.


Sapper Martin, or 'Marto', was described as 'the smartest guy in the section'. In a statement released by the Australian Defence Force, his family said James, just 21, was always thoughtful, caring and considerate of others; a loving son, brother and grandson who would not have given up the opportunity to serve Australia for anything. He wrote to his family after his first deployment that he was meant to be an Australian soldier. That is what he wanted to do, that is what he was proudest of doing and he knew it was what he was best at doing. It was a goal he had achieved and he had done very bravely. To Sapper Martin's mother, Suzanne Thomas, his younger brother and sister, Angus and Holly, and his grandparents, Lucille and Ralph Thomas, again I offer my condolences.


Lieutenant Colonel Mark Jennings farewelled Private Poate, saying he was a 'hard worker' and a 'larrikin'. Private Poate, he said, was a popular member of his platoon, 'dependable and ready to do what was required'. We heard earlier the member for Calare describe his personal knowledge of the private's family. He is survived by his parents, Hugh and Janny, and his sister, Nicola. Just days before his deployment to Afghanistan in June, Private Poate's dad, Hugh, took his son aside and offered him a few words of advice, as a dad would do for his son:


We'd heard a lot about the green-on-blue attacks and I said to him, 'keep an eye on the ANA [Afghan National Army]'.


Soon after arriving in Afghanistan, the young fellow called his dad to reassure him that all was well. He told his father:


They're a fantastic bunch of people, they just love us Aussies, they play cricket with us.


All you've got to do is respect their customs and there's no problems.


Unfortunately, tragically, sadly, that respect was betrayed last month.


Private Poate was only 23. He will be laid to rest with full military honours in Canberra this afternoon. He also trained at Kapooka, at Blamey Barracks at Wagga Wagga, the home of the soldier. One of the most moving tributes to Private Poate came from his colleagues still serving with the 6th Battalion in Afghanistan. The Bushmaster armoured vehicle he commanded has been named 'Poatey' by his mates, who have painted his name on the side of that vehicle.


These Australians were killed at the hands of terrorist activity. Our soldiers are directly protecting and trying to instil the ideals of freedom among peace-seeking Afghans. Their efforts are lauded, honoured and respected, and they will always be remembered. Thirty eight brave Australians have now been lost in Afghanistan; 38 courageous soldiers; 38 men with families and loved ones—young men gone long before their time. Their efforts were not in vain. Their dedication has helped to bring hope to a troubled country, now far more than a threatening haven for terrorists. They have ensured the Anzac spirit continues to burn brightly. Lest we forget.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2012-09-12,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (10:39):  I too, sadly, rise to speak about the recent tragic loss of life in Afghanistan. It was referred to in the media by the defence minister, the CDF and the Prime Minister as our darkest day since Vietnam. Lance Corporal Milosevic, Sapper James Thomas Martin and Private Robert Poate were three Australian soldiers born in very different parts of Australia—in Penrith, in Perth and in Canberra. They were soldiers at different stages of their military careers and of their own lives. Two of them were young men on their first deployment while the other was an older father of two making his second deployment overseas.


On such occasions, it is hard to know what are the correct words to use for such a speech. I do not know what the right words are but I do know on such occasions saying nothing is obviously the wrong thing to do. So I am particularly keen to say something to commemorate these three soldiers, particularly as a Queenslander, since they were based in Queensland. I am not sure who my audience is, whether it is the families and friends of Lance Corporal Milosevic, Sapper James Martin and Private Robert Pate listening now or whether it will be Sarah and Kate Milosevic perhaps listening in 20 years time or reading in 20 years time the words said about their father.


Obviously, it is an important time to be speaking. We recently celebrated the 11th anniversary of the September 11 tragedy in the United States and we are coming up to the 10-year anniversary of the Bali bombings. We do know that our soldiers, our sailors and our airmen put themselves in harm's way so that Australians can sleep safer in their beds at night. I know occasionally when there are deaths overseas of our soldiers, sailors and airmen that some people will ask questions about the validity of such campaigns. I was in Pakistan only two weeks ago—we did not go to Afghanistan because of the danger over there. When people talk about how we should not be in such campaigns, I do know that we need our soldiers, sailors and airmen to be there because, as we saw after the Bali bombing, such terror can be exported around the world and can be right on our doorstep or even inside our house perhaps.


Lance Corporal Milosevic, known as Rick to his family and Milo to his comrades, was deployed to Afghanistan with the 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment Task Group, and was from the 2nd/14th Light Horse Regiment, Queensland Mounted Infantry, based in Brisbane, Queensland, at Enoggera. This was formerly called the West Moreton Regiment, which was around in the 1800s. When the Commonwealth was formed and we were at war immediately in South Africa, the regiment gained battle honours and again in World War I, World War II and beyond. I note that link with the West Moreton Regiment as the member for Moreton.


Lance Corporal Milosevic was born in Penrith, New South Wales, in 1972. He enlisted in the Army in 2008 as a 36-year-old. He had a long and interesting career before then but it says something about the ticker of the man who, as a 36-year-old, went through Kapooka, where they would have done him no favours whatsoever because of his age. So he must have had a fair bit of ticker to want to join up as a 36-year-old. Even though for me 36 seems quite young I am sure he would have been surrounded by 18- and 19-year-olds who would have been keen to show up the older figure. Since he came through with flying colours, I think he must have had real ticker as a man. He was posted as a cavalryman to the 2nd/14th Light Horse Regiment, Queensland Mounted Infantry, in Brisbane in 2009 on completion of his basic training and initial deployment training. His potential was quickly identified and he achieved outstanding course results in a short period of time, being promoted to Lance Corporal in 2011 and becoming a light armoured vehicle crew commander. Lance Corporal Milosevic was a highly qualified soldier with a strong future. He was a much liked and respected member of the regiment—a typical Aussie bloke, friendly, funny and very down to earth. I understand his leadership and professional abilities stood out in the unit and also on operations.


I also note that he was very successful on the rugby field. I should stress I do not know Lance Corporal Milosevic and I would hate to be defaming him but I have assumed, from looking at his photos, that he played in the forwards. I say this as a hooker. I would hate to find out that he was actually in the backs. He looked like one of those people who do all the hard work on the rugby field in the forwards. I have met some decent people who have played in the backs but, obviously, I do not ever fully trust them!


Lance Corporal Milosevic has been awarded the following honours and awards: the Australian Active Service Medal with Clasps IRAQ 2003 and ICAT, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the Iraq Campaign Medal, the Australian Defence Medal, the NATO Non Article 5 Medal with Clasp ISAF, the Army Combat Badge and the Return from Active Service Badge. I understand he was also a very devoted family man, and his family must have understood his desire to join the military at a mature age. So to Lance Corporal Milosevic's wife, Kelly, his daughters, Sarah and Kate, his mother, Heather, his brother, Milan, and sister, Danica, and all of his friends and family I express my deepest condolences during this time of loss.


Sapper James Thomas Martin was on his first operational deployment as part of 3rd Battalion Royal Australian Regiment Task Group. He was a sapper from the Brisbane based 2nd Combat Engineer Regiment. I know Enoggera Army barracks well. I worked next door to them for six years. I hope that during the time he spent in Brisbane he enjoyed our wonderful Queensland weather and the food and the good times available there. I hope he had some great times while he was based in Queensland. He was born in Perth, Western Australia in 1991, barely 21 years ago. He enlisted in the Australian Regular Army on 24 January 2011 and completed his recruit training at the 1st Recruit Training Battalion in Wagga Wagga in April 2011, where he was allocated to the Corps of Royal Australian Engineers. In May 2011, Sapper Martin attended the School of Military Engineering in Sydney and began his Initial Employment Training as a combat engineer. On completion of his combat engineer course in August 2011, he was posted to the 2nd Combat Engineer Regiment in Brisbane. On his arrival at the 2nd Combat Engineer Regiment, Sapper Martin became a member of the 7th Combat Engineer Squadron. He completed a number of additional courses including Combat Engineer High Threat Search, Communications and Weapon courses. Along with the rest of his squadron, Sapper Martin's force was concentrated in Townsville with 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment in early 2012, in preparation for their deployment to Afghanistan. Sapper Martin was an intellectual soldier who was a quick learner and adapted well to the Army environment. This was a man dedicated to serving his country. Even when his mates were thinking of withdrawing from training, he said, 'I won't give up this opportunity for anything,' and he did not. 


He was respected by his mates and was considered a loyal friend and comrade. A musically talented individual, he often played his bass guitar for his mates. For anyone that knows the music industry, and I say this as a former bass player, the bass player is just the guy that works in the background with not all the flair of an elite singer—leaving aside Paul McCartney or Sting or Steve Kolbe, from The Church, or even Mark King from Level 42, all those lead singer bass players—so normally the bass player does the hard work although not like a drummer, which is a different sort of person altogether. The bass player does the solid work and keeps the music bumping along. So I am glad to hear that he played his bass for his mates. Like many Western Australians, he was also a follower of Aussie Rules. Sapper Martin has been awarded the following honours and awards: the Australian Active Service Medal with Clasp ICAT, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the Australian Defence Medal, the NATO Non Article 5 Medal with Clasp ISAF, and the Army Combat Badge. He is survived by his mother, Suzanne Thomas, his younger brother and sister Angus and Holly, and his grandparents Lucille and Ralph Thomas. We will never take his sacrifice and his comrades' sacrifice for granted and we will never allow ourselves to forget what people like Sapper Martin have done for our nation.


I now move on to Private Robert Poate, who was a member of the 3rd Battalion Royal Australian Regiment Task Group and was also from 6th Battalion Royal Australian Regiment based in Brisbane, Queensland, at Enoggera. Private Poate was born in Canberra, in 1988, the bicentennial year. He enlisted in the Army in 2009. On completion of his basic and initial employment training, he was posted as a rifleman to 6RAR. Private Poate was a highly qualified soldier, having completed specialist training as a protected mobility vehicle driver in 2010 and protected mobility vehicle commander in 2011. Knowing that he was going to Afghanistan, they would have been important skills to have.


Private Poate was known for having outstanding leadership potential, which led to him completing a promotion course for corporal in 2011. He will be fondly remembered by his brothers by choice in 6RAR as a larrikin and an incredibly professional soldier—that mix that we often hear about Australian soldiers, sailors and airmen. Private Poate had a reputation for creating mischief without getting caught—such a very Australian tradition. He was very proud of his family; he was proud of his military service; and he was also proud of his Canberra origins, as so many people from the ACT are. He was known for his ranga hair, which he so often defended as being strawberry blonde. While I am not so sure that our Prime Minister Gillard would ever try to defend her hair as being strawberry blonde, apparently that is what Private Poate did, and all power to him.


Private Poate was awarded the following honours and awards: Australian Active Service Medal with Clasp ICAT, Afghanistan Campaign Medal, Australian Defence Medal, NATO Non Article 5 Medal with Clasp ISAF, and the Infantry Combat Badge. Private Poate is survived by his parents, Hugh and Janny, and his sister Nicola. To you, your friends, your extended family, the 2nd/14th Light Horse Regiment (Queensland Mounted Infantry), the 2nd Combat Engineer Regiment, and the 6th Battalion Royal Australian Regiment, may I express my deepest sympathies on behalf of myself and all the people of Moreton that I represent. Our thoughts and prayers are with you.


Unfortunately there is nothing new about war, but in Australia we are fortunate that most of the wars have been fought far from our shores, World War II aside. However, it is such events as these that have occurred in Afghanistan that remind us and bring home the horrors and tragedies of war and the importance of our armed forces. The 11th anniversary of September 11 is a poignant reminder of the daily challenges that Australian soldiers face in their hard but necessary work on behalf of all Australians.


I know that the words of a politician who has not met these three brave soldiers would be only small comfort, but, as I said, not saying anything would not be appropriate. On such occasions there are more skilful wordsmiths than me, so I turn to the words of a poet. I turn to the words of Paul Kelly, one of Australia's greatest singer-songwriters. I was going to quote from one of his songs called No you, which might be appropriate. The final verse says:


I do not lack good companions


To pick a man up when he's down


We go to the track on Saturdays


Spread our money 'round


I go up and down


And every single sound says


No you! No you! No you! No you!


No you, no you, no you!


But it was not as hopeful as I would like it to have been, so I turn instead to a poem by Paul Kelly that might offer some comfort. It is called Smoke under the bridgeand it is about companionship. It says:


All day long I've been walking


And mostly to myself I've been talking


The lonesome night is too quickly falling


In this unfriendly town


It's cold when the sun goes down


So I'll head for the river and look for smoke under the bridge


I'll keep on moving 'til I find smoke under the bridge


A little shelter, a friendly fire under the bridge


Once I had a place I could call my own


Now wherever I lay my head is home


Ran into some trouble back on down the road


They didn't like the look of me


Someone took a hook at me


I'll keep my eyes open for smoke under the bridge


Keep on hoping for smoke under the bridge


A warm fire, some company under the bridge


I'll keep on looking for smoke under the bridge


Keep on walking to smoke under the bridge


A little shelter, a friendly fire, some company under the bridge


I'll keep walking


Regarding the three soldiers we are commemorating today, Milosevic, Martin and Poate, I say lest we forget.

Mr TUDGE
 (Aston) (10:54):  I rise also to speak to this condolence motion, which was moved by the Acting Prime Minister and was spoken to by numerous parliamentarians before me. I acknowledge the member for Moreton with regard to his very moving and fine words, and I associate myself with his comments.


Every soldier lost in the line of duty is a tragedy. Every circumstance and situation where we lose one of our own is dark and sorrowful. However, to mourn three soldiers killed in an act of betrayal is a heavy burden indeed. Lance Corporal Stjepan 'Rick' Milosevic, Sapper James Thomas Martin and Private Robert Poate, on operations in Afghanistan, had their lives tragically taken from them in an insider attack at Patrol Base Wahab in the Baluchi Valley region of Uruzgan Province on the evening of 29 August 2012. Today, I stand also to honour their memory. Today, I stand to mourn with a nation.


Lance Corporal Milosevic, a 40-year-old Queensland outback raised and former Marist student, carried on a proud family tradition of military service, joining the army when he was 36. He became dedicated to the army, and was known for his strong sense of right and wrong which saw him rise quickly within its ranks. He was highly respected as a leader who put his soldiers ahead of himself. He was clearly a well-liked member of his regiment, with leadership and professional abilities which stood out in the unit, on the rugby field and on operations. Lance Corporal Milosevic is survived by his wife and their two children, for whom he was a loving and much loved husband and father. Those who knew him well said his family was always uppermost in his mind. This nation mourns with them today.


Sapper James Martin was on his first operational deployment as part of the 3rd Battalion, the Royal Australian Regiment Task Group with the Brisbane based 2nd Combat Engineer Regiment. The 21-year-old from Perth became a combat engineer and was well-known as a meticulous researcher. He was a quick learner who adapted well to the army environment. As a member of the 7th Combat Engineer Squadron, Sapper Martin completed a number of additional courses, including combat engineer, high-threat search and communications, and weapons courses. He was respected by his colleagues and, I understand, was considered a very loyal friend and comrade. He was also a keen musician, as the member for Moreton pointed out. Apparently he often played his bass guitar for his mates, even over in the field. He was also an avid follower of Aussie Rules—I do not know which team, but I was hoping it might be the Kangaroos. His love for his family was well known within his unit. The nation also shares the loss and extends its sympathy to his mother Suzanne Thomas, his younger brother Angus and his sister Holly, as well as his grandparents Lucille and Ralph Thomas.


Private Robert Poate was born in Canberra in 1988. He enlisted in the army in 2009 and was posted as a rifleman to 6 RAR. 'Robbie' to his family and 'Poatey' to his mates, I understand, was a larrikin in the great Australian tradition—one of the boys, a young man who loved to laugh and gave as much as he got. He will be fondly remembered by his 'brothers by choice' in 6 RAR as an incredibly professional soldier, but also one with a reputation for creating mischief and getting away with it. He was well-known for having outstanding leadership potential and had completed a promotion course for corporal in 2011. 


He was a highly qualified soldier with specialist training as a protected mobility vehicle driver and was a protected mobility vehicle commander. Private Poate is survived by his parents Hugh and Janny, and his sister Nicola. He was known to have been very proud of his family, his military service, his Canberra origins, and his red hair, as the member for Moreton also pointed out.


The nation mourns with the families of these fallen heroes. We look up to them. We honour them and acknowledge the terrible loss to their families and to this nation. Lest we forget.

Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (10:59):  Can I associate myself with remarks of the Acting Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence, the Leader of the Opposition and all those other members of the parliament who have spoken in this condolence motion, and express our sympathy to the family and friends of Sapper James Thomas Martin, Lance Corporal Stjepan Milosevic and Private Robert Hugh Frederick Poate.


These three brave men were murdered, as we know now, in an insider attack in Afghanistan on 29 August this year. It is important that we fully appreciate the ultimate sacrifice made by these brave men, who laid down their lives for us, for their country and for their mates. There can be nothing more terrible than when that life is lost at the hands of one whom we were there to assist.


These three soldiers were from very different parts of Australia: Perth, Penrith and Canberra. They were men at different stages in their lives and in their careers as Australian soldiers, united in their service to the nation. These three brave sons will never be forgotten. As we know, Sapper James Martin hailed from Perth. He was a young soldier at the beginning of his career, a career that was so unjustly and unfairly cut short. In his youth he played cricket with Maylands Cricket Club and played local football with Bayswater Bears football club. He traded these teams for the much larger team—but still welcoming one—of the Australian Army when he enlisted in 2011. He joined the 2nd Combat Engineer Regiment in Brisbane. He was, as we have been told, an intelligent soldier, a quick learner and a bloke who embraced the challenge of service life—earning the respect of his mates as a loyal friend and comrade. Through his service and sacrifice he will always have the respect of his country. This was his first operational deployment. He is survived by his mother Suzanne, his younger siblings Angus and Holly, and his grandparents Lucille and Ralph. To his family and friends, I say his service is now part of Australia's story. It will never be underestimated nor will it be forgotten.


Lance Corporal Milosevic served in the Army since 2008. He was a very much-liked and respected member of the 2nd/14th Light Horse Regiment Queensland Mounted Infantry. He had a dry sense of humour, we are told. He was easy-going and had a natural charm—and, to those who knew that about him best, I send my sincere condolences. We know he had fine leadership skills both as a soldier and on the sporting field playing his much-loved rugby. His rise to the rank of Lance Corporal was quick, a testament to his talent and drive to succeed. He served in Iraq in 2010 and in Afghanistan in 2012. He is survived by his wife Kelly, his young daughters Sarah and Kate, his mother Heather and siblings Milan and Danica. Today, on the day of his funeral in Brisbane, we send our sympathies and condolences to his family, his friends and his comrades. He was a proud family man and a promising soldier with a very bright future so horribly cut short as a result of this very cowardly act. It is a future which his family and friends will miss every single day. As Lieutenant Mark Welburn of the 2nd/14th Light Horse said only last week, 'He is now and forever part of the Light Horse.'


Today the family and friends of Private Robert Poate are coming together in Canberra at his old school, Canberra Grammar, to farewell a son, a brother and a mate. We pay tribute to him here in this place as well. Private Poate joined the Army in 2009, taking up the post as a rifleman in the 6th Battalion RAR. He was selected, as we now know, for promotion very early in his career.


Within two years of enlistment, he had qualified as a protected mobility vehicle driver and commander, and his brothers by choice within the ADF and 6 RAR knew him as a professional soldier and, as we have heard a number of times now, quite a larrikin. I do not know if it was his red hair, but he was clearly a larrikin.


We know it will be his family and friends who miss him most of all. The salute to his service and sacrifice in Australia's name can never fulfil or console for his loss. I know his mates in Afghanistan are back at work, now driving an armoured vehicle christened 'Poatey' in tribute to his work as a protector. Private Poate is survived by his parents, Hugh and Janny, and his sister, Nicola. I would like to thank them for raising such a selfless son, who gave his all for his country.


These three men from different parts of Australia were united in their service. They were, indeed, brothers by choice. The loss of Sapper Martin, Lance Corporal Milosevic and Private Poate in such terrible circumstances has led many, as you would expect, to question our commitment in Afghanistan. Indeed, it is always right to question our actions and we should constantly assess and review our path, particularly when the price is so high. To go on blindly without questioning would be an affront to our system of democracy. At this terrible time, perhaps now more than ever, we must continue to be clear-sighted and focused. Our objective remains to prevent Afghanistan from being again a safe haven for terrorists. We will not be in Afghanistan for that much longer. The transition to an Afghan led security responsibility in Uruzgan has commenced and we are on track. We are there for a set purpose and a set time and should not and must not let our losses be in vain.


All deaths, during peace time or war, are heartbreaking—indeed, to families, friends and comrades, shattering. Lives are shortened and loved ones are left behind to grieve and pick up the pieces. These three men loved the service, its challenges and opportunities, the comradeship and the community. Their deaths are on their own devastating, as they are doubly heartbreaking as they came at the hands of a coward. This is a difficult fact that will take a long time to reconcile, if ever it can be. At times like this, with grief so inconsolable, it would be easy to walk away. But, if we did so, we would simply compound our loss. We have always been a nation that sees things through, that keeps to its commitments and that gets the job done. We are a nation who honour the fallen by finishing what we started.


Sapper James Martin, Lance Corporal Rick Milosevic and Private Robert Poate will never be forgotten. Their names will sit alongside those other names on the walls of the Australian War Memorial, forever enshrined. Our condolences, our thoughts and our prayers are with their families, their friends and their mates. Their contribution and their sacrifice will be forever remembered.


I want to conclude by reminding all of us that we can never imagine what it is like to serve in such a conflict. We can never imagine the courage that it takes to put that uniform on, carry a weapon and fight for your country. Those of us who have not served can never put ourselves in that place. So the respect we must have for all our serving men and women is, as it should be, very high. It underlines, I think, the courage, the conviction and the sacrifice that men and women such as these three brave soldiers are prepared to commit to when they put on that uniform and embark on an overseas mission.


They know that the challenges are extreme, they know that the threats are extreme, but none of them should expect to be treated so poorly by a comrade or supposed colleagues—people who would shoot them down in such a cowardly way. These three very, very brave young men deserve forever our respect, our admiration and our love. Lest we forget.

Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (11:10):  I rise with great sadness to speak on this condolence motion. At the outset I would like to associate myself with the very eloquent words of the minister who spoke just before me. We all in this place join together in honouring the memory and the sacrifice of five very brave Australians who lost their lives defending our freedoms and our rights that we take for granted every day, on the single worst day for casualties that we have seen since the Vietnam War. Lance Corporal Stjepan Milosevic, Sapper James Martin, Private Robert Poate, Lance Corporal Mervyn McDonald and Private Nathanael Galagher are our latest victims of this tragedy that is war and today I speak in particular of Lance Corporal Stjepan Milosevic, Sapper James Martin and Private Robert Poate. 


What makes this tragedy so hard to digest is that these three soldiers were killed by the very person that they were trying to help. They were all shot by a rogue Afghan soldier whilst unwinding with beer after a long day of service. This cowardly internal attack is particularly disturbing because the enemy was walking within. I want to say a few words about each of these brave soldiers. 


Lance Corporal Stjepan Milosevic, or 'Rick' as his mates used to refer to him, was a highly decorated soldier who received many awards: the Australian Active Service Medal with Clasps IRAQ 2003 and ICAT, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the Iraq Campaign Medal, the Australian Defence Medal, NATO Non Article 5 Medal with Clasp ISAF, the Army Combat Badge and the Return from Active Service Badge. At Kapooka he was deemed the most outstanding soldier. A soldier to the end, Rick was on his second deployment to the Middle East. He is survived by his partner, Kelly; their daughters, Sarah and Kate; his mother, Heather; his brother, Milan; and his sister, Danica.


Sapper James Martin was born in Perth in 1991 and joined the armed forces in 2011. Sapper Martin was on his first operational mission as part of the 3rd Battalion, the Royal Australian Regiment Task Group. He was known to be highly intelligent, and Sapper Martin was extremely well regarded by his peers. He was destined for even greater things in the armed forces. Sapper Martin received the following awards: the Australian Active Service Medal with Clasp ICAT, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the Australian Defence Medal, NATO Non Article 5 Medal with Clasp ISAF and the Army Combat Badge. He is survived by his mother, Suzanne Thomas; his younger brother, Angus; his sister, Holly; and his grandparents, Lucille and Ralph Thomas.


Private Robert Poate was also a member of the 3rd Battalion, the Royal Australian Regiment Task Group. Private Poate was highly regarded for his leadership potential, having just completed a promotion course for the rank of corporal. Private Poate has also been awarded many honours and awards: the Australian Active Service Medal with Clasp ICAT, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the Australian Defence Medal, the NATO Non Article 5 Medal with Clasp ISAF and the Infantry Combat Badge. Private Poate is survived by his parents, Hugh and Janny, and his sister, Nicola.


We thank these brave men for their service and their sacrifice. We honour their memory today. We grieve with their families, their friends and their comrades, whose lives have been changed forever.


These brave young men have paid the ultimate price for their loyalty and patriotism. In this country, we are forever grateful for their service in defending our values. It is particularly poignant, especially the day after the anniversary of September 11 and almost 10 years since the Bali bombing, that we would be standing in this place and honouring these men. My words are simply not eloquent enough. I need to refer to some words by Rudyard Kipling that struck me, where he said:


All we have of freedom—all we use or know—


This our fathers bought for us, long and long ago.


We owe them a great debt for their sacrifice. May they rest in peace and lest we forget.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (11:15):  It is with great sadness that I rise today to support the condolence motion for Lance Corporal Stjepan 'Rick' Milosevic, Sapper James Thomas Martin and Private Robert Hugh Frederick Poate. These men, Australian soldiers on a mission to prevent the spread of terrorism and to bring peace and stability to the people of Afghanistan, died in the most tragic and heartbreaking way. My fellow members have spoken with great passion about the circumstances in which these men lost their lives. What has come across in the speeches that have been made today, and also from the sentiments in the community, is the devastation of the deaths and the fact that they were killed by someone they trusted, so there was an absolute breach of trust, which for any human being rocks you to the core.


I met many soldiers in Afghanistan when I was there and I met those who were training the ANA. They were very young men in their early 20s and they were classic Australian larrikin types, with a great sense humour and a bit naughty. What struck me about them was their absolute dedication and commitment to getting that army up to standard so that they could protect their own people and protect the stability of Afghanistan. For that breach of trust to occur, like it did under those circumstances, is just extraordinary, which is why I know it has rocked so many of my fellow colleagues here and the general community in Australia and throughout Canberra.


Today I offer my condolences to the family and friends of these soldiers. In particular, I offer condolences from the people of Canberra to the family and friends of Private Robert Poate. Robert was born here in Canberra in 1988. He attended the Canberra Grammar School. I understand he was a young man who attended right throughout his schooling. He was a Grammar boy through and through. Robert enlisted in the Army in 2009 and, after completing his basic and initial employment training, was posted as a rifleman to the 6th Battalion Royal Australian Regiment at the Gallipoli Barracks in Brisbane. In 2010 he completed specialist training as a protected mobility vehicle driver, going on to complete further specialist training in 2011 to become a protected mobility vehicle commander.


The funeral of Private Poate, known as 'Poatey' to his mates, will be held in Canberra today. Robert will be laid to rest with full military honours at the Canberra Grammar School, which is so appropriate. I understand the senior schoolboys and staff will be lining the route of the funeral service at the beginning of the service. This is a very sad and emotional day for many people in Canberra, particularly those at Canberra Grammar School. It came as a deep blow to the Canberra Grammar community. I spoke to the Principal of Canberra Grammar, Dr Justin Garrick, last week. He explained to me how the community was incredibly devastated by this loss. As soon as they heard the news they had a special service at the school. Private Poate was a deeply loved and honoured member of that community and it has been a very deep blow to them. It is appropriate that he is honoured in such a way today at his former school, where he spent so much of his life.


I was very moved by the words of Hugh and Janny Poate, Robert's parents, that were reported in today's Canberra Times. Their son was known as a larrikin like so many Australian soldiers, with the ability to create mischief without getting caught—also like so many Australian soldiers. I gather Robert liked to stir a bit. The tributes to him tell a story of a dedicated soldier with a mischievous sense of humour and, of course, that famous strawberry blonde hair. Robert's parents have been overwhelmed by the tributes that have filled their home, many from Robert's mates and many from fellow Canberrans expressing their condolences.


Janny Poate described her son as warm and loving and said he would probably be a bit embarrassed by all this attention. But this attention is more than deserved. Every soldier who gives their life to serve their country by helping to bring peace to people under threat deserves to be honoured by the parliament and by the people. As I mentioned before, I have been to Tarin Kot, Kandahar and Kabul as part of the Defence subcommittee and I saw firsthand the determination and focus of the Australian troops in their mission to eliminate terrorism from the region and create a peaceful and safe country for the people of Afghanistan. I also saw the loyalty and camaraderie of soldiers and I can only imagine the hurt and grief they are experiencing at the loss of three of their own. Our soldiers are a very tight-knit community and they are a very loyal bunch.


We heard others talk of Robert Poate's role as part of Operation SLIPPER in Afghanistan where he tragically died at a patrol base in the Baluchi Valley. I am not going to go into any more detail about that but what I will say is that the loss of these three young soldiers is having a devastating impact on their families, their friends and the Defence community. The Australian Defence Force is an integral part of the Australian and Canberra communities, touching the lives of many people. While the ADF headquarters are here in Canberra, the strong Defence presence is respected by the entire community and we have a deep admiration for all our men and women who serve, which is why it is so hard to lose three of these great soldiers.


Today, in particular, the thoughts and prayers of the Canberra community are with Robert Poate's parents, Hugh and Janny, and his sister, Nicola. While I did not know Robert Poate personally, over the last week I have heard incredible stories and tributes which are testimony to his talent and commitment. On behalf of all Canberrans, we honour the sacrifice of Lance Corporal Milosevic, Sapper James Martin and Private Robert Poate who lost their lives in such a tragic way and in a way that really does challenge our moral core. Lest we forget and may they rest in peace.

"Truss, Warren, MP",Nats,2012-09-12,"



Mr TRUSS
 (Wide Bay—Leader of The Nationals) (11:22):  Today in this motion and in the one to follow, we are paying tribute to five outstanding Australian men—soldiers cut down in the line of duty and in the prime of their lives. It is difficult for any of us to make sense of our losses in Afghanistan, especially when those losses occur in circumstances such as happened on one day just a week or so ago. We cannot begin to understand the shattering effect on their families. Likewise, the Australian people have been struggling with these latest tragic circumstances.


Lance Corporal Stjepan ‘Rick’ Milosevic, Sapper James Martin from Perth and Private Robert Poate from Canberra were killed by a rogue Afghan soldier at a patrol base in Uruzgan Province. In a separate incident, Lance Corporal Mervin McDonald of Carnarvon in Western Australia and Private Nathanael Galagher of Wee Waa in New South Wales died when their helicopter crashed in Helmand Province. An accident and a betrayal have cost this country dearly. Together they mark the single highest loss of Australian troops since 1971 and the Vietnam War. We have suffered losses in war before yet the losses of these five Australians, far from home, on the same day, came as a shock to all Australians. Our armed forces are the cream of the crop. They are engaged in dangerous places and under difficult circumstances but tragic news always comes hard. We must take solace in the knowledge that Australia's role in Afghanistan is making the world a safer place. What our troops are doing on the ground in Afghanistan matters, and it is making a difference. These events illustrate just how dangerous that job is. There are never places where you can be assured of being safe or being protected from risk.


Bringing home the troops before their mission is complete, as some have demanded, would dishonour all who have fallen and would make their sacrifice in vain. Our troops should come home as soon as the job is completed. There can be no doubt that the circumstances surrounding these tragedies are especially hard for all of us to come to grips with, especially the families, the loved ones and comrades most directly affected. An accident is regrettable, but when it comes with such a toll we must ask questions about how this could happen and what can be done to ensure it does not happen again. But betrayal is unforgivable. Questions of how this could happen and why, how it was organised and whether it was just one individual acting alone or at random are natural and we may never know the answers.


The bitter irony of these deaths is not lost on any of us. Our troops are in Afghanistan training and mentoring around 200 Afghan soldiers who provide security for the Afghan people. It is a rebuilding mission—a mission to put Afghanistan on a course to self-determination free from repression and to provide safety and security for the Afghan people. It is also a mission of the utmost strategic importance to Australia and our people. Terrorism knows no borders. Unchecked, we have seen it spread like a cancer and we have been touched by it through the loss of civilian Australians from the actions of such people. In Afghanistan we are striking at its very roots. Naturally that has been a military operation, but it is also a battle for the hearts and minds of the Afghan people. The relationships being forged by our troops with the Afghan people are essential if we are to subdue and ultimately defeat the mentality that begets terrorism and breeds terrorists. Lance Corporal Milosevic, Sapper Martin, Private Poate, Lance Corporal McDonald and Private Galagher knew that well. The aftermath of these tragic events reverberates still and, as the funerals are being held now across the country, we are reminded again of the personal sacrifice that has been involved for these men and their families.


Confidence is undermined, of course, when it comes to a rogue Afghan soldier slaying Australian troops. Perhaps that is their goal. Some commentators say that confidence betrayed means that it is misplaced, that we should not be there. I disagree. I think these events drive home to us all the harsh reality that our troops face every day and the bravery they display day in, day out, doing a job that needs to be done. This is a unique mission with unique dangers from an unprecedented theatre of war. It is an important task with ramifications for quelling future terrorist activity.


That does not make these five deaths, and any that have become before, any easier to bear. My sincere hope is that those feeling the pain of these losses most deeply can find some consolation in knowing the sacrifice of their loved ones is creating a new, safer and freer Afghanistan and, in doing so, making Australia and the world also safer for us all. Their sacrifice is not in vain, but we grieve with their families on these tragic losses.

"Scott, Bruce, MP",Nats,2012-09-12,"



Mr BRUCE SCOTT
 (Maranoa—Second Deputy Speaker) (11:28):  I rise to join with others on this condolence motion for Lance Corporal Stjepan (Rick)—or Milo, as he is known—Milosevic, who grew up in Quilpie in my electorate in Queensland, some 800 kilometres west of Brisbane. It is rather poignant that right at this very moment his private service is being conducted in Brisbane at Marist College Ashgrove. I spoke to people there knowing that I could not be there today—it was a private service and I respect the wishes of the family.


I am also here to pay my respects to Sapper James Thomas Martin and Private Robert Hugh Frederick Poate. It is not a coincidence but it is a reminder to us all that it was on the day of 11 September 2001 that the free world was attacked by terrorists using not weapons of war but civilian aircraft. So I think it serves all of us in this place at this time to be reminded of the events that have brought about our involvement in Afghanistan.


The three soldiers who are part of the condolence motion, 'Rick', James and Robert, were killed by a soldier that they trusted, an Afghani—but you cannot attach the word 'soldier' to that person; he is a coward. Our soldiers, our men, our Australian Defence Force and we in Australia thought we could trust him, but the only word you could use to describe his actions is 'cowardly'. You could never use the word 'soldier' because soldiers are people of courage and of commitment and of values. Of course, they are prepared to do things that many of us perhaps would never do ourselves but they do them in the name of Australia as they serve under our flag, and I respect the professionalism that they display each and every day that they serve.


Our three soldiers about whom this condolence motion reflects on today were well trained. They were professional. They had the support of the parliament. It is one of those things that in this place when we commit soldiers, our Australian Defence Force personnel, to an operation overseas where they will be in harm's way I always have to reflect for a moment because we are, in fact, by the resolution of the parliament, committing troops to a theatre of a war or a peacekeeping operation where there are risks. In Afghanistan we have lost some 38 wonderful Australians who leave behind them family, friends, wives, partners and, as so often, children. When we do commit our troops to an operation overseas I have to think very carefully about how we do that to make sure that we are doing everything possible to support our troops when we commit their services through that resolution of the parliament—and it must be unwavering support.


Rick was born in New South Wales, where he grew up, and his very early education was in Quilpie, in Western Queensland, where his mother, his brother and other members of his family still live. In fact, his brother was recently elected to the Quilpie Shire Council. I know that Rick's death has hit the Quilpie Shire and Western Queensland particularly hard because it is a very close knit community, a small rural community with a very proud record of service to our nation. Many community members throughout time have served in the Australian Defence Force, in the Army, Air Force or Navy, including during the First World War, the Second World War, Vietnam and Korea. So it is a very proud community, and I know this has had a significant effect not just on the Quilpie Shire but also on the surrounding shires—we have all felt it. When I got the news it was one of those things where you draw in your breath and think about another loss of life, another family in which children will grow up without a father—in this case, Rick's children. And, of course, there is Rick's wife, who is a mother, and his extended family.


Rick was one of those guys who went into the Army at quite a mature age, at 36. He was actually awarded for his initial training at Kapooka—an outstanding soldier award. That, to me, said a bit more about Rick. You can imagine the young guys saying, 'I think we are fitter than this fellow who is a bit older than us'—probably twice their age. Rick was a stocky guy and played a good game of football out there in Western Queensland and was loved by so many. His commitment and leadership shone through at his training at Kapooka. He was promoted to lance corporal—a further demonstration of his leadership qualities—and I know that he would have had an outstanding career in the Army. Another thing I want to say about Rick is that he was a family person. Family meant everything to him, as it does to his mother, his brothers and his sisters. It meant everything to him.


Since this tragedy occurred in Afghanistan there have been some comments about whether we should bring our troops home. I would like to share with you an email that I received from a constituent of mine whose son is in Afghanistan. I will not use their name, because I want to preserve their privacy. It is interesting. I will quote from the email that my constituent received from their son. In the email, their son said:


It was a sad morning this morning when we farewelled the bodies of the guys killed last week, and I understand you're concern but I want you to take a second and read something for me.


He said to his mother:


Read Mark Chapter 8 verses 31 to 38.


So I can assure you that those in the services do have the strength and the support of the spiritual belief that helps them through times like this—and I think this is reflected in his email. He went on to say:


We have lost some men, but to impose some knee-jerk reaction as a consequence only serves to trivialise their lives and the sacrifice that they and their families have made.


He went on to say:


Coming to this country I had ideas about what I was doing and why I was doing it, but the incidents around this week have crystallised that understanding for me. I guess that you have heard about the 17 young people that were beheaded by the Taliban. They were in a province just a little distance from us here, just kids having a party whose only sin was to be playing music and dancing at that party. According to the news reports it is becoming their preferred form of social intimidation. Surely pure evil in is basest form.


Our guys are doing great work over here, giving the locals options to that oppressive regime, and hopefully slowing the movement of drugs into the western world. The main focus at the moment is working towards an orderly withdrawal, which I'm sure that your pleased about.


He went on to say:


Ultimately we'll probably never know the difference that we, or more particularly those that have lost their lives or been injured over here, will have made. But there is the possibility that because were here one Afghani will have the chance, the courage, or just the idea to make a difference in this country. And if there is one, then there could be many and it could make such a difference in our world as a whole. I only know that if we weren't here they wouldn't have that chance.


He went on to say in his email:


The Padre who led the service today quoted the old saying, 'The only thing required for evil to flourish in this world is for good men to do nothing.' I think that this place makes that statement very real.


Those comments I read are from an email from a soldier who is in the field, in theatre, and who knew Rick. He is from my constituency and his parents live there, but I want to protect their names. I do not want to necessarily link them to this, but I do want to thank them for the email that they have shared with me.


I think it is important to share those words in this condolence motion because they say a lot about those who are in the field. We as a nation and we as members of parliament are committed by resolution of the parliament to a task in Afghanistan we must see through.


Lance Corporal Rick Milosevic was known as 'Milo'. I am not quite sure how he got the name 'Milo', but there is a large sheep property out there called 'Milo'. Maybe he worked in shearing sheds in his holidays or something, because his parents had a business there. They had mail runs out of Quilpie and did a lot of building in and around Quilpie. In 2003 Lance Corporal Rick Milosevic received the Australian Active Service Medal with Iraq 2003 and ICAT clasps, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the Iraq Campaign Medal, the Australian Defence Medal, the NATO Non-Article 5 Medal with ISAF clasp, the Army Combat Badge and, very proudly worn by those who have been in active service, the Returned From Active Service Badge.


It is at times like these that we all reflect on our own lucky circumstances in Australia, but we also must remember that those who are lost—and we have lost 38 in Afghanistan—leave behind them families. It is to those that I address my deepest sympathies and condolences, not only on my own behalf but on behalf of my constituency of Maranoa and on behalf of the parliament. They will forever need our support as a nation. I know that for Rick's widow, now a war widow, and his children the work of the Department of Veterans' Affairs and Legacy will be very important to support the family left behind. In this country, we must never diminish our financial support for those who are left behind. We have one of the best systems in the world. Regardless of budget surpluses or deficits, their service and support must always be paramount in the minds of all of us. To those families, and particularly to Rick's family, his mother—his father has passed away—his brother and his extended family, I say, 'My deepest condolence to you.' Rest in peace, Rick. We will never forget you.

Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Opposition Whip) (11:42):  I join the House and all members in honouring Lance Corporal Stjepan 'Rick' Milosevic, Sapper James Martin and Private Robert Poate from the 3 RAR Task Group, who were tragically killed in action on the evening of 29 August at Patrol Base Wahab in the Baluchi Valley. In the same attack, two of their comrades were wounded. I realise that the families, comrades and friends of these men may take a long time to bring themselves to read these condolences. It will not be easy for them to read these condolences because their grief, loss and anguish at this point are beyond measure, as the member for Maranoa reflected on. Some may never be able to read our words, such will be their loss. However, I offer my sincere condolences to Lance Corporal Milosevic's partner, Kelly, his daughters, Sarah and Kate, his mother, his brothers and his sisters. I offer my condolences to Sapper James Martin's mother, Suzanne Thomas, his younger brother and sister, Angus and Holly, and his grandparents, Lucille and Ralph Thomas. I also offer my condolences to Private Robert Poate's parents, Hugh and Janny, and his sister, Nicola.


In this place, we do need to honour and respect these fine men and the sacrifice they have made for our nation, but we also need to honour and respect the sacrifice their families have also made for our nation and the ongoing sacrifice that they now will continue to make. I do not know how many others in this place have the same experience, but my mother was a war widow. My two older sisters and my mother lived all their lives with the sacrifice that they made, as well as the sacrifice of their husband and father.


So I know what is ahead for these families, and it will not be easy. As the member for Maranoa said, they will get wonderful support from Legacy, from the defence community and from their broader community. But nothing will change their loss, and they have to live with that on a daily basis.


These three specialist volunteers, these three brave men, will be remembered for their leadership, their dedication to their Army, but from what I understand mostly their love of life. All were on the very first tour of Afghanistan and all were highly respected and outstanding leaders. The loss of these soldiers is even more tragic given the treacherous nature of their death—something that I think enraged all Australians, no matter where they were when they heard this news. We all considered it such a cowardly, insider attack. We do know that we are in this battle to stay the course and to honour the sacrifice that has already been made, not to cut and run.


Having been to Afghanistan and spent time with our troops on the ground in theatre, I understand firsthand what they believe about their mission and how committed they are to doing what needs doing in Afghanistan. They all understand the job that this parliament has asked them to do. I saw the work that they have done in the provisional reconstruction. In 2000-01 in Afghanistan there was no government, no health services, no basic governance and no education. They see firsthand what they are able to achieve on the ground. But the actions of our enemies, given the cowardly attack, will not define our actions nor change our attitude. That is something that has been reinforced across this parliament. We will keep doing what is right in the face of such a grievous wrong.


In doing so, I believe we honour the legacy of not only these three brave Australian soldiers but all who have gone before them. Above all, though, these three men were loved by their families, and they will be mourned and missed forever. Their families have to live with this loss for the rest of their lives. I know that there have been requests to respect the family's privacy during this time, but I do hope there will come a time when their loved ones and those closest to them can bring themselves to read these condolence motions and understand that we in this place share their grief, and we simply want to show respect for those who have been lost.

Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (11:47):  I join my colleagues in honouring Lance Corporal Stjepan (Rick) Milosevic, Sapper James Martin and Private Robert Poate from 3RAR task group who were tragically killed in action and their two comrades who were wounded in action during an attack at Patrol Base Wahab in the Baluchi Valley on the evening of 29 August. I offer my condolences to Lance Corporal's Milosevic's partner, Kelly; his daughters, Sarah and Kate; and his mother, brothers and sisters. I extend my condolences to Sapper James Martin's mother, Suzanne Thomas; his younger brother and sister, Angus and Holly; and his grandparents, Lucille and Ralph Thomas. I extend my condolences to Private Robert Poate's parents, Hugh and Janny, and his sister, Nicola.


Sapper James Martin was on his first operational deployment as part of 3RAR, which is based in Townsville. They are under the control of a very qualified Lieutenant Colonel and they are a highly trained and highly skilled group of defence personnel. Sapper Martin came from the Brisbane based 2nd Combat Engineering Regiment. Along with the rest of his squadron, Sapper Martin's force concentrated in Townsville with the 3RAR in early 2012 in preparation for their deployment to Afghanistan.


Private Robert Hugh Frederick Poate was a member of the 3RAR and was from the 6RAR, based in Brisbane in the south-east corner of Queensland.


Lance Corporal Stjepan 'Rick' Milosevic, or 'Milo' as his mates called him, was deployed to Afghanistan in the same group. He was from the 2nd/14th Light Horse Regiment (Queensland Mounted Infantry) based in Brisbane.


During my fantastic rugby career, in my first year of senior football with the magnificent Bank of New South Wales Rugby Club in Brisbane, our two breakaways in first grade were Cedomir Milosevic and Miroslav Risojevic. Like all of Stjepan's mates who called him 'Milo' or 'Rick', Cedomir Milosevic was called 'Chad' and Miroslav Risojevic was called 'Rizzo'. I can only tell you one thing on behalf of all of them: if you have a bloke by the name of Milosevic in your team, you are going to go okay; he is going to be tough, he is going to go hard at the ball and he will take no prisoners—he will be hard at it.


3RAR has only been in Townsville for a short time. We are part of a very big defence family and we feel for the people who have copped this loss. We feel it as a community. For those who are wounded, we need to help you with your recovery; we need to understand what is going to happen to you when you come home and the problems you are going to face. And we need to look at the way that our allowances and pay are done for these people. There are the soldiers who accompany home the bodies and there are the wounded men who come home and go to hospital but want to move out of hospital to be with their families. All of their allowances and tax-free benefits must be looked at to support these people as best we possibly can. They have enough to worry about.


The overall command of the Australians in Afghanistan is now under the control of Major General Stuart Smith, who is the immediate past brigadier at the brigade in Townsville. He is the son of a Vietnam casualty. He knows first-hand. Those of us who have been to the funerals will understand the grief that has been shown by the families who have suffered these losses. The Defence Force Welfare Association and Legacy will do a great job for these families, but it is cold comfort for someone who has lost a family member. We just had a ball in Townsville to raise money for Legacy. I did the auction. We raised some fantastic money and everyone had a great night. It is these things that bring it home very quickly.


I have not been to Afghanistan but I talk to ADF personnel and their families. We will stay the course. We have a finish date and we do not cut and run. These guys understand that they have a role to play. We have professional soldiers and a very professional Army. Lest we forget.


Debate adjourned.
