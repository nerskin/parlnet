"Williams, Sen John",NATS,2010-10-26,"—Australia has always contributed over the last 100 or so years to playing its role in achieving world peace. This war against terrorism is no different. Australia has a proud history when we look at the heroic efforts of Australian soldiers in the Boer War, in World War I at the Battle of Beersheba, in World War II with the Rats of Tobruk achieving world peace there and especially in New Guinea, in the Korean War, in the Vietnam War at the Battle of Long Tan where Australian soldiers excelled with courage, in East Timor where we brought stability and now in Iraq and Afghanistan.
As I said at the start of my speech last night, it would be good to live in a perfect world; however, we do not. We see what terrorists have done. Brad Ridley from Forbes, who was one of my customers, was unfortunately killed in the bombing in Bali. There was the devastation of the towers in New York on September 11. Surely we cannot just turn our backs on what these terrorists are doing. If we do, then their murderous and destructive ways will simply continue. That is why we have to be part of this allied contribution in Afghanistan to bring Afghanistan to a state where it can look after itself, govern itself and have a strong defence force and police force to enforce their own laws to look after their country.
It is very sad that already 21 Australian soldiers have been killed in Afghanistan. I have one ambition in my life, and that is never to stand at the gravesite of one of my children. Unfortunately, many parents of those 21 soldiers have had to do that. That is sad in itself. We are fully aware that, if you join the Defence Force—if you join the Army, the Navy or the Air Force—you are taking on a dangerous occupation. Unfortunately, we have now seen the loss of 21 soldiers in Afghanistan. If those soldiers could speak to us today I wonder if they would say, ‘Get out of Afghanistan; walk away,’ or would say: ‘We have a job to do here. We have to clean this mess up in an effort to rid the world of terrorism so future generations can, hopefully, live in long-lasting peace.’ To cut and run now would be a betrayal in my opinion.
Our soldiers and our allies deserve our total support. Afghanistan must be able to stand on its own two feet. It has been a haven for the training of terrorists. We know that that is where many learned their terrible trades, if you can call them that, and carry out their activities against innocent human beings. I know that our soldiers are amongst the best, if not the best, in the world. They deserve our total support. They have a job to do. It is expensive. Unfortunately, it has been going on for a long time and will probably continue to go on for several years yet. But to cut and run now, to leave Afghanistan, to walk away from our allies who stuck with us during the Second World War, especially the United States of America, would be to me a betrayal of what we believe in and a betrayal of our allies.
I keep going back to the point that I wish we lived in a perfect world. Hopefully, one day we will, but we are far from it at the moment. While we have innocent people being killed and blown up by terrorist activities then this is something that our nation and our allies should never turn their backs on. We believe in freedom, we believe in democracy and we believe in peace, but so often peace comes at a cost. That has been the case in the world wars, in Korea, in Vietnam and in the following wars, and this is no different. This is a war against terrorists. We must do our bit and fight the war so that eventually we can say that we have had the win, we have had the victory. We have seen success in Iraq. We now have to go the full distance and see the victory day in Afghanistan.
I am not going to speak for much longer, but I just say in summary that I support our efforts in Afghanistan. I support our efforts in search of world peace, to rid the world of terrorism, to do the right thing by so many Australians—more than 80 were killed in Bali alone from the terrible bombing there—to do our bit and to play our role so that future generations not only in Australia but around the world can, hopefully, live in a peaceful world. As I said, peace comes at a price. It is terrible we have to pay that price. But I do believe that we should throw our total support behind this effort. Hopefully, sooner rather than later, we will see the victory which is ultimately the goal.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Afghanistan</title>,Ministerial Statements,2,1,speech
"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2010-10-26,"—This is the first time that many in this parliament will have debated the presence of our troops in overseas conflict zones. The question, however, takes on an altogether new meaning when you are a member of the defence family. This in fact is the third time that I have confronted this question. The first was in 2003 when a family member prepared to deploy to Iraq at the commencement of those hostilities, the second was in 2006 when he deployed to Afghanistan with the Reconstruction Task Force, and this is the third. Anyone placed in this position knows only too well the mixture of emotions. You reflect hourly—or, certainly if not hourly, daily—on the safety of your family member, the validity of the mission, the wisdom of executive government in sending them and the risk that they and their fellow soldiers confront. You cannot help but reflect on what your reaction would be in the event of receiving news that a family member is wounded or even worse. I cite yesterday’s news when we were advised that four Australian soldiers were wounded last week in Kandahar. Every Australian feels deeply for those soldiers and their families, as we do indeed for those who have been wounded elsewhere, or for the 21 who have died in Afghanistan.
As a person who was not in the Australian parliament at that time, I used to reflect on what I might say to the Prime Minister had our family been placed in that dreadful position. Ironically, here I am today. For me, this is a very personal debate. We are in the parliament to address an issue and we are somewhat remote from deployment. But let me assure you that everybody in the defence family is watching our contributions and the outcome of this debate, and I include both serving members as well as their families. For them, this also is very personal.
I applaud the opportunity for parliamentarians to discuss in open forum our deployment of troops overseas, so long as that debate is informed, mature and respects our obligations. However, I am firmly convinced that the decision to deploy our troops is that of the executive government of the day and not that of parliament in open session. We simply cannot have a circumstance in which every member of parliament, or senator, is briefed adequately by defence and others for the purpose.
Whilst I welcome the opportunity for vigorous debate and the presentation of alternative views which will emerge, there is a distinct and serious obligation on each of us to ensure that we say nothing to cause Australia to descend into the chasm of national shame which followed our withdrawal at the conclusion of the Vietnam War. I refer, of course, to the demonising of Australian troops upon their return. The decision to deploy them was political. They simply did as soldiers have always done and are doing Afghanistan—that is, complying with the demand of executive government and the orders of their superiors and performing to the best of their abilities. Whatever may be our views of Afghanistan, our presence and the possible outcomes, all of us have a clear responsibility to ensure that the Australian community differentiates between those who make the decision for our troops’ deployment and those who carry out the orders.
Why are we in Afghanistan? We are not a major player on the world stage. We do of course, however, perform well above our weight. We are proud of our contribution in the region and around the world. We have a strong tradition of providing aid and assistance in emergencies, even recent ones such as the tsunami, earthquakes and other natural disasters. Of course whilst we always could do more, we have a proud and strong record in Australia of long-term agricultural, medical and educational support throughout South-East Asia, the Middle East and the Pacific Island regions. I would say that it is entirely appropriate that we extend that philosophy into military support in these same spheres.
We all know, of course, of the strong alliance we have with the United States. It is pivotal to our security policy and it brings with it an obligation to honour that commitment. At the same time, Australia must examine on a case-by-case basis, having regard to our own commercial, regional and security objectives, those actions in which we join the United States. I also believe it is appropriate, in the context of Afghanistan, that we are seen to support the USA and our many NATO allies in the International Security Assistance Force or ISAF. We have long, strong, historic commercial and defence relations with many of those who are involved.
I turn to support for our troops on the ground. Contingent on executive government making the decision to deploy our troops, it is essential in my view that they are adequately resourced in terms of personnel, equipment and support. Having met in April of this year with ADF personnel at many levels in the UAE at Al Minhad, I can attest to the seriousness with which each and every one of them undertakes his or her role and their commitment to the task. It was impressive. I have, however, formed the view that we can do more to assist our front-line troops by providing them with more firepower through indirect weapons support on the ground. My own experience in my career involved in emergency situations, especially those remote from a home base, has instilled in me one principle: it is far better to have extra resources at hand and not need them than to need them and not have them. I fear we are in a circumstance in which we have placed our troops in need without supply. Our troops on patrol on the ground need additional assets such as mortars and artillery to provide that dedicated generic indirect fire support in those circumstances when their own safety is threatened and a successful outcome of a mission is compromised. I believe we saw evidence of that only recently in a 3½-hour firefight when inadequate support was offered. These assets are already in our ADF ordnance supply and could readily, in my view, be deployed into the theatre of action.
As a parent of someone who deployed into war zones, I was always clear that Australian troops enjoyed the same level of protection and conditions of engagement as those of United States troops. It was my belief that our troops, when acting under fire and in accordance with the orders of their superiors, enjoyed the same level of immunity from prosecution as their American counterparts in the event of the regrettable outcome of civilian casualties being found in a conflict; that local command in the theatre of operation had the capacity to deal with violations. I believed that Australia, like America, have not ratified the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. I now learn that that is not the case. America did not ratify that treaty; Australia did. So what then happens, I ask, when Australian soldiers are engaged in the same action alongside American troops? Ours might face the prospect of criminal proceedings and prosecution, with dire consequence if found guilty, while US troops will not. To me, this is unacceptable.
The parliament sends our troops into a war zone. Military commanders direct operations and targets. Are we giving them the necessary protection when the outcome differs from that which we expect? This is no ordinary conflict in Afghanistan. The Taliban launch offensives from within homes in villages. They keep women and children in compounds in front of them to act as shields for their own protection. The terms of engagement with the terrorists are radically different in Afghanistan from conventional warfare. I believe we need to re-examine our position in relation to the Rome Statute of the ICC. We need to re-establish consistency with US soldiers, with whom our own troops are so often involved in direct line of fire.
I can assure the Senate that, as the parent of a serving officer at that time, I would have resisted my son’s deployment to Afghanistan with all the force I could muster had I realised the legal risk to which he was exposed in carrying out his duties.
I now turn to the role of the ADF. The emphasis of Australia’s involvement in Afghanistan has shifted from reconstruction to training of the Afghan army. I would urge that we do not abandon the excellent initiatives of the earlier objectives of trades training and reconstruction in the villages in Oruzgan province. I am disappointed that the Australian media have not adequately informed the Australian community of the very many successful reconstruction projects which have been undertaken under the direction of Australian Defence Force personnel. The program has been aimed at trades training for young men in the villages so that they can conduct building projects in their own and neighbouring villages. This is the Australian military at its best: consulting with village elders to determine necessary projects, building the skills level of those within the village to be able to perform those construction tasks, providing the building materials to ensure projects can be undertaken, as well as the supervision, and then the security to safely see those projects through to their completion. This is genuinely ‘teaching Mohammed to fish rather than giving him a fish’.
Projects completed over the last few years in Oruzgan in Afghanistan include the building of schools for both boys and girls, health clinics, wells closer to villages for drawing water and, I must say from my own professional background, even a veterinary health facility. As we would all know, the goodwill generated from these projects is immense and ongoing. I urge that the Australian community are made aware of the excellence of these programs. Let us not lose the emphasis of this reconstruction or the value to the local communities.
The focus, of course, has now turned to training Afghan army personnel. If we are to succeed in this endeavour there are some fundamentals that I believe need to be addressed. Our troops have built up excellent relations with Afghan army personnel. They are respected as good soldiers, fearless, enthusiastic and loyal. However, it is my understanding they are poorly paid and they rarely return home for leave, with the inevitable result that desertion rates are unacceptably high. This could surely be addressed by them being paid in a timely manner, with a significant proportion of those funds going to their families in the villages from which they come, and allowing them the opportunity to go back to the areas, remote from Oruzgan, from where they are drawn. Not surprisingly, the inability for them to be able to do this means the rates of desertion are high, and failure to return after leave is equally unacceptably high. I believe the ADF in association with its ISAF coalition partners can address these issues.
Many in our community believe that the Taliban, al-Qaeda and other terrorists do not pose a threat to Australia or Australians commensurate with the cost of our response. This is no doubt a debate that will be had. But I, for one, am satisfied as a result of the events of the last few years in this region and around the world that the threat is real, it is ongoing, it must be addressed and we must be part of that process. I accept that it is a complex issue, creating as many questions as it answers, but this only serves to strengthen my view that executive government has made the correct decision to place our troops there and to maintain them. The questions include: can the terrorists move across borders from Afghanistan if NATO led coalition forces exert sufficient pressure? Do other countries such as Pakistan have the capacity and the will to counteract terrorists in their countries if the threat continues and expands? Does the Afghanistan government have the capacity to overcome the Taliban, even if they have the desire? Is there room for negotiation between the parties to achieve a reasonable peace in that country and, if so, what will be the relevant position of power from which each side will negotiate? I believe the terms of these negotiations should surely include: the rights of women and children, evolution towards some form of democracy, and the basic rights which we take for granted, including universal education, health, security and freedom of expression—some of which have been reported already in this place.
If Australia is to contribute to these outcomes, we must continue our active service role in association with ISAF member countries. I believe there is a legitimate role for the ADF to be part of the NATO led mission in Afghanistan. The decision to deploy, to remain and, ultimately, to exit should be that of executive government and not that of members and senators voting en masse.
To conclude, if we are to deploy our troops to active war zones, of which Afghanistan is demonstrably one, then they must be adequately supported in terms of troop numbers, assets available to them and legal protection. If we err, we should err on the side of caution and provide more than we believe they need. Without going into the events confronting three of our military personnel, I believe we must provide a level of protection for those who are in active service, under fire, so that they receive the protection that they want and that we as a community believe they deserve.
In the annals of Australian military history there are many examples where the innovative use of assets has turned a battle to our advantage. We need look no further than the World War I battle at Le Hamel, on the Somme, when General Monash, for the first time in military history, combined the use of artillery, infantry, air support and tanks to achieve an objective in less than two hours which others had spent many months and far too many lives failing to achieve by conventional means. Our troops need to know that they have our support. They need to know that we will not spare our assets, our time or our attention to them.
The decision was taken to deploy our personnel to support the NATO led coalition in Afghanistan. I know from discussions with serving personnel in the Middle East and those who have returned that they are proud of our contribution and that they fully support the deployment. We must stay the course until the objective is met or a solution is reached. Only then will we have honoured the memory of those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice in this conflict.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Afghanistan</title>,Ministerial Statements,2,1,speech
"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2010-10-26,"—I want to begin by acknowledging all those who have taken part in this debate in both places. It is a very important undertaking by the parliament and one which I think is timely, particularly with regard to recent discussions both in Australia and elsewhere.
It is history which shows Australian support for the initial foray into Afghanistan and against the Taliban regime—at the time, a move with bipartisan support. In the wake of the September 11 attacks and the Taliban regime’s harbouring of the al-Qaeda masterminds of those egregious crimes, the view held here and elsewhere was that the continued existence of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan posed a threat to both international and, in Australia’s view, national security. We had an ANZUS alliance partner who had been attacked on their home soil. Australia’s obligation to support the United States in taking swift action against al-Qaeda and the Taliban regime that harboured them was a very important obligation.
This was an engagement directed at the ruling Taliban regime, an unelected regime not only that harboured the perpetrators of the 9-11 attacks and other terrorist acts but whose hardline rule exacted an appalling toll on the history, the culture and the people of Afghanistan. I have spoken before—long before being in this chamber, ironically—of the devastating impact of the Taliban on the lives of women and girls in Afghanistan in particular. I spoke in this chamber, some years ago now, of the completely without merit, completely obscene destruction of the historic Buddhist statues at Bamiyan by the Taliban for no other reason, really, than that they could.
It is important to remember aspects of those debates, I think, and the debates which many of us have taken part in in other places, as we sit here, nine years later, debating Australia’s continued involvement in Afghanistan. I am not sure who, or how many of us for that matter, would have envisaged the duration of our commitment and whether it would still be ongoing in 2010. I think, to that end, it is understandable that public attitudes and support for Australia’s continued involvement in Afghanistan have experienced changes over that time. As I said at the beginning, I think it is important that we are having this debate here and now about staying the course. It is an important debate, which is healthy in a great democracy like ours, a democracy that so many others do not have the privilege to enjoy.
I know that several members of the parliament have taken the opportunity to express their very strong reservations about ongoing Australian involvement in Afghanistan. Their views are genuinely held and passionately argued. However, they are not views that I can share. I could not support the abandonment of the people of Afghanistan and, in Australia’s case, of the Oruzgan province specifically to the fate of a resurgent, pre-eminent Taliban. We have that insight already. It is not an attractive picture. It is about violence. It is about lawlessness. It is about extremism. It is about hate. It is about anarchy. It would certainly come back, should Australia and other nations that are supporting efforts in Afghanistan elect to withdraw, in my view.
I think it is extremely important to reiterate at almost every opportunity when issues of this nature are under discussion that the deployment of Australian troops is never a decision made lightly. It is not made lightly in terms of the conscience of those members of government who make it. It is not made lightly by the leadership of the Defence Force who advise on it. Participation in those deployments is not taken lightly by those men and women of the ADF who are fully engaged in the task. It is also not a decision made lightly in terms of the very real costs of fine and proud Australian soldiers. They are costs which are immeasurable. They do not appear on a balance sheet anywhere, except perhaps a balance sheet in the hearts and minds of their families and friends. For those who have given their lives in this cause, for their families and their friends, for their mates who still remain and do the job, we must, I think, note and record that these are not decisions made lightly.
I have spent many years in this place working on defence issues. That work has in fact taken me to Afghanistan during the period of Australian deployment to see for myself some of the work being done there.
I have seen the good, the bad and the singularly unattractive of the Australian defence forces, but, through all of that, I have great respect for those who serve, for their leadership, who grapple every single day with these issues, and for the decisions that they make in that process.
I would say, though, that the costs that you can add up, the costs that you can put on a balance sheet, are in many ways very concerning. If you look at the United States budget for the Department of Defense, for example, you see something like in excess of $335 billion to date has been spent on the direct costs of the war, with a further $120 billion requested for the 2011 financial year. In comparison, the Australian government, whilst spending billions of our own dollars, has made a similarly important financial contribution for us. But let us put it in perspective, with consideration of the amount of money that the US State Department has spent to fund reconstruction and aid across conflicts like Afghanistan and, in this case, also Iraq: $59 billion. To put that into perspective, more than twice as much money has been spent funding military engagement in Afghanistan in the last 12 months than has been spent by the State Department on aid and reconstruction efforts during the entire nine-year period of conflict.
So, while I absolutely support our engagement in Afghanistan, I do think that it is important that we consider that balance or, some would say, imbalance. I think there is an issue to be addressed by those of us engaged in the decision-making process politically, in this country and elsewhere, when the size of the commitment of prosecuting the war is so large and the size of the commitment of prosecuting the peace is relatively small. I will talk further about prosecuting the peace, so to speak, in a moment.
I believe that we should finish what we set out to do, that we should assist and support the people in Afghanistan in achieving what they are currently not able to achieve, which is a government with some stability, a government with some solid and transparently operating institutions and rules, and a society which comes as close to free and fair as they can get. There may be some who see those ambitions as perhaps unreal or overly ambitious, who think that that is not possible and question whether our efforts thus far are worth while.
While some are lost in the sea of pessimism which surrounds our engagement in Afghanistan, there are some very worthy organisations which contain very committed individuals on the ground who are doing very valuable work for the people in Afghanistan. That is over and above own government agencies like AusAID and the Australian Federal Police, for example. There are Australian NGOs currently engaged in Afghanistan. And I note that, in terms of engagement in this debate, the Australian Council for International Development wrote to members and senators recently in regard to these Afghan and Australian civilian and military aid issues. I do not agree with everything they have written, not by a long shot, and I do not agree with all of the premises on which they operate, but I do think that their raising of our awareness and hopefully our interest in some of this work in Afghanistan is a very important contribution to the discussion. Having said I do not agree with them, I expect to hear from ACFID again quite soon! We will see how that goes.
Organisations that do that sort of work do not always receive the sort of recognition they deserve. They are carrying out vital grassroots work, though, with the people of Afghanistan. As I said, they are building the peace, if you like. Whether it is World Vision, Oxfam, Habitat for Humanity, the Fred Hollows Foundation or CARE, the sort of support they are providing—backed up by our military presence—would not be provided, in my view, if we were not there. Realistically, it would be difficult for them to continue in the face of a completely resurgent and in-control Taliban, for example.
Afghanistan at the moment has one of the most poorly resourced education systems in the world—and in fact, as most of us are aware, the formal education of girls was effectively nonexistent under the Taliban—with an adult literacy rate at less than 30 per cent. CARE Australia is one of the organisations who are determined to assist in turning that around. It is running a community-organised primary education program which is currently endeavouring to meet the primary education needs of over 3,000 students—most importantly, 70 per cent of whom are girls—with ambitions to reach many thousands more. It is also operating an innovative program which targets the social and economic reintegration of the many thousands of displaced women in Afghanistan. Its support services cover a very wide array of roles. They include things like vocational training, microfinance—I know many members of this chamber have a longstanding interest in the effective use of microfinance—and community outreach activities. I think that they make a contribution, at the same time that I think our military engagement makes a contribution, to the development of sound institutions and to the observation of the rule of law, which in fact will not develop unassisted, and I believe that we should do as much as we can to help this process both developmentally and, in terms of security issues, militarily.
In Australia and, most particularly, in our very robust parliaments, I think we often take for granted the opportunity to speak our minds. Freedom of speech might not be something which is explicitly enshrined in the Australian Constitution, but I think it is a pretty cherished and fiercely protected right in this country. We do have the freedom to speak our minds, to argue the case, to argue against authority, to champion a cause or basically just to tell people our view, usually without fear of persecution—unless it is a ‘very important’ debate about football or something like that! But it takes courage to speak out on issues we feel strongly about, especially when we know powerful forces disagree with us. Having the courage to speak up for what we believe in in the face of intransigent power is, I think, admirable. Doing so in the knowledge that it can mean death is probably beyond my capacity to describe, but let us start with ‘truly courageous’.
I want to speak very briefly in my concluding remarks today about one Afghan woman and to use the phrase ‘truly courageous’ to describe her. Her name is Dr Sima Samar. Many of you here may have met Sima Samar over the years on the couple of occasions that she has had the opportunity to visit this region and our country. She is the head of the Independent Afghanistan Human Rights Commission. She has made a lifetime of risking her life for her beliefs. As a medical doctor, she was forced to flee first Kabul and then Afghanistan entirely when her husband was arrested by the regime of the time. She fled to Pakistan where she established the Shuhada Organization, a body dedicated to the provision of health care for Afghan women and girls who, like her, had been forced to flee their homes due to violence and persecution.
Her full story is complex and distressing. I have heard her tell it personally and it is a deeply moving story and a deeply distressing story. Ultimately in 2002 she returned to Afghanistan to take up a role as Minister for Women’s Affairs in the Afghan Transitional Administration before being forced to resign her post. Her crime, her offence, at the time was public questioning of certain laws in an interview with a foreign newspaper. In fact, not only was she forced to resign but she faced death threats and she faced ongoing harassment. A group of religious extremists went so far as to take out an advertisement in a local paper labelling her the Salman Rushdie of Afghanistan.
When I met her at a conference of representatives of national human rights institutions in Fiji—it was a very obscure place and time to meet a woman of her calibre—I was struck by her courage and her tenacity in standing up for those without a voice in Afghanistan, for championing unpopular causes like women’s rights and reform of sharia law in the face of what seems from the outside to be almost insurmountable odds.
For me, the war in Afghanistan and our military engagement in Afghanistan are not just about the many men and women I know personally who have served on behalf of Australia and continue to do so. It is not just about endeavouring as best as we are able to remove the Taliban from their engagement in this area. It is about security, it is about human rights and it is about peace. It is about supporting the Sima Samars of this world who do so selflessly risk their own lives to better the lives of those around them. I do not believe that our work in Afghanistan is complete until people like her no longer have to risk their lives to make their voices heard, and I do not believe that is a forlorn hope.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Afghanistan</title>,Ministerial Statements,2,1,speech
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2010-10-26,"—In 1915, Afghanistan, according to history, was working through one of its all too rare periods of peace. At the same time a group of women moved to Europe to make a statement about the need for peace in a war that was raging across that part of the known world at the time. Those women were not, as some people claimed, dangerous, they were not difficult and they were not mentally deranged. However, they were strong, concerned and questioning the future of war. Those women formed the basis of an organisation called the Women’s International League for Peace and Freedom, which is still active and strong in our community now. Their cause was the need for political and negotiated solutions to international conflicts, the promotion of women, the safety of women and children in any war-torn area and the need to look at ways of working together to form a peaceful solution.
One of the key aspects of the discussion we are having in this place at the moment must be to ensure that people who ask questions and people who are concerned are not seen as being disloyal and are not seen as being in some way treasonous. We have, as Senator Payne talked about, the right to speak freely, to have these discussions and to ensure that people feel engaged with the process. Many people in our country now are strongly interested and concerned about what we are doing in Afghanistan, and they have the right to know. In fact, we need to rebuild around this whole discussion the fact that people want to know what our reasons are for taking action, what our plans are for the future and how we are looking after the people who are serving our country in overseas placements. That is their right.
Another key aspect must be that questioning what is going on is not in any way being disloyal or nonsupportive of the personnel of our armed forces. There tended to be a bit of a gut reaction in this place only a few years ago, just after I came here, when we were talking about our engagement in Iraq. Any questioning or concerns raised were determined to be somehow disloyal. It built up, as we have heard a little bit in the discussions today, some kind of divide between respect and support for our personnel—the people who are doing the job that they chose to do to protect our country—and interest in what is going on and the future of what our deployment will be.
Certainly I do not pretend in any way to understand what it is like to be a member of the armed forces. What I do know when I talk to people who have made such a strong and clear decision to serve our country and their families—because we are talking about a family commitment in so many ways—is that they have chosen a job and they want to be well trained. They understand that they act at the direction of the government and they expect that their country will support them while they are doing their job and when they come home. I do not think there is anyone in this parliament who disagrees with that. We have heard protestations both in the other place and here about how concerned we are. That is important because our personnel need to hear that message consistently. They need to know that, no matter how people feel about decisions about war, once a decision is made that Australian troops will be serving they have the absolute support of the people in this place—and there is no doubt that they do.
We have in our community much more awareness and knowledge of what is going on in the world than we had in the past. Governments in this Australian parliament have for generations been making decisions about military deployment. Very rarely, only really in the depths of World War II, has there been an immediate threat to the Australian border. If there was a threat of invasion to our country, we can understand the reaction for the defence of our country. All we have to do is walk through any Australian town and see those incredibly confronting war memorials to realise in how many fields of battle and in how many countries Australian servicepeople have done their job.
Australian governments have been making that decision, and I believe that every Australian government of whatever flavour has taken the decision extremely strongly, understanding the full import of what they are doing. But I think that Australians in the community now, particularly because of the immediacy of the media worldwide, have more information about what is going on—and it is not all accurate information. One of the problems is that, with the availability of a wide range of media, sometimes you do not get absolutely accurate stories, and that is something we should consider very seriously. It is important that people in Australia who follow what is going on in a number of places including Afghanistan understand that when they question things they need to question the media reports. Nonetheless, we can see in our living rooms, in our bedrooms—wherever we have TV sets—the absolute horror of war, and it is a horror, because people are being killed.
Senator Payne referred to having the opportunity of visiting a number of places. War is not a good place to be and the victims of war cover so many areas. They cover women, children and families. The displacement numbers across the world now are too confronting for people to truly understand. Also, the statistics are not well kept. They are kept much better now than they have been in the past, but the figures from Human Rights Watch about the number of Afghani citizens who have been killed just in the latest conflict in Afghanistan, since 2000, show numbers around 7,000. We all know that is not right. We all know that many more people have been killed or wounded, have had their lives disrupted or have lost their homes or livelihoods. Nonetheless, every single person is a victim of the process, and our military engagement in that process is focused on ensuring that there is peace. That is why we are there. We have heard many people restate that the background to the decision to go to war in Afghanistan is for security reasons, to stop terrorism, but the final outcome must be to secure a peaceful world in Afghanistan for the people who live there. There is not enough time to talk about the evil and the horror of what has gone on in that country because of the Taliban and because of years of engagement in war in that place. It would be difficult to find a single family in Afghanistan who can remember peace, let alone understand what it is like—let alone to plan, hopefully, for the future, a future where there will be peace in the area. But that is part of our job.
In terms of what will happen in the future, one of the reasons that Australia is working so hard in Afghanistan is to ensure that there will be an understanding of peace in that country and that there will be education for all Afghanis. Certainly we know that circumstances in that area have been particularly horrific for women and girls. We have heard a number of senators talk about the statistics that we have about the changes that have happened only in the last few years in access to education in areas where it was never available before. We know that Australian aid agencies have been working in the area for many years looking particularly at the areas of health and education but responding specifically to the poverty that is entrenched in the Afghani countryside. It is very difficult to have a sustainable economy and a future when there have been so many years of conflict and war. But that certainly will be the future for Australia’s engagement in the area, because our military engagement in Afghanistan will end at some time.
When you look at the history of Australian deployment in every war in which we have been involved, there will be an end to our military engagement. But that will not be the end of Australia’s engagement. As Senator Payne said, a number of aid agencies that have been working actively in that area have been in contact with parliamentarians in this place, looking at the way forward and where we need to go in that area. Our commitment, as I said, is to an ongoing peace to ensure that the Afghani nation can actually have their own government, their own services, their own security and their own infrastructure, and what we need as an Australian community is to understand that. What we also need to have is an understanding that the government will be open and will give regular information to the community about what is going on.
I know that the Prime Minister has agreed that there will be a debate in this place on a regular basis about updating what is happening in Afghanistan, and I think that is important, because one of the things that needs to happen is the rebuilding of trust. As I said, people have access to the media, and I also think people are thinking more about what is happening in our world. As I have said many times in this place, Australia is part of the global community and we cannot just have our own slice of the world and not be engaged beyond that; that is an impossibility. I think more people in our community are looking at what is happening and weighing up where Australia fits.
There has been an abuse of trust in recent years in terms of the ability of people to have full information—or as much as they can have. I know that when we are in a war situation there are security reasons and issues around personal safety, so full information can never be shared. But we can ensure that what information can be shared is shared. Subsequent information has become available with regard to the Vietnam War and, more recently, the Iraq war, and the media indicate that there was some confusion. There was some inaccuracy in the arguments that were given about a range of countries across the world and the need for engagement in those places, and people are questioning that. I think that interest has been raised by past history.
What we need to do is to rebuild in a certain way an understanding in the wider community about the decisions that government make. We know that Australians respect the role of our military personnel. I think that the public way in which the lives of the soldiers who have been lost is remembered and their lives celebrated through the media and through local community involvement, sends a particularly clear message to the Australian community. We share the loss when we give our condolences and our sympathy absolutely to the families involved. Through media involvement as well we see not just the Australian loss but also the return to America and to the UK of soldiers who have been lost in the conflict.
We also see—and I mentioned this earlier—the horrific loss of civilians, and I think that there is a wider understanding of that than there has been in the past. So my hope is that we will continue to have this engagement with the community, reinforcing the decisions of government and the respect for the work of the personnel who are fighting in very dangerous circumstances.
I opened up my contribution by talking about the women who went to The Hague in 1915 from all around the world to talk about the need for the engagement and empowerment of women and about a way of working towards a peaceful solution in the midst of a horrific war—the largest war that had been known by the world until that time. Earlier this year, a group of women from Afghanistan went to an international meeting in London which was looking at the future of what was going on in Afghanistan. Originally they did not have a seat at the table, but through community pressure they got some publicity and they had engagement in an international meeting that was held in January 2010, looking at the future of what was going to happen in Afghanistan in terms of building a peaceful solution. The Afghan women’s civil society was represented at that meeting. I cannot help but see a similarity between the women in 1915 and the women from Afghanistan in 2010.
The communique that came out of that conference, which was a high-level international discussion, responded to the questions and concerns that were raised by those Afghan women and acknowledged that the future of any peaceful solution in Afghanistan had to engage with women’s empowerment. One of the key things that came out of that meeting was an absolute commitment that the Afghan government would continue to pass legislation that protected women’s safety and freedom in the new Afghan state. It also talked about the need to have women engage in future governance in that area, and the wonderful woman to whom Senator Payne referred is one of the leaders in that area.
We know that there will be an end to the war in Afghanistan in some way. What we need to know is how the peaceful future will be entrenched. We have a commitment from this country to ensure that that will happen. We have already had the commitment in a military way; we need to continue to have the commitment in further aid and development in that country. I have no doubt that that will occur. In terms of the way we move forward, I say that there must be engagement with the community in Australia, and one of the core aspects—and something that I will continue to talk about in this place—is to ensure absolutely that the women of Afghanistan will be involved in the future of Afghanistan and the horrors that we have heard about will no longer be the daily expectation of women and girls in that country.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Afghanistan</title>,Ministerial Statements,2,1,speech
"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2010-10-26,"—In rising to participate in today’s debate and make a contribution, I firstly extend commendations to the Prime Minister for allowing members and senators to participate in the debate on this extremely important issue of Australia’s role in Afghanistan. I believe it is important that we all have the opportunity to have a say on a topic which affects each and every one of us in this country. It is truly a privilege to be able to raise this topic in a democratic parliament and a country which many other countries envy.
As a member of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and the Defence Subcommittee of that committee, I understand the importance of our troops’ continued role in Afghanistan and completely value that role. Through my limited involvement and participation in the defence committees, I have had the opportunity to be involved in inquiries. One such inquiry involved a visit to Timor-Leste in 2009 with the Defence Subcommittee—and my memory, Madam Acting Deputy President Crossin, is that you were with me on that trip. On our brief visit, the committee was briefed about the Defence Cooperation Program, or DCP, and its role in creating and sustaining a professional military culture and assisting the local people in education and rebuilding. Australia has been involved in East Timor since 1999 and the DCP was established in 2001. The DCP is an example of nation building and shows Australia’s commitment in assisting the new government in securing its future. Similarly, Afghanistan is also a country in need of assistance.
In Australia, we are privileged to live in a democracy whose citizens have the freedom to speak and think independently. We have the freedom to make our own choices and to learn from our mistakes. We have access to education and the ability to study whatever matter one chooses without oppression. We have access to a free and adequate health system and many more social benefits that we sometimes take for granted. And we have the opportunity as citizens to elect our parliamentary representatives in local, state and federal parliaments, a right many countries are still denied. I am not suggesting our customs and beliefs are better than anyone else’s; however, citizens of countries like Afghanistan deserve the opportunity to exercise the same liberties that we enjoy here. This is why it is imperative that we continue to support the Afghani population in their quest to be free from the oppressive rule of the Taliban.
Australia has been involved in Afghanistan since 2001. We have joined our allies to ensure that Afghanistan is never again a place where al-Qaeda can recruit and train people to kill and where terrorists can hatch plans to kill our loved ones. On 11 September 2001, we lost 10 Australians in the twin tower terrorist attacks. On 12 October 2002, we lost 88 Australians in the Bali bombing. In 2005, we lost another four in the second Bali bombing. Any loss of life is tragic, and there are always those left to remember their loved ones—someone’s mother, father, son, daughter, brother, sister, niece, nephew, uncle, aunt or friend. All of their families and friends have to carry on with their lives without those loved ones because their lives were unnecessarily lost due to an act of terrorism.
This is what we are trying to prevent from reoccurring. Our presence in Afghanistan has already hurt these terrorist groups, and our continued presence will ensure that they do not have the capacity to recover and to conscript and train more insurgents. At present, we have 1,550 Australian troops in Afghanistan, with 1,241 located in Oruzgan province. In April 2010, Australia announced that it would double its civilian contribution, and there are now 50 working Australian civilians and 10 defence civilian personnel in Afghanistan. Since combat began on 7 October 2001, al-Qaeda’s practices have been greatly affected. It no longer has training camps or safe havens in the country. However, the International Security Assistance Force, or ISAF, and the Afghan government still face a persistent insurgency, particularly in the country’s south.
Should you be wondering what has been achieved since 2001, the record stands. Already differences can be seen in Afghanistan. School enrolments have increased enormously from one million just boys to more than six million today, with two million of those enrolments being girls. Health services have dramatically increased. Before 2001 only 10 per cent had access to health care; now 85 per cent have access to basic care. More than 39,000 community based infrastructure projects have been identified in the country. These projects include wells, clinics and roads. Thousands have been employed through the rehabilitation of roads. About 10 million Afghans now have access to telecommunications compared to 20,000 in 2001, and there are now 400 print media publications, 150 FM radio stations and 26 television channels. This is a far cry from the oppressive regime under the Taliban.
Our involvement in Afghanistan is to provide stability and encouragement to enable the country to stand on its own two feet and to begin its nation building. We are doing this as part of our membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation through the NATO-led ISAF, which includes 47 different countries which also have troops in Afghanistan. According to ISAF’s website, its duties include:
… in support of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, conducts operations in Afghanistan to reduce the capability and will of the insurgency, support the growth in capacity and capability of the Afghan National Security Forces (ANSF), and facilitate improvements in governance and socio-economic development, in order to provide a secure environment for sustainable stability that is observable to the population.
By laying down these foundations, we are giving the Afghanis the opportunity to build new lives, to gain access to education, to improve their health system and, ultimately, to be free from oppression. With all these countries coming together for a common cause, it legitimises and communicates that this alliance is doing what it set out to do.
Before 2005, ISAF duties were based on stabilisation. Now ISAF is targeting insurgents and protecting key population centres while working with the United Nations and the Afghan government. ISAF is also focused on working with Pakistan to deal with extremists in the bordering regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan. There are currently 140,000 coalition troops in Afghanistan. This includes 120,000 from ISAF, and the United States has an additional 20,000 from Operation Enduring Freedom.
Along with the United States, New Zealand, Singapore and Slovakia, we are laying the foundations for a strong security force by providing training to the Afghan National Army 4th Brigade and the Afghan National Police. The capability of the ANA 4th Brigade to conduct security operations has increased, and the Chief of the Defence Force assesses it will be ready to lead security operations in Oruzgan within two to four years.
Some believe that it is time to pull out our troops. But the truth is, if we pull them out now before the country can stand on its own two feet, then the losses we as a nation have suffered will be in vain. Our contribution to this war has not been without its grief. As a nation we have suffered losses. We have lost 21 brave Australians; many young men who have put their lives on the line so that we can enjoy the freedom to live without fear, and so that Afghanis, one day, may experience the same liberties as we enjoy.
Without knowing the troops and families personally, as a resident of Brisbane, where the 6th Royal Australian Regiment and 2nd Combat Engineer Regiment are based, these losses bring this war so much closer to home. I cannot even begin to imagine how these families are feeling, and I am sure they are very proud of what their loved ones have achieved and served for our country. Many of our troops have also been injured in the line of duty and will carry their suffering for the rest of their natural lives.
I would also like to acknowledge the Australian troops who are currently serving in Afghanistan. You have put your lives on the line, you have sacrificed time away from your families, you have missed birthdays, you have missed weddings, you have missed first days at school, you have missed the first steps of your child and you have missed the birth of your own children. You have done all of this for your country. Your commitment and bravery for this country is unwavering and extraordinary, and your dedication to ensuring Afghanis have the opportunity to live in peace is beyond words and we express our thanks. We thank you. We thank your families. And we thank you for your patriotism.
Once again I would like to thank the Prime Minister for providing this opportunity to debate this very important issue. I am encouraged by the number of government senators, members of the House of Representatives, opposition and crossbenchers who have shown interest and made their contributions towards this very important debate.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Afghanistan</title>,Ministerial Statements,2,1,speech
"Trood, Sen Russell",LP,2010-10-26,"—A parliamentary debate on the topic of Afghanistan is long overdue. Indeed, not only is this debate overdue; the parliament generally does not devote anywhere near enough time to considerations of foreign affairs in its schedule. There are, no doubt, good reasons for this, but it certainly cannot be that we are short of issues. We live in a world of tumult and turmoil, and Australia faces a wide range of foreign policy challenges that should be the subject of a wider public debate.
Afghanistan is a very appropriate place to begin this public conversation because there we are confronted with a desperate struggle for the country’s future. This, of course, is not the first time that Afghanistan has been a crucible of conflict. As students of history would be well aware it has often been called ‘the graveyard of empires’. For some of the war’s critics, this remembrance of things past is enough to underscore the futility of the task we have undertaken there.
Certainly, Afghanistan has posed challenges for those emboldened to take an interest in its affairs. In an earlier life, well before I entered the Senate, I published a book entitled The Indian Ocean: Perspectives on a Strategic Arena. In the chapter on Afghanistan, there appears this passage:
Several factors will play critical roles in determining whether the Soviet Union succeeds in … Afghanistan. These include the policies adopted by Pakistan towards the insurgents, the extent of external support … the success or failure of Soviet attempts to convert divisions among the insurgents into open conflict, the Soviet’s ability to establish a government in Kabul that commands a large armed force (and has a wide base of support) and the scope and duration of the Soviet commitment.
That passage was written about a different time in Afghanistan’s history by Zalmay Khalizad. As some senators may be aware, Dr Khalizad has since gone on to greater things, including serving a term as the United States Ambassador to Afghanistan. While he and I strongly distance ourselves from Soviet ambitions in Afghanistan, Khalizad’s comments remind us that in this country some things seem not to change very much at all. Substitute the US or the International Security Assistance Force, ISAF, for the Soviet Union, and we arguably have a pretty fair description of the range of challenges that confront us today.
If ever there was one truth about Afghanistan, it is that the historic struggles which have taken place there have never been just about the future of Afghanistan itself. They have always been about part of a much grander landscape. This is no less true today than it was in the 19th century or in the 1970s or 1980s. Afghanistan has always been part of a very volatile region in world affairs. If we are to comprehend the full extent of the challenge we confront there, we cannot engage in the comfortable delusion that it can be easily quarantined from the influence of its strategically unstable neighbourhood. As a landlocked state, it is surrounded by great powers, many of which see it as an arena for their own ambitions. No part of that neighbourhood is more strategically interconnected with Afghanistan than its eastern neighbour Pakistan. Democratic governance in Pakistan is already at grave risk from, among other things, a violent internal insurgency which includes al-Qaeda backed extremists. In recent times, intensified bombings and terrorist attacks testify to the growing self-confidence and a brutal and bloody determination to destroy an already brittle political order. The Pakistan government is struggling to contain this threat. Should its resolve falter and Pakistan fall under the influence of groups aligned with al-Qaeda or one of its indigenous variants, it would be a strategic disaster.
The fall of a democracy, however imperfect, to Islamic insurgents would give massive propaganda to al-Qaeda and embolden extremism in Asia and elsewhere, to say nothing of the threat that would emerge if Pakistan’s nuclear warheads fell into the hands of the terrorists. The chaos and instability in Afghanistan only serve to fuel this risk. As the analyst Stephen Biddle has written in relation to the United States—but it is an observation that applies to other Western countries, including Australia—we all have an interest in preventing Afghanistan from aggravating Pakistan’s internal problems and magnifying the danger of an al-Qaeda nuclear-armed sanctuary that might exist there. We are, of course, assisting Pakistan to confront the severe challenges it faces. I trust we will continue to do so to the full extent of our capacity. But Pakistan is a sovereign state, wary of outsiders’ offers of assistance and determined to be responsible for its own security. In Afghanistan, the circumstances are very different. There, our opportunities to assist in bringing peace and stability to a broken and divided country are that much greater.
Aside from our interest in Pakistan’s future, Australia has strong reasons for continuing to play a role as part of the international coalition that is striving to offer a better future for Afghanistan. These reasons have their origins in Australia’s membership of the international force that intervened to bring down the Taliban and liberate the country from its ugly, oppressive rule in Operation Enduring Freedom in 2001. There is little doubt that, at the time, the Taliban was providing a safe haven for al-Qaeda training camps and that Afghanistan occupied a central place in Osama bin Laden’s global network of terror. Certainly, things have changed since then. Al-Qaeda’s presence in Afghanistan is much diminished, and the threat which existed in 2001 and al-Qaeda’s base of operations is now more likely to be found on the Horn of Africa or across the border in Pakistan. Nevertheless, the strategic reality is that the significant, dangerous and continuing linkages between the Taliban and al-Qaeda remain and are not seriously in doubt. They are a persistent threat to Afghanistan’s stability and to Western interests in the region. The insurgents’ freedom to move across the porous international border confronts ISAF with one of its greatest operational challenges in trying to eliminate their presence. We would be taking a massive strategic risk if ISAF were suddenly to leave Afghanistan without a high degree of confidence that al-Qaeda’s alliance with the elements of the Taliban had not been crushed.
Australia also has a national interest in Afghanistan borne of its alliance with the United States. The many critics of this argument seem to have wilfully ignored the circumstances under which the United States and its allies, including Australia, entered Afghanistan. As Fullilove and Bubalo from the Lowy Institute pointed out recently, 2001 was not an exercise in US unilateralism of the kind usually so widely condemned by the left. It was a case of Washington acting in concert with the international community and, of no less importance, it was an exercise in self-defence, sanctioned under international law as part of an international response to al-Qaeda’s terrorist attack of 9-11. Perhaps most significantly, the mission was undertaken with a mandate from the United Nations which has been renewed year after year. In short, for Australia, being part of the ISAF coalition in Afghanistan is not only an entirely appropriate exercise in alliance maintenance but also an organic part of the international obligations we have assumed in the struggle against Islamic extremism with other members of the global community.
There can be little doubt that we are facing a tough fight in Afghanistan. Our enemy is ruthless, enterprising and determined. The increasing casualties amongst ISAF troops, along with more violence against civilians and an alarming number of political assassinations, all point to stepped up insurgent activity and to higher levels of insecurity. In Kabul and elsewhere across the country, many Afghanis appear to have limited respect for their government, which they often see as dysfunctional, corrupt and lacking in legitimacy. The disruption of commercial and business activity and the fragility of economic enterprise are making everyday life extremely hard for most Afghanis. Beyond Afghanistan, among the populations of the countries contributing to ISAF there is a growing restiveness at the alarming human and financial costs of the war. In these circumstances it is hardly surprising that there is a considerable pessimism about Afghanistan’s future.
For all that, I think there is good reason to look forward with some confidence. There are some encouraging signs of progress in things like school attendance; the construction of road, health and telecommunications infrastructure; and small-scale business enterprise beginning to grow. On the security front, it is true that for a long period of time the international coalition struggled to design a strategy that would secure Afghanistan’s future. While the Taliban was never a movement with a widespread following or deep-seated historical legitimacy within Afghanistan’s society, it did manage to secure government in the 1990s. Now, however, it is a highly factionalised entity supported in some parts of the country but only tolerated in others and deeply hated elsewhere. The ISAF counterinsurgency strategy, now being led by General Petraeus, offers the best opportunity in nine years of conflict to further erode and degrade the Taliban’s strength. With its key elements of clear, hold, build and transfer, the strategy is designed to deliver Afghanistan’s security into the hands of its own people. Although results are agonisingly slow, I am cautiously encouraged that this strategy together with the massive program of civil reconstruction now underway offers Afghanis a more secure and stable future.
Were we now to abandon Afghanistan, all the military and economic good we have so far achieved would likely be a wasted legacy. I struggle to imagine that the Greens and others who continue to oppose our continued presence in Afghanistan would think this a desirable outcome after all we have sacrificed there. We should not have any illusions about the lengthy time it will take to secure Afghanistan’s future. We and our coalition partners are likely to be engaged in military operations for some years. A civilian presence will likely continue long afterwards. However long we are engaged, we cannot afford to lose sight of what is surely one of the most important salient realities of the Afghan conflict: we are acting as friends and allies of the Afghan people. It hardly needs saying, but this is their country and they will remain long after the international forces have departed. This means that, whatever our strategic ambitions might be, we have to respect the aspirations of the Afghani people. This requires us to temper our expectations of success. As much as we and, indeed, some Afghanis might wish it, prosecuting this conflict to the point of securing the unconditional surrender of the Taliban is unrealistic. As is now beginning to occur, they will have to be a party to the negotiations that ultimately will see an end to the conflict.
The reality is that we do not need a perfect Afghanistan to secure our strategic objectives there. Our aim should be a country that is stable and free enough to offer the opportunity for the Afghani people to decide on their political, economic and social future. It should also be sufficiently independent of the influence of the Taliban and its insurgent allies to ensure that Islamic extremism and the terrorism it begets does not regain a foothold. The challenge we now face is to create the conditions where these objectives can be achieved. As I have said, I consider the counterinsurgency strategy now in place makes this a realistic possibility.
Australia’s contribution is a significant one, and I express my gratitude and enormous respect for the professionalism of the men and women of the Australian Defence Force, the Australian Federal Police, the officers of AusAID and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and the other Australian citizens who daily risk so much in the service of our interests. The Australian contingent in Afghanistan may not be the largest among ISAF, but it is for the most part in the southern province of Oruzgan, one of the most violent and unstable parts of the country. Australians face constant danger, as we are tragically reminded when we recall the 21 members of the ADF who have already lost their lives.
Sadly, we face the prospect of further casualties before our commitment to Afghanistan comes to an end. But, like other senators, I am struck by the fact that many of the families who have lost loved ones in this conflict want it known that the soldiers who have fallen have been committed professionals and maintained a belief in the importance of their mission. At the moment, I am far from convinced that we are doing enough to degrade the Taliban’s insurgence. While our SAS commando and other forces are doing a magnificent job disrupting Taliban and insurgent networks as part of the Special Operations Task Group, there is a strong case for expanding their capabilities. I acknowledge that these types of military operations place our soldiers at higher risk, but they are vital to the ultimate success of our mission. For that reason, I trust that the government and its military advisers have the option of an expanded and enhanced force under serious consideration. But ultimately, as Mr Abbott said in his contribution to this debate, we on this side of the chamber recognise that this is necessarily a matter for the government.
In concluding my remarks, I note that, in her contribution to the House last week, the Prime Minister confirmed that Australia would continue to stay the course in Afghanistan. As the Leader of the Opposition made clear in his remarks, we in the opposition endorse that position very strongly. Part of the challenge we face in sustaining our commitment is to strive, as far as possible, to ensure that it has the support of the Australian people. A recent poll on this point is far from encouraging, with only 45 per cent of Australians being in favour. I cannot help but think that this is at least in part a consequence of the previous Labor government’s apparent reluctance to accept its responsibility and diligently strive to make a convincing case for our commitment.
I detected in the Prime Minister’s remarks the other day a determination to take a more muscular approach to our Afghanistan commitment. I much welcome this shift in policy. Following through on Australia’s commitment to Afghanistan is an immensely important enterprise. Its strategic rationale needs to be spelt out more clearly, the case for staying on needs to be made with greater conviction and the Australian people need to be convinced of the stakes. To that end, the government needs to go on the offensive to arrest the steady decline in public support for the war. The nation expects it and the brave men and women in the field deserve no less.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Afghanistan</title>,Ministerial Statements,2,1,speech
"Kroger, Sen Helen",LP,2010-10-26,"—It is with great humility that I rise to make a small contribution to the debate on Afghanistan in this place. I say ‘a small contribution’ in the context of the enormous courage and bravery of our serving forces who are representing us as we speak on the ground in Afghanistan. There is no easy fix to the many problems and challenges that country is facing. The landlocked region in the Hindu Kush has experienced centuries of tribal warfare, ethnic fighting and religious tension, which has left the country deeply scarred and ensured the complexity of the problems that it faces today. After nine years the country remains fragile, with the hope of peace and stability a lingering challenge. The desire of all people to live, work and play in a secure environment is a right that all should share and remains the noble cause of this near decade long dispute.
The coalition’s mission has made considerable differences to the lives of the Afghan people, especially to women and children, who now enjoy more freedom and security. The war has harnessed international cooperation in an endeavour to counter extremism and terrorism. Afghanistan is no longer a breeding and training ground for terrorists. This in itself is a great accomplishment. We now need to assist the Afghans to build a future free from terrorism. Nonetheless, the last few months have been tough for our troops as we are in the middle of what the military commanders describe as ‘the fighting season’.
We mourn the significant losses of the coalition and, in particular, those 21 brave Australian soldiers who have given their lives to bring peace and stability. I salute them for their courage, conviction and belief in the quest for democratic freedom. To their families, I send my deepest sympathy and respect. I cannot and never will pretend to understand how difficult it would be to lose a loved one in the prime of their life. I can only imagine the life-changing consequences and we must never forget the sacrifices they have made. If history has taught us anything, it is that we must strive to provide every level of support possible for the families. As political leaders, we must ensure that the legacy of honour that these soldiers have died for is never forgotten.
This debate gives us an opportunity to renew our commitment to the pursuit of democracy and freedom in Afghanistan. It also provides the Australian parliament an opportunity to tell our allies and international partners that we are there for the duration. This is, of course, the responsible thing to do, and it is not in the Australian DNA to cut and run. Political and military strategists must be the ones who continue to consider the best course of action for the Afghan people to assume responsibility and control of their own country. Whilst our troop numbers of 1,500 are small in comparison to the overall coalition force, our men and women play a significant role to bring stability and peace to the region. The troops are there to protect the population from insurgents and remove their safe havens. They are now fulfilling a vitally important role in training and mentoring the Afghan National Army 4th Brigade, our primary mission in the Oruzgan province. This mission is well on track, with the aim that the army brigade will be ready to lead security operations within two to four years.

—Senator Cormann is obviously very keen to make his mark in this place, but perhaps he ought to show a little more restraint.
The agreement between the government and those three mining companies was designed to ensure that Australians got a fairer return for the use of our nonrenewable resources and to allow us to invest in the long-term economic future of this country. We also indicated at the time that, in terms of extending the arrangement to other miners who were caught by our proposed minerals resource rent tax, we would continue a discussion and a consultative process. That is occurring. The policy transition group, led by Don Argus, is discussing all of the issues involved and reporting back to the government by year’s end.
There have been some discussions about the detail of one measure of the agreement with those mining companies. That, obviously, is the subject of further discussions between us and those companies. But it has been very clear from the start that we will not be giving a green light to state and territory governments to increase their royalties at the expense of the mining resource tax revenue.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Mining</title>,Questions Without Notice,3,1,answer
"Evans, Sen Chris (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",ALP,2010-10-26,"—With all respect, I answered most of the supplementary question in responding to the primary question. I did indicate that there had been some public discussion around the implications of that part of the agreement between the major mining companies. I understand discussions have occurred between the minister and those companies about this. But, as I say, from the start we made it clear that we would not be giving a green light to state and territory governments to increase their royalties and therefore undermine the mining resource rent tax. Clearly, that would be a very perverse outcome and defeat the purpose for which the MRRT was designed. It would undermine our ability to pay for the sorts of things we committed to—like super, infrastructure and tax relief. Those discussions are continuing, but the government’s position is clear.

"Evans, Sen Chris (Leader of the Government in the Senate)",ALP,2010-10-26,"—I think in a former life the senator would be accused of leading the witness with the way he constructed the question, claiming that I said a whole range of things that I did not. In this context, we call it ‘verballing the minister’. I reject the assumptions contained in the question.
This government has set about implementing the mining resource rent tax in a way that ensures that Australians get fair reward for their mineral wealth; that when mining companies are making huge profits from mining nonrenewable resources, the Australian community gets a benefit from that; and that when commodity prices are at record highs, Australian taxpayers are entitled to share in the large profits being made. We remain committed to that principle and working with the industry to achieve it. (Time expired)

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2010-10-26,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Tertiary Education, Skills, Jobs and Workplace Relations (Senator Evans) to a question without notice asked by Senator Brandis today, relating to economic reform.
There is no doubt that this government is in a hopeless mess. From pink batts, to green loans, to Building the Education Revolution and to border protection we have a government that is in a mess. As Labor’s Senator Cameron so perceptively acknowledged, it is as though the Labor Party have had a lobotomy. We on this side have known that for a long time. The surprise to us is that the Labor Party have finally realised it themselves.
If anyone needed an example of a lobotomised Labor Party, all they needed to do was have the same misfortune as I had last night in witnessing the most appalling prime ministerial address to the Australian Industry Group. Last year’s PowerPoint presentation by Prime Minister Rudd achieved a new low, but it was still way, way ahead of Prime Minister Gillard’s performance last night. Ms Gillard, in a shrill and strained presentation last night, claimed, ‘A deal is a deal.’
—A knife is a knife!
—That is news from Mr Rudd, coming from Ms Gillard. As Senator Brandis said, a knife is a knife. But they made a deal that she would not challenge for the leadership and 15 minutes later she was back in his office saying, ‘I am going to challenge.’ So, clothed with all that moral authority and integrity, she addressed the Australian Industry Group last night and said, ‘A deal is a deal.’
And of course, on the mining tax mess that we are facing, Ms Gillard is claiming that a deal is a deal and things should be honoured. Well, the deal that she struck was renounced on 2 July. She said this in a media conference:
Last night we sat down to settle the final agreement, and I can now announce we’ve reached agreement on the basic structure of minerals taxation for the future.
Then, in an answer to a question on notice to the inquiry into fuel and energy, so ably led by a coalition senator, we were provided with a copy of the heads of agreement, part of which said:
All—
a-l-l—
state and territory royalties will be creditable against the resources tax liability …
Now, all of a sudden, having promised that there would be no cap, there is a cap, and yet, hand on heart, last night in a very shrill and—
—Stop saying ‘shrill’.
—Well, I am sorry; it was shrill—
—It’s a sexist comment.
—It is not a sexist comment; it is an indication of how she came across, which is indicative, of course, of a government struggling to get out of its self-inflicted mess. They are starting to sink in their own mire of self-created mess.
And here she was, trying to justify herself as the great economic reformer—the one that opposed every single Howard-Costello government reform—all of a sudden remade. All that she could talk about last night was the Hawke-Keating reform era. She then airbrushed out the Howard-Costello era—she just could not bring herself to that—which of course went down like a lead balloon in the audience that she was addressing.
But what we have now is a government that nobody trusts. Mr Rudd does not trust her because she has form. The mining industry no longer trusts her—the mining industry which is so important and vital to the economic, and thus the social, fabric of our country. They do not trust her anymore. And of course the Australian people cannot trust her any more, given that, on the very day before the election, she made a solemn promise that there would be no carbon tax—absolutely no carbon tax—and yet, straight after the election, she is now entertaining a carbon tax. She will be seeking to implement a carbon tax, and she said so last night. So when she said to this audience, ‘A deal is a deal,’ she was in fact announcing that she was breaking her very own deal, her solemn promise to the Australian people. This is a Labor government in a mess, and what we need— (Time expired)

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2010-10-26,"—I am proud to be part of a Labor government that is prepared to take on the hard tasks and the difficult agendas. We sat on that side of the Senate for 11½ years and watched those opportunities simply trickle through the coalition government’s fingers. The big, hard questions that we have had the temerity and the fortitude to tackle are things like really trying to start working to ensure that we have a health system in this nation that will deliver for people who need it and an education system that works across the country with a single curriculum so constituents who by nature of their job are very transient are able to move their children around the country and still get a quality education. I am proud to be part of a government that did tackle sensibly, decisively and with great success the global financial crisis. We have tackled the issue of Indigenous aspiration, something that is never going to be delivered in a short period of time. But at least we have started. We have started dealing with the questions of health, housing, education and, in particular, employment for Indigenous Australians.
It is terrific to be part of a government now working with people on the crossbenches and the Greens to deal with the questions of rural, remote and regional Australia. It is terrific to be part of that. And, yes, we are going to tackle one of the hardest pieces of public policy—that is, dealing with the Murray-Darling Basin. What do we get, though, from those sitting over there? We get name-calling, nastiness, pettiness and base political point-scoring. Last night I was there when the Prime Minister expressed some astonishment at the comments we have had over the last couple of days from Messrs Hockey and Robb. It is quite extraordinary that here we are in 2010 and we have two opposition frontbenchers—two would-be ministers, minister for finance and Treasurer—pulling back the economic reforms that I thought, and I think our Prime Minister thought, that for the past nearly 20 years were agreed on: that we needed to have a more open market economy and deregulation of the banks, and that the way that interest rates are set in this nation by an independent entity is the right thing to do. So why are we revisiting economic arguments that were won and agreed to more than 20 years ago? I will tell you why. Because it is easy politics; it is lazy politics as well. It is simply appealing to those who want to find a simple answer rather than taking the hard way, the difficult way—the way that I know that many of you who sit over there in fact agree with.
I thought the Prime Minister’s comments last night were very, very apt and important to inform the community debate around what we are really talking about. Let us not let the economic debate in Australia fall so low that we get to questions around—and I do recall it—‘Why don’t we print some more money?’ That is another line that a former member of the House of Representatives, who I think the Prime Minister was alluding to last night, suggested was a reasonable economic strategy. Be careful. I urge caution. We are in this place to lead the debate and not to fall to the lowest common denominator. I encourage leadership; I encourage good, common sense.
—But we are in opposition.
—And that is all you do—simply oppose. If you sit there opposing forever, you will stay there. (Time expired)

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2010-10-26,"—I am not entirely sure where Senator McLucas was last night, but I know where she wasn’t. She most certainly was not at the AiG dinner, because she could not possibly have come out of that dinner and made the comments that she has now made. Indeed, it was a shrill commentary. It lacked any depth at all. It did not attempt to address in any way the big issues that are expected of the Prime Minister. Indeed, look at some of the commentary. I am looking at the Canberra Times headline: “ALP becoming ‘party of zombies’: internal rumblings’. There is a picture of Senator Doug Cameron. It looks as if he is doing 30 with a minimum of 20. I do not think the photo does him any justice at all, but his comments most certainly do.
Effectively, Senator Cameron, one of the strongest members of the parliamentary Labor Party, has—within the space of nine weeks since the last election—accused his own party of treating members like zombies and giving members political lobotomies. The comments of Senator Cameron are quite instructive. He said: ‘We are not allowed to stand up for the people that we represent. You can’t talk about things. You’re not allowed to talk about things. And, really, you know, we don’t want zombie politicians.’
The most remarkable thing that we have seen today is the Newspoll. Nine weeks after the election of a new government, the Labor Party is behind in the Newspoll. There is only one reason for this. It is because the Labor Party have already broken the so-called deal that they went to the election with. They have broken the deals in relation to health, economic management and illegal immigration. They have broken deal after deal of the deals that they allegedly made with the Australian people.
The arrangement that they have made with the Australian Greens is clear evidence of the depths that they have reached. Labor are a party beholden to a group of people who in the main—certainly in this chamber—they do not share the philosophical beliefs of. There are some in the chamber today—and I will not identify them—who do not share the philosophical beliefs of the Australian Greens. They do not share the philosophical beliefs of some of the Independents. Labor have done a grubby deal to retain power. The Australian people have seen through the grubby deal. The Australian people know that Labor do not believe in what the Greens believe in. But they know that Labor have done a deal simply to hold government.
The Australian people would look at the performance of the Prime Minister last night and say to themselves: ‘What have we done? What have we let this country in for for a maximum of three years? What can we trust about this political party?’ As the Leader of the Opposition has said quite clearly, this is a government which simply can’t keep its word. There is no more damning indictment of a political party, and particularly of a Prime Minister, than being accused of not keeping your word. The Australian people know what is going on. The Australian people can see through the Australian Labor Party and this new government. The Australian people have made a decision in nine short weeks that they do not believe you, that everything that you touch is a mess and that your word cannot be trusted. The great tragedy is that there is another potential three years left of the sorts of mistruths and policy inaction that we have seen from this government already. Senator Cameron is absolutely right. This is a political party in which there is no debate. This is a political party that is micromanaged more than it was under the Prime Minister that it unceremoniously dumped. (Time expired)

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2010-10-26,"—Let me commence my contribution by addressing the central focus of Senator Ronaldson’s comments late in his contribution: that this government had broken its word and is not consistent in the application of its policy and that, after a miserable mere nine weeks, should forfeit its position. Let us talk about the five things that Senator Ronaldson listed. They were health reform, asylum seeker and migratory reform, carbon tax reform, mining tax reform and reform in the Murray-Darling Basin. Those are the five issues. Each of those five issues has received considerable prominence and press of late. Why is that? Because the government of Australia, through its relevant cabinet ministers, is in each instance seeking to resolve issues that were determined some nine weeks ago.
This government was given a clear mandate to go ahead with reform in each of these areas. On each of these issues, the relevant ministers are engaged in consultation and negotiation. They are holding meetings and forums. They are part-way through that process. No-one on God’s earth believes that, after nine weeks in government and after only some four or five weeks since the parliament first convened, each of those issues should have been resolved. The process is underway and will undoubtedly bear fruit in due course.
In contributions by opposition senators, snide references were made to the delivery of a speech last night by the Prime Minister. I must have been the only person in the Great Hall who sat and paid attention to that excellent speech by the Prime Minister, because the appropriate adjectives to use to describe it are ‘reasoned’, ‘calm’, ‘balanced’, ‘logical’, ‘forthright’, ‘deliberate’ and ‘authoritative’. They are the seven adjectives that any sensible person would use to describe both the content and the delivery of that speech.
We are also accused, as I understand it, of being somewhat inconsistent in the process of discussion and negotiation concerning the mining resources rent tax. I would suggest in response that the position that we adopted in July and that we put to the people in late August is the same position that is now being negotiated by Minister Ferguson and his officials and Mr Argus from the National Australia Bank. It is the same position that will come out when that committee of inquiry delivers its report to the government later on this year sometime around about December. Those negotiations on the mining tax have been a model of consistency. The mining tax, as we all know, has particular application in Western Australia and Queensland.
What do we have to say about the proposal that was the subject of questioning by Senator Brandis? Yes, there was an agreement entered into back in late June or early July of this year. Yes, there was a mining tax agreement entered into with the three largest mining companies in this country. Yes, it was made public. There is no disagreement on those basic propositions. We also made it quite clear under the administration of Mr Rudd and the continuing administration of Ms Gillard that we—the government; the Australian Labor Party—are absolutely insistent that there be a fairer return for the use of non-renewable resources in this country. We will continue that discussion and consultation process right across Australia. We have been quite forthright about that process.
The basics will not change. The basics were outlined in the heads of agreement that was negotiated in late June or early July. That heads of agreement was made public. That document made it quite clear that the Australian government was insistent that the Australian people—on behalf of whom it was negotiating—would, through appropriate taxation mechanisms, receive a fair return for allowing mining companies to exploit non-renewable resources in this country in the greatest boom this country has seen in terms of commodities and the extraction of resources. That is what is going on now. The committee is moving around Australia. It is particularly active in Queensland and Western Australia. It is having negotiations at both ends of the— (Time expired)

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2010-10-26,"—Last night I attended a dinner in the Great Hall with the captains of Australian industry and I heard there a very calm, thoughtful, balanced, intelligent speech by the chairman of the Australian Industry Group. He then introduced the only other speaker for the night, and what we heard then was an absolute embarrassment to the people of Australia—a shrill, ignorant speech that really embarrassed us. I went around to the Great Hall this morning and had a look at the floor. I thought there must have been something unusual about the floor because there was a point in the Prime Minister’s speech last night when suddenly for about 30 seconds everyone was looking at the floor. It was an embarrassment at the table I was at and it was an embarrassment at all of the tables that I could see around me. People were embarrassed that this was Australia’s Prime Minister, with such a shrill speech at that sort of event. The issues that the chairman of the Australian Industry Group raised very sensibly in his introduction were not addressed at all by the Prime Minister.
As Senator Brandis indicated in his very thoughtful question at the beginning of question time today, this government simply cannot be trusted. The Labor Party under Kevin Rudd were in free-fall a couple of months out from the election and one of the reasons was that they were trying to tax Australia’s resource industries out of existence. All the mine workers, particularly in states like Western Australia and Queensland, could see that their jobs were being put at risk by this mining tax. After the brutal stabbing by Ms Gillard of the then Prime Minister Rudd, Ms Gillard had to do something to try and reverse the electoral defeat that was staring the Labor Party in the face, and the easiest thing to do was to gather up the three biggest mining companies and make a deal with them.
One should perhaps be a little sorry for BHP, Rio and Xstrata today, now that they realise they have been treated with treachery by the Prime Minister. I cannot really bring myself to have sympathy for those three companies because they were so keen to climb into bed with Ms Gillard in the period before the election and save the Labor Party from ultimate annihilation at the election. I do hope that those three companies reflect upon the part they played by crawling into bed with Ms Gillard and its impact on the election held in August.
Unfortunately those companies, whilst they deal with a handshake with billions of dollars around the world, were fooled by a politician of Ms Gillard’s standard. She made a deal with them which, she led them to understand, contained certain arrangements. Yet she knew at the time, I suspect—and certainly it has since become clear—that she had no intention whatsoever of complying with and honouring the deal that she had made. She got through the election—admittedly Labor were almost defeated, but they were saved by some other deal, with a couple of Independents and the Greens, which I am sure will also go the way of the deal with the mining companies—but she has broken that deal this week. This should be a salutary lesson to anyone who would deal with this government that this is a government that simply cannot be trusted. It is an embarrassment to me as an Australian to have a Prime Minister and a government that cannot be trusted. Three of the world’s biggest companies now understand that they cannot deal with the Australian government. We saw last night a Prime Minister who simply cannot be trusted. In her delivery of that speech, with her pettiness, childishness and immaturity, she showed that this government is an embarrassment to all Australians. (Time expired)

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2010-10-26,"—This Labor government is addicted to spending, which leads to an addiction to new and increased taxes. It has delivered record levels of debt and deficit. This government has tried to hide under the cover of a global economic downturn. Those in the government want us to believe that this profligate spending only started after the global economic downturn started in 2009. But nothing could be further from the truth. Right from the word go, this Labor government was a high-spending, high-taxing, big-debt, big-deficit government—immediately causing significant pressure on interest rates moving forward.
In its first budget, net spending increased by $15 billion. There were additional taxes of $20 billion. Labor in three years in government has not once delivered a surplus budget in a year in which it was fully responsible for our nation’s books. The last surplus budget in Australia at a national level was the 2007-08 budget, and that was still in part, of course, under the stewardship of the Howard-Costello government. There was $15 billion in additional spending and $20 billion in additional taxes in Labor’s first budget, the 2008-09 budget—a $27 billion deficit—which was followed in 2009-10 by a $54.8 billion deficit. This next financial year we are looking at a $40.7 billion deficit.
We have a new Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Senator Wong. She is telling us this government has already made so many savings. Senator Wong says the Labor government has made $83.6 billion worth of savings over the last three years. But nothing is ever as it seems with this government. People out there in the community, people who might be listening to this broadcast, might think: ‘Well, $83.6 billion worth of savings? This government must have made some difficult decisions. This government must have made $83.6 billion worth of decisions to cut spending. This government must have looked at how to genuinely bring the budget back into surplus by making some difficult spending cuts.’
I tried to get some information from Minister Wong in estimates as to where that $83.6 billion worth of savings was coming from. More than $30 billion of what Minister Wong claims are savings are in fact tax increases. I will mention a few. I have here a list of all the increased taxes in Labor’s first three budgets in government which Minister Wong is claiming as savings, as if they are somehow spending cuts. There is the Orwellian-sounding ‘better targeting of personal income tax cuts’—that is, taking income tax cuts away—of $5.3 billion in Labor’s first budget. We have the tax on alcopops of $3.1 billion in Labor’s first budget. We have the tax on the North West Shelf gas project of $2.5 billion in Labor’s first budget. We have the fringe benefits tax ‘tightening of exemptions’—read ‘increased taxes’—which was also to deliver $1.4 billion. There was the increase in the luxury car tax of $550 million. There was the increase in the passenger movement charge of $459 million. All these tax increases continued, budget after budget. Then we come to 2010-11. Bearing in mind that we had a record budget deficit of $54.8 billion in 2009-10, what do we see in 2010-11? Twelve billion dollars for—you guessed it—the mining tax. Minister Wong is claiming the $12 billion in additional revenue for the Gillard Labor government as a saving. I do not think that anyone across Australia would agree with the minister that imposing a $12 billion new tax on an important industry like mining is a spending cut or a saving. It is a new tax.
This government struggles with the definition of what a tax actually is. Senator Cameron tried to claim the benefits of speaking out, and we have heard him say in committee hearings in the past that, really, all the money is the government’s money and the government decides how much money people are allowed to keep. Senators on this side of the chamber, like Senator Bushby, Senator Ryan and Senator Parry—and you, Mr Acting Deputy President Trood, I am sure—take the view that it is the people’s money and that the government should take as little of it as possible; as much as necessary but as little as possible. We believe in lower taxes, smaller government and less wasteful spending.
With this Labor government here in Canberra for the last three years there has been waste and mismanagement everywhere, deficit after deficit and an addiction to spending, and of course this has already had an impact on interest rates. The problem is that there is now a fiscal policy at the federal level which runs completely counter to the monetary policy pursued by the Reserve Bank. When we were confronted with the challenges from the global economic downturn, the Rudd Labor government thought that it should do the same as the UK and the US, irrespective of our circumstances being very different. The Rudd Labor government inherited a strong budget position and a strong economy. There was a lot of scope for the Reserve Bank to reduce interest rates to stimulate the economy. In the UK for the last two years there have been interest rates at one half of one per cent. They have actually had to start printing money to stimulate the economy. Even that has not been enough. The government there thought, ‘We have got to stimulate the economy by fiscal measures—additional spending.’ In the US interest rates have been at about one quarter of one per cent for the last two years, and they too are printing money. But even that has not been enough, so the government there has had to circulate additional funds through fiscal stimulus.
However, here in Australia interest rates bottomed out at three per cent, which is much higher than they are in either the UK or the US, and they have increased much faster than in any other part of the world. In fact, we have had six increases in interest rates since October last year, and the consensus among economists is that interest rates will be one per cent higher again by the end of next year. We have a government that continues to shuffle the money out while the Reserve Bank tries to put the brakes on. If the government had not put billions of dollars in wasteful spending into the economy, the Reserve Bank would have had much more flexibility with its monetary policy. The Reserve Bank could have continued to reduce interest rates and stimulate the economy without leaving us hundreds of billions of dollars in debt and future generations of Australians having to pay the price for the wasteful spending of this Labor administration. This generation of Labor senators and Labor members should hang their heads in shame because they are leaving generations of Australians with a burden of debt that they should never have been left with.
There were other ways. There was the way of less wasteful spending and there was the way of letting the Reserve Bank do its job for longer than it was ultimately able to. Of course, since the election nothing has changed. We have asked the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, Senator Wong, again and again, ‘Where are your spending cuts?’ Do not tell us about your plans for more tax increases. We know that you describe tax increases as ‘savings’. That is not what we want to know. That is not what the Australian people want to know. The Australian people want to know when you are going to start spending less so that you can tax less. The Australian people are tired of all the new taxes. They are tired of having to pay $10 billion a year in interest payments to pay for Labor’s debt. This is a government which inherited a strong economy and a strong budgetary position from John Howard and Peter Costello. It is a government that has wasted the money that was available to it when it won government, and here we are after three years of Labor government just short of $100 billion worth of debt with the government still borrowing about $100 million a week to pay for its spending. Of course, this is continuing to put upward pressure on interest rates, and that is not in our national interest.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Economy</title>,Matters of Public Importance,17,1,speech
"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2010-10-26,"—I rise today to dispute Senator Fifield’s matter of public importance attacking the Gillard government’s management of this nation’s economy. In our first term in government we were faced with the biggest economic crisis of our generation—the global financial crisis. When we heard of the crisis unfolding in the United States, the Labor government took swift action and implemented the Nation Building and Jobs Plan to stimulate our economy and ensure that we did not go down the same path. Our $42 billion Nation Building and Jobs Plan did what it was supposed to do, and Australia’s economy continues to outperform those of other developed nations. Our stimulus package injected much-needed funds into education through the Building the Education Revolution as well as into infrastructure, roads, social housing, renewable energy, small business, defence housing and even the hands of working Australians. The coalition voted against this package that kept our economy afloat and our citizens in jobs. The coalition has attacked our spending and our deficit, which is to be paid back three years ahead of schedule. The coalition would have kept this nation’s surplus and let people join the unemployment queues, lose their homes and keep our schools infrastructure back in the past just like where the coalition are. Instead, due to the government’s strong and decisive action and injection of stimulus into the economy, our nation’s schools now have the 21st century facilities that they had been yearning for.
I have been privileged to open many BER projects in Queensland, and I am yet to hear any negative feedback about the scheme that kept the construction companies, sparkies, painters and public servants in jobs throughout the economic downturn. Students have new libraries, new computer labs, new halls, new indoor sports centres and refurbished classrooms thanks to the Labor government’s BER. I have heard from principals who are still in disbelief that they have these new facilities, which would not have been provided to them under a coalition government. I have heard from students who are excited that they now have somewhere to play sport when it is raining, a new library in which to research assignments or even a new dance studio. Benowa State School, for example, hires out its new dance studio to the local community. The BER not only assisted the students, the builders and anyone else who worked on these facilities but also assisted the furniture companies whom the schools chose to furnish their new classrooms, computer labs and libraries. It also provided local community groups with facilities to hold meetings and functions.
Our stimulus package helped Australians enter the housing market for the first time. Our boost to the first home owners grant assisted 250,000 Australians into their first home. The first home owner boost provided an additional $7,000 to the already existing $7,000 first home owners grant, and those who chose to purchase or build a brand-new home received $14,000 on top of the grant. This has supported thousands of jobs in the housing supply industry, including those of electricians, plumbers, builders and tradespeople.
The Nation Building and Jobs Plan also provided funding to invigorate existing and build new facilities for the community to enjoy. The government allocated $800 million under the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program to help build and renew community centres, town halls, parks, playgrounds, sports facilities and swimming pools. This initiative employed many Australians and ensured our citizens had access to brilliant infrastructure. Under the $250 million allocation, 3,220 projects were approved for funding to 566 councils. More than 2,750 have already been completed. Under the $550 million allocation, 70 of the 137 strategic community projects have commenced.
It is true that we are strong economic managers. Just look at the new policies we have implemented that will still enable us to go back to surplus in 2012-13. In January 2011 our nation’s first Paid Parental Leave scheme begins. We will be enabling working Australians to stay at home longer with their new born or adopted children. Providing support to our working families is important in maintaining a relationship between employers and employees and provides an avenue for mothers to return to the workforce. We also overhauled our pension system and provided a much-needed increase for our four million pensioners who depend on it. Are you telling me that a pension increase is irresponsible?
How can the opposition accuse us of mismanagement when we are in one of the best fiscal positions in the world? We have the lowest debt and deficit of all major advanced economies. We have the lowest unemployment rate of all major advanced economies. We were the only major advanced economy to avoid recession and we maintained our AAA credit rating.
If we had not taken action during the GFC, about 200,000 jobs would have been lost. Can you imagine the struggle our working families would have faced if this were the case? Instead, this year 360,400 jobs were created, with 55,800 in September and 56,700 in August this year. This is the biggest two-month increase in employment in 22 years. Interest rates are still lower than they were under John Howard when he left office, and we have delivered tax cuts for our working families and low-income earners. Someone who earns $50,000 a year is now paying $1,750 less in tax than in 2007. In fact, the highest our interest rates had even been in this country were under a coalition government. Under former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser and Treasurer John Howard interest rates peaked at 21.4 per cent. During our first term, interest rates continued to drop, but, since we avoided recession and have a strong economy, interest rates have started to go up. This was always going to happen. However, interest rates are still lower today than when the coalition was ousted from government in 2007.
As we all know here today, interest rates are controlled by the independent Reserve Bank of Australia. However, last week the shadow Treasurer, Joe Hockey, said he believed the RBA needed to be regulated on interest rates. He said:
… I would say that the Treasurer is not using the obvious levers available to put pressure on the banks to stop them from raising interest rates outside of the changes—
Honourable senators interjecting—
 (Senator Mark Bishop)—Order!
—I will repeat that. Shadow Treasurer Joe Hockey said:
… I would say that the Treasurer is not using the obvious levers available to put pressure on the banks to stop them from raising interest rates outside of the changes brought about by the Reserve Bank itself.
He then went on to say:
Well there are a raft of levers that are available that may be punitive in measure when it comes to the banks, but the banks ought to understand they rely heavily on a government and a parliament that delivers good will and if the banks trade off that good will to gouge the Australian consumers, then if the Government doesn’t move to put pressure on the banks then the parliament will.
This statement of encouraging interference of an independent body is amusing coming from a frontbencher of a party that prides itself on supporting private enterprise.
Treasurer Wayne Swan labelled Mr Hockey’s remarks as a challenge to independence and walking away on economic reform. Even the Secretary to the Department of the Treasury, Ken Henry, dismissed his ideas. He said:
It would be rather difficult to have a central bank independently operating monetary policy through interest rates and at the same time another body, ie the Government, regulating those interest rates. That doesn’t sit too well together.
The International Monetary Fund released its World Economic Outlook earlier this month, confirming that Australia is in a strong fiscal position and continues to outperform other advanced economies. Other nations are dealing with high unemployment while we are leading the way with strong economic growth and job creation. The IMF has predicted unemployment will remain high in advanced economies at more than eight per cent for the next two years. The United States’ unemployment rate is at 9.6 per cent and in the Euro area it is 10.1 per cent. In comparison, Australia’s unemployment is at 5.1 per cent.
If you examine the facts, it is clear that the Labor government have managed a strong economy to the envy of the rest of the developed world. We kept people employed and successfully created jobs. We refurbished our schools and provided new facilities that they would not have otherwise received. We have upgraded roads and provided funding to upgrade the rail systems, funding for community infrastructure, funding for social housing and funding for defence housing. We have implemented schemes like Paid Parental Leave to ensure parents retain a relationship with their employers. We provided a boost to our economy through stimulus payments to our taxpayers to curb the GFC and keep Australia out of recession.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Economy</title>,Matters of Public Importance,17,1,speech
"Ryan, Sen Scott",LP,2010-10-26,"—I rise to support the matter of public importance on the government’s mismanagement of the budget. What a performance. I note in the list of all the programs that Senator Furner mentioned then there was one that went missing—in fact, two. Firstly, I did not hear anything about home insulation. I remember sitting at the Senate hearing when this was discussed, and Senator Furner’s side were warned about the profligacy of the package they were putting forward. Yes, we voted against it on this side, and I am quite happy to say to the schoolchildren sitting in those overpriced school halls that we voted against it because we knew that they are going to spend their entire working lives paying that back.
But, more importantly, Senator Furner made the claim that this government debt will be paid back in three years. This is one of the great fictions that Labor hope to hoodwink the Australian public with. The government have promised that in three years, out of a $350 billion budget, they will have a surplus of $3 billion. They have promised a surplus of $3 billion—less than one per cent of government spending—in three years. That will only represent a start. If that happens, and it is a very big ‘if’, that will represent about two per cent of net government debt.
So there is a long way to go, Senator Furner, in paying back government debt. You cannot say that this level of debt is going to be paid back in three years. You are promising to make a start, and your track record tells the Australian people that that promise is absolutely worthless—just like your promise not to introduce a carbon tax and just like your promise not to build extra detention centres. And it is a three-year promise, not a three-week promise. The Australian people know that that is worthless.
It is basic economics that the larger the government deficit the greater the pressure on monetary policy and interest rates. It is not just on this side that it was said—it was the mantra of the Labor government in the eighties. I had the misfortune to listen to the Prime Minister’s speech, and the Orwellian tone of it, at dinner last night. I lost count of the number of times she mentioned reform and Hawke-Keating—as if to somehow, falsely, claim the mantle. Saying it does not make it true. All through the 1980s, the once reformist Labor Party made the point that government spending had to be reined in, because that is what took pressure off monetary policy. That is the opposite of what this government has done. It talks the talk, but it does not walk the walk. It alleges that, somehow, economic populism has found its roots on this side of the chamber. A simple look at the Labor record, while in opposition, shows that is completely untrue because, despite selling everything it could get its hands on under the sun when it was in office before 1996, it opposed the privatisation of Telstra as soon as it came into opposition.
Despite its own Treasurer and future Prime Minister proposing a consumption tax in 1985, it spent every ounce of its energy post 1998 opposing the tax package that was put to the Australian people at the 1998 election. It sold airports. It sold the long-cherished Commonwealth Bank. It was even planning to sell part of Telstra, as the 1996 election campaign made clear. But as soon as it came to opposition, it said ‘the sky is going to fall in if the government does not run a telecom company’, which is exactly what it is trying to do today. And in the most egregious example that I can remember of the last decade in Australia, the former Prime Minister—whom the Labor Party had the good sense to remove before the Australian people had their opportunity to do so—argued for the flawed RSPT and alleged that these foreign mining companies had to pay a greater level of tax. It was the former Prime Minister who started to run the economically xenophobic arguments that foreign owned mining companies were not paying their share. That did not happen from this side; it happened from that side of the chamber.
What we now know is that the record $90 billion deficit that has been run-up in just two years by this government is worrying people other than us. It was the Treasury itself that pointed out that something had to be done about this government’s wasteful spending. This is not from us. I will read a quote from Ken Henry, the Secretary of the Treasury—who you are so fond of quoting to justify all these other plans. The Secretary of the Treasury said:
Tighter fiscal policy, and measures to boost labour force participation and productivity, could play a useful role in complementing monetary policy, reducing the size of the required increase in interest rates and the exchange rate.
I am not an expert in bureaucratese, but this is about as clear as it gets in a briefing from government. The Secretary of the Treasury and the briefing to the incoming government, provided by the Treasury, make it clear that there is a trade-off and make it clear that under this government’s policies—by refusing to reconsider its wasteful fiscal policies and its wasteful spending—interest rates are higher than they would otherwise be.
It is no use comparing us to our neighbours. What Australians want to know is: do they have to be where they are now? It is no use comparing us on interest rates. Australian householders and small businesses do not care what they are in New Zealand. They do not care what they are in the United States. They care what they are here, and in Australia they are higher than they otherwise need to be. And it is having a dramatic impact upon our economy.
Just last week, the ABS put out its biennial data on the number of entries and exits into business. In the first two years of the Rudd government, before the members opposite had the good sense to remove him, there were 25,000 fewer businesses than there were when the Rudd government came to office—25,000 fewer small businesses, if you include those with fewer than 20 employees. Over the same period there have been, roughly, over 250,000 job losses in the small-business sector. That is what your policies are doing to the growth sector of the Australian economy. But that does not surprise me because, quite frankly, those opposite have never understood nor ever cared for small business.
We hear a lot from those opposite about how strong the Australian economy is. To those on this side, the Australian economy and a low unemployment rate are things we are very happy about: fewer Australians out of work. I suppose it is lucky that you are not a kid who wants to work two hours, not three, after school, because you have not been quite as lucky. But it goes to this particular point. If the economy is so strong then why are you borrowing $100 million a day? The stimulus package, you know, is still being rolled out, particularly in the building space and in the schools. You are stimulating an economy that is running at capacity. You are forcing inflationary pressures in the economy ever higher, and it is unnecessary. It was wasteful to begin with and it is unnecessary now. Your own words testify to that.
Fifty years ago, the Labor Party in Australia wanted us to replicate Britain and its socialisation of the economy of transport, coal mining and steel-making. Today, it seems they want to replicate the British economy again. They want to ramp up the size of government and they want to try to plug revenue holes with new taxes, but they show absolutely no ability to restrain their own urges and restrain their own ability to offer preferred patronage to parts of the Australian economy. This government stands guilty of putting unnecessary pressure upon interest rates.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Economy</title>,Matters of Public Importance,17,1,speech
"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,2010-10-26,"—Listening to Senator Ryan’s contribution this afternoon, I was amazed. I do not think he missed any of his enemies in his 10-minute contribution—from banks to building societies—and he talked about George Orwell, but one thing that did intrigue me a little was his rant against the Hawke-Keating government and a number of the economic reforms that it conducted—mainly in privatising a number of government sectors. Now, I know that Senator Ryan was an activist in the Victorian university clubs and all those sorts of things but I get an inkling that deep down Senator Ryan is a leftie who was disturbed by what the Hawke-Keating government did. And I will have an opportunity, after my contribution, to talk to one of my Left colleagues, Senator Marshall. I am not sure whether Senator Ryan applied to joint the Socialist Left in Victoria and was rejected. If he was rejected it was a sound decision, Senator Marshall, in hindsight, because we have certainly seen a tirade conducted by him here today.
When an election is called it is usual for the major economic spokesmen of both parties to present themselves before the National Press Club. You may recall that the shadow Treasurer, Joe Hockey, walked into the National Press Club and refused to answer questions on the coalition’s policy, how it would be funded and the impact it would have on the economy. You may well recall how embarrassing a day that was for the coalition. Subsequent to that I asked a number of coalition members: ‘Why didn’t Joe Hockey answer those questions? Was he denied the opportunity to answer those questions by a vindictive leader in Tony Abbott?’ And I was told by men and women who should know, ‘No, it was just lazy Joe Hockey.’ He hadn’t done his work.
—Sloppy Joe!
—As Senator Marshall interjects, ‘Sloppy Joe.’ But do you remember, even better, the unedifying presence of Mr Robb in this building having to conduct a press conference to at least try to explain the funny money opportunities that were being put forward by the coalition? Who could ever forget Andrew Robb diligently, valiantly, trying to explain the unexplainable? And who could forget that poor staffer down the back of the room, when Andrew Robb continued to soldier on, trying to argue the inarguable? The young staffer was down the back of the room with his finger across his throat, going: ‘Andrew! Andrew! Cut, cut, cut! Do not let them know any more!’ This was the farce of the coalition in that period, and it continued right up to and after the election.
We know now that there was an $11 billion hole in the coalition’s budget plans. This is how good they were, and I would have to say you would have to think they were trying to sabotage their campaign. Mr Hockey said at the National Press Club on 9 August, ‘The Australian economy is the envy of the developed world.’ Mr Robb said: ‘Well, untrue. That’s true, I’m sure. I’m sorry; I agree that it is the rest of the world.’ These men knew, and know now, that our economy is in that state.
I now go to the post-election period. Do you remember the farce of that period where the coalition would not present their budgets to the Treasury so that they could be costed? Do you remember the almost two weeks of farce that this country and its people had to go through because he refused to provide information that could have made sure that the coalition was in government? Do you remember that? I remember it very well, and so do the Australian people. And that is why the coalition is on that side of the chamber and we are on this side—because everybody can see through them.
When the opposition finally came up with their funny figures from Sloppy Joe we found that there was an $11 billion hole in them. That is what tipped the balance and gave us the treasury bench—because people like those opposite were not prepared to be honest with the Australian people, let alone be honest with their parliamentary colleagues. It is an interesting paradox that we have now. I have suggested that Senator Ryan is a disappointed leftie who was denied possible membership of the Socialist Left in Victoria, but now we have a situation where Sloppy Joe, the shadow Treasurer—I probably should not call him ‘Sloppy Joe’—
—I rise on a point of order. Mr Acting Deputy President, members of the other chamber should be referred to by their proper names.
 (Senator Mark Bishop)—The point of order is correct. You should refer to Mr Hockey as Mr Hockey.
—Mr Hockey has now embarked on yet another program that would probably qualify him for the old Socialist Left in Victoria—and that is to re-regulate banks. I wonder when we are going to see from the coalition statements along the lines that we might need to reinstate some labour rights! What about restoring the single desk? I am sure that would be in Senator Williams’s heart! Why don’t we go back to the fifties, where it now looks as if our coalition colleagues are far more comfortable! Let’s see if that single rail gauge is really appropriate when we take a train from Victoria to New South Wales! Was the Snowy Mountains scheme appropriate? Was it necessary? I know that Robert Menzies boycotted the opening of it; was it really necessary?
All these great nation-building programs in the past, now and in the future, have been initiated by Labor governments. We will continue to provide those because they are necessary for the economic wellbeing of our country. My colleague Senator Furner has outlined a number of the social initiatives that have been conducted by this government but we have been receiving from the independent commentators the necessary compliments required for us to proceed with the program we are running. Standard and Poor’s said on 24 September this year:
Australia has one of the strongest fiscal positions globally with a net general government debt burden less than half the level of AAA rated countries.
Moody’s said:
In comparison to most other AAA-rated countries, Australia’s government financial strength is very high, with a very low gross debt—
‘very low gross debt’, senator who will follow me—
that is easily affordable and provides a high degree of fiscal flexibility.
I do not know why the coalition are in the pickle they are in at the moment; they seem to be all at sixes and sevens. But, as I say, we have been delivering for the Australian community and we will continue to do so. As I said earlier, we have a strategy that will get our budget back into surplus in three years, and that will be before any other major advanced economy. That is why it has been endorsed by the IMF and also by the Reserve Bank of Australia—

Senator Boyce interjecting—

—and international credit-rating agencies, as I just outlined to you, Senator Boyce. As I said, if you want to go back and re-regulate the economy, which seems to be what the shadow Treasurer wants to do—

Senator Boyce interjecting—

—If you want to go back and do that, if you want to be disappointed lefties like Senator Ryan, you go ahead and argue that at the next Australian election, because if you really look at what you want to do, it is confusing to many people in the street. Even noted economists are disturbed by where you are going, and so they should be, because it could take us back into difficulties.
This government has been one of the few governments in the last decade that has been prepared to put on the table the issues of nation building and, at the same time, fiscal responsibility. In each and every way, we have been opposed by a narrow-minded and biased coalition. It is time that they understood that their duties in this place are to the nation, not to their own party. I hope today we may see some semblance of light from some of the contributors coming after me.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Economy</title>,Matters of Public Importance,17,1,speech
"Bushby, Sen David",LP,2010-10-26,"—What an interesting contribution we have had today from government senators!
—Thank you; they’ve done very well.
—I look forward to something better from Senator Bilyk because so far we have not heard anything from any of the government senators that is actually in the least bit relevant to the matter we are discussing today. Senator Furner went into great detail about how the stimulus package which the government put in place was swift, and yet here we are, two years later, and a large percentage of it, 30 to 40 per cent of it, is still being rolled out. If the stimulus is what saved Australia’s economy, then why is it still being rolled out? And, if it needed to spend as much money as the government says it needed to spend to do that, why do we still have a large percentage of it that has not been spent? Quite clearly, the large part of it that has not been spent yet is not contributing to the stimulus and did not contribute in any shape or form to our economic performance over the last two years.
And how does that fit into Treasury’s requirement of the three t’s: that any stimulus package should be temporary, timely and targeted? Is the stimulus package still temporary when two years later there is still 30 to 40 per cent of it to be rolled out? How temporary is that? Is it timely? Any crisis that did exist in Australia to the extent that the North Atlantic financial crisis did impact on us is well past now; why do we still need to be rolling out a stimulus?
Is it targeted? Well, Senator Furner himself talked about how it had promoted local industry. In my home state of Tasmania, Tascot Templeton is the only remaining carpet producer of its type in the country. It specialises in making carpets of the type that you put in parliament—the carpet in this chamber now is Tascot Templeton carpet—and in places like schools and other institutions. It was perfect carpet for it, but, no, the Building the Education Revolution program did not use their carpet and now they will be closing before Christmas.
In general, Senator Furner spent most of his time highlighting how the economy is close to capacity. We could argue all day as to why the Australian economy actually came out of the North Atlantic financial crisis in the shape that it did. There are a number of arguments but I suspect China’s stimulus had a lot more to do with it than the Australian stimulus. This is the problem: Senator Furner himself and Senator Hutchins admitted that we are near capacity. This comes down to the nub of what we are talking about today. If we are near capacity, why are we still stimulating?
I want to take the trouble to repeat the quote that Senator Ryan mentioned, which was:
Tighter fiscal policy and measures to boost labour force participation and productivity, could play a useful role in complementing monetary policy, reducing the size of the required increase in interest rates and the exchange rate.
So said the Department of the Treasury and Finance in its incoming advice to this government, in the document commonly known as the red book. What Treasury did in that statement was highlight a couple of issues it sees within the control of government that, if addressed, could reduce the size of required increases in interest rates and the exchange rate.
Surely, given the massive increases in the cost of living faced by all Australians, particularly in the area of government-supplied or government-controlled goods and services like water, energy and rates, mainly under state Labor governments, the last thing that this government should be doing is making decisions that add to the cost of living for Australians or, just as bad, ignoring advice to take action that would minimise pressures that would add to costs for Australians—in this case, the cost of servicing a home loan or, if you are a small business, your small business loan.
So what are these two measures that Treasury recommended the government take action on to reduce the size of required increases in interest rates and the exchange rate? The first was tighter fiscal policy, and this means better spending control by government. It means cutting back spending and working a little harder to ensure that spending is only on that absolutely required rather than for looser political reasons—or, to put it more bluntly, stopping the wasteful and reckless spending of this government. The second measure was to boost labour force participation—things like providing better incentives for people to get off various forms of government assistance or welfare and to get into the workforce—which would involve a mixture of carrot-and-stick measures.
But the subject of the MPI today is how the Gillard government’s mismanagement of its budget and fiscal policy is impacting on interest rate pressures, so I will focus on the first of the recommendations of Treasury. In doing so, I would like to refer to another quote from the red book, one that followed on from that with which I opened my comments:
... there is also scope for the government to improve the quality of its own spending programs in a way that takes pressure off interest rates and the exchange rate.
So here we have not just a polite suggestion that tighter fiscal policy can reduce the size of required interest rates but a comment that perhaps the quality of the government’s spending needs a little work. That is, that it maybe is not of the best quality and—just perhaps—the government should think about what it is spending its money on and maybe rethink a little or even a lot of it. Of course, Treasury in its red book has to be somewhat circumspect. It cannot just come out and blatantly slam the government for choosing to continue its wanton spending on stimulus for an economy that is nearing full capacity and for which stimulus is the last thing it needs. It cannot come out and say, ‘Your fiscal settings were set for a dire economic outcome that never actually transpired; so stop,’ or even, ‘Your fiscal settings are emergency settings and the emergency has passed’—if it ever actually applied in Australia. It just cannot come out and say that. No, Treasury in these documents has to be far more polite and responsible. So the comment of ‘scope exists to improve the quality of government spending’ is fairly direct and telling. Treasury clearly has issues with the government’s spending—and for good reason. Dr Henry in a June 2008 estimates hearing stated:
... the budget is estimated to have a mildly or moderately contractionary effect on the economy through the increase in the size of the budget surplus, and through that higher budget surplus or moderately contractionary effect on the economy that comes with that higher budget surplus there would be downward pressure exerted on inflation.
At the October 2010 estimates, just last week, I asked Dr Henry about these comments in the context of the current challenges, as outlined in the red book and elsewhere, and whether the same principle applies now. He said:
In an economy close to full capacity—
and, as we have heard from Senator Furner and Senator Hutchins, that is where we are at now—
a tightening of fiscal policy would mean that there is less work left to be done by monetary policy, and that would mean, other things being equal, that interest rates would be somewhat lower.
A clearer statement of how things work could not be made. (Time expired)

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2010-10-26,"—Senator Bushby, what an absolute classic! He is obviously not sure of his arguments because he has just stood up and argued that if Tascott Templeton had been able to supply carpet to schools through the BER program then they would not have had to cease business. So what he is actually saying is that the program was great for job productivity to increase employment. Earlier across the chamber he acknowledged that he had not been to one opening through the BER program. I was a bit concerned about why he had not, but now I realise that he is just deadset embarrassed by his own side’s arguments, because he obviously thinks there is an increase in employment participation through the program, and I am sure that that is something he would support for the people not only of Tasmania, from where we both come, but of Australia.
It is absolutely beyond me why the opposition continues to insist on scoring own goals when it comes to fiscal policy. They bring on an MPI to try to highlight some supposed budget mismanagement on our part and yet, if they had their say on the fiscal settings, Australia would be in a recession right now with double-digit unemployment. Of course, we had former Prime Minister John Howard on Q&A last night trying to rewrite history—I think he has done that in his recent publication as well—by trying to say that Australia avoided a recession and it was down to his economic management. Yet the reason that we needed such a large economic stimulus was the abject failure of those opposite to make any significant moves to boost Australia’s productivity—and productivity, as we know, is the key to good economic management
The Gillard government is committed to strong and sensible economic management. We have a strategy that will get the budget back to surplus in three years, well before any major advanced economy. That is why it has been endorsed again by the IMF and also by the RBA and international credit rating agencies. Market economists overwhelmingly agree that our strategy will get us back to surplus in 2012-13 and keep us in surplus in 2013-14. Fiscal stimulus is being withdrawn, too. Far from fuelling growth, the withdrawal of stimulus will subtract around one percentage point from growth this year, and the remaining investments are in long-term infrastructure which is critical to building our productive economic capacity. Senator Bushby would have us abandon projects midstream. I cannot see any benefit in that it all, Senator Bushby, and I do not know if the voters in Tasmania would either.
If you want a strong bottom line in both good times and bad, you need to invest in productivity. This includes skills and education, such as trade training centres; additional university and TAFE places; and new school facilities, including classrooms and multipurpose halls. It includes infrastructure like the National Broadband Network; renewable energy schemes; record investment in highways, rails and ports; and innovation, spending on which has increased by 34 per cent since we came to government. I would leave, too, Senator Bushby. I would be very embarrassed if I were you.
If the coalition were not committed to productivity then at least they shared Labor’s commitment to economic reform—well, up until recently, anyway. Now they have got some bizarre idea into their heads that the best way to support Australia’s economy is not productivity, not economic reform, but re-regulating the banks. What kind of a policy gets described by one of your own backbenchers as being ‘a policy from the lunatic fringe’? I think that is a great description from the member for Canning. After all, as the Prime Minister pointed out, this was the kind of wacky policy being espoused by Pauline Hanson’s One Nation—or, if you want to explore the lunatic fringe a bit further, how about the Citizens Electoral Council? Come to think of it, the CEC also believe that global warming is a fraud and that Australia should invest in nuclear power.
When we had the coalition’s finance spokesperson Andrew Robb questioning whether Australia should have floated the dollar, does this indicate a return to protectionism by those opposite? Once we peg our currency to the US dollar like Communist China what is next for the federal opposition? Are we going to start raising our tariff barriers? Our floating dollar has kept Australia on an even keel for years, protecting us from price shocks and helping us through financial crises such as the dotcom crash and the Asian financial crisis of 1997.
In fact, our floating dollar, tariff reform, strong banking system and independent monetary policy have been supported by both major parties and kept our economy growing continuously for 20 years. Why would anyone want to wind back a financial system that has been so successful? Well, according to the member for Canning, as I said, only the lunatic fringe would want to do that.
Let us look at our fiscal position. I am going, at this point, to expose a few inconvenient truths for the pre-Copernicans opposite. First of all, they talk about debt and deficit, but fail to point out that Australia has the lowest debt to GDP ratio of all OECD countries. The average for major advanced economies was 70 per cent in 2009-10. I will see if anyone on the other side of the chamber can tell me what Australia’s debt to GDP ratio was. Anyone like to hazard a guess? No? I will give you a clue—it was somewhat less than 70 per cent. Australia’s debt to GDP ratio was 3.3 per cent in 2009-10. And guess what? We are paying it back, as I said, three years ahead of schedule.
This is the great claim of those opposite when they say that we mismanaged the budget—that we had a debt of 3.3 per cent of GDP and continued economic growth, while other advanced economies racked up debts, in some cases over 100 per cent of GDP, had double-digit unemployment and went into recession. In fact, what happened to other major advanced economies despite economic stimulus is a great example of the disaster that could have befallen Australia without stimulus. And that is what, in Australia, would have happened if those opposite had had their way—because they opposed economic stimulus.
If you want to talk about fiscal incompetence, you only need to look back to very recent history, to the 2010 federal election, to find an absolute corker from the opposition. Let us not forget that it was only two months ago that the coalition, after avoiding the scrutiny of having their policies properly costed, finally submitted their figures to the Treasury. And what did we get? An $11 billion blow-out. That is ‘billion’ with a ‘B’ for Barnaby—sorry, for Senator Joyce over there.
Do you know what could be bought with $11 billion? Let us think of a few examples. The Kingston bypass near my office, in the electorate of Franklin, is a $41.5 million project jointly funded by the state and federal governments. So the coalition’s failure to do their sums properly, if they had ended up in government, would have left the taxpayers worse off by the equivalent of 265 Kingston bypasses. Another project in the Franklin electorate is the Clarence GP superclinic, an integrated care centre receiving joint state and federal funding of $18.5 million. The coalition’s accounting error adds up to almost 600 Clarence health centres.
This explains why the coalition did not want the sunshine of Treasury analysis to be shone on their figures. It also explains why most of the Independents were reluctant to support them on supply and confidence. Remember what the Independent member for New England, Tony Windsor, said on the Four Corners program that aired on 4 October? He said:
… I think it does indicate that they knew that there were issues here in terms of the accountability process.
That was Mr Windsor’s polite way of saying that the coalition deliberately avoided scrutiny of their budget figures because they knew the figures were dodgy. And the member for Denison, Andrew Wilkie, cited the coalition’s budget black hole as one of the reasons he doubted their ability to deliver on their extravagant promise for the Royal Hobart Hospital. After all, their black hole added up to 11 times their proposed package for the Royal.
In another two months Christmas is coming, and I have a collective present for the opposition caucus—but it is especially for the shadow minister for finance, Andrew Robb, and shadow Treasurer, Joe Hockey. I am not usually in the habit of telling people early what their Christmas presents might be because I do not like to spoil the surprise too much. But I think, because the other side is in such need of this piece of equipment, this tool, I will just have to tell them. I am going to get them an abacus. I know how badly needed it is on that side of the chamber. I did consider a calculator, but I figured they needed to add their sums up slowly, to avoid any further mistakes, and do not want them to confuse millions and billions. Maybe I will throw in an instruction booklet and they can have a tutorial for their first caucus meeting next year. I hope they enjoy their present and put it to good use. (Time expired)

"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2010-10-26,"—The contributions to this debate from the government senators have been particularly worrying, and the worrying thing about them I think is that they believed what they were saying. I think they honestly think that if they just keep repeating the mantra of paying back the deficit three years early it will actually come true. Perhaps they forget that we went through the—very tortuous, these days—process of Senate estimates, where, in committee after committee after committee, the government had to admit that they had not met the deadline on anything that they were proposing—not on superclinics, not on anything. They cannot meet a deadline. They are not capable of it. Why would we think that, on something as important as reducing the deficit, they could actually improve on their deadline?
So what we have are the senators opposite repeating mantras, and thinking that if they set up these straw men and then knock them over they have actually achieved something. It has taken a long time for the government to continue to try and build up the global financial crisis as the greatest catastrophe of our time because then they could be terribly ‘successful’ at controlling it. What a laugh! This economy was in far, far better shape, as other opposition speakers have already pointed out; the contribution of China towards our economy was at least as important as, if not more important than, the so-called economic stimulus.
I must admit, that given some of the ducks-and-drakes games that are being played with new tax measures being counted as savings by this federal government, I am reminded more of the state Labor governments. I am reminded even more of the state Labor governments’ habits of getting into the hollow logs and digging out whatever they can when we think back to the Medibank Private raid that this government undertook. Labor is in a mess. Labor’s management of the economy and of fiscal policy is in a mess.
There is no doubt whatsoever that excessive government spending is placing upward pressure on interest rates. It is time the government started to pay off the debt, not continue to accumulate it at $100 million a day. That is what is causing the problems. We have a $41 billion deficit along with an economy that is running close to capacity and employment running at almost full levels. They are overdoing it; they are over stimulating the economy. When the Howard-Costello government was managing the economy, the same group—Mr Swan, Ms Gillard and others—opposed almost everything that we did. From tax reform to privatisation, from waterfront to fiscal consolidation, they said no, no, no every time. Now we have a fiscal policy that is in complete opposition to the policy of the Reserve Bank. They are putting pressure on interest rates. This will continue until they can see reality, until they can stop believing their own spin and actually concentrate on the real issues at hand.
They can repeat over and over that the global financial crisis was the greatest catastrophe of our time, but it is not going to make it true. We currently have a situation where we have one shrill redhead evoking the memory of another shrill redhead. Can I suggest to the prime ministerial redhead that what she needs to do is look to her own mismanagement of the budget and fiscal policy—because she knows that, if interest rates keep going up at the same rate as they are right now, she will be as dead a duck as her predecessor.

"Kroger, Sen Helen",LP,2010-10-26,"—I rise to contribute to the debate on the ministerial statement. Australia has followed an integrated approach in Oruzgan province with military police and aid workers on the ground. Currently there are 28 members of the Australian Federal Police deployed inside the main Australian base at Tarin Kowt. They provide training to the Afghan National Police by teaching basic policing and survival skills, along with human rights considerations. So far more than 600 Afghan police have graduated from this course. This integrated Australian approach has improved security, governance and development. It has delivered projects which make a difference to the lives of the Afghan people.
To effectively deliver education, health or governance a basic level of stability and security is necessary. To withdraw our troops at this time would simply condemn the Afghan people to many more years of suffering and despair.
Projects include a new waste management facility in the provincial capital of Tarin Kowt, a boys primary school and high school, a girls school and numerous infrastructure projects. Such an integrated approach is critical to winning the enduring support of the Afghans and defeating the insurgency. It is also critical to create better conditions for governance, reconstruction and development efforts.
Australia’s military and policing efforts go hand in hand with our aid commitment. We have currently 50 civilians deployed to Afghanistan, based in Kabul, Kandahar and Tarin Kowt. Their main objective is to work with the locals to improve fundamental government services, such as health and education, and to support agriculture, which is considered to be the key driver for future income generation. Almost half of Australia’s aid money is delivered through Afghan government systems, which is worth mentioning as this is generally considered to be a main tool for building local capacity. Through these channels Australia has been able to deliver important services, such as basic health and hygiene education, and mine risk education, and to improve food security through the distribution of wheat and other foods.
Thousands of kilometres of roads have been built. School enrolments are six times higher than in 2001, when there were only one million boys going to school. Today there are six million students attending school, of which one-third are girls. Health services have been significantly increased, as well as access to telecommunications. These are without doubt enormous achievements when compared to the lives of Afghans under the Taliban regime.
Our mission is not to impose a foreign government or a Western value system; our aim is to help the people to help themselves. Retired Major General Jim Molan summed this up succinctly, when he said:
The coalition’s aim is to help the Afghan people, despite their appallingly imperfect government, to produce an army and police force capable of securing the country so that governance and prosperity can improve, and Afghanistan can determine its own future. This is still doable.
Australia has clearly defined goals in Afghanistan. We are there to deny terrorists sanctuary. We must not forget that more than 100 Australians have lost their lives through terrorist attacks attributed directly to links in Afghanistan. To abandon this process now is to deny the Afghan people a self-sufficient future. It is not in any way humane nor justifiable to consider this as an option. There is a lot of good we can do in Afghanistan and there is a lot we can do to make the lives of women and children better.
There are reports that the Taliban banned girls from school, locked away women and allowed them few, if any, rights. This is unjustifiable and unforgettable. Women’s advocates have repeatedly warned that it would be the mothers and children who would suffer most if Western troops were to end their commitment in Afghanistan too early. Dr Sakena Yacoobi is the Executive Director of the Afghan Institute of Learning, AIL, which is an Afghan women-led NGO she founded in 1995. She asserts that the women of Afghanistan completely depend on the ISAF troops. She said:
As soon as allied soldiers walk out and leave Afghanistan, the first blood shed will be women and children.
Dr Yacoobi is one of those brave women who stood up to the Taliban and risked their lives in the pursuit of helping others. She ran underground schools for girls in the 1990s during the Taliban regime. Today Dr Yacoobi heads the Afghan Institute of Learning, an organisation which works with women to improve health and education in seven Afghan provinces.
Dr Yacoobi is not the only woman swaying the ISAF allies to stay and finish what they began. There is also renowned Afghan human rights activist Suraya Pakzad, who founded the acclaimed Voice of Women Organisation. This organisation assists underprivileged and vulnerable women and children, providing critical relief and rehabilitation. Mrs Pakzad also stresses that women have benefited tremendously through the war in Afghanistan. She said in the West Australian:
In the Taliban time we weren’t women, we were second-class citizens and we were not considered a person equal to men.
The days when women were not allowed to walk down the streets on their own, without being accompanied by a male family member, are gone. Women could not go to school, could not travel, had no choice who to marry and were excluded from any kind of social life—an existence that we in Australia would find very hard to imagine. Life was very dangerous for women. There are countless stories of women who lost their lives because they tried secretly to gather basic knowledge. These women who sought to go to so-called underground schools were hounded out and faced the terrible consequences. Life can still be very dangerous for women in Afghanistan. This is just another reason why the coalition of troops must stay the course. Female representation in the Afghan parliament has also improved.
The culture of the Taliban has not disappeared. Educating the women has not changed the majority of men—and their views—who still believe that females are their personal possession. I have read about women who try to burn themselves trying to escape their cruel husbands and fathers. This self-immolation is a huge problem that still exists, with, unfortunately, case numbers still on the rise. Luckily, the number of women who try to escape this cycle of violence is also on the rise. There are ever more young women who emancipate themselves and fight for their rights. It is these very people that we must continue to support. These women need our support because such a decision can have very severe consequences.
Ten women’s rights activists have been murdered since 2005. Others live under constant threat, like the famous female MP Malalai Joya, who never spends more than 24 hours in one house, in order to keep her assassins at arm’s length. If these women continue to ask Australian troops for help, I feel we have a moral obligation to hear and fulfil their pleas. We are fighting this war for a just reason: to help the good people of Afghanistan to help themselves. Stability and security are the very foundation of this process, which must lead to an improvement of the appalling human rights situation.
Only last week I read a quote from another young woman in an interview with the Adelaide Advertiser. This was an Australian woman. This woman, 23-year old Taryn McGowan, spoke about the reasons why her partner had decided to serve in Afghanistan. Ms McGowan said, impressively:
He is there to help get the country back to a place where women and children are protected and I am proud of that.
It is a sentiment that I think we all would salute. So she should and so should we. I hope that this parliamentary debate can truly recognise the essential work that is undertaken by Ms McGowan’s partner and by his 1,500 or so Australian mates and colleagues. Their commitment will not be in vain. Supported by their loved ones at home and in this parliament, our troops will lead Afghanistan to a prosperous, self-sufficient democracy and future—a contribution for which Australia can be proud. If there is one thing that history has taught us, it is that we must continuously support the families that fight for freedom and democracy, and we must continually honour those that fight and have lost their lives to serve us and to serve the great fight for democracy around the world.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Afghanistan</title>,Ministerial Statements,22,1,speech
"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2010-10-26,"—In addressing the debate on the ministerial statement, and along with other speakers, I express my sorrow for those who have lost their lives in this conflict. We were reminded of the toll of this war just yesterday, when we learnt that four Australian special forces soldiers had been wounded during operations. Our thoughts are with the soldiers that are injured and their families, and at this time we wish them a speedy recovery. I rise to speak in support of our engagement in Afghanistan. I speak in support of our service men and women tasked with bringing peace and stability to a nation in turmoil. I speak in support of the Australian soldiers that have been injured or have lost their lives in the service of our great nation.
The privilege I have today of expressing my views to the Senate is a privilege that is not reflected in nations around the world. The privilege that we have been gifted was built on the backs of Australians before us—Australians that fought in far-off lands for the gift of freedom and democracy. Our troops today are not in a dissimilar place. In the harsh arid lands of Afghanistan our troops are held in the highest regard by our coalition partners. Their courage, spirit and profession-alism are constantly recognised. They are Australian qualities that I admire and respect. It is for those reasons I state my support for the war in Afghanistan with deep consideration.
When I woke on the morning of 12 September 2001, I could not believe what was unfolding on our televi-sion. I will never forget the images of the twin towers engulfed in fire and of occupants throwing themselves to their death to escape the inferno, the phone calls of the trapped office workers to their loved ones, and the ultimate loss of 3,000 lives. I will also never forget the night of 12 October 2002, when 202 innocent people lost their lives in the first Bali bombing—88 from Australia and several from my home community of Coogee. And I remember Afghanistan in 2001, under the draconian and extremist rule of the Taliban, a regime that executed women for minor offences, a regime that outlawed the education of girls, a regime that destroyed the cultural icons of other faiths, a Stone Age regime that attacked knowledge itself, and a country that sanctioned the flow of drugs onto the streets of the West. Not only did the Taliban oppress and murder its own citizens, it harboured and ultimately became beholden to the extremist organisation al-Qaeda, the organisation that has at its core the slaughter of those that do not surrender to its doctrine, and that was behind the attacks in New York and, of course, connected to the attacks in Bali. It was the Taliban in Afghanistan that provided al-Qaeda with its support to establish its military and financial networks. Under the Taliban in Afghanistan, al-Qaeda trained and funded terrorists to kill. Al-Qaeda provided jihadists to conflicts across the globe. Before the September 11 attacks, al-Qaeda in Afghanistan was allowed to become a global terror network with the clear purpose of the destruction of the West.
Our battle is not against the peaceful religion of Islam practised by over one billion people. Our battle is against fundamentalism; it is against militant extremism. It is a battle we cannot afford to lose. Western democracies have fought against extremism whenever they have encountered it, and in Afghanistan it is no different. The war in Afghanistan is a battle of ideas—a battle against the extremist doctrine of a global terror network that gave a green light for the murder of Australian citizens; a battle of ideologies between a belief in the rule of law and freedom for citizens versus Stone Age sharia law.
Our mission in Afghanistan is worth fighting for. We are part of a NATO led force and our role is to help build a civil society. We are part of a mission to provide the citizens of Afghanistan the security environment they need to allow the country to move forward and to prosper. Our armed forces are currently training Afghan soldiers and helping nation-building efforts to help the Afghan people. We cannot allow Afghanistan, after all this, to become a failed state. We owe it to the people of Afghanistan not to walk away because the task is difficult and challenging but rather to stay the course. We owe it to the people of the country, to the children and the women, to support their education, to support their voice and to support their development. And, importantly, we must stay in Afghanistan to keep interrupting an evil terror network.
We are making progress. I am not going to say that everything is perfect. There are still a great many challenges, but at the same time there have been great strides. Militarily, our special operations task force is effectively disturbing Taliban activities and we are damaging the al-Qaeda network every day. There is progress in the training of the Afghan National Army. Women for the first time have a voice in the government. Education enrolments have increased. The Australian Federal Police is training Afghan police officers. And normality is returning to society. As Minister for Sport I was heartened to read that the Afghan judo team participated in the Judo World Cup for the first time, and two of the team members were female. I also recently watched the ICC Twenty20 World Cup, which Afghanistan competed in for the first time, and I read that there is enormous cricket talent in that country that is being developed.
The government and the parliament understand the challenge that is ahead of us. From a fight against fundamentalism through to the challenge of helping build a nation, it is an enormous task. Again, I do not take the decision to support this conflict lightly. I believe this conflict is critically important. It is too important to walk away from those who lost their lives on September 11. It is too important to walk away from those who have lost their lives at the hands of al-Qaeda. It is too important to the region and to our allies. It is too important to the people of Afghanistan. And it is too important to our nation.
I conclude by echoing the sentiments of the only veteran in my party in the House of Representatives, the Hon. Dr Mike Kelly. He calls for us not to leave Afghanistan because it is too hard. He states that we should keep faith in those who serve in our name in Afghanistan and for the nation to stay the course. I wholeheartedly agree. We have to stay the course for the benefit of those who wish for a better life in Afghanistan, for the memory of those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice, for our national security and ultimately for the security of our own citizens and families.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Afghanistan</title>,Ministerial Statements,22,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2010-10-26,"—I commence my contribution to the debate on Australia’s involvement in the war in Afghanistan by acknowledging the professionalism and dedication of the members of the Australian defence forces deployed in that theatre of war. Coming as I do from the garrison city of Townsville, I do on a daily basis see and understand those magnificent men and women who put their lives at risk every day for the security of our nation and for peace in our world. All our soldiers are trained to use weapons, but they are also trained to help people who, without the work of the Australian defence forces, would find the quality of life and the freedoms they do enjoy much more illusory.
There will always be critics of Australia’s involvement in any military action. Just last Saturday morning I was privileged to be able to attend, on behalf of the Leader of the Opposition, a commemorative service to acknowledge the commencement of the Korean War some 60 years ago—a war that some people have labelled the ‘forgotten war’. Some people will still challenge Australia’s involvement in that conflict. You have to look no further than the repressive, totalitarian regime that still controls the long-suffering people of North Korea to understand what Australian troops in the early 1950s succeeded in doing for half of the people of the Korean Peninsula. Koreans south of the demilitarised zone lead a life of freedom, with rights in a working democracy that have brought prosperity and relative peace to those citizens. Without the involvement of the United Nations in those years, which included a substantial contingent of Australian forces, all Koreans today would be under the control of that harsh, repressive dictatorship which has no respect for human life or liberty.
Any person on this planet with a conscience would want to avoid any sort of war. But for those who sit in the comfort and security of life in Australia, it is easy to overlook the fact that for some people their liberty and future can only be protected if a stand is taken against aggression and political power. Appeasement never works, and World War II showed that. In September 2002 the Australian parliament supported Prime Minister Howard’s invocation of articles IV and V of the ANZUS treaty to support Australia’s involvement in the war against terror following the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
Our original objective in Afghanistan was to combat a clear threat from international terrorism to both international security and our own security. Whilst others in this place have cited the accomplishment of this objective as a reason to bring our troops home, we cannot afford to let Afghanistan again become an open training ground for terrorist organisations. The best way of protecting Afghanistan’s new-found freedom and preventing terrorist organisations returning is to ensure that that country enjoys a democratic, open and peaceful government and also to make sure that the Afghan National Army is well trained, well led and well educated. We can give them the skills and guidance they need to secure freedom and stability for their nation. This is the mission, currently, of the 1,550 ADF personnel serving in Afghanistan.
Our training mission is succeeding. It is making progress. The 4th Brigade is proving to be an increasingly professional force, fighting better and becoming more capable of conducting the complex operations that are needed in that sort of conflict. Over the last couple of years the Afghan security forces, in partnership with the forces of Australia, Holland and the US, have methodically expanded their permanent presence in key population centres in Oruzgan province. This permanent presence has provided the security necessary for the provincial government to be able to start delivering roads and services to its people.
I applaud the leadership shown by John Howard, Peter Reith, Robert Hill, Kevin Rudd, John Faulkner, Tony Abbott and David Johnston in continuing to support Australia’s troops and Australia’s involvement in the conflict in Afghanistan. All of these people and many more have a clear understanding of the objectives and roles of the Australian troops. It is just such a pity that some of those who have grabbed headlines with comments on Australia’s involvement have not yet bothered to be properly briefed by those with all the information on the role, actions and strategies of the Australian troops in Afghanistan. In fact, some people have a very naive view that Australia rarely needs military forces. This sort of approach comes from those who have never, in my view, shown any great consistency in relation to policy issues involving Australia’s future.
It has always been a disappointment to me that the Greens political party, for example, never seem to worry about the rape of native forests in our near neighbours in South-East Asia and the Pacific which supply timber to Australia, whilst they oppose and denigrate logging practices in Australian forests that are some of the best managed in the world. If those practices were allowed to continue in Australia, it would mean that there would be no call for the sort of rape of forests that is occurring in our near northern neighbours. It is that sort of hypocrisy in policy thinking that is repeated in the Greens political party policy approach to the maintenance of Australia’s professional Army and its involvement in conflicts that threaten the peace and security of the world.
Australia’s troops in Afghanistan will return home, as they have done from every other conflict, but they will come back when the job is finished. To bring them back before the job is finished would mean that the sacrifice of 21 Australians would have been in vain. As the wife of one of Australia’s brave soldiers who fell in Afghanistan said:
To pull the troops out now when the job isn’t done, then, really, all those guys did die in vain.
Clearly, our role in Afghanistan has changed since 2001. Australia’s SAS forces were responsible for removing much of the al-Qaeda threat and the Taliban. Their efforts have meant peace and freedom for Afghani civilians, particularly women, that would not have been possible under that repressive regime. The goal is now to rebuild and to make Afghanistan a place where women and children are protected and can progress, with secure, positive and worthwhile futures.
It is interesting to note that in Oruzgan province Australia has helped with 78 school reconstruction projects, over 100 kilometres of roadworks and the disbursement of more than 950 microfinance loans. We have helped to refurbish hospitals. We have assisted in the rehabilitation and operation of 11 health centres and 167 health posts. Indeed, in Afghanistan generally economic growth has averaged 11 per cent per year since 2002. Poppy cultivation has decreased and 20 of the 34 provinces in Afghanistan are now poppy free. Basic health services are now available to some 85 per cent of the population, compared with only 10 per cent under the Taliban regime. Since 2001, primary school enrolments have reached six million. That is up from about one million when the Taliban were in charge. Of those six million enrolments, approximately two million are girls, who were, as has been pointed out in this debate so far, excluded under the Taliban regime. These successes are perhaps small, but they are successes and they would never have occurred without Australia’s involvement and the involvement of other willing nations in the fight against terror in Afghanistan.
I conclude where I started. Those young men and women who join Australia’s armed forces do so because they believe there is a role to play in protecting our country. They are trained to fight and they are trained to become what are universally recognised as some of the best soldiers in the world. They are there to do a job and, when called upon, they do it professionally and bravely and in fulfilment of the hours, days, weeks, months and years of training that have been part of their lives since they entered military service. They are always willing to put their training and skills into action and to ensure that, by their work, the world is a safer and better place.
I salute all of those brave Australians who have at any time served in the defence of our country. As a nation we are honoured by the sacrifice of those who have given their lives in the service of their country, and I do recognise the sadness and heartache for the partners, children, parents and other loved ones of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice. Yes, our troops will come home, but they will do it when the job is done and not before.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Afghanistan</title>,Ministerial Statements,22,1,speech
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NATS,2010-10-26,"—I rise to also take note of the ministerial statement we are debating today and to support our troops in Afghanistan. When Australians ask, ‘Why should we be in Afghanistan?’ three answers come to mind. The first reason is that the first objective of Australia’s national security is freedom from attack or the threat of attack—that is, the capacity to protect our citizens and interests at home and abroad. Australia has lost 111 citizens to terrorist attacks abroad. All of these attacks are linked back in some way to the freedom of action that terrorist forces have enjoyed in Afghanistan. We have to remove the safe havens for extreme Islamic terrorists and other groups that are capable of extending their influence into the Australian region and thereby further impacting on our national interests. We also must remember the horrific attacks of September 11 which killed over 3,000 people.
One of the principles of Australia’s national security strategy is to support the UN to promote a rules-based international order. In Afghanistan, Australian forces are under ISAF command, under a UN mandate along with about 40 other countries that are involved. If our alliance with the United States remains a key strategic partnership and the central pillar of Australia’s national security policy, then we have a responsibility to join with the US and its partners under the auspices and sanctions of the UN to continue to achieve the mission in Afghanistan. The maintenance of a strong ANZUS alliance is critical to Australia’s regional security. Australia’s involvement in Afghanistan serves at least in part to reaffirm the strength of the ANZUS alliance and indeed the value of the ANZUS treaty. That is the second reason we should be in Afghanistan. The third reason we should be there is for the welfare of Afghani citizens, who are repressed under extreme Islamic laws.
Firstly, there is the question of whether the troops should pull out altogether. That is an idea advocated by the Greens, who support all sorts of rights—women’s rights, human rights, gay rights. I say, emphatically, no. That would be a sell-out of everything our troops had fought for. Secondly, there is the question of how Australia actively encourages potential Afghan refugees to stay in Afghanistan so that the nation can rebuild itself properly.
It is important to point out that Afghanistan was not always a war-torn nation. Before 1974, it had a university and a form of governance in the monarchy. From 1932 to 1972, Afghanistan enjoyed a certain level of peace and prosperity. Maybe it was not what we would expect, but there was a government. The country was ruled by King Mohammad Nadir Shah, who brought some quite modern, progressive changes to the country—for example, he made the wearing of the veil non-compulsory for women. He was actually a supporter of women’s rights and tried to steer away from the more religious fundamentalist forms of government. He also tried to devise a democratic constitution of sorts. But, after his death, Afghanistan was thrown into conflict by clashing factions from the Marxist side and from the Islamist side. In 1979, the Soviets invaded in an effort to help the Marxist uprising. The war continued for 10 years and it was only after America went in to assist that the Russians pulled out.
In 1990 an interim government was set up in the hope that they could forge ahead with democracy. However, the Taliban as we know it today was already becoming quite a strong political movement, and its growing strength led to the overthrow of the government in 1992. With the subsequent invasions of the country and the formation of the Taliban, Afghanistan turned into a haven for terrorism and extremism, and a training ground with al-Qaeda terrorist camps. But now, with the overthrow of the Taliban and with our forces in Afghanistan, there is no reason why Afghanistan cannot become manageable again, as it was between 1932 and 1974.
Over the past decade, close to 100 Australians have been killed by terrorist attacks that were planned and executed from terrorist safe havens in the mountains of Afghanistan. Australia’s involvement in Afghanistan was then and is now directly linked to our national security and the safety of our citizens, and this is one of the most compelling reasons for us to stay in Afghanistan.
While Afghanistan remains an unstable and volatile hot spot in the world, it cannot be denied that the allied initiatives have brought a level of hope to the people of Afghanistan, and that has not been seen for a long time. School enrolments have increased from one million in 2001 to over six million today, including two million girls, through the national education program. They have expanded the provision of basic health services from less than 10 per cent of the population under the Taliban to around 85 per cent today through national health programs. Over 22,000 communities have identified and managed their own development projects through the Afghanistan-led national solidarity program.
Yet, despite these advancements, there still remains strong opposition to the good work that our brave service men and women in the armed forces are doing. Bob Brown and the Greens would have the Australian public believe they represent the majority of Australians in calling for our troops to come home, but once again the Greens are not telling the truth. That is a very minority point of view. The Greens say that they represent the weakest groups in society such as women, children, gays and all these sorts of people. If we withdraw our troops and subject minorities in Afghanistan to the iron fist of the Taliban, chaos will rule again. Going back 10 or 15 years I can recall an occasion that horrified me when I read about women having been paraded before the crowd in a football ground and hung from the goalposts because they violated some sharia law. It has always stood out in my mind and I have never been able to forget it. Is that what the Greens want? Is that their form of human rights? Do they not realise this has happened and will happen again if we are not in there? People will be wrongly imprisoned for years for the slightest infringement. The vote would be a thing of the past along with education for girls. All these things would go the moment that we left.
The demands of the Greens threaten to derail and sabotage all the good work that has gone into trying to make Afghanistan a stable country again. Enormous sacrifices have been made: 21 of our troops have paid the supreme sacrifice and 100 more have been wounded. That is something that we should recognise in this parliament as a contribution that we have made to stabilise Afghanistan. To just walk out of Afghanistan and return it to the way it was would be, in my opinion, terrible. It would say to the people, the loved ones, the partners and the wives of these soldiers who have made the supreme sacrifice for us, ‘You have given your life for nothing.’
Due to the hard work and cooperation of the allied forces, the people of Afghanistan have had some form of stability brought to their country. It is nothing we would recognise and nothing that we would be happy with, but it is a start and it is moving forward. We have to bring stability to Afghanistan. By bringing stability we do face other problems. How does a nation like Afghanistan that has lost 3.3 million citizens that are now scattered around the rest of the world reconstruct its government when these people, probably from the middle classes, have left? These are the things that we have to recognise. In Afghanistan the average life expectancy is 40 years. Less than 10 per cent of males in Oruzgan province are literate and zero per cent of women in the same area can read. We are in a fight over there and one I do not believe we can walk away from. The country cannot recover if we walk out and let the atrocities that were happening before we arrived to continue.
In closing, I want to recognise the bravery and the high performance with which our soldiers have represented us. They are recognised as the best in Afghanistan. I do not believe that we can walk out now. Afghanistan was once a stable nation, and it can return to that state again if we stay the course. Our country owes a debt of gratitude to our armed forces who fight for us in Afghanistan and other overseas countries. They should know that we are behind them 100 per cent. To cut and run now would not be in Australia’s best interests and would indicate that what our troops have fought for—that is, the stabilisation of Afghanistan—is not appreciated by the parliament or by the Australian citizens. Therefore, I support the Prime Minister’s statement. I believe it is a true reflection of what the Australian people want of our armed forces. They are doing us proud and we should acknowledge their efforts and encourage them to stay there until the job is done.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Afghanistan</title>,Ministerial Statements,22,1,speech
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2010-10-26,"—I rise to take note of the Prime Minister’s statement on Afghanistan. I have been looking forward to participating in this debate for quite some time. Of course, the Greens have argued for many years that we needed to hold a discussion and a debate in both chambers of this parliament—that parliamentarians needed to be directly engaged with the conversation and discussion about whether we should continue our presence in Afghanistan. I would like to support the Greens leader, Senator Brown, in his contribution to this debate and to reinforce the Greens’ position that we really should not have gone to war without this chamber and the other chamber—our parliamentarians, the elected members of our Australian communities in our Australian parliament—discussing and debating the deployment of our troops.
Before I go on to the reasons why I believe it is time to withdraw our troops from Afghanistan and look at the reasons why we need to be doing more in relation to civilian aid, I would firmly like to stipulate that this debate is not about the job that our troops are doing. This is a debate about whether our brave Australian men and women need to be there at all, through the military forces. My respect and value for our defence forces is absolute. I have many friends and family who have fought in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Thankfully, none of them have been seriously injured. I have one friend, in particular, who is waiting for the green light to go. Of course, his family are dreading the day he departs, and many Australian families right around the country would concur with the feelings of my friend’s family—his girlfriend, his mother, his father and his sister. This is not a question about the ability of our brave men and women. It is not a question about their courage or their commitment.
This is about Australia’s ongoing role in Afghanistan in a war that, until now, our nation’s parliament has not been able to debate. This is our 10th year of conflict, and everything we are seeing today facing the Afghan population points to the question: what is it that we have actually achieved? Have we ensured that women are able to live without fear and that children are safe and able to attend schools? Have we improved what is the highest maternal mortality rate in the world? No, we have done none of these things.
Let us look at the hard realities of a country ravished by conflict. Every 30 minutes an Afghan woman dies during childbirth; 87 per cent of Afghan women are illiterate; just 30 per cent of girls in Afghanistan have access to education; one in three Afghan women experience violence, physical or sexual; 44 years is the average life expectancy rate for women in Afghanistan; and 70 to 80 per cent of women in Afghanistan are forced into marriage. With the statistics that I have just mentioned, it is clear that one of the key reasons the investment in Afghanistan has not improved the lives of Afghans is that we have not been focused on dealing with the issues at the local level. We have to remember that this is a war that even the experts tell us is an unwinnable conflict—that, rather, we should be looking at how we can work better to empower the population of Afghanistan to overcome the embedded disadvantage and discrimination. And that, the experts tell us—the NGOs, the human rights organisations and former military personnel—cannot be achieved through a continued military presence.
Everything that we have seen for the last 10 years has shown that you cannot deliver effective, empowering community development through civil aid that is delivered through a military presence. All of the statistics that I have pointed to have not been dealt with because of our military presence—in fact, they have worsened in many places because of the conflict. It should be noted that an estimated 42 per cent of the Afghan population live below the poverty line, and there has been an increase of 31 per cent in civilian deaths just in the first six months of this year alone in comparison to the numbers this time last year. We are not winning. We are not achieving the outcomes that many people would like us to believe. These statistics are reflected by our own realities of the injuries and death toll of our own defence forces and, unfortunately, we have seen them increase alongside the increase of civilian deaths.
So what are the reasons? Let us just pinpoint them. What are the reasons and the arguments behind Australia’s continued engagement in Afghanistan? The most common argument is that it is of counterterrorism. Second to that is the reason of stabilising Afghanistan, which is generally linked more to humanitarian efforts. The final reason is simply that of our continued alliance with the US.
It is clear that the arguments for why we are there now are very different to the reasons we were told we needed to go 10 years ago. When you consider that this is Australia’s longest war and that the Prime Minister has asserted that we could be in Afghanistan for another decade, we must look at the grim reality of our commitment. Twenty-one Australian soldiers have lost their lives, 10 of them since June. There have been over 2,100 international military fatalities—but that, of course, excludes the private security contractors, which we know would increase that number significantly. The total civilian casualties between 2007 and 2010 alone are estimated to be in excess of 7,000. I guess we need to reflect on the information that was released through the WikiLeaks website only recently in relation to the unknown civilian deaths that were accounted for in the Iraq War. While we are looking at the awful number of 7,000, we must remember that that is most likely a very, very conservative figure.
When you consider that each year combatant and civilian casualties are on the rise, I think it is time for us to step back and wonder. When we have statistics that only 30 per cent of Afghan girls can access education, when the maternal mortality rate in Afghanistan is the highest in the world and when 80 per cent of Afghan women are forced into marriages, what are we really achieving? Are things going so well?
We must remember that we are on a combative mission; we are not there as peacekeepers. If after 10 years our mission has indeed changed and is now to assist Afghanistan with its urgent developmental needs and to engage its communities to overcome this disadvantage and to overcome the discrimination, particularly against women and girls, then our engagement must reflect this reality. It is clear that we must boost our civil aid and diplomacy efforts to address the serious developmental issues that Afghanistan currently faces, but this should not in any way be seen as being able to be delivered or having to be delivered through our military engagement. In fact, all the statistics and all of the expert evidence show that, when you try to deliver civil aid through military force, in fact what you do is disempower communities. The schools that are built through that military operation end up becoming, as they have in Afghanistan, targets for terrorism. So why would people send their kids to that school? Why would you let your daughter go to that school when that school is a target of terrorism because it has been put there as part of the military operations? These are the realities of the things that we are doing but are not doing so well because they are cloaked in the military presence.
The Australian Council for International Development has recently calculated that Australia’s military spending on Afghanistan outstrips our aid expenditure by a factor of 10. So, if we want to get real about helping the Afghan people and dealing with disadvantage and discrimination, we need to start putting some rebalance into the types of efforts that we have in Afghanistan: boosting civil aid and ensuring that we can engage with the local communities and give them some ownership of the projects that we are funding. If we are serious about investing in Afghanistan to improve the lives of Afghan people then we need to ensure that aid is directed to the community, not to the military—whose deployment, we must remember, is largely a combative one.
The Executive Director of Oxfam Australia, Andrew Hewitt, recently argued that many of the developmental projects underway in Afghanistan have been implemented with military money or through military-dominated structures that often do not have sufficient community involvement to make them sustainable. They are considered quick wins—quick projects with quick impact. They are not being supported as sustainable institutions and sustainable infrastructure, either social or community. This, of course, is no criticism of the Australian Defence Force—it is not their role; it is not what they have been sent there to do—but it is a simple acknowledgement that the military are not designed to do this community-level work. The quick-impact nature of many of the projects that have been embarked on means that they are not designed to achieve lasting change.
This war, we have been told, is not winnable. We have already heard that from several voices on various sides of the chamber in the last week. We have heard that from the military experts. We have heard that from former military personnel. We hear that from the various different organisations engaged on the ground in Afghanistan. The mission that we embarked on is not winnable. If we are serious about helping the Afghan people to overcome disadvantage and discrimination and ensuring that we can deliver lasting change, we need to change our strategy.
In 2009, a study by the Afghan Ministry of Education and the World Bank found that schools supported and constructed by military forces were perceived by local Afghans to be at much higher risk of being attacked than the civilian-constructed schools. When we look at those statistics—only 30 per cent of Afghan girls going to school—we need to think about why that is. Yes, the infrastructure in many of those communities is not there. Yes, the teachers have not got the training. Yes, we need to invest in those communities and those education systems. Yes, we need a boost in civil aid to do that. Yes, we need to engage with the local non-profit and non-government organisations to do that. Yes, we need to engage with the experts. But we need to learn that delivering these quick-fix, quick-impact measures through the military deployment is not achieving success. We may have schools built, but there are no kids there, and the kids that are there are often targeted because of the impact. You cannot deliver long-lasting community social change through a combat military presence. History has taught us that, and what has been going on in the last 10 years in Afghanistan is teaching us that. We need to heed those warning signs. We need to be focusing on long-term solutions, not quick fixes or bandaid solutions. We need measures that address Australia’s role in helping the Afghan people directly.
As I said at the outset, this debate is not about doubting the amazing, brave, good job that our troops are doing in Afghanistan. My heart goes out to them and to their families, who are here waiting for them to come home. This is not about questioning their courage, their bravery or their commitment. This is about saying that, as the arm of parliament that keeps the government responsible, we need to seriously consider the impact that we are having on the Afghani people and the risk at which we put the lives of our young Australian men and women and think about how we can safely bring our troops home. There is no question that this is inevitable—it is inevitable—but how much longer do we have to wait? How much longer are we going to expect them to be in harm’s way before we bite the bullet and accept the inevitable truth that this war—this mission that we have been set—is unwinnable? If we really want to help the Afghani people, we need to engage them. We need to ensure that they feel safe sending their kids to the schools that are built.
We need to bring our troops home. I think it is wonderful that we have this opportunity to have this discussion in our chamber, but I am sad that it has taken nearly 10 years to have the discussion. I think it is a good thing that the government, the opposition and the crossbenches have been able to participate in this discussion, but I do not want us to fail to accept the realities that we face and instead simply continue down this blind path. Our troops must be brought home and we must engage the Afghani people in helping them overcome the discrimination and disadvantages that we have not helped them with to date. In fact, in some places we have made the situation worse, and I am very sorry.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Afghanistan</title>,Ministerial Statements,22,1,speech
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2010-10-26,"—I also rise to contribute to this very important discussion on Afghanistan. This is a very sombre and serious debate because it goes to perhaps the most important of all topics that we in this parliament could ever discuss—people’s lives. First and foremost, the decisions made within this parliament and by our executive go very directly to both the lives of our service personnel—our men and women in uniform who we deploy overseas, do their all in the name of Australia and put their lives on the line as a result of those decisions—and the lives of their families and friends. This discussion also goes to the lives of the people of Afghanistan. Whenever we deploy our service personnel overseas, it is not just their lives and the lives of their loved ones that are affected but also the lives of the people within the country to which we deploy those service personnel. Lastly, this debate also touches on the lives of people the world over who are at risk of terrorist activities. That encompasses so many people in so many countries which have a cultural outlook and a level of freedom and development much like our own.
Decisions that impact on lives and threaten lives cannot and should never be taken lightly, and that is why I join with others in welcoming the discussion of these matters in this place. It is helpful at this juncture after many years of conflict in Afghanistan—longer than other military operations that Australia has been involved in—for us to ensure that the commitment of this parliament is resolute behind the mission, that there is a strong bipartisan unity behind the mission our troops are undertaking and that we send a clear signal to the people of Afghanistan, to our allies and to others that we are there to see the job through.
In addition to its being a serious debate because of the impact of the conflict on the lives of so many people, this is equally a serious debate because of its impact on our international relations and the development of the world as a whole and Afghanistan in particular, which is the country that we are talking about. This discussion is about not just the impact of the war on our relations with Afghanistan but also the development of and changes in Afghanistan, topics which I will return to shortly. As with Afghanistan, we need to ensure that Pakistan, which has seen increasing terrorist activity over the years of our engagement in Afghanistan and which is a nuclear state, does not become the type of safe haven for terrorists that we have been working against in Afghanistan. There is also the question of our relations with our coalition partners—our traditional allies and friends as fellow nations of the free world with whom we have built lasting relationships. We rely upon them and expect them to be there to work with and defend us in times of need, and they rightly and reasonably expect that we will be there to work with and help defend them in their hour of need.
Australia has played a serious role in the conflict in Afghanistan from day one. We are currently the 11th largest force in the country. That is perhaps misunderstood. Many people believe, perhaps as a result of the composition of the coalition of the willing that engaged in the Iraq conflict, that Australia is a standout contributor in Afghanistan. It is true that we are a standout contributor, but it is also true that we are one of many standout contributors. We are the largest non-NATO force in Afghanistan. However, we need to note that there are not merely one or two but 10 other countries with a larger troop presence in Afghanistan than ours, and there are many other countries with a smaller presence. This is a truly multinational force working, we hope, towards a very positive end to this conflict.
Currently we have 1,550 personnel or thereabouts serving in Afghanistan, playing a leading role in security in the Oruzgan province in particular—long a Taliban heartland. It is an area that is at the centre of reforming Afghanistan, the centre of where we need to succeed if we are to have a positive impact in the long run. Our involvement has not been an easy one, not an easy one at all. Our role there, our remit, the partner countries we have worked with and the provinces we have worked within have at times changed over the course of our involvement since 2001. The level of our deployment has fluctuated, so we have seen variations to the extent of our commitment and involvement. But it is true to say that throughout that time the overwhelming spirit of the commitment by Australia to Afghanistan has been a strong one.
It has also not been easy because we have had casualties. More than 150 of our personnel have suffered injuries, some of them quite serious. And, as has been mentioned by probably all members and senators in this debate, 21 of our servicemen have paid the ultimate sacrifice in the name of Australia as part of our army. They follow in the path of many before them who have paid that sacrifice in other conflicts defending Australia’s way of life and our hopes for the future.
It is not just those immediately obvious casualties that we need to reflect upon. There will also be challenges in casualties for years to come with regard to mental health that Australia needs to be conscious of. It will not just be the commitment of this government or the next government to the Afghanistan conflict that will be important; it will be the commitment of many more governments to come to care for and ensure the protection and rights of the personnel who have served there and served our country with such honour and distinction.
Overall, I believe Australians do have much to be proud of for our involvement there. I will return to some of the achievements on the ground in Afghanistan, but I think most importantly we in this place need to reflect on the outstanding service of those men and women whom we have sent to Afghanistan over this time. Australians in uniform have gone there and there are many others who have worked alongside them from other countries, as well as non-uniform personnel and those from non-government organisations. They have all been working towards a better Afghanistan, a safer Afghanistan and a safer world as a result.
Importantly, at the heart of this debate are questions. Why are we there? Should we still be there? Should we stay there? When will the job be done? These are not easy questions, and I am not someone who approaches them, particularly the question of when the job will be done, like I somehow have the wisdom of Solomon. There will always be elements of judgement in this, and it is judgement best exercised by our military commanders, by the leadership of Afghanistan, by our own political leadership here in Australia and by our allies through NATO and throughout the rest of the world.
But why we are there is in many ways easy to answer. You can put it down to a one-word answer, if you want, and that one word is ‘terrorism’. It is an evil scourge of extremist, fundamentalist-driven terrorism. I think back to September 11, 2001. I know that people of my parents’ generation would say that one of the defining moments of their lives where time stood still and they forever remembered where they were was when they heard of the assassination of President Kennedy. For my generation one of those defining moments will forever be where we were when we heard of the attacks on the World Trade Centre and the attacks of September 11, 2001. I was living in this fair city, not far from this building, at that time and I remember the night vividly, I remember the very little sleep that I got that night as the true horror of what was occurring unfolded. We should remember that night and the other terrorist instances when we come to this debate. We must remember why it is we went there in the first place and what it is that we are trying to prevent from happening again. Those terrorist attacks, and others, brought a new form of warfare to the world, a brutal warfare. It was brutal in particular because it was so random in its attacks and who it struck and where it struck. It could be anyone anywhere. In particular, they were attacks aimed at striking at our way of life. That is the summary. The interest of the terrorists is to attack our way of life in countries like Australia and those of our allies around the world.
People found that they could be threatened anywhere at any time, whether it was sitting at a desk in their offices in New York, enjoying a nightclub visit in Bali, travelling on the London Underground, turning up to work at the Australian Embassy in Jakarta or simply berthing a ship in Sudan. Australians and those people from our allied nations found real threats to life day after day after day that were totally random as a result of these terrorist organisations, and the terrorism grew out of a fundamentalism that was encouraged and fostered in Afghanistan.
It grew out of that fundamentalism of al-Qaeda. It was a direct result of the support of the Taliban, in Afghanistan, that allowed terrorists to flourish and to undertake some of these atrocities. Not only did the Taliban promote violence to the rest of the world but we should also never forget that in their own country, Afghanistan, they were a repressive regime with a terrible record against their own people. This was a regime of violence and oppression. It was a regime that I do not think anybody in this place would stand up for—neither the fundamentalist views they sought to impose nor the way they went about trying to impose them.
It is for the sake of our own security and for the security of the world—and hopefully for the security of and a better life for the Afghan people—that we came to be in Afghanistan; that we came to be part of this conflict. Our goal must be to ensure that Afghanistan does not return to being such a safe haven for terrorists in the future.
When will our time there be done? I do not know. Others in this debate have speculated. Some have called for it to be immediate. To me, it is quite clear that Afghanistan is not ready for our immediate withdrawal. To me, it is quite clear that fixing a specific time frame right now is unlikely to help—because the only message that sends to the terrorists is that if you wait then you will win.
We need to ensure that we leave Afghanistan in a condition where it is best placed to fend for itself. It may not be left as the type of country that we would aspire to live in, or that we would aspire for Australia, but at least it may be left as a country with a relative level of security, with a relatively stable government, with a capacity to function and to have functioning internal systems and, of course, with a strong internal security force that is committed to the stability of the country and to ensuring law abidance within that country. I would hope that we are leaving Afghanistan as a place that is no longer a haven for terrorists, where it can no longer feed the type of terrorist activity that spawned those attacks of 11 September or the various other terrorist attacks.
That is why Australia’s military operations are so committed to delivering the type of training and support in Afghanistan that will leave individuals and communities better equipped to look after themselves into the future—the type of country about which I just spoke. That is why we have ploughed resources in targeted province-by-province localities, as an international force—ensuring that each province is ideally slowly but surely transitioned to one of self-sufficiency. In doing so, we can transition the entire country. It will never be perfect. I suspect that we will have many doubts about the type of government and some of the decisions of government in Afghanistan for many years to come. But we are looking to leave a country that is no longer a threat to the world and, ideally, no longer a threat to itself.
My leader in the other place, Mr Abbott, spoke about what type of progress had to be achieved in this debate, and his words were that progress has to be made family by family, village by village and district by district. Those words are right. They are right not just in a military sense but also in a sense of building a civic society and in the sense of providing the types of humanitarian advancements that we aspire to see throughout developing countries.
Senator Hanson-Young, in contributing to this debate, highlighted a number of human rights issues. She highlighted a number of concerns about aid. Let me say that I agree with those concerns, but I expect them to be exercised in a markedly different way. I expect them to actually be supported by our military. I want to see our military supporting humanitarian outcomes. I want to see greater aid funding. I want to see that aid funding working to an outcome to support the entire Afghan population.

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2010-10-26,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I note the very good success of Medibank Private during this period, and I want to pay a compliment to and congratulate the management—to George Savvides and his team; to those who are involved in making that success possible. Based on my understanding of the report, and perusing the details, it appears that Medibank Private has announced a net profit of $380 million for that financial year—four times the previous year’s profit. That is a good result. Member benefit payments totalled $3.75 billion. Membership covered 3.479 million Australians. Eighty-six per cent of members used their insurance cover to claim for ancillary benefits: dental, optical, physiotherapy et cetera. There are ancillary claims totalling $752 million. You can see the benefits of private health insurance in this report, quite clearly. The market share reported was some 28.7 per cent of the total market and the last premium increase, announced in February 2010, saw premiums increase 5.74 per cent, which was just below the average for the industry at 5.8 per cent.
Speaking to the report gives me another opportunity to highlight my view and the view of the coalition that this should be sold. I expressed these views many years ago—in fact, on 4 August 2005, in an opinion piece in the Mercury newspaper and also in the Australian Financial Review on 3 August 2005, indicating that it made no sense for the Australian government to own Australia’s largest private health fund. Of course, that was coalition policy prior to the last election for very good reason. Joe Hockey has espoused those reasons and released the economic action plan for the coalition at the time. The No. 1 economic priority was to get Labor’s debt down and under control as quickly as possible. And the proceeds from the sale of Medibank Private would be quarantined for paying off Labor’s debt. It made a lot of sense then, it made a lot of sense in 2005 and it still makes a lot of sense now.
I note that, according to the annual report, it has paid an interim dividend of $32 million for the three-month period ending December 2009, and in addition the annual report advised that a final dividend payment of $48.3 million was recommended by the directors to be paid. Well, frankly, in terms of the taxpayer, that is still not good enough. Taxpayers deserve better and it is in the interests of the public and the taxpayer that it be sold. It is obviously performing very well under the good stewardship and management of Mr George Savvides and his team. As I said, they should be congratulated for what they have done.
This is clearly a policy decision. It is not a matter for the management of Medibank Private, but I do want to congratulate them and thank them for their initiatives in promoting healthy lifestyles. They have a range of initiatives to help the community address the obesity epidemic, tobacco and alcohol concerns and to promote prevention measures. That is fantastic. Congratulations! Well done. Obviously, over time—the short-, medium- and long-term—it is to the benefit of not only Medibank Private but also Australia that those initiatives are undertaken and implemented. I congratulate Mr Savvides and his team for that and look forward to working with them in pursuing and supporting those particular initiatives.
I made that call about privatisation in 2005. I make it again. It is a meritorious one that should be seriously considered to get our debt under control, and it is in the interests of the Australian taxpayer. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2010-10-26,"—I doubt anyone in this chamber would disagree with me if I said that the role of Australian schools in preparing children for their lives as adults goes beyond simply teaching skills and imparting knowledge. Sure, we want our high school graduates to be able to secure a job and to learn life skills, but we also want them to have a sense of philanthropy and to want to make a difference in the lives of those less fortunate than themselves. As well as learning facts and skills, school is also a place for learning values.
Great values are learnt by helping students to develop an awareness of how their actions positively impact on the environment and society at a local, national and global level. What better way to develop this awareness than to produce an educational toolkit for public schools, non-profit organisations and government funded community agencies that enables young people to become active citizens and lead social change.
The Foundation for Young Australians, an organisation which aims to empower young Australians to be ‘successful learners and creative, active and valued citizens’ has done just that with a program called ruMAD? ruMAD? stands for ‘are you making a difference?’ I guess it appeals to young people to abbreviate phrases like this, especially when you consider the way text-speak is pervading our culture. There are four different programs or levels of ‘MADness’ that a school or organisation can implement with the program. They could organise a MAD day, where the students take on a one-day activity that gets everyone thinking about making a difference. They could organise a MAD project, a longer term commitment that involves detailed research, planning and involvement. They could establish a MAD foundation to raise funds for a cause and donate those funds to a local community organisation. Students could become ruMAD? youth ambassadors. Students celebrate their achievements through ruMAD? at an annual Youth Action Conference and learn about being an ambassador for community action.
Conferences have been held in the north and south of Tasmania over the past two years and hundreds of students have attended. A fifth level of MADness—ruMAD? social enterprise—is soon to be added to the list. Since the inception of the program, over 50,000 young people in 150 schools around Australia have participated. I am very pleased to say that 12,500 of these students, or one quarter, have been from my home state of Tasmania. In fact, last year 32 Tasmanian schools participated.
The success of the program in Tasmania is a testament to the dedication of a local organisation, the Tasmanian Centre for Global Learning. The program is primarily funded through the Tasmanian government’s Tasmanian Community Fund, but there are a number of other organisations, including local councils and government departments, that also contribute funding. The centre provides professional development; curriculum materials; a global learning resource library; a ruMAD? school coordinator, education officer and program manager; and also helps network with other organisations working for a fairer world, including Amnesty, Anglicare and World Vision to name just a few.
Three schools in Tasmania—Rokeby High School, Queechy High School and Gagebrook Primary School—have taken a lead in running the program by providing dedicated ruMAD? teachers for one day a week. I was pleased to have the opportunity to attend the expo session of this year’s ruMAD? Youth Action Conference in late August at Rokeby High School. While there was an extensive program for the conference, the expo was the opportunity for the schools to exhibit their projects to invited guests and members of the public. Some 180 students from 16 schools participated in the conference, and they had clearly put a lot of work into their projects and their exhibits.
One of the great things about the ruMAD? program is the amount of direction and planning that comes from the students themselves. The students had the opportunity to choose their own projects, and I could tell from their excitement that they were not only proud of their projects but had a genuine and passionate commitment to the causes they had chosen. East Derwent Primary School had been raising funds and awareness to help save the Tasmanian devil, a native marsupial that is currently at risk of extinction from a facial tumour disease that has spread rapidly throughout its population. Two of their fundraising initiatives included selling chocolates and holding a car wash.
Cambridge Primary School had chosen a cause closer to home—connecting with the elderly. A couple of weeks after I had attended the expo, I had the opportunity to visit Cambridge Primary School to attend an assembly that was dedicated to showcasing the results of their project. The students had put together gift bags for elderly people. These included useful information for seniors such as bus timetables and concession guides. They collected recipes and collated a recipe book, which was sold to raise funds, the proceeds of which were used to purchase board games and DVDs to donate to Ningana Nursing Home in Sorell.
Other issues that featured at the expo included child rights and global poverty, environmental sustainability and water conservation. The other participating schools included Cygnet Primary, Huonville Primary, Clarendon Vale Primary, Herdsmans Cove Primary, Gagebrook Primary, Rosetta Primary, Lenah Valley Primary, Rokeby High, Geilston Bay High, New Town High, Kingston High, Dover District High, Tarremah Steiner School and Campania School. I thank Rokeby High School for the invitation and the opportunity to hear directly from students learning valuable lessons about social action.
Since the conference, Rokeby High School have organised a major concert, securing Australia’s Got Talent winners Justice Crew as the headline act. The funds raised from the concert, titled Concert 4 Cambodia, have been used to support the Tabitha Foundation, a not-for-profit organisation that conducts development, education and housing programs in Cambodia.
I would like to conclude by acknowledging a few people for their role in making ruMAD? a success in Tasmania. First of all I wish to thank and congratulate Helen Hortle, Jeremy Picone and Karen Reid from the Tasmanian Centre for Global Learning for their stewardship of the program. I would also like to thank teacher Emma Christian, who, after coordinating the program at Rokeby High School, helped to roll it out to other schools and took a lead role in organising the ruMAD? conference. Her involvement in ruMAD?—amongst other important contributions to the school community—has earned her the 2010 Pride of Australia Inspiration Medal, an award that is well deserved. I would like to acknowledge and thank all the other teaching staff and volunteers who have assisted with ruMAD? throughout the state.
Finally, I will acknowledge the most important people of all: the thousands of schoolchildren who have worked hard on their respective ruMAD? projects. I hope ruMAD? has inspired you to continue making a positive contribution to your community, even after you finish your involvement in the program. I am impressed by the dedication, the consideration and the imagination that you have put into your projects. Your efforts to make the world a better place set a great example for the rest of us. While there is still poverty in the world, while there are still people living in isolation, while threats still exist to our sustainability and natural environment, it is incumbent upon each of us to ask ourselves and those around us: ‘Are you making a difference?’",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Schools</title>,Adjournment,24,1,speech
