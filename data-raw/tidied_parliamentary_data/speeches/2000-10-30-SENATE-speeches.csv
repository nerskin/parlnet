"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-10-30,"—I would like to have an indication from the government as to where that places the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Bill 2000, which was due to be the first item for discussion today. I am particularly concerned about this bill, as is my constituency. I understand there has been some movement in regard to support for that bill by various senators. It is important for the Senate to know what the new scheduling is. On the weekend I was at a public meeting in Brisbane where there was very strong support for removing from that bill the component which would allow native woodlands to be used to produce so-called renewable energy, and there is a big campaign against that in Tasmania. I am glad that there has been a delay, although I think it is not for reasons that are in the interests of those who want to conserve forests and woodlands. This will give the Labor Party in particular the opportunity to support my amendment which I will flag now, and I hope the Labor Party will insist on the Senate not backing down on the amendments which went to the House and were rejected there. My amendment will remove native forests and woodlands from the legislation insofar as they would be able to be woodchipped, burnt and turned into so-called renewable power.
I know the legislation is going to come before us very shortly because the government wants to have that legislation when it goes to the COP6 conference in The Hague in the Netherlands in just nine days. So the government will be wanting to pass the legislation. With my ear to the ground, I hear that the government is even prepared to accept the Senate amendments. Unfortunately, in this discussion that is going on about the rescheduling of that legislation, senators are not aware of the situation regarding the Labor Party and its support for the government's woodchipping provisions, the Democrats' support for the legislation or indeed what other amendments the government might be looking at or might see fit to reject. I would like an indication from the government as to when that legislation is being rescheduled so we can make sure we have an informed ability to look at the amendments and what the government's new position may be regarding the rejection of the amendments by the House of Representatives.

"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-10-30,"—I move Democrat amendment No. 1:
(1)	Schedule 1, page 3 (after line 4), before item 1, insert:
1A  Section 8 (at the end of the definition of government or political matters)
Add “but does not include communications or conduct relating to the fundraising activities of political parties”.
This amendment would ban tobacco advertising at political fundraising events. The Democrats believe it is totally inappropriate that any political party accept donations or sponsorships from the tobacco industry. The evidence is that donations are buying the tobacco industry time—eight years at least. I think in the eyes of the general public the tobacco industry has been completely discredited. There is overwhelming evidence that tobacco companies knew from their own research that tobacco use caused heart disease and cancer yet hid from the results of this research while promoting tobacco as a healthy product. They even paid doctors to appear in advertisements, reassuring the public that tobacco use was safe. 
The government does not seem to share the views of the majority of the population that the tobacco industry is not to be trusted. In fact, the coalition regularly accepts donations from tobacco industry organisations. We all remember that Philip Morris sponsored the Liberal Party's national conference dinner two years ago and in that same year donated an additional $86,400 to the party. I am pleased to say the Democrats have never accepted donations from the tobacco industry. We believe that accepting financial support from an industry that is responsible for millions of deaths worldwide is morally reprehensible. Unfortunately, we are not able to amend this bill to prohibit donations and sponsorships of political parties by tobacco companies, but this amendment prohibits advertising in association with a political fundraising event. So it is my hope that the coalition and the Labor Party will go further than this and in future refuse all donations from tobacco companies. I have no doubt that the general public would strongly support that stand.",SENATE,<title>TOBACCO ADVERTISING PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-10-30,"—Labor will be opposing this amendment moved by the Democrats. It is not that we disagree with their objective; it is a question of whether or not we think it is effective. We have spoken against political events being used for the promotion of a cigarette company or its messages, as occurred most famously with the Philip Morris sponsorship of the Liberal Party dinner recently. Tobacco advertisements are legal except where an exemption applies under this act. A political party should be treated no differently from any others in regard to tobacco advertisements. However, the amendment being put forward does not appear to be effective in achieving this goal. It also appears to be in breach of the High Court decision in the 1997 case of Lange v. Australian Broadcasting Corporation. 
I think the essence of the Democrat amendment is that it changes the definition of what is a government or political matter by excluding communications or conduct relating to the fundraising activities of political parties. Section 9(1A) provides a limited exception covering the defined government and political matters provided they are not an advertisement which promotes smoking in general or a particular brand or range of brands of tobacco products. The reason for this exception being included in the original act was to ensure that free speech prevails. Governments and political parties are not restricted from having debates or talking about these issues, provided they do not amount to either the promotion of a particular range of tobacco products or the promotion of smoking itself. To add the words proposed by the Democrats to the definition does not have the effect of preventing sponsorships and it may have unintended consequences. I hate arguing on that particular line because that is usually what the government uses for anything it wishes to oppose, but I think there is concern about the Democrat amendment which I understand the government shares. 
An example of a consequence of the Democrat amendment could be that the Australian Electoral Commission might be prevented from publicly reporting donations by tobacco companies to political parties because the publication of those names would come within the definition of an advertisement of conduct relating to fundraising. The Labor Party believes that all such donations should be publicly disclosed and hence cannot support the amendment in its current form. Likewise, the exclusion of any conduct, including fundraising, is not limited to conduct relating to fundraising from tobacco companies. Hence, a forum which has some fundraising element would lose the protection of being a political matter and a discussion of tobacco policy would no longer be protected.  
For these reasons the opposition is unable to support the Democrat amendment, though broadly supports the objective. Senators would be aware that Labor has circulated an alternative amendment which closes this loophole to the extent that this can be done, while dealing with the concern about the constitutional right to free speech. Some concerns were expressed by the government about that attempt as well. We recently revised that, and I think that has recently been circulated in the chamber. We will be moving that amendment as our attempt to meet the objective of the Democrats but which we think will be a better way of getting there. So we will be opposing the Democrat amendment but, as I say, hoping to pick up most of the objective they express in our amendment, which I will move next.",SENATE,<title>TOBACCO ADVERTISING PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-10-30,"—The government does not accept this amendment by the Democrats. It obscures the intent of this major piece of public health legislation and opens up a debate that is entirely tangential to its core concern. The legislation is about limiting the exposure of the public to measures and images that favourably market cigarettes and portray smoking in a way that may persuade them to start smoking or continue smoking or to use or continue to use tobacco products. The object of the act is to improve public health. It is ludicrous to suggest we stop citizens and corporate Australia making contributions to public causes such as political parties and charities via this bill. Sponsorship of this nature is well beyond the scope of the bill and any controls over it are catered for in other ways and other avenues. The matter of political parties accepting funds from business is a matter for the party executive. Accepting this amendment to the act could see the ludicrous situation of the Commonwealth prosecuting a political party, which may be the government of the day, for accepting sponsorship from a tobacco company. 
On the international stage, Australia is a world leader in tobacco control. In June 1999, the Commonwealth and all states and territories endorsed a National Tobacco Strategy. The strategy provides a framework for all jurisdictions, including the Commonwealth, to develop their own action plans for tobacco control. The strategy not only is the first attempt to coordinate tobacco control nationally but also places Australia among a handful of countries globally who can say they have tobacco control strategies that reflect all those interventions deemed by the World Health Organisation as best practice. 
The government is committed to maintaining, and improving on, Australia's excellent track record in tobacco control by consistently implementing new initiatives. In 1998, the European Parliament voted for a ban on tobacco advertising, including a ban to be placed on sponsorship advertising of events or activities organised at an international level. This bill is consistent with the decision made by the European Parliament and introduces the same time frames for introducing these bans. The phase-out of all tobacco advertising in Australia also represents a major contribution to the National Tobacco Strategy and, in particular, the Commonwealth's commitments under this strategy. 
Under this bill there will be no tobacco advertising at any sporting or cultural event after 1 October 2006 under any circumstances. There is to be a phase-out period between 1 October 2000 and 1 October 2006. With the passage of this bill, any event that has not previously received an exemption before 1 October 2000 will not be able to apply for an exemption under section 18. Events that have previously received an exemption may continue to apply, but they will receive no expansion on the advertising permitted, and it is our intention that advertising be progressively restricted. It should be noted that, where exemptions are given, they are very prescriptive as to the amount, the size and the placement of any advertising. These exemptions are then monitored by officers from the Department of Health and Aged Care, and any infringements jeopardise future exemptions. 
Amendment not agreed to.",SENATE,<title>TOBACCO ADVERTISING PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-10-30,"—I move:
(1)	Schedule 1, page 3 (after line 4), before item 1, insert:
1A  Subsections 9(1A) and (1B)
Repeal the subsections, substitute:
Exception—political discourse
	(1A)	To remove any doubt, it is declared that if:
	(a)	something (the advertisement) does not promote, and is not intended to promote: 
	(i)	any particular tobacco product; or
	(ii)	a particular range of tobacco products; or
	(iii)	a manufacturer of tobacco products; or
	(iv)	a tobacco trademark; and 
	(b)	the advertisement does not promote, and is not intended to promote, smoking; and 
	(c)	the advertisement relates solely to government or political matters; 
the advertisement is not a tobacco advertisement for the purposes of this Act.
Political comment by a manufacturer etc.
	(1B)	Without limiting the scope of subsection (1A), the use by a manufacturer of its own name in an advertisement or publication is not a tobacco advertisement for the purposes of this Act where:
	(a)	the advertisement or publication is for the purpose of the manufacturer participating in government or political matters; and
	(b)	the advertisement does not promote, and is not intended to promote, smoking.
As you have indicated, Mr Chairman, this is a revised amendment being a redrafted version of an amendment moved by the opposition. The original amendment was redrafted after the government expressed some concerns about its potential to interfere with decisions regarding the right to free speech et cetera. We think this amendment achieves the objective of ending the loophole that has allowed the Liberal Party to provide advertisements for Philip Morris as part of a dinner sponsorship arrangement. The exception currently refers only to the name of a tobacco product or a range of tobacco products and explicitly allows for advertisements, including the name of a manufacturer, to continue. Although Philip Morris manufacture other products, I think all Australians know that their name is synonymous with cigarette products and this arrangement is viewed publicly as tobacco sponsorship.
Turning to the root of the problem, the opposition is keen to end the loophole that allows continuing sponsorship of political events because of the current wording of this section. The Philip Morris sponsorship of the Liberal Party function is not prohibited because, in that case, the Liberal Party has been promoting the name of the manufacturer. The general prohibitions on advertising in this bill include the names of manufacturers and trademarks, but the exception for political matters is narrower because it applies only to the names of tobacco products. The exception in subsection 9(1A) allows political comment in circumstances where a manufacturer's name or a trademark is displayed but not where a range of tobacco products is mentioned. This point is made clearly in subsection 9(1B), which says explicitly that a manufacturer's name does not of itself constitute promotion of a tobacco product. 
The opposition believes this is a loophole that has been exploited to allow advertising in conjunction with Liberal Party events, and it is appropriate that this loophole be closed. The amendment that I circulated the last time this bill was debated was intended to achieve that outcome, but, as I have said, the Crown Solicitor concluded that the draft amendment was flawed by the same argument concerning free speech established in the case of Lange. Freedom of speech to discuss the tobacco issue must be maintained in a democracy. However, this should not extend to an exemption for political parties to advertise and promote tobacco products or the names of tobacco manufacturers or trademarks when everyone else is barred from doing so. Therefore, the opposition is moving the revised amendment to have this effect, which we believe will retain the free speech rights of tobacco manufacturers without permitting advertising by a third party. The new amend-ment allows a tobacco company to advertise its views about issues in its own name, provided that this does not amount to a promotion of smoking or of particular tobacco products. 
A recent relevant example is the new laws controlling the illegal production and sale of tobacco. Another example could be advertisements to enforce the rules concerning the sale of tobacco to minors. Participation by tobacco companies in mainstream political life should not be curtailed unreasonably, and the opposition's amendment will preserve their right to free speech. However, it will stop advertising by others on behalf of the tobacco manufacturers as part of a sponsorship arrangement. It will no longer be possible for a political party to advertise on behalf of a tobacco company and promote the name of donors. This will ensure that political parties and all other organisations are put on the same footing. I therefore urge senators to support the amendment.",SENATE,<title>TOBACCO ADVERTISING PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-10-30,"—The Australian Democrats support the opposition's amendment, which restricts the advertising of tobacco products in association with political activity. It will allow tobacco companies to use their own names in political discourse—for example, in lobbying the government on issues such as the illegal sale of tobacco—but it prohibits a tobacco company from paying another organisation or agent to use its name or trademark in political discourse. This would prohibit the use of political donations and sponsorships to gain publicity or to promote a tobacco company. The Democrats appreciate that there may be some legitimate reasons why a tobacco company needs to enter into political discourse and debate on topics such as underage smoking or illegal tobacco sales. However, we cannot see any justification for allowing tobacco companies to use political discourse to promote either themselves or their products.
Having said that, I understand that the government has some problems with subsection (1B) so we will listen to what the parliamentary secretary has to say about that. We have a suggested amendment to (1B) that may solve the problem. I wonder whether the parliamentary secretary could explain that issue.",SENATE,<title>TOBACCO ADVERTISING PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-10-30,"—This is a very important issue that requires careful consideration. As the committee will be aware, during previous consideration of this bill before the parliamentary recess, the Labor Party distributed a form of amendment different from that which has been circulated today. We had difficulty with the previous amendment because the Australian Government Solicitor advised: 
The effect of the ALP amendments to the Bill would be to severely restrict the range of communications that could be made by a tobacco company without offending the provisions of the Act. In our opinion, there is a significant risk that those amendments would not satisfy the tests for the validity of a law on the grounds of freedom of political communication which has been identified by the High Court in Lange versus the Australian Broadcasting Corporation 1997, 189CLR520 at page 567. Therefore, we consider that it is highly likely that the High Court could consider the ALP amendments to the bill to be beyond constitutional power.
I note that the opposition has brought forward a separate amendment in the form that has been circulated today. Can I indicate that the government could accept the proposed amendments to section 9(1A). However, the government opposes the opposition amendment to section 9(1B). If amended in this form, section 9(1B) could enable tobacco manufacturers to form a commercial alliance and create the necessary elements for a High Court challenge to the constitutional validity of the act. The opposition amendment would prevent that alliance from publishing a purely political advertisement which included the name of a tobacco manufacturer. The amendment would allow a manufacturer to use its own name in a political advertisement—for example, the recent BATA ads in national newspapers opposing chop chop tobacco. But a third party, such as a commercial alliance of tobacco manufacturers, would not be able to publish the same advertisement with reference to the BATA in the advertisement. Therefore, we indicate that we cannot support the amendment as a whole. 
I would put to the Senate, either to the opposition or to the Democrats, that it may therefore be more appropriate to split this amendment, as proposed, and deal with it in two sections—that is, (1A) and (1B). I note that Senator Allison said she was perhaps open to persuasion on this matter. I would ask her very seriously to consider those longer term implications in that regard and perhaps indicate whether she would be prepared to support the government in having the legislation split into two parts.",SENATE,<title>TOBACCO ADVERTISING PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-10-30,"—Splitting is one option, Minister, but I have an amendment, which I have now circulated, which I understand will solve that problem. So it could be that we could deal with both of them together, provided that that amendment is acceptable.",SENATE,<title>TOBACCO ADVERTISING PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-10-30,"—The words proposed by the Democrats, as I understand it—let me just clear this with Senator Allison—on the amendment as circulated by the ALP would read in the first line of (1B) `Without limiting the scope of subsection (1A), the use' and then there would be a deletion of the remainder of the words on that line and a substitution with the words `are of a manufacturer's name'; those words would be inserted on that particular line. I indicate that the government would be agreeable to accepting that amendment.
 (Senator Chapman)—Senator Allison, you may care to move that as an amendment to Senator Evans's amendment.",SENATE,<title>TOBACCO ADVERTISING PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-10-30,"—Yes, thank you, Chair. I move:
Paragraph (1B), omit “by a manufacturer of its own name”, insert “of a manufacturer's name”.",SENATE,<title>TOBACCO ADVERTISING PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-10-30,"—Perhaps I could ask the Democrats to pause and think about what the impact of that amendment is. As I understand it, that is very similar to what is currently in the act. It might well have the effect of defeating the purpose that we set ourselves. I am confirmed in that thought by the readiness with which the government agreed to the proposition. That is always a good sign of one perhaps having undone oneself.
I wonder whether, Senator Allison, we might be better off meeting the only substantive argument that the government has made. That would be by including after the words `the use by a manufacturer' the words `or group of manufacturers of its own name in advertisement or publication'. The government's argument is that there is a legal possibility of a group of manufacturers being able to argue that its right to free speech has been contravened. I wonder whether that is not a better way of our seeking to overcome that objection. I am a bit concerned that the use of the words that you propose will effectively undermine the clause completely. As I say, it is difficult doing this on the run, but I wonder whether that might not be a better form of doing it.
Perhaps, Mr Chairman, with your indulgence, I might seek to amend my amendment by adding in (1B), after the words `the use by a manufacturer', a new set of words `or group of manufacturers'. Then that first line of (1B) would read `Without limiting the scope of subsection (1A), the use by a manufacturer or group of manufacturers of its own name in advertisement or publication' et cetera.
 (Senator Chapman)—Senator, at the moment we have an amendment to the amendment before the chair. You may care to foreshadow that as an amendment, subject to how this amendment is resolved.
—Certainly, Mr Chairman. I was just trying to facilitate the debate. I will move that amendment formally later, if that is the appropriate time. But I just wish to indicate to the Democrats that I think that might be a better way of reaching our joint objective. I was a bit concerned about the impact of their use of words, which I understand are the same as in the current act. ",SENATE,<title>TOBACCO ADVERTISING PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-10-30,—I think it would be useful at this stage to hear from the government about that proposal. It is difficult on the run to assess the impact of what might appear to be a minor change. I wonder whether we could just have an indication on that.,SENATE,<title>TOBACCO ADVERTISING PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-10-30,"—This is an important consideration. But I would point out to the Senate that any accusation of doing work on the run is rather inopportune and unfair, given that the ALP amendment was given to us this morning at 11.30 before our coming to this place. That was despite the fact that, during the last fortnight, there was plenty of opportunity for quite extensive consultation. In fact, I understand that comprehensive material was made available to the opposition during that period, including legal advice on this matter.
The government are still very reluctant to look at the amendment foreshadowed by Senator Evans for the inclusion of extra words in the area of acceptance of a group. I am advised that this would still provide too narrow an opportunity. It could, for example, involve action by a body such as the Pharmacy Guild, which would then be constrained in the type of advertising that it would and could have. That would be contrary to what we are seeking to achieve. Therefore, the government are not attracted to the foreshadowed amendment as proposed by Senator Evans but would certainly agree to the words that were originally proposed by Senator Allison.",SENATE,<title>TOBACCO ADVERTISING PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-10-30,"—As I understand it, the government are not inclined to support the amendment I have foreshadowed. As I have said to Senator Allison and the Democrats, our concern is that the wording of her amendment will effectively allow people to continue to use the manufacturer's name as part of sponsorship arrangements, and that will in fact defeat the purpose for which we are aiming. I would urge her not to go down that path and instead to support the foreshadowed amendment which I have indicated I will move if her amendment is defeated.",SENATE,<title>TOBACCO ADVERTISING PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-10-30,"—We will support the ALP's foreshadowed amendment, so I will withdraw this one. Can I say that I did not mean to suggest earlier that it was any fault of the government's in terms of this being a rather rushed decision. I am fully aware that this amendment was circulated at the last minute, so there was no criticism implied in what I said about the government. I seek leave to withdraw my amendment.
Leave granted.",SENATE,<title>TOBACCO ADVERTISING PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-10-30,"—I wish to formally amend my amendment by adding words after `without limiting the scope of subsection (1A)' so that it now reads:
Paragraph (1B), omit “of its own name”, insert “or a group of manufacturers of its own name or their own names”.
I also indicate that I do not wish to get into an argument with Senator Tambling about the timing of the amendments. I was just saying that we were making amendments on the run. I can see that the government has been tick-tacking with us on these issues and we have been trying to get an outcome, but I think there is a genuine difference of opinion in some of this. I must say for the record that in the health area we do have a better level of cooperation about amendments, even if we do not agree in the end. I do not think these arguments about who did what and when are really all that relevant to it. We have been trying to get to the nub of the problem. I think there is a difference of view on the importance of this measure. Anyway, in order to try to meet the government's amendments, I formally amend the Labor Party amendment.",SENATE,<title>TOBACCO ADVERTISING PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-10-30,"—I must indicate that the government do not accept the amendment proposed by Senator Evans, and I think we must go to the core of the argument and the core of the bill. We are seeking in this act to ensure that we protect the act as a whole from any possible challenge. I would remind the Senate that this legislation is about prohibiting advertising at sporting and cultural events. The amendments that we have been getting caught up in relate to political involvement, political advertising and political disclosure, which I would argue are much more appropriately dealt with in other legislation, in other places and at other times. In effect, the Labor Party amendment would jeopardise the entire intent of this legislation, and it would be a pity. As I indicated in the earlier debate, the proposal that is put forward by Senator Evans is now fraught with considerable difficulty. I indicated that groups like the Pharmacy Guild could become involved. Similarly, a group of manufacturers could easily collude in such a way as to form a $2 company as a result of what the opposition are seeking to do here, and it would totally frustrate the entire intent of everything that is proposed. There is no way that the government can accept this amendment. 
Question put:
That the amendment (Senator Chris Evans's) be agreed to.",SENATE,<title>TOBACCO ADVERTISING PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-10-30,"—I move Democrat amendment No. 2:
(2)	Schedule 1, page 3 (after line 23), at the end of the Schedule, add:
2  After subsection 18(3)
Insert:
	(3A)	Conditions specified under subsection (3) must not permit the use of tobacco advertising signs (within the meaning of subsection 22(3)) at an event held on or after 1 October 2002.
This amendment brings forward the phasing out of tobacco advertising and bans fixed signage after 1 October 2002. This would significantly reduce the advertising at events after this time and send a clear message to the rest of the world that Australia does not support tobacco advertising. The Democrats do not believe that the government is committed to reducing tobacco advertising as quickly as possible. We believe Australia should be leading the world in banning tobacco advertising rather than just following passively behind other countries, such as those in the European Union. We do not need to wait until other countries have banned tobacco advertising before we do so, in our view. Australia should be taking a strong stance against the promotion of tobacco products and ensuring that it does everything it can to restrict the promotion of tobacco. Of course, the Democrats would prefer a complete ban on tobacco advertising in all its forms, but we recognise that this can be difficult in some cases—for example, where equipment such as cars and yachts is brought from other countries for events. However, in the case of fixed signs that are made specifically for the Australian event, we believe that an earlier phase-out is appropriate. ",SENATE,<title>TOBACCO ADVERTISING PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-10-30,"—I rise on behalf of the opposition to express our opposition to this amendment. I apologise to Senator Allison; I feel a bit churlish for not supporting her amendments. But the effect of this amendment would be to prohibit all signs at an event approved under section 18 from 2002 because the term `signs' includes all forms of advertising at an event. This would effectively render meaningless the exemption provided by section 18 and, in effect, would bring forward the termination of all existing contracts from the year 2006 to the year 2002. Labor cannot support this measure because of the contractual commitments that exist for the remaining events. 
The basis of this legislation is to ensure that there will be an end to tobacco advertising by 2006, and Labor will stand by that position. I understand the intent of the amendment is that there should be some phase-down in signage in the lead-up to 2006. That is not the effect of the amendment because the definition of `signs' is broad and effectively includes all forms of advertising or promotion. I understand, however, that there are discussions going on to achieve some voluntary phase-out of signs on cars and uniforms prior to 2006 and that the Victorian government is investigating complaints that shops adjacent to the Grand Prix had advertising displays which breached the requirements of this act. 
If we take a broader perspective, the impact of the residual advertising undertaken with an exemption left for the remaining sporting events will be small and should diminish until we get to the point where existing contractual obligations expire and this avenue for tobacco promotion is closed permanently. The key front in the battle against tobacco has moved from sport to the point of sale where most states are now legislating to control the extent of advertising in shops. Most states are also taking action about smoking in public places and are acting to deter or restrict smoking in restaurants and pubs. We will therefore be opposing this amendment.",SENATE,<title>TOBACCO ADVERTISING PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-10-30,"—The government does not accept this amendment. By attempting to effectively ban tobacco sponsorship from 1 October 2002, this measure is not only impractical but puts at risk the very careful negotiation by the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Dr Wooldridge, and the goodwill he has garnered in support of the 1 October 2006 deadline. October 2006 was negotiated with event organisers to provide sufficient time to pursue alternative sponsorship arrangements and not put the event at risk because of the introduction of this legislation. 
As it stands, we have an achievable and sensible phase-out date negotiated and agreed with all parties. This will achieve our public health objective of closing the loop on the association of tobacco with sport while still managing to keep international events and the economic benefits they bring to Australia. To dramatically bring forward the phase-out date to this point would put at risk the goodwill which bodies such as the Federation Internationale d'Automobile have negotiated with the Australian government. To attempt to phase out tobacco advertising four years before the 1 October 2006 deadline would seriously jeopardise these events and affect event organisers' abilities to meet their obligations under international contracts. 
The 1 October 2006 date was set to be consistent with international practice, particularly with European Union directives which came into force on 6 July 1998 and which ban tobacco sponsorship advertising of events or activities organised at world level from 1 October 2006. Although this directive has been challenged and subsequently annulled as of 5 October 2000, the Director General of WHO, Dr Brundtland, has urged member states to redraft the tobacco advertising ban in accordance with the European court's indications. Dr Brundtland has also stated that the annulment is on technical and legal grounds and not on health grounds. 
Australia is the first country outside of Europe to successfully legislate to put in place a total ban on sponsorship by 2006. This builds on Australia's tobacco control leadership globally and spearheads our tobacco control effort. As section 22 of the act defines a tobacco advertising sign as `a sign that is or contains a tobacco advertisement', this would include not only track side signage but possibly any advertisements on the uniforms of drivers, competing vehicles, team personnel and team equipment, thereby probably rendering tobacco sponsorship worthless to the tobacco companies. 
I would draw Senator Allison's attention in particular to the front page of today's Herald Sun newspaper—that is, the news pictorial of Monday, 30 October—where the front-page lead story is `Thriller on the island', and the motorbike in question and the rider are suitably endowed with full advertising. In reality, the amount of track side signage has been reduced at all events. Track signage is not permitted at the Rally Australia and Indy 300 events. It is anticipated that the course signage at any future Ladies Masters Golf Tournament will be substantially reduced. In addition, the permitted track signage at the 2000 Motorcycle Grand Prix will be smaller than that permitted at previous Motorcycle Grand Prix events. Health warnings are required to accompany all tobacco advertising and to occupy at least 25 per cent of the total area of signs. With regard to the 2000 Rally Australia event, health warnings have been increased to occupy 50 per cent of the area devoted to the display of tobacco advertising. So I very strongly indicate that the government certainly does not accept this amendment.

Insert:
34A  Reports to Parliament
	(1)	As soon as practicable after each 31 December occurring after 1 January 2001, the Minister must cause to be prepared a report on:
	(a)	the number and nature of any contraventions of the Act occurring in the preceding 12 months; and
	(b)	action taken by the Minister or a Commonwealth agency in response to each contravention.
	(2)	A person who prepares a report under subsection (1) must give a copy to the Minister.
	(3)	The Minister must cause copies of the report to be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of that House after receiving it.
This amendment would require the government to table a report in the parliament once a year outlining any contraventions of the act that have occurred in the previous 12 months. We believe that tobacco advertising is an important community issue and that the general public have an interest in knowing how successful the current advertising restrictions are. It is an important accountability mechanism which will provide some scrutiny of the government's monitoring of advertising restrictions. It will also ensure that the parliament is made aware of any companies or organisations that breach the advertising restrictions. It is important to make this information as widely available as possible as this will create a disincentive for companies trying to breach the act as they will risk negative publicity. In my speech in the second reading debate, I went to some length to talk about the sorts of breaches that there have been in the past. It seems that governments have not taken those breaches seriously. We think this is an important amendment which will bring the matter to the fore and make it a matter for the parliament to have a report on.",SENATE,<title>TOBACCO ADVERTISING PROHIBITION AMENDMENT BILL 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1,speech

"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2000-10-30,"—The Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000 seeks to introduce competitive tendering of the telecommunications universal service obligation—or USO, as it is commonly known. Whilst the opposition supports competitive tendering trials on a local, regional or niche basis, there are a number of problems that arise from the way in which the government has sought to implement the pilot programs in this bill by making extensive changes to the universal service regime. The bill provides for the repeal of part 2 of the 1999 Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Act and substitutes a new part 2. The professed purpose of the changes is, according to the explanatory memorandum, to effect the government's decisions to (a) amend the universal service regime to improve its general operation, particularly in relation to contestability, costing and funding; (b) undertake two pilot schemes in regional Australia to trial the competitive supply of services under the USO; and (c) extend the funding base for the USO and digital data service obligation, DDSO, to include carriage service providers as well as carriers. Part 2 of the act imposes a universal service obligation on Telstra which ensures that standard telephone services, pay phones and prescribed carriage services are provided to all Australians on an equitable basis, irrespective of where their residence or business is located. The DDSO and payphone elements of the universal service regime will not be subject to competitive tendering. Part 2 of the act also provides the funding arrangements by telecommunication carriers of the cost for provision of the USO and DDSO.
The amendments contained in the bill envisage and facilitate significant changes to the delivery of the USO and DDSO which impact on the delivery of those services through most of Australia's landmass. The impact of these changes to the universal service regime on Australians living in regional, rural and remote areas is potentially far reaching. We all know that telecommunication service levels in country areas are inadequate. If we lacked proof before, evidence to the Besley inquiry has conclusively demonstrated that significant numbers of Telstra's country customers are receiving substandard service. As I said, the opposition supports the trial and evaluation of competitive tendering for the USO on a local, regional or niche basis. It is important to distinguish, however, a competitive tendering scheme which could further erode service levels—and I firmly believe this scheme has the potential—from a scheme which will support and ensure resultant improvements in service. The bill goes well beyond simply implementing the pilot projects for competitive tendering. In view of the considerable degree of uncertainty concerning the process of competitive tendering, it is critically important that the outcomes of the pilot programs are analysed in detail prior to the extension of competitive tendering beyond those pilot areas. For that matter, the pilots could be a dismal failure, and there would be nothing to prevent Telstra from pulling out of all areas where it presently is obligated to provide universal service. The scope of the bill is excessively broad, to the ultimate detriment of all Australians who depend on reliable telecommunication services of an adequate standard. 
The importance of the political context of the government's decision to introduce USO contestability is demonstrated by the way the government has sought to implement these pilots. The government's decision to pursue these amendments to the universal service regime has been made in the context of its unrelenting quest to privatise Telstra. Provision of the USO and DDSO is critical to continued access to communication services in regional, rural and remote Australia. The government's portrayal of competitive tendering as the answer to declining service levels and as an argument in favour of the full privatisation of Telstra is nothing short of misleading. The contention that competitive tendering of the universal service obligation is the solution to the inadequacy of service levels outside metropolitan areas is unsubstantiated. The government is deceiving country customers into believing that this is the solution to all their problems in a desperate attempt to quell widespread public opposition to the full sale of Telstra. There are serious doubts whether competitive tendering is the answer to declining service levels, and the time frame for the trials and their analysis precludes any rational justification of full privatisation in this way.
Furthermore, the bill looks beyond the trials and empowers the minister to relieve Telstra of its obligations to provide loss making universal services by declaring another carrier as primary universal service provider, or PUSP. The legislation permits full contestability of the USO without any requirement for analysis or success of the pilot schemes prior to the commencement of Australia-wide competitive tendering. The opposition believes that it is critically important that the trials be subject to a public and independent review and subsequent report to parliament prior to further consideration of any extension to USO contestability.
The government has decided, in its wisdom, that in the pilot areas Telstra must continue to provide a safety net service by continuing as primary universal service provider, or PUSP. Requiring Telstra to remain as the safety net service provider of last resort in the two proposed pilot project areas is tantamount to an admission by the government of the limited scope of contestability. It is very unfortunate that the government has not taken a similarly cautious approach to the $150 million local call zone tenders whereby Telstra would be required to continue to provide services if it failed to win the tender to provide local calls in remote areas. Instead, the local call zone tender arrangements permit Telstra to withdraw from a massive 80 per cent of the Australian landmass should its tender be unsuccessful. Labor have already expressed our concerns at the government's failure to require Telstra to continue as universal service provider if it fails to win the $150 million tender for untimed local calls in the extended outer zone. The opposition remain concerned at the implications of Telstra's automatic replacement as universal service provider in those areas.
This bill provides as a transitional measure that Telstra is deemed to be the PUSP for all service areas until such time as another carrier is declared to be the PUSP. A declaration that any other carrier should become the PUSP for a given geographical area and service will be a disallowable instrument pursuant to section 12A of the bill. The opposition believes that if contestability of the USO is to be introduced Telstra should be the primary universal service provider Australia wide. Introduction of competition is just that: a means to provide competition for Telstra in the provision of basic telephone services. It should not be an excuse to allow Telstra to withdraw from providing those services altogether. Telstra should continue to be required to make its services available to customers across Australia. This bill should be amended so that Telstra remains the national primary universal service provider and to remove the provisions allowing a carrier other than Telstra to become a primary universal service provider. 
The bill permits a primary or competing universal service provider to offer customers an alternative telephone service. Some concerns were expressed to the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee inquiry that customers might make uninformed decisions to change service providers. In order to prevent customer confusion or misunderstanding, the opposition considers it important that providers be required to fully inform customers of the different service and price arrangements available under the alternative telephone service as compared with the standard telephone service they would otherwise receive. An amendment to this effect will be moved so that providers will be required to make customers fully aware of the consequence of accepting an alternative telecommunications service.
At the appropriate time the opposition intends to move amendments in the Senate which reflect the concerns raised in the Labor senators' minority report from the committee inquiry into the bill. The amendments will address the concern that the pilot projects will not be subject to proper evaluation before competitive tendering is extended into areas beyond those trials. Surely that is the point of trials, after all. You do not need them if you are certain a project is going to work. Consequently, the opposition will be seeking to amend the bill to require proper independent and public review of the trial results once the pilots are complete.
The opposition is concerned that Telstra will not remain as a safety net service provider Australia wide in the case of a declaration of an alternate universal service provider or will be automatically replaced in the case of the winning tender for the local call zone extension tenders. Accordingly, Labor will move a series of amendments—an amendment to retain Telstra as the national universal service provider and to remove the provisions allowing other carriers to become the primary universal service provider in the region, and in the case of the $150 million local call zone tender an amendment to ensure that Telstra remains as universal service provider and is not automatically replaced by the successful tenderer. This is important, as it potentially impacts on 80 per cent of the Australian landmass.
In conclusion, the fundamental importance of the universal service obligation in ensuring the equitable delivery of telecommunications services to rural and regional Australia requires that the detail of this bill be considered carefully. The nature and extent of some of its provisions are of concern to the opposition, as they unnecessarily go far beyond implementing the two trials of competitive tendering. This unnecessary breadth has some serious implications for continued provision of telecommunications services to country areas. For this reason the opposition will be moving, at the appropriate time, amendments to address our concerns as detailed in the ALP senators' minority report to the bill inquiry.
The opposition has circulated its second reading amendment, which is in six paragraphs, paragraphs (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f). I move Labor's second reading amendment, which reads:
At the end of the motion, add “but the Senate, recognising the fundamental importance of high quality and reliable telecommunications services to all Australians now and in the future:
	(a)	condemns the Government for its continuing push towards the full privatisation of Telstra which will inevitably lead to a decline in services to rural and regional Australia;
	(b)	recognises the importance of the Universal Service Obligation to the delivery of minimum communications services to rural and regional Australia;
	(c)	notes that while the Government is holding up competitive tendering as the solution to rural and regional service delivery difficulties and as a justification of the full privatisation of Telstra;
	(i)	its plan is limited to two pilot projects the results of which will not be known for a number of years; and
	(ii)	its decision to require Telstra to remain as a safety net provider of last resort in the areas to be covered by the pilot projects acknowledges the unique role of Telstra in the delivery of services to rural and regional Australia and the folly of pursuing full privatisation; 
	(d)	calls on the Government to ensure that no further competitive tendering decisions are made prior to a comprehensive evaluation of the results of the two pilot projects;
	(e)	notes with concern that Telstra will be excluded as the Primary Universal Service Provider and will only provide service on a `commercial' basis to 80 per cent of Australia if it is unsuccessful in its bid for the Government's $150 million tender for untimed local call access in remote areas; and
	(f)	calls on the Government to ensure that the $150 million tender proceeds on the same basis as the two pilot projects, namely with Telstra as the provider of last resort”.
Speaking briefly on that second reading opposition amendment, in paragraph (a) we are concerned that full privatisation will lead to a decline in Telstra service levels in rural and regional areas. Already the Besley inquiry has shown that, since the partial privatisation of Telstra, service levels have begun to decline. We all know that telecommunication service levels in country areas are inadequate. This competitive tendering scheme could further erode service levels rather than ensure resultant improvements in service.
Turning to paragraph (b), the universal service obligation is critically important to the delivery of minimum communications services to rural and regional Australia. Without this legislatively enshrined USO there would be no guaranteed level of service, particularly for those areas—and there are many—where providing telecommunication services is unprofitable. The universal service obligation aims to ensure equitable provision of a universal application service. If equity cannot be achieved, even with the USO in place, it is unlikely that residents in rural and remote areas would have a service that was even close to adequate—if at all.
In terms of paragraph (c), the government is desperate to convince Australians living in rural and regional areas that their service levels will not decline if Telstra is sold—as everyone knows they will. So the government chooses to hold out competitive tendering as the answer to ensuring universal service continues. The truth is no-one knows if competitive tendering will succeed or fail. The results of the two trials will not be known for a number of years. By that time the government will have well and truly sold off the remainder of Telstra, which is owned by the public. Furthermore the government has acknowledged that Telstra has an important role to play in competitive tendering pilot areas by requiring it to remain as a safety net provider of last resort. This tacit acknowledgment of Telstra's crucial role demonstrates the importance of retaining majority public ownership of Telstra.
Turning to paragraph (d), it is very important that the results of the two pilot projects are thoroughly and impartially analysed prior to the extension of competitive tendering to other areas. The impact of competitive tendering is unknown. Even though there is a chance of success, it should be cautiously investigated in case of failure. It is important that decisions on extending competitive tendering be deferred until it is certain that competitive tendering will not be detrimental to the interests of rural and remote telecommunication users.
Finally, in addressing paragraphs (e) and (f) of the opposition's amendment, under the government's $150 million tender for untimed local call access in remote areas, Telstra—if it is not the successful tenderer—will automatically be replaced as the primary universal service provider in the relevant area by the successful tenderer. The zones where Telstra may be automatically replaced as primary universal service provider cover 80 per cent of Australia. In the event that Telstra is the unsuccessful tenderer Telstra will make a decision on a commercial basis as to whether it will remain in the area as a service provider. This means that Telstra automatically relinquishes its universal service obligations if it is not successful in the provision of untimed local call access under the $150 million program.
The opposition calls on the government to require that Telstra remain as the provider of last resort in the local call tender area, consistent with the government's decision that Telstra must remain as such in the competitive tendering pilot projects. The decision requiring Telstra to remain recognises the important role it plays in fulfilling the USO. The government must extend this reasoning to the local call zone tender so that 80 per cent of the Australian land mass is not left at risk of not being serviced by Telstra at a time in the near or distant future. ",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2000-10-30,"—The primary purpose of the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2000 is to provide for competition in the fulfilment of the universal service obligation. At present the USO is fulfilled by Telstra. At the outset contestability will be introduced in two pilot areas and presumably, if the results of the pilots are positive, it will be extended to other parts of Australia. I have commented on the Democrats' view of competition in the delivery of the USO on a number of occasions in this place. When the Senate was considering this telecommunications bill earlier this year I expressed the view that the Democrats would not stand in the way of the government pursuing competitive tendering but that, at the same time, we would like to see the government implementing other strategies to advance the technologies available to rural areas. Having made that comment—most recently at the end of June this year—and at no time having received a response from the government to my concern, I was encouraged by the release of the Besley report earlier this month. Recommendation 4 of that report states:
If the contestability processes announced by the Government do not have the effect of materially improving service levels in regional, rural and remote areas, the Government should reassess policy measures, including the USO, with a view to ensuring the contemporary telecommunications needs of all Australians are met.
It was very refreshing to finally see someone countenancing the possibility that contestability might not result in the problems being experienced by rural and remote Australia being solved. It is interesting that the Besley inquiry reached two conclusions in this area, and I quote here from the so-called `certificate' of the inquiry. The inquiry's first conclusion was:
The Inquiry research indicates Australians who live in metropolitan and regional centres enjoy good telecommunications services and are generally satisfied with them.
I think if you go and speak to any number of people in metropolitan and suburban Melbourne or Brisbane, for example, the anecdotal evidence you will obtain will largely be supportive of the inquiry's conclusion. By and large most people in the cities and large regional centres do not have a lot of reason to complain about their phone services. I say that as a generalisation, because there are always exceptions of course. The inquiry's second conclusion was:
However, a significant proportion of those who live and work in rural and remote Australia have concerns regarding key aspects of services which, at this stage, are not adequate.
The report went on to enumerate the three areas of concern, which can generically be termed as: repair and connection times, mobile phone coverage, and Internet access and data speeds. Once again I think if you went out to some of the outlying areas of Victoria or Queensland, it would not take very long to find people who identified repair and connection times, mobile coverage and data speeds as being completely inadequate.
The government was hoping to get a certificate from the inquiry saying, `Phone services in Australia are adequate. Therefore, you can sell the rest to Telstra.' Clearly, that has not occurred. I would like to reiterate that one of the primary reasons for our opposition to the sale of Telstra has always been the inadequacy of services to rural and remote Australia and increased difficulty in remedying that inadequacy if Telstra were completely privatised. 
To return to the issues in this bill, in our minority report to the inquiry into the bill, we raised two issues. The first is that we take the view that contestability needs to prove itself, that is, we are introducing this form of fulfilment of the USO as a trial, and that trial should be fully assessed before contestability is introduced in other parts of Australia. I am very pleased to see that the government has responded to our concern. Their amendments now include a prohibition on the expansion of contestability before a review is conducted. The results of that review are tabled in the parliament. There is no timing for that review. That will be a matter for the government to decide. At this stage we are happy with that because if it appears in six months time that the whole concept is a raging success then we are happy for the government to initiate a review at that time to test that claim.  
The other issue we raised in our minority report was much more specific. Universal service providers will be permitted to offer alternative telecommunications services. These may be offerings which include additional services or may be budget priced offerings which, presumably, will be priced at a lower rate than the charge for the standard telephone service. The Democrats were concerned that problems could arise if carriers were offering budget priced services but were not properly identifying the areas in which the service might not meet the standard to which consumers are already accustomed. For example, a budget priced service might not offer call waiting as a facility. It is our view that those sorts of matters should be fully disclosed by providers when offering services. The government has circulated an amendment to attempt to address our concern. We are currently examining that issue and I anticipate saying a little more about that in the committee stage. 
Today I would also like to make a couple of observations about the contestability pilot areas. I do not know how many senators have had a chance to look at the maps of the areas that will be covered by the pilots but I must say I was a bit perplexed when I saw them. One of the pilot areas covers the south west of Victoria and the south east of South Australia and includes the Central Goldfields and Greater Bendigo. The other area starts at north-east New South Wales at Kempsey and extends to the Caloundra Shire in Queensland. Both of these areas seem to me to share a characteristic in that they both contain a reasonable number of large regional centres to which carriers would be attracted. In Queensland, for example, there are the cities of Ipswich and Toowoomba, the Pine River Shire and the Caloundra Shire. So there will be some very profitable customers and some loss making services that will attract the subsidy. 
I would have thought it would be more interesting to see the results of the pilot conducted, say, in the Kimberley region in Western Australia or around the mining town of Mt Isa in Queensland. Even if benefits are found to exist as a result of contestability in the pilot areas it would be a brave person indeed who would extrapolate from those results that similar benefits would be achieved in areas where there are fewer regional centres and where population densities are much lower. The likelihood is that carriers will simply not be attracted to those areas like they might be attracted to the two pilot areas. I understand that the government undertook a process of consultation and considered a number of factors when deciding the pilot areas, but that does not alleviate my concern that the pilot areas do not seem to be representative of many places that are served by the USO. 
On a positive note, the government has conducted public information sessions at three locations in each pilot area to attempt to inform the local media and residents of how contestability will impact on them. One of my staff attended one of those information sessions and I am informed that, whilst only about 20 people were present, the department and the ACA made a very clear and concise presentation about how contestability should work in practice and what safeguards will be in place to protect consumers. 
The other matter I wish to discuss here today has been an ongoing wish of the Democrats—that is, that there should be regular reviews of the USO and customer service guarantee to ensure that rural and remote Australians are not left behind when it comes to the availability of services and technologies. In a perfect world the Democrats would like to see a Besley inquiry conducted every four years or so as a means of identifying the gap in services available to rural and remote Australia. In the year 2000 the Besley inquiry found that the problem areas are repair and connection times, mobile phone coverage and Internet access and data speeds, as I said. It is likely that in four years or so one or two of those problem areas will have been solved, but another gap may have arisen. We would like to see a regular review mechanism put in place to identify that gap or disparity.  
The government has refused to agree to put in place a regular review mechanism like that and they have provided their reasons to us for not agreeing to our request. However, as some sort of compromise with us, the government has agreed to legislate that there will be a review of the USO and the CSG within three years. It is our desire that that inquiry will specifically consider the ability of providers to offer alternative telecommunications services and whether that ability has resulted in an improvement in the technologies and services available to those in rural and remote parts of Australia as compared to those available to people in metropolitan Australia. I foreshadow that the Australian Democrats will be moving an amendment to that effect when we reach the committee stage. 
On this issue, the Democrats are very much realists. We regretfully accept that the services and technologies available to people in metropolitan areas will always outpace to some degree services and technologies in rural and remote Australia. That is somewhat inevitable. It is a function of the fact that it is profitable to offer services first where there are a substantial number of people who will take up those services. However, what we want to achieve is a situation where that disparity in services does not get any wider and, hopefully, gets narrower. Achieving that requires, firstly, an identification of the disparity in services and then a consideration of how to reduce it. 
Before I conclude my remarks, I should comment briefly on the Labor Party's second reading amendment. It contains six points and I will mention each in turn. The Democrats agree with point (a); we are concerned about a decline in services should Telstra be fully privatised. We too recognise the importance of the USO in delivering minimum communication services, particularly in rural and remote Australia—that is point (b). As I have commented on numerous occasions, we are distressed that competitive tendering is being held up as the solution to all communication problems in rural and remote Australia, and we would like to see the government developing and pursuing some alternative strategies. Point (d) refers to the desire that there be a full evaluation of the contestability pilots before any expansion of contestability in other areas. That is one of the issues that I raised in my minority report to the Senate inquiry into this bill. I agree with that point, but I think that we will see some discussion in the committee stage to address the issue.
Points (e) and (f) are related, and I will deal with those together. They are about the $150 million tender for providing untimed local calls to 40,000 Australians in the most remote parts of Australia. The Labor Party is expressing concern that, if Telstra does not win the tender, Telstra will only remain in those areas to serve profitable customers on a commercial basis. The Labor Party's concern is that, if the successful non-Telstra tenderer does not work out or cannot provide services for whatever reason, Telstra will not be there as a provider of last resort to step in and take over. This issue came up during the debate earlier this year on the Telecommunications (Consumer Protection and Service Standards) Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000. The Democrats share the concern of the ALP, but we do not think that requiring Telstra to stay in the outer extended zones as a provider of last resort is a practical solution. Those 40,000 customers are the highest loss making customers in Australia. It is expensive to have one carrier providing services to those people, but to have two carriers present in the extended zones just so that one can be there as some sort of backup in the event that the first goes broke or cannot provide service would double the cost of service provision to those people. With that in mind, I move my amendment No. 1, which has the effect of omitting items (e) and (f) from Labor's amendment:
(1) Omit paragraphs (e) and (f).",SENATE,<title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS (CONSUMER PROTECTION AND SERVICE STANDARDS) AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-10-30,"—There are a number of remarks I would like to make in response to the speeches from honourable senators, but I will restrict my remarks because I think it is probably in the interests of the Senate to move past the second reading stage and debate the important issues in the committee stage. I will just respond to a couple of points that can be made relatively briefly. Firstly, the criticism of the government's privatisation agenda: I think there is a remarkable difference between our agenda and that of the opposition. I think the Democrats have been quite consistent in their position, so it is not necessarily worth commenting on, but we have always said that we support the sale of Telstra. Prior to the last election we said we would not take it any further without a full public and independent inquiry, and we have had that. I think anyone who looks at telecommunications policy in Australia would regard the Besley inquiry, if you take away all the politics surrounding privatisation, as a remarkably successful process in trying to understand where the problems are and where the opportunities are in telecommunications in Australia. The government has made a commitment to respond with a plan to the Besley report, and I think that will be clearly the next constructive part of the telecommunications debate. Juxtapose that against Labor's position, which is to oppose privatisation when it suits them, publicly in relation to Telstra, but of course to support it in relation to Qantas and in relation to the Commonwealth Bank with something like $10 billion worth of privatisations when they were in government. And then of course to privately sneak around, trying to sell Telstra both in government and in opposition—to either break it up, sell off the Yellow Pages, sell it to IBM, sell it to BHP and even sneak off to the Macquarie Bank in the last few weeks and try to find a break-up plan to give them some privatisation proceeds—is, at the very least, a less than honest approach to the issue. 
In response to Senator Allison's point in relation to the description of where the trial should be, the honourable senator mentioned the Kimberley, and of course the Kimberley in my own state is already covered by the untimed local call tender, and so to the extent that that process brings in competition, there will be a benefit for those constituents in that area. Apart from that, I will address some of the more detailed issues in the committee stage. I genuinely thank Senator Bishop and Senator Allison for their contributions to the debate and commend the bill to the Senate.
 (Senator Sherry)—I have got to put Senator Allison's amendment first. The question is that Senator Allison's amendment be agreed to.
Question resolved in the negative.
—I will now put the opposition amendment as moved by Senator Bishop. The question is that the amendment be agreed to. Those in favour please say aye; the contrary no.
—Senator Allison indicated in her comments to our amendment that she was supporting paragraphs (a) to (d) but opposing paragraphs (e) and (f). It is unfortunate the Democrats are not here now.
—That does not give me a lot of help. I will consult with the Clerk. I call it for the noes. The amendment is defeated; the ayes have it.
A division having being called and the bells being rung—
—I suggest that you call the division off. Normally we do not have divisions, as you would be aware, at one minute to two. There needs to be a division, but my point is I am seeking leave to hold the division at a later hour of the day during government business. That is the sensible course of action.

I note that the minister did not answer my question about Mr Jull, but I ask him to answer this important supplementary question. Mr Reith stated at his media conference in Melbourne on 13 October that, when he sat down with the relevant officers from the Department of Finance and Administration, he asked:
`If you'd got a bill for a million dollars, would you have paid it?' And their answer was, `Yes, we would have paid it.' And I said, `Well, would you have told me?' And the answer was, `No, we would not have.' 
Is that correct? Who made this statement—or is it just a case of Mr Reith exaggerating yet again?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Department of Finance and Administration: Ministerial and Parliamentary Services</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,question
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-10-30,"—The opposition has a cheek to come in here and say that we have not been doing things in relation to entitlements, because it is under this government that a number of reforms have taken place. Just to name a few things that we have done: each six months we have a tabling in the parliament which covers travelling allowance payments, commercial fares, car travel and the cost of self-drive vehicles. That was implemented in 1997 by this government. In relation to the recent issue of telecards, last year we tightened the issuing and receipt of telecards, we issued monthly monitoring of amounts and checked those in relation to individual members and senators, and we are now disaggregating those telecard amounts.  
This government has looked at other aspects such as frequent flier points. We introduced the policy that frequent flier points should only be used to offset the cost of travel which would otherwise be at official expense. That is another policy that we have introduced. We have also brought in the 60-day rule relating to the submission of travel allowance claims. This requires members and senators to submit travel claims within 60 days of incurring that travel. We have clarified car travel in Canberra so that senators and members may make reasonable use of the access available without risking allegations of misuse. We have also removed cumbersome arrangements for the payment of home telephone accounts, and I remember Senator Ray agreed with that and asked us questions at estimates hearings about that. We have also clarified the chartered transport entitlements. 
It is worth while remembering that last year the Ministerial and Parliamentary Services section dealt with 42,000 personnel transactions. They paid 50,000 accounts and also dealt with some 21,000 travel allowance items. What you are dealing with is a very busy section of the Department of Finance and Administration. Since we took power we have brought in reforms, we have made things more transparent, and we have introduced six-monthly tabling—reforms which the opposition when it was in government did not undertake. This government has made things more transparent, and we have made those entitlements more streamlined and effective. This government has been all about strengthening those aspects of entitlements which Senator Faulkner has referred to, and we will continue to do so.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Department of Finance and Administration: Ministerial and Parliamentary Services</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1,answer
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-10-30,"—If there is any exaggeration here, it is by the opposition. They are trying to beat up this issue in relation to the Department of Finance and Administration. We have dealt with this issue as I have said: we took steps to strengthen the issuing and receipt of the telecards, we have started monthly monitoring as a result of this matter and we have also disaggregated the amounts so that members and senators can check them.
—Madam President, I raise a point of order. I asked Senator Ellison a direct primary question that he failed to answer. I then asked a very specific supplementary question. Could you please ask the minister to answer the supplementary question that was directed to him in relation to Mr Reith's statements about the Department of Finance and Administration? It is a specific question and it deserves an answer—not dissembling from the minister.
—I cannot direct the minister to answer the question. I can only be certain that he is dealing with it in a relevant manner.
—My answer is relevant because Senator Faulkner is trying to allege that the Department of Finance and Administration is entirely lax in this matter. It is not, and when there has been a need to tighten requirements we have done so.

Bankruptcy Amendment Regulations 2000 (No. 2), Statutory Rules 2000 No. 220
These Regulations amend the Bankruptcy Notice to reflect the introduction of the Federal Magistrates Service. The Regulations omitted the address details of the relevant Federal Court Registry from the Notice with no indication how debtors will still be able to obtain the information.
Child Care Benefit (Allocation of Child Care Places) Determination 2000
Child Care Benefit (Breach of Conditions for Continued Approval) Determination 2000
Child Care Benefit (Eligibility of Child Care Services for Approval and Continued Approval) Determination 2000
Section 4 of the Allocation of Child Care Places Determination and the Eligibility of Child Care Services for Approval and Continued Approval Determination provides that the Secretary to the Department of Family and Community Services `may' in writing, delegate to an officer all or any of the powers of the Secretary under this determination. There is no suitable definition of `officer' to whom the power will be delegated.
Section 4 of the Breach of Conditions for Continued Approval Determination specifies factors that are to be taken into account by the Secretary in considering whether to impose sanctions on a child care service. However, there is no definition of the factors used to determine the degree of gravity of the breach of a condition.
Subsection 7(1) of the Eligibility of Child Care Services for Approval and Continued Approval Determination states that `the applicant must be a suitable person' to operate a child care service. Subsection 7(3) states that the Secretary `may' consider a number of factors in determining an application. The discretionary nature of the subsection means that there is no clear guidance as to what constitutes suitability. This may be more suitable as a mandatory provision.
Section 8 of the Eligibility of Child Care Services for Approval and Continued Approval Determination requires staff of a child care service to be `suitable people'. Subsection 8(3) states that in determining suitability the child care service must check certain matters concerning criminal charges, convictions or findings of guilt, or restraining orders. It is not clear whether an absence of criminal charges, convictions etc is to be regarded as the sole criterion of a staff member's suitability. Subsection 8(4) suggests that this is not the case, because it states that the Secretary `may consider any other matters relevant to the staff' in addition to those in subsection (3). However, subsection (4) is discretionary, while the checks in subsection (3) are mandatory. Similar comments can be made with regard to section 9, dealing with family day care services.
Customs (Prohibited Exports) Amendment Regulations 2000 (No. 1), Statutory Rules 2000 No. 211
Customs (Prohibited Imports) Amendment Regulations 2000 (No. 5), Statutory Rules 2000 No. 214
These Regulations prohibit the exportation from and importation into Australia of toothfish without written permission. These is no indication whether these discretions are subject to independent merits review.

The Explanatory Statement notes that these amendments will assist Olympic and Paralympic teams and competitors importing animals for competition or for personal use.

Dear Attorney
I refer to the Electronic Transactions Amendment Regulations 2000 (No. 1), Statutory Rules 2000 No. 101, that prescribe various Commonwealth laws to which the Electronic Transactions Act 1999 will apply.
The Committee notes that Schedule 2 commences on 24 June 2000 while the remainder of the Amendment Regulations commence on gazettal. The Explanatory Statement provides no explanation for the different commencement dates.
The Committee would appreciate your advice on the reason for the different commencement dates as soon as possible to enable it to finalise its consideration of this matter.

Dear Senator Coonan
Thank you for your letter of 17 August 2000 in which the Standing Committee sought my advice regarding the reasons why Schedule 2 of the Electronic Transactions Amendment Regulations 2000 (No. 1) commenced on 24 June 2000 while the remainder of the Amending Regulations commenced on gazettal.
The effect of Schedule 2 of the Amending Regulations is to apply the Electronic Transactions Act 1999 to the listed items administered by the Australian Quarantine Inspection Service. The Australian Quarantine Inspection Service requested that the Electronic Transactions Act 1999 apply to these three items from 24 June 2000. This was to ensure that they coincided with the commencement of the Quarantine Regulations 2000 on the same day. To allow them to be treated separately the three items were placed in a separate Schedule to commence by special gazettal on 24 June 2000. The remaining Amending Regulations commenced on routine gazettal, five working days after the Amending Regulations were made.
Yours sincerely

Dear Attorney
I refer to the Federal Magistrates Regulations 2000, Statutory Rules 2000 No. 102, that prescribe matters relating to the fees payable in relation to proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court.
The Explanatory Statement indicates that the basis for the prescribed fees is that “similar fee regimes” exist for Family Court proceedings and Federal Court proceedings. However, there is no comparative information concerning those other fee regimes, nor an explanation as to why the Family Court and the Federal Court are considered to be appropriate comparisons for fees in the Federal Magistrates Court. The Committee would appreciate your advice on this matter. 
New regulation 13 specifies that decisions concerning waiver of fees under new regulation 9 are reviewable. The Committee notes, however, that a decision concerning the deferral of fees under new regulation 10 is not subject to review. The Committee would appreciate your advice as to whether such a decision should be subject to review.
The Committee would be grateful for your advice as soon as possible but before 31 August 2000 when disallowance action may be initiated.

Dear Senator Coonan
Thank you for your letter of 17 August 2000 regarding the Federal Magistrates Regulations 2000.
You have queried why the Family Court and the Federal Court are considered to be appropriate for a comparison of fees with the Federal Magistrates Service. This is because the jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Service is concurrent with that of the Family and Federal Courts, and the Federal Magistrates Service is dealing with matters which could have been dealt with previously only by those courts.
The Government's intention is that less complex proceedings will be dealt with by the Federal Magistrates Service, and those which require the attention of a superior court judge will be dealt with by the Family Court or the Federal Court. Litigants can choose in which court to commence proceedings, and there are also provisions under the relevant legislation which allow proceedings to be transferred between the courts. A summary of the jurisdiction of the Federal Magistrates Service is Attachment A.
You also have asked how the fee regime prescribed under these Regulations is similar a to that prescribed for proceedings in the Family Court and the Federal Court. Fees for Family Court proceedings are prescribed under the Family Law Regulations 1984 and those for  Federal Court proceedings are prescribed under the Federal Court of Australia Regulations 1978. A table containing a comparison of the fees is Attachment B.
It was the intention that fees would be payable in the Federal Magistrates Service in the same types of proceedings in which fees are payable in the Family Court and the Federal Court. Due to an administrative oversight, there are some types of family law proceedings in which fees are currently payable under the Federal Magistrates Regulations 2000 where fees would not be payable in the Family Court, as set out Attachment B. My Department is currently drafting amendments to the Federal Magistrates Regulations 2000 to rectify this situation, and I expect that these amendments will be made in September. I have been advised that no proceedings of this type have actually been filed to date in the Federal Magistrates Service.
You also mention the issue of whether a decision regarding the deferral of fees under  Regulation 10 should be subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This regulation allows a Registrar to defer the payment of a fee on the grounds of urgency and is based on subregulation 2(5) of the Federal Court of Australia Regulations 1978. Neither of these regulations allows for review of such a decision, since urgency is the only ground for deferring the fee.
I understand that deferral of fees usually arises in the Federal Court where an application needs to be made urgently but the litigant has not had an opportunity to make arrangements to pay the filing fee in time. This may be, for example, either because the limitation period for filing an application is about to expire, or where a litigant seeks an urgent injunction. I have been advised that applications for the deferral of fees rarely arise and are usually granted.
If a fee is not deferred because the Registrar assesses that the situation is not urgent, and the litigant can afford the fee, the litigant should be able to make arrangements to pay the fee and return at a later time. If a litigant cannot afford to pay the fee, then he or she can apply to have the fee waived on the grounds of financial hardship. It seems that little practical purpose would be served by allowing a litigant to make an application to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to review a decision not to defer a fee in these circumstances. However, I am happy to reconsider this issue should the Committee consider it to be of importance. 
Yours sincerely

Dear Minister
I refer to the Australian Federal Police Amendment Regulations 2000 (No. 2), Statutory Rules 2000 No. 138, that amend the Principal Regulations in relation to employment decisions, suspension from duties of AFP employees and confidentiality of handling of financial statements. 
Item 3 of Schedule 1 introduces a new regulation 5 which provides that the Commissioner may suspend an AFP employee in certain defined instan-ces. The operation of this regulation is complicated because it appears to cover suspensions that might be regarded as involuntary (for example where it is believed that the employee has com-mitted a disciplinary offence) as well as those which are voluntary (for example, where the employee wishes to contest an election to a non-par-lia-mentary body). With regard to the first type of sus-pension, the Committee notes that the new regu-lation does not specify any processes for a sus-pension decision (for example, whether written notice must be given), nor does it indicate whether such a decision is reviewable. With regard to the second type of suspension, the reference to `an election to a non-parliamentary body' is vague. The Committee would appreciate your ad-vice as to whether it would be more appropriate for these matters to be clarified in the new regulation and, indeed, whether the different types of suspension should be dealt with under separate subregulations.  
Item 3 of Schedule 1 introduces a new regulation 13 which provides for the attachment of salaries to satisfy judgment debts. The subregulation 13(1) provides that `The AFP may make deductions from the salary of any of the following persons to satisfy a judgment debt:' There is then a list of four categories of person. The words quoted appear to be drafted widely, covering the judgment debt of any person. The Committee would also appreciate your advice as to whether the subregulation should be amended to specify that the judgment debt is that of the person from whose salary deductions are to be made.
The Committee would be grateful for your advice as soon as possible but before 9 October 2000 when disallowance action may be initiated.
Yours sincerely

Dear Senator Coonan
Thank you for your letter of 17 August 2000 seeking advice to the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances on the Australian Federal Police Amendment Regulations 2000 (Statutory Rules 2000 No. 138). The Committee commented on two regulations, regulation 5 which provides for suspension from duties, and regulation 13 which provides for the attachment of salaries to satisfy judgment debts. I thank the Committee for its comments.
In respect of subregulation 5(1), that subregulation was inserted to cover suspensions that may be regarded, as noted by the Committee, as voluntary or involuntary. For the purpose of clarity, it is proposed to separate these different types of suspension so that they are dealt with under separate subregulations. 
The Committee notes that the regulation 5 does not specify any process for a decision to suspend an AFP employee from duties in defined circumstances (including for a disciplinary offence or for a failure to comply with professional standards). You mention a requirement for notice and review of the decision. To address the former issue, it is proposed to amend the regulations to insert a notice requirement. The absence of the requirement for notice does not reflect AFP practice, rather, it arises from the fact that the involuntary suspension regulations largely replace provisions in the Australian Federal Police (Discipline) Regulations 1979 (regulation 20) which did not include a process for involuntary suspension.
In respect of the latter issue, review of a decision to suspend is available under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977, and reasons for the decision are available under section 13 of that Act.
With regard to suspension for a disciplinary offence, a failure to comply with professional standards, or suspension of an AFP employee charged with, or committed for trial on, a criminal offence, the Department will issue instructions for regulations to provide for the Commissioner to give a notice of suspension to an AFP employee as soon as practicable after the decision to suspend has been made. Grounds for suspension for a failure to comply with professional standards are detailed in Commissioner's Order 2, clauses 5 and 6 (attached).
It is the nature of disciplinary suspension, suspensions in respect of a failure to comply with professional standards and suspensions for a criminal offence, that upon the Commissioner reaching a decision, the suspension will take effect immediately. However, if a suspension is without pay, the suspension of pay will not take place until the date of notice.
The Committee has stated that the reference to `an election to a non-parliamentary body' is vague as a ground for suspension in regulation 5. This terminology has been used deliberately so as to increase the availability of AFP employee-initiated suspension by not limiting the bodies to which they may seek to be elected. It is envisaged that such non-parliamentary bodies could, for example, include the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission.
The Committee has stated that regulation 13 appears to be drafted widely, covering the judgment debt of any person in the four named categories of person. This regulation is modelled directly on regulation 9.1 of the Public Service Regulations 1999. To rectify the ambiguity, drafting instructions will be issued to amend the regulation to provide that the person from whose salary deductions are to be made, is the person who has the judgment debt.
Yours sincerely

Dear Minister
I refer to the Determination No. PB 9 of 2000 made under subsection 98C(1)(b) of the National Health Act 1953, that specifies the conditions under which payments will be made in respect of the supply of pharmaceutical benefits by appro-v-ed pharmacists and approved medical practitioners.
By virtue of clause 1(a) of this instrument, it is taken to have commenced retrospectively on 1 January 2000. Although it appears that it does not detrimentally affect the rights of any person other than the Commonwealth, there is no assurance to that effect in the Explanatory Statement. The Committee would therefore appreciate your as-sur-ance that no person has been adversely affec-ted by the retrospective nature of this instrument.

Dear Senator Coonan
Thank you for your letter of 17 August 2000 concerning Determination No. PB 9 of 2000 made under the National Health Act 1953 (the Act) in relation to the listing of drugs and medicinal preparations as pharmaceutical benefits. 
Your references to this particular determination having been made under subsection 98C(1)(b) of the Act and having effect retrospectively to 1 January 2000 are not understood. In fact this determination was made on 7 July 2000 under subsection 99AAC(2) of the Act and its operation was made retrospective only to 1 July 2000.
The National Health Amendment Act (No. 1) 2000 amended the Act to give effect, as from 1 July 2000, to changes that had been agreed with the Pharmacy Guild of Australia and incorporated in the Third Community Pharmacy Agreement. One of those changes was to repeal section 99ZAA of the Act, which enabled the payment of a remote pharmacy allowance to certain approved pharmacists. As a consequence it was also necessary to repeal paragraph 99AAB(2)(d).
Subsection 99AAA(4) of the Act provides that an approved supplier is required to use the Claims Transmission System except as provided by section 99AAB. That section sets out the classes of approved supplier that are exempt from that requirement. Currently these are approved medical practitioners and approved suppliers in respect of whom a declaration under section 99AAC is in force. A declaration of an approved supplier by the Secretary under subsection 99AAC(1) is subject to the guidelines determined by the Minister under subsection 99AAC(2).
Before 1 July 2000, approved pharmacists who were receiving a remote pharmacy allowance were  also exempt. With the repeal of paragraph 99AAB(2)(d) with effect from that date, it was necessary to amend the determination under subsection 99AAC(2) so that approved pharmacists in receipt of a remote pharmacy allowance who had been exercising an exemption from the use of the Claims Transmission System would not be disadvantaged. That there would be a need to make this determination was foreshadowed in the notes relating to item 5 in the explanatory memorandum to the amending Bill.
I wish to assure the Committee that my Department is cognisant of the restricted circumstances in which it is permissible to make legislation that operates retrospectively. In this case, far from having detrimental effect on any person (other than the Commonwealth), the determination was beneficial to the four approved pharmacists affected by the repeal of paragraph 99AAB(2)(d) of the Act.
Unless the determination had been made with retrospective effect to 1 July 2000, these four pharmacists would have been unable to make any further claims for payment for the supply of pharmaceutical benefits until 14 July 2000, the day on which the determination was published appeared in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette.
I hope this clarifies the, issue.
With kind regards,
Yours sincerely
Dr Michael Wooldridge

Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry
Parliament House
CANBERRA   ACT   2600
Dear Minister
I refer to the Quarantine Regulations 2000, Statutory Rules 2000 No. 129, that repeal and replace the Quarantine (General) Regulations 1956, Quarantine (Plants) Regulations 1935, and Quarantine (Animals) Regulations 1935.
New subregulation 10(1) items 12 and 13, 10(2) items 5 and 6, and regulation 12 items 4 and 5 each require that certain information must be reported under s.27A(2) of the Act (for regulation 10) and s.27B(2) of the Act (for regulation 12). Regulation 18 items 13 and 14 prescribe the matter about which a quarantine officer may require the master, commander, medical officer, or agent of certain vessels to answer questions. These requirements and reporting obligations arise `if any live animal is on board' the vessel, installation, or aircraft, or `if any animal died' during the voyage or flight. The Committee would appreciate your advice as to whether these requirements and reporting obligations are intended to apply broadly to `any' live animal on board, regardless of whether the presence of the animal was actually known to the master of the vessel or commander of the aircraft. If, on the other hand, it is intended that the reporting obligation applies only to animals that have been consigned for transportation, then the Committee suggests that this be clarified in the regulations.
New subregulation 21(1) states that a person must not give or report information, or cause information to be given or reported to a quarantine officer under certain other regulations if that information is false or misleading in a material detail. A penalty of 50 penalty units is specified for breach. It is not stated that this is a strict liability offence, as is the case with new subregulations 27, 31, 34, and 58(1).  The Committee would appreciate your advice as to whether subregulation 21(1) is intended to impose liability regardless of the person's knowledge of the falsity or misleading nature of the information and, if so, whether this could be specified in the regulation. 
New subregulation 28(1) provides that a quarantine officer may secure any stores or waste that are on an overseas vessel or overseas installation at a port in Australia or the Cocos Islands. New subregulation 28(2) then provides that `a person' must not interfere with the stores or waste, or the means of its security, without the master's permission. Literally the reference to `a person' in subregulation (2) can include the quarantine officer who has caused the stores etc to be secured in the first place. The Committee would appreciate your advice as to whether it is intended that the quarantine officer should require the master's permission before being able to deal with the stores etc after having secured them.
New subregulation 41(5) refers to a `communicable disease'. This term is not defined in the Regulations or in the Quarantine Act 1908. The Committee would appreciate your advice as to whether a definition is required for this term.
New subregulation 76 specifies that an officer who seizes an animal, plant or other goods must give a notice `as soon as practicable'. The Committee would appreciate your advice as to whether a time limit should be placed upon this requirement.
The Committee would be grateful for your advice as soon as possible but before 9 October 2000 when disallowance action may be initiated.
Yours sincerely

Dear Helen
Thank you for your letter of 17 August 2000 in which you sought advice regarding various provisions of the Quarantine Regulations 2000 (the Regulations). I appreciate the opportunity to address the Committee's concerns.
The Committee seeks clarification regarding the scope of the information specified in the Regulations for the purposes of sections 27A, 27B and 28 of the Quarantine Act 1908 (the Act). In particular, you ask whether the reporting requirements apply to any live animal on board a vessel regardless of whether the animal's presence on the vessel was actually known to the master, or only to those animals that have been consigned for transportation.
Sections 27A, 27B and 28 of the Act are important provisions because they enable quarantine officers to obtain information relevant to the protection of Australia's quarantine security. The information specified in the Regulations is intended to apply to all animals on board the vessel or aircraft, not just to animals that have been consigned for transport. If the reporting requirements were limited to animals consigned for transportation, animals kept as pets on the vessels, such as cats, dogs, birds or monkeys, would be overlooked. Animals, dead or alive, on overseas vessels could introduce unwanted pests and diseases into Australia. It is therefore vital that quarantine officers be fully informed about the existence of such quarantine risks so that appropriate measures can be taken.
Sections 27A, 27B and 28 do not place an obligation on the master (or commander in the case of aircraft) to provide information “regardless of whether the presence of the animal was actually known”. This view is supported by the fact that the offences in these sections are not offences of strict liability under the Criminal Code. Section 86G of the Act applies Chapter 2 of the Criminal Code to all offences against the Act.
However, the sections do contain offence provisions which apply if the master (or commander in the case of aircraft) knowingly or negligently gives false or misleading information in meeting these reporting requirements, or falls to correct information once he becomes aware that is it incorrect.
The Committee asks if the offence set out in subregulation 21(1) is intended to be an offence of strict liability.
The offence in subregulation 21(1) is not intended to be a strict liability offence and as a matter of policy the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service will not seek to prosecute breaches of section 21(1) on a strict liability basis. Furthermore, it is unlikely that a court would accept that subregulation 21(1) is a strict liability offence because it imposes a higher penalty than the other offence in regulation 21 which specifies a mental element of negligence. If regulation 21 is read as a whole, the implication is that the offence in subregulation 21(1) will require a mental element demonstrating at least recklessness or knowledge.
However, if this explanation does not allay the Committee's concerns, I will undertake to amend subregulation 21(1) to clarify its intended effect.
The Committee asks for clarification as to whether it is intended that a quarantine officer should be required to obtain the consent of the master of a vessel under subregulation 28(2) prior to interfering with stores or waste secured by that quarantine officer, or another quarantine officer, under subregulation 28(1). 
It is not intended that a quarantine officer should be required to obtain the consent of the master of a vessel under subregulation 28(2). In general, throughout the Act and the Regulations the terms `quarantine officer' and `person' are used in a mutually exclusive way. Furthermore, it would be inconsistent with administrative arrangements set out in Part II of the Act and in subsection 8B(6) in particular to have a quarantine Officer subject to the authority of a master of a vessel rather than to a Chief Quarantine Officer or a Director of Quarantine.
In relation to the issue of whether a definition is required for the term `communicable disease' in subregulation 41(5), this term concerns human quarantine. The human aspects of the Act are administered by my colleague the Hon Dr Michael Wooldridge MP, Minister for Health and Aged Care. Accordingly, I have referred this question to him for a response to your Committee. I understand that the use of this term, which occurs in section 35A of the Act as well as in the Regulations, is presently under consideration in a review of the human quarantine aspects of the Act by the Department of Health and Aged Care.
The Committee seeks my views as to whether a time limit should be placed on the requirement in subregulation 76. Subregulation 76 specifies that the importer, owner or person in control of the animal, plant or other goods that have been seized under section 69 of the Act must be given notice `as soon as practicable'.
The focus of section 69 is to empower. officers to place potential quarantine risks under, or return them to, quarantine control without delay. A more specific time limit on the requirement for notification could defeat the intention of section 69. For example, if officers are obliged to meet a specific time for notification after seizure, they may be reluctant to act unless they are confident about identifying the `importer, owner or person in control of the animal, plant or other goods' within the prescribed time. While notification is important, it is secondary to containing the quarantine risk. Under these circumstances, I believe the requirement in subregulation 76 that notice be given `as soon as practicable' achieves an appropriate balance between recognising the right of people to know the location of their seized goods and allowing the flexibility necessary for the effective operation of section 69.
I trust that the Committee's concerns have been fully addressed. I would be pleased to arrange for officers of the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service to meet with the committee if it requires clarification on any of the matters raised in this letter.
Thank you for bringing your concerns to my attention.
Yours sincerely

"Forshaw, Sen Michael",ALP,2000-10-30,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report. 
Ordinarily, one finds that a report on legislation that comes before a Senate legislation committee does not require detailed debate in this chamber, given that the legislation will be debated and considered subsequently in committee. However, I believe it is important at this stage to make a few comments about the report of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee on the Wool Services Privatisation Bill 2000.
The legislation is part of an ongoing process that has been under consideration in the wool industry itself; it also has been subject to ongoing debate and consideration by the parliament. The process involves changes to the regulatory regime within the wool industry. This particular legislation will have the effect of privatising the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation. Earlier legislation has been dealt with by this parliament, and the history of what has taken place both in the industry and in the parliament is detailed in the government report and in the dissenting report by Senator O'Brien, Senator Woodley and myself. I will not take up time by going through that. I invite senators to read the reports—both the government report and the dissenting report. Of course, we will come to consider those reports in more detail when dealing with the legislation in due course.
As everyone knows, the privatisation of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation follows a chequered history of the operations of that body and, in particular, the serious concern in the industry which ultimately led to the motion of no confidence in the AWRAP board on 30 November 1998. The then minister, Mr Vaile, asked for the resignation of all board members of AWRAP and then established the Wool Industry Future Directions Task Force, which was chaired by former minister Mr Ian McLachlan. Mr McLachlan brought down his report. It was released on 30 June 1999 and made a number of recommendations. This legislation, the subject of this Senate committee report, is in part a response to—and, if you like, a natural progression of—the issues that have been raised over time and which were dealt with in Mr McLachlan's report.
I have to say at the outset that the opposition do not seek to delay this legislation unduly. Indeed, our position is that we have supported, and continue to support, the orderly restructuring of the wool industry. I believe that we have cooperated at all stages through that process, both at an industry level and also in the parliament when dealing with legislation. But we are concerned to ensure that the ultimate privatisation of AWRAP is done with the full knowledge of the facts, both for the industry itself and for the parliament. We want to see the new organisations, these new companies that will be established, start off on the right foot. It has become clear that, during the consideration of this legislation by the Senate committee, there are a number of very important outstanding issues that have not yet been resolved.
One of those issues involves the finalisation of a payment to the South African company Cape Wools, which has an equity interest in the old organisation. There is a history to that matter which I am not in a position to go over today—firstly, because time does not permit and, secondly, because the committee took evidence in camera from representatives of AWRAP, from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and also from representatives of the South African company Cape Wools. I have to say that nothing that we heard in camera has led the opposition—and, I believe, Senator Woodley, but no doubt he can speak for himself—to think other than that this is a serious matter that needs to be finalised; it certainly needs to be clarified before this legislation is ultimately debated and passed by this chamber, if that is the ultimate position.
It is public knowledge now that there is litigation. Litigation has been commenced both by AWRAP itself and by Cape Wools to settle the question of the value of the South African company's interests. We believe that the minister is the one who should be getting involved—as we hope will be the case—in trying to bring about a resolution of that issue, based upon the agreed procedures that were entered into between AWRAP and the South African company when privatisation was first mooted and when the South African company indicated that it wished to withdraw its involvement from the company. 
This is an issue that should be resolved, and it is an issue that goes ultimately to the liability that will be carried forward into the new company. I am concerned that wool growers' representatives have been publicly criticising the opposition for its position, which has called for all of this to be resolved before the legislation is dealt with in this parliament, yet when they appeared before the committee, they certainly gave us a different impression. Mr Wolfenden the other day was quoted as saying, `Woolgrowers message to parliament is clear: pass the legislation and let us get on with the job.' They were critical of our dissenting report.
My challenge to Mr Wolfenden is this: let us release all of the material that was put to the committee, both in camera and in public, and then let us find out what the real concerns of wool growers are. We know that they are concerned about the possible liability and the level of debt. That has been made known publicly. We are also concerned that there are a range of other issues that have not been resolved yet. We do not have the regulations. There are answers to questions and other material that we have requested that have not been provided to the committee. I am sure that when this legislation comes on for debate there will be a lot more to say about it. But I do want to make it very clear that the opposition are proposing to delay the final passage of this legislation until all these issues are resolved, because we believe that it is in the interests of the industry and wool growers to do so.",SENATE,<title>WOOL SERVICES PRIVATISATION BILL 2000</title>,<title>Report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NP,2000-10-30,"—In the absence of Senator Crane, who is the chair of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, I think it is appropriate that I make some comments about the majority position of the committee. I have listened carefully to Senator Forshaw. I have also read the minority report of the Labor senators and Senator Woodley, and I understand their concerns. But I say that, whether or not the contingent liability of Cape Wools and the South Africans is resolved before 1 January, this is not the overriding consideration, in the committee's view, with respect to this legislation. At this time, with an improvement in world wool prices and world production falling below demand, there should be no postponement or delay in the passage of this bill because of the changing economic circumstances of wool growers. In addition, the opportunity to develop better wool production and marketing methods for this industry must be followed up.
Subject to the three amendments that the committee put in its report, I think the legislation should proceed. The privatisation of the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation is part of a much larger process to enable the wool industry to assume ownership of its service delivery body and to be accountable to levy payers, as the shareholders, as wool growers, will be. This is part of a process that has revolved around the privatisation of the stockpile through the wool stock legislation, which Senator Woodley was very involved in. Industry and government have worked closely together to produce that and to produce this important result for the wool industry. 
The good work done by the Interim Advisory Board, headed up by Rod Price, and the Wool Growers Advisory Group, headed up by Robert Webster, has ensured that the process has run smoothly and in line with the recommendations of the McLachlan inquiry and the WoolPoll 2000, where all wool growers were, of course, polled. This legislation is the final step to deliver the privatisation of the wool industry service provider, the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation, and its operating subsidiary, The Woolmark Co., which internationally is one of the most highly recognised symbols. The ownership of that symbol is what the current problem and the dispute with Cape Wools are about.
This legislation passes the ownership of the management of the wool industry services into the hands of wool growers and reduces the government's involvement in oversighting statutory funding and accountability. The process to establish the most appropriate structure to replace AWRAP has been, as I said, comprehensive and very well supported by wool growers. It has been a strong example of government and industry working together to achieve a common goal. It has not been an easy task for wool growers over the last decade, but certainly this legislation and the privatisation of the stockpile in the form of the Woolstock company, which has been a great success and is continuing to reduce the stockpile substantially, have been a benefit to the wool market and to the industry as a whole. 
I would like to put on the record some of the benefits of the proposed privatisation and why it is essential that it go ahead despite the question mark of the contingent liability. The process to privatise AWRAP is solely in response to industry calls for reform. The new arrangements differ from AWRAP in a number of key ways which address industry concerns. The government is responding to industry concerns. All taxpayers will be the owners of the new arrangements. There will be full contestability and transparency between the receipt and expenditure of the wool levy and matching R&D funds, which the government will continue to assist with. The government's role will be limited to that required for accountability for the wool levy and matching R&D funds received and ensuring efficient and effective service delivery. Shareholders in The Woolmark Co., which is the company which will hold the Woolmark, will have the opportunity to realise future capital gains as a result of share trading, most probably on the Stock Exchange, and the new companies will operate as commercial entities under the Corporations Law. In the absence of Senator Crane, my view and that of the committee is that the legislation should proceed as the committee report has found. I look forward to the operation of the new wool services legislation and want to see it pass into law as soon as possible.",SENATE,<title>WOOL SERVICES PRIVATISATION BILL 2000</title>,<title>Report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee</title>,Bills,11,1,speech
"Woodley, Sen John",AD,2000-10-30,"—I want to thank the Senate for the opportunity to speak this afternoon to the report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee entitled The Wool Services Privatisation Bill 2000, given the absence of the chairman and given the importance of this particular issue. It is interesting that all parties actually support the eventual passing of the Wool Services Privatisation Bill 2000. That is not in doubt; it is not as if there were fundamental differences between members of this chamber over the legislation. Eventually, we all wish for the legislation to be supported and for the new companies to be established. 
As members of the Senate would know, this process is one that has gone on for quite a few years. It followed a lot of unrest in the industry, particularly over the way in which the fixed release schedule was operating in terms of the wool stockpile, and led eventually to the sacking of the whole of the AWRAP board and a process which led to this legislation, which will establish two new companies. So there is no doubt that all of us who have been involved in this debate for many years are committed to the establishment of the privatised companies, and we are certainly committed to seeing the wool industry get back on its feet—as it is beginning to do—and go ahead with control of its own industry through the new bodies.
However, there are still some problems These problems are to do with the lack of information about something which has only surfaced in the last few weeks and which placed the future of those new companies in some jeopardy, and that is a continuing liability which will be carried over from the old AWRAP board and which will have to be picked up by somebody. At this stage, who that somebody is is not altogether certain. Certainly, the government has said that it has no financial liability—it is covered by both the old and the new legislation—but I am not sure about that. If the government itself has had a hand in signing off on the agreement which established the liability, I am not sure about that. No matter what other legislation says, at least in a moral and ethical sense, anyone who is party to an agreement which establishes a debt surely has some responsibility for payment of part of that debt. So there is one of the questions which remain.
We do not know the extent of the debt, we do not know who is going to pay it and there is no doubt that we would be legislating in a very irresponsible manner if we simply legislated and said, `Well, too bad. Somebody will have to pick it up, and maybe they will in the future.' The debt, of course, is a continuing liability to Cape Wools of South Africa, who originally had around an eight per cent interest in the old AWRAP and associated bodies. While they have, I believe, received a percentage of the sale of the physical assets, there still remains the issue of the intellectual property and the value of that intellectual property. The question is: who is going to pay for that? I think there is no doubt in the government's mind that the growers themselves will pay, and I have problems with that. There is no doubt that, when WoolPoll 2000 was put in place—a ballot was held—growers in the majority said that they were willing to pay a two per cent levy. We know that already this has been extended to three per cent for a period to cover some liabilities which continue, but are we going to extend that two per cent to three per cent for a much longer period in order to cover the debt which is obviously there? Nobody can answer that question. So those are the issues which remain with us. 
I note that Mr Wolfenden from the Wool Council issued a press release when the Labor Party and the Democrats put out a minority report. It was not altogether a dissenting report in the sense that it was the total opposite of what the government was saying—we supported most of what the government had in its own report—but it added some caution. For this press release to state that opposition senators were trying to block the legislation was really a little bit over the fence. All Mr Wolfenden had to do was to pick up the phone and speak to Senator Forshaw, Senator O'Brien or me and he would have understood much better than he seems to have what our position is.
—He could have read the report.
—And if he had read our report he also would have been a little clearer and perhaps would not have issued what I believe to be a silly press release. We have challenged him to allow on the public record the things that he told us in camera and that, in itself, would supply some of the information which we need. So these are the concerns that we have. The Democrats certainly do not want to in any sense block this legislation or the formation of these new bodies, but we do want answers to these questions. It would be irresponsible for us to simply say, `Here's a blank cheque. The poor old growers will pay again, but that doesn't really matter.' At the end of the day, ordinary growers are not able either to speak or to vote in this place. As legislators, we need to vote and to speak responsibly in this debate, and there needs to be sufficient information to inform the debate so that the legislation itself is legislation in which we can have confidence.
There are a number of amendments and I would like to signal now that there are a couple of issues which still need to be considered. One of those is what has happened to those properties—particularly in Victoria—where ovine Johne's disease has been found and where, if we operate on the basis which is in the legislation, they will end up having no equity at all. Having had their properties destocked in the period where the equity is to be established, they have no income for that period and therefore—it would seem—no equity, and that is a grave injustice. So that needs to be addressed.
An issue which I know Senator Ferris, in particular, has been very concerned about—and she has said so publicly—is the transfer of AWRAP staff into the new bodies without any consideration as to whether or not the culture in AWRAP, which got us into the problems that we faced in the first place, will also be transferred with the transfer of staff. That will have to be addressed. Another issue I am concerned about is to make sure that funds from the two per cent levy, which are mainly to go to research and development, will not be used to fund any future representative bodies. These are some of the issues which will be addressed by legislation and by amendments. They are canvassed in the report which I am supporting today.

I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
The report that I have just tabled is important for two reasons. Firstly, it represents some degree of parliamentary involvement in the scrutiny process. This is significant and something that the committee supports. That involvement is, however, heavily qualified, and I will return to this point. Secondly, the legislation that prompted this report and the timing of the tabling of the document about the loan have both caused some concern to committee members. Before dealing with those two related points and the information provided to us in this inquiry, I would like to make some general comments on this loan to the PNG government.
This loan of $133.2 million was granted to PNG under the provisions of the International Monetary Agreement Act 1947 as amended in 1998. This enables the government to lend money to other countries provided at least one government or organisation intends to provide or has provided money to the proposed recipient. Further, when loans are made under this act, it prescribes that a national interest statement setting out the nature and terms of the loan is to be tabled in the parliament. The national interest statement is also to set out the reasons why the loan is in Australia's national interest, having regard in particular to foreign policy, trade and economic interests. In this case, both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are working with PNG and lending it money to assist its reform agenda. There can be no doubt that making this loan to PNG is in Australia's national interest, and it is supported by the committee. The historical and geographic ties between the two nations are such that it would be unthinkable not to assist the government of Sir Mekere Morauta to continue its reforming work.
The terms of this loan are strictly commercial. PNG's record of repaying other loans is such that the committee is confident that this loan will be repaid in full and on time. Although the time to consider this matter was short, the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee of the joint committee carried out a standard inquiry process. A total of seven submissions were received from five organisations or individuals. A short public hearing was held on 12 September at which very useful evidence was taken from a range of witnesses, particularly from the Treasury, the DFAT portfolio and from a panel from the ANU. These witnesses all supported the loan and the efforts of the Morauta government to implement a program of reform in PNG. I believe that my colleagues would agree that, although many things remain to be done, the witnesses from the ANU were surprisingly optimistic about PNG's prospects under the Morauta government. I am sure that all those with an interest in our closest northern neighbour hope that very recent events in PNG will not lead to a weakening of its government's resolve to continue its reform program. 
The next point I want to address is the timing of the referral of loans such as this to the joint committee for inquiry and report. Loans made under the International Monetary Agreements Act 1947 as amended stand automatically referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade for inquiry and report within two months. Such a time frame does not encourage a long or detailed inquiry. Further, the legislation does not specify when, in the approval process, loans should be referred to the committee. Thus, the national interest statement was tabled some time after the loan was approved. It was granted on 21 June 2000, but the national interest statement was not tabled in the parliament until 28 August 2000. Committee members had some difficulty in understanding why the joint committee was included in the process at all. Parliamentary scrutiny is a good and desirable thing but, to be effective in the consideration of loans such as this, it must occur earlier in the approval process than it does under this legislation. It is possible to include such scrutiny in approval processes without causing delays. For example, the approvals of government projects over a specified cost have to include time for consideration by the Public Works Committee. This has been so since the early years of federation.
Since 1996, all treaties proposed for ratification must be examined by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. Only 15 sitting days are allowed for its processes. This period is often as short as five or six weeks—rather shorter than the two months specified in the legislation for these loans. As the report states, what we see in this case is a concession to parliamentary scrutiny in theory, but a denial of it in practice. We have recommended that the legislation be further amended to ensure that parliamentary scrutiny occurs before loans are executed under its provisions. We believe time can and should be made for scrutiny of these loans. Surely it is a waste of effort for all participants if there is no opportunity to make this scrutiny both timely and effective or if the loan has already been granted. In supporting this loan, therefore, the committee has also recommended that the legislation be amended to ensure that parliamentary consideration of any future loans is included earlier in the approval process. The NIS refers to a further loan to PNG of $A30 million. The committee understands that negotiations for this loan are under way at present. Even if our recommendation is accepted, it is unlikely that the legislation will be amended in time for a change to the current process. It is likely, therefore, that the three payments making up this additional loan will be dealt with in the same unsatisfactory way as the larger loan that is the subject of this report.
The final point I would like to cover relates to some of the material given to us by the departments involved in the process of executing this loan. The act is quite specific about the matters to be covered in the national interest statement: the terms and conditions of the loan and, broadly, Australia's national interests. The section in the national interest statement on the terms and conditions of the loan was not very helpful. It simply stated that the loan agreement contains standard commercial terms and conditions, including an indemnity clause designed to protect the Commonwealth's interests. This brief statement was repeated at the hearing on 12 September.
Australia's national interest—the other matter required to be covered by the legislation—was not given much more consideration than the loan itself in the national interest statement. It was brief and, as far as it went, satisfactory. Unfortunately, neither that statement nor the evidence at the public hearing gave any indication of how Australia's national interest is defined or what factors are taken into account during the process. DFAT's additional material provided little additional light on either issue, largely repeating with slight variations what had already been put forward. I would hope that the quality of the information provided by these organisations could improve if further loans are made under the provisions of this legislation. I commend this report to the Senate

"Gibbs, Sen Brenda",ALP,2000-10-30,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present a report of the committee entitled Australian government loan to Papua New Guinea, together with the Hansard record of the committee's proceedings, minutes of proceedings and submissions received by the committee. I seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
The report that I have just tabled is important for two reasons. Firstly, it represents some degree of parliamentary involvement in the scrutiny process. This is significant and something that the committee supports. That involvement is, however, heavily qualified, and I will return to this point. Secondly, the legislation that prompted this report and the timing of the tabling of the document about the loan have both caused some concern to committee members. Before dealing with those two related points and the information provided to us in this inquiry, I would like to make some general comments on this loan to the PNG government.
This loan of $133.2 million was granted to PNG under the provisions of the International Monetary Agreement Act 1947 as amended in 1998. This enables the government to lend money to other countries provided at least one government or organisation intends to provide or has provided money to the proposed recipient. Further, when loans are made under this act, it prescribes that a national interest statement setting out the nature and terms of the loan is to be tabled in the parliament. The national interest statement is also to set out the reasons why the loan is in Australia's national interest, having regard in particular to foreign policy, trade and economic interests. In this case, both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are working with PNG and lending it money to assist its reform agenda. There can be no doubt that making this loan to PNG is in Australia's national interest, and it is supported by the committee. The historical and geographic ties between the two nations are such that it would be unthinkable not to assist the government of Sir Mekere Morauta to continue its reforming work.
The terms of this loan are strictly commercial. PNG's record of repaying other loans is such that the committee is confident that this loan will be repaid in full and on time. Although the time to consider this matter was short, the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee of the joint committee carried out a standard inquiry process. A total of seven submissions were received from five organisations or individuals. A short public hearing was held on 12 September at which very useful evidence was taken from a range of witnesses, particularly from the Treasury, the DFAT portfolio and from a panel from the ANU. These witnesses all supported the loan and the efforts of the Morauta government to implement a program of reform in PNG.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2000-10-30,"—The Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2000, which is before us and which I spoke to in the second reading debate, goes to the issues concerning financial assistance payable to universities for 2002; makes a number of commitments with regard to price movements; seeks to provide for funding for various scholarships, research infrastructure, equipment, facilities and strategic partnerships with industry; and makes a number of other technical changes. The Senate considered a second reading amendment, which was in fact carried, which pointed out some of the concerns that the opposition has with the bill. In the committee stage of this bill, I have a few questions I would like to ask the minister with regard to clarification.
I would particularly like to turn to the issue of the Australian National University. The minister would be aware that I am a member of the council at the ANU as a nominee of the parliament. The issue of the Noel Butlin Archives Centre was canvassed at the last meeting and the matters that related to the university administration's attempts to reduce the level of access to the Noel Butlin Archives Centre have concerned a very large number of people across this country. This is because the Noel Butlin Archives Centre is a national asset of enormous value insofar as it is an archive of the records of a very large number of Australian companies and workers' organisations. It provides quite an extraordinary, rich tapestry of Australia's economic life from both a union and a business perspective. It is of profound significance to this country and it is a body of records which is all the more valuable because many of the organisations that provided those records are no longer in existence.
I am particularly concerned about the national role of the National University. It is the case, Minister, that there is a statutory function of the Australian National University to encourage and to provide facilities for research and postgraduate study both generally and in relation to subjects of national importance to Australia.  
I would ask, Minister: is it the case that this parliament currently appropriates some $155 million to the ANU for these particular functions? Minister, are you aware of the vice-chancellor's Plan for growth, which recently attracted some media attention and which is a document that proposes—among other things—that the Commonwealth government `pro-vides a block grant to us' to support the par-ticular statutory functions of the university? The vice-chancellor goes on in this report to say:
Our future growth is linked to how well we take up this challenge of directing our research and postgraduate training and teaching to subjects of national importance, and how seriously we take our national role.
I would ask the minister whether he is aware of the claim that is being made by the Vice-Chancellor of the ANU, who states:
... our only true difference from other universities looking to attract the same student base and the same research dollars, is the statutory charter we have to play this national role in research and postgraduate teaching.
That distinguishes the ANU from any other university insofar as this block grant is provided. Is the minister aware that the university claims to provide national leadership in teaching, postgraduate training and research? The report states:
... we define what it is that we offer that other institutions do not. We are, as a national academic institution, central to the understanding of Australia's place in a new globalised, technological, economic, political and cultural world.
I further ask the minister whether he is aware of the vice-chancellor's claim that:
A vital key to success in pursuing our national role is how well we engage with the broad community, and how openly and truly we acknowledge that our national role, and the nation's investment in us amounts to our being, to all intents and purposes, publicly owned.
If that is the case, is the minister aware that there is a shortfall—according to the ANU management—of $150,000 and that this is the cause for them to restrict access to the Noel Butlin Archives Centre to the level that they are proposing? Minister, in a budget of $155 million that this parliament appropriates to the ANU, do you think it is reasonable that $150,000 extra be found for the Noel Butlin Archives Centre?",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1,speech

 (Senator Sherry)—Standing orders: no tedious repetition, Senator Carr!
—Senator Carr has touched on research and development in higher education. From 1996-97 to 1998-99, the expenditure on R&D in higher education rose from $2.3 billion to $2.6 billion in current prices. The expenditure on R&D in higher education in 1998-99 accounted for 29 per cent of Australia's growth expenditure on research and development compared with 26 per cent in the previous year, 1996-97. This demonstrates the government is committed to supporting Australia's higher education research effort. But I have taken up the particular question Senator Carr asked with the department, and we will have to take that on notice.

The proposition was put to us that additional money should be provided by the parliament.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2000-10-30,"—I am asking specifically whether or not the case has been put by the university for additional moneys to meet its statutory functions. I raise this because in the Plan for growth the vice-chancellor places a great deal of emphasis on the unique roles of the university. The document says:
We provide national leadership in teaching, postgraduate training and research and in that role we define what it is that we offer that other institutions do not.
A legitimate claim may well be made that that is the purpose of the ANU. I think it plays a very valuable role in this country's academic and cultural life. But, equally, if it is the case that these functions ought to be undertaken, have you had any representations from the ANU that its statutory functions—one of which it says is `encouraging and providing facilities for research and postgraduate study both generally and in relation to subjects of national importance to Australia'—are not being met and that additional moneys are required so that it can fulfil these particular functions?",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1,speech

 (Senator Sherry)—Order! You have not prepared anything. There is a lot of discussion going on.
—Senator Carr was asking questions about matters that are germane to the running of universities themselves and how they administer the commercial arms of those universities. Really, it is a matter for those universities. One of the officials here from the department is aware of the article. It is a question of the universities having to work within those frameworks. The government believes that this is something which goes to the autonomy of the university concerned; it is their affair.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2000-10-30,"—On that point, Minister, this is a funding bill for universities. I think it is well within the province of the chamber to consider the funding policies of the government in regard to universities. I asked a question that specifically related to the University of New South Wales and a $10 million loss which appeared to have developed at that particular university. Minister, are you aware that four of the six so-called sandstone universities that have private commercial arms have had serious financial troubles? Given that these are publicly funded institutions being bailed out with public money, surely this is a matter of direct interest to this chamber and to this government. Are you able to give an assurance, Minister, that there are no public moneys involved in the bailout of any of these so-called sandstone universities with private arms, four of which are reported to have had serious financial trouble over the last year or so?",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-10-30,"—We have been through this before with Senator Carr at estimates. We as a government have to be very careful about what we say about the financial plight or otherwise of universities because there is an aspect of commerciality there. I think the funding has to be looked at in the light that, excluding HECS, 50 per cent of funding is government and 50 per cent is not. If we were to say, `Here is funding and it has strings attached,' I dare say the opposition and in particular Senator Carr would be the first ones to jump up and down and say, `The government should not be limiting the autonomy of universities in this way.' 
I think the very question that Senator Carr asked about the ANU goes towards that question of autonomy—that is, that the ANU has its own council and charter and within that it makes its own decisions. If the government were to try to impose its will one way or another on the ANU, I am sure Senator Carr would be very upset. Similarly, with these universities here the government is not going to comment one way or another publicly about the financial aspects or details of a university. I think people have to remember that the universities have a degree of autonomy whereby they have private funding available; it is not total government funding. Therefore, it would be unreasonable for the government to just march in and tell the universities how to run their own affairs, and I am sure they would be the first to complain if we did.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2000</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2000-10-30,"—The issue at stake here is the question of the nature of government policy and whether or not universities are obliged to follow these particularly destructive policies in the operations of these commercial arms. Minister, I understand your point about the need for commercial confidentiality, but I am asking you a question about the expenditure of public moneys, and I have asked you a specific question as to whether or not you can assure this chamber that no public moneys have been used to bail out any of these private arms. While you are seeking advice I ask you whether or not the fact that there have been so many reports of failure in the financial operations of these commercial arms is of itself a commentary upon the failure of government policy in higher education.
What troubles me is whether or not the approach that is being taken here by this government in imposing a series of quite severe—in fact, draconian—cuts on universities means that many of our universities have, using their `autonomy', as you put it, sought to come to terms with these cuts by embarking on what would now appear on the surface to be a prima facie case of some rather dodgy and questionable commercial ventures, all in the name of financial autonomy. The other concern I have, Minister, is whether government policy is encouraging universities to take this action and to seek through these private arms vehicles by which they can avoid public scrutiny. But the situation now is that, if a series of university administrations are seeking to privatise their profits but to socialise their losses, there is quite clearly an issue for this parliament. So I ask you again, Minister: are you able to advise me as to whether or not any public moneys have gone to any of these commercial arms which have faced serious financial difficulties over the last two years?

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2000-10-30,"—The funding I have mentioned does not go to those commercial arms. It is not funding which is earmarked or specified for those commercial arms. I reiterate that total university revenues are at an all-time record—I think just a tad over $9 billion. The government's funding, including HECS, makes up $6 billion of this, which relies on some $3 billion coming from other sources. That money is essential for the growth of the tertiary education sector. The government encourages the private sector to become involved in research and development and other aspects of university endeavour, but the funding that is put in by government is not funding which goes to prop up some commercial arm of the university; it goes to university funding.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-10-30,"—The Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements Legislation Amendment (Private Trusts and Private Companies—Integrity of Means Testing) Bill 2000, as its title implies, relates to the means testing of private trusts and private companies in relation to social security and veterans' entitlements. This issue goes to what has become a fundamental component of our social security system—that is, means testing arrangements, particularly assets tests in relation to this issue.
Certainly there has been a growth in recent times in the use of trusts and other mechanisms to hide assets and to distort income—but particularly in relation to assets—and that can give a distorted outcome in terms of the intent of the Social Security Act, which is structured now so that only people who come underneath certain assets tests are entitled to payments. It is reasonably clear that a number of people are using trusts and other arrangements to create an incorrect impression of their assets and thus gain entitlements that they might otherwise not be able to gain. There are similar issues in relation to the taxation system, which obviously are not dealt with in this legislation. These have also been the subject of some debate through the political and policy process in recent years, and this is also an area where some action is pending.
The Democrats support the thrust and the intent of what the government is doing here. It clearly is aimed at saving a significant amount of money over a period of time. That is something that is always a bonus. Whenever we are amending social security legislation it is always a concern of the Democrats, as I think I have said many times before in this place, to look at whether or not people's entitlements and assistance are being taken away. Clearly this is a bill that seeks to take away some people's entitlement and access to social security payments. That is normally a cause for concern for the Democrats, because we are always concerned about people who are not well off having their entitlements further reduced. However, in this case we are talking about people who are reasonably well off in terms of assets and, given the nature of our social security system, it is appropriate that people who are well off in terms of assets should have those assets taken into account in determining their social security entitlement. 
The thrust of this legislation is something the Democrats are supportive of. I am not sure whether or not the opposition have any amendments. I have not seen any circulated in relation to this, but if there are any then I am sure they will be explained and elaborated on clearly and cogently by the opposition, and we will consider any arguments they put forward at that time. But at this stage, in the second reading debate on this bill, I think it is appropriate to indicate the Democrats' support for the thrust of the legislation.
This is not legislation about which we have received particularly significant concerns from the community. Certainly in social security areas I try to as much as possible ensure that I consult with members of the community and people who are potentially affected to make sure that they are aware of the changes and to identify any potential concerns. These proposed changes were flagged by the government some time back, so people have already had some notice about the desirability of them restructuring their affairs or identifying what the potential impact on them is going to be. If this legislation is passed there will be some time still before the measures come into effect. This obviously will provide people with more time again to assess whether or not they will be affected by these changes.
There are some specific arrangements in relation to farmers and farming families, recognising the special nature of that type of activity and the relationship that trusts have in terms of the normal operations of farms. This bill aims to identify people who are artificially structuring their affairs through the use of trusts and other mechanisms to create a false impression of their assets—to deflate the amount of their assets—for social security purposes, and that intent is one the Democrats share. As I said, any amendments that may be put forward we are willing to consider when we get to the committee stage of the debate, but at this point in time I think it is appropriate to indicate our support for the intent, the thrust and content of the legislation as it stands. Certainly at this second reading stage the Democrats indicate our support for this legislation.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PRIVATE TRUSTS AND PRIVATE COMPANIES—INTEGRITY OF MEANS TESTING) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-10-30,"—I rise to speak on the Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements Legislation Amendment (Private Trusts and Private Companies—Integrity of Means Testing) Bill 2000, a complex title if ever there was one. This bill aims to tighten the treatment of assets and income held by social security and veterans affairs recipients through their involvement in private trusts and private companies. Labor, like the Democrats, will be supporting the bill, but we will be seeking to move an amendment to address what we see as an overly long implementation period.
The bill serves to demonstrate the now familiar double standards that the coalition applies to different sections of our community. The government can never move quickly enough when it comes to imposing penalties on ordinary families struggling to get ahead. It can never move quickly enough when it comes to breaching unemployed persons doing their level best to clear even higher hurdles; yet when it comes to addressing the ability of wealthy individuals to draw on social security benefits the government seems rather more sluggish, and that is the central concern we have with this bill. Our primary concern is the lengthy delay before the means testing provisions contained in the bill will come into force. For Labor, 2002 seems to be Sunday too far away. We were bemused and concerned that, in the second reading debate in the House of Representatives, the Minister for Community Services said: 
The measure was announced on budget night, so individuals and financial advisers will have sufficient time to acquaint themselves with the content and operation of the legislation prior to the commencement of the measure on 1 January 2002.
This statement serves to invite those under scrutiny to rearrange their affairs before the new rules commence. We accept that there needed to be some warning for people to take into consideration those changes in legislation, but these people will continue to collect social security benefits while they restructure their affairs. If the restructuring is successful, they will be able to receive benefits ad infinitum. It seems to me that this is an overly generous approach by the government and one, as I say, not provided to other persons in the social security area.
Broadly speaking, the bill aims to ensure that customers who hold their assets in private companies or private trusts receive comparable treatment under the means test to those customers who hold their assets directly. Existing provisions in the Social Security Act provide for income and assets held in a trust or private company to be attributed to an individual but only when transparent arrangements exist. As noted in the minister's discussion paper released in November last year, trust structures have developed considerably since the original asset testing provisions were introduced in the mid-1980s. Since this time some have sought to use increasingly complex structures to hide income and assets that would otherwise be attributed to them. Under this bill the assets and income of the structure will be attributed to the person or persons who control the company or trust or to the person or persons who were the source of the capital or corpus of the company or trust.
The opposition support moves to act on wealthy individuals who seek to rort the system—individuals with the means to circumvent the income and assets test which will apply to other social security applicants who cannot conceal their assets in a web of remote trusts or companies. Australians need to feel confident that the social security safety net which they value and fund is used to support only those in genuine need. It is pleasing to see the government making some moves to achieve that end. It seems the coalition has travelled a long way since 1984 in its bitter opposition to the introduction of the assets test by the Hawke government. As my colleague Wayne Swan pointed out in the other place, the coalition so opposed the assets test legislation at that time that it moved a private member's bill in March 1985 to abolish it completely. That does give us some cause for concern about the government's commitment and sincerity on some of these issues.
As I have indicated, our major concern is that the bill, as it is drafted, will give wealthy individuals a break from accountability by failing to implement the means testing provisions until the start of 2002. A second fatal flaw is restricting the application of the source test to contributions made after the budget night this year. The purpose of the source test—one of the two major tests designed to give effect to the provisions of the bill—is to determine the original contributor to assets held in trust. Once again I think the timing provisions serve to undermine the government's rationale for introducing legislation to treat individuals in like circumstances equally. By applying the source test to post-budget contributions only, individuals will be treated differently depending on whether their assets were diverted into trusts or companies before or after the Treasurer's budget night address. This strikes me as having no foundation in logic or good public policy. I would be interested in hearing from the minister why that is occurring and what the thinking behind it was.
Labor is far from convinced that the government are serious about tackling inequities in the application of income and asset tests. One of the most damaging legacies of four years of a coalition government has been their determination to brand all social security recipients as rorters, bludgers or welfare cheats—this is their language, not mine. On previous occasions when Labor has made this claim the minister has dismissed its validity; yet the minister is part of this government and the cabinet has carefully crafted the rort card as a key coalition campaign theme. 
During the last election voters received a letter from the Prime Minister with an attachment headed `250,000 welfare cheats caught'. It is disingenuous to argue that the minister would not have been party to such a release or would not have been fully aware that more than 240,000 of these individuals were not welfare cheats but persons who had debts raised against them due to Centrelink payment errors. If the minister and the government were honest, I think they would acknowledge that few people rort the system. Only 0.1 per cent of those audited are convicted. This rate has barely budged from the levels recorded under the former Labor government in the early nineties. Indeed it was Labor who implemented most of the compliance activities that the current government pursues.
Given the focus of this debate I think it is timely to draw on the Commonwealth Ombudsman's latest annual report. The Ombudsman states that, while there is much rhetoric in the media about overpayments resulting from welfare fraud, the majority of complaints they receive about overpayments are from:
... customers who have done their best to comply with their obligations to report earnings or who find they have been overpaid through no fault of their own.
The Ombudsman continues:
On investigation we often find that in these cases the error has resulted from Centrelink's computer programming or from the complex legislative design of the payments themselves.
The FACS annual report provides further evidence of the government's policy priorities and administrative errors. Since 1997-98 the number of breach penalties applied by Centrelink has increased by 175 per cent. However, of the 474,000 breaches imposed on job seekers last financial year, 172,000 were overturned on appeal. Nearly 40 per cent of all breaches applied by Centrelink are now overturned following investigation. While the exposure of the baseless nature of the government's claims is to be welcomed, the coalition is not easily deterred. I understand the 2000-01 budget has allocated in excess of $8 million for an advertising blitz on welfare fraud. Undoubtedly we will see the products of this expenditure in the next election campaign, just as we saw it in the last.
The government's campaign against low income individuals and families stands in sharp contrast to their preparedness to watch the grass grow when it comes to cracking down on wealthy individuals milking the system. I think this approach is offensive in its intent and, as I say, Labor is most concerned. In order to plug the apparent loopholes Labor will be seeking to bring forward the means testing provisions from 1 January 2002 to 1 March 2001. By doing so, we hope to stop the rot that the Minister for Community Services alluded to in his second reading speech. We do not wish to invite those operating trusts and private companies, armed with a bevy of accountants, lawyers and financial planners, to examine the legislation detail and rearrange their affairs to undermine its intent. As I say, I am also interested to hear the minister's explanation of the rules regarding the source test and why it will apply only to those who have dispersed assets into trusts and companies after 9 May this year.
But, as I say, our major concern with the bill is the commencement date. We have not been convinced by the government's rationale as to why we have an excessive delay in implementing the tightening of the system for those who have been using private trusts and private companies to increase their access to social security benefits to which ordinarily they would not be entitled. Labor are keen to bring that tightening measure forward. As I say, we support the thrust of the measure, but we see no reason why the delay should be so lengthy as to not see this being implemented, following the budget decision, until at least the start of 2000.",SENATE,<title>SOCIAL SECURITY AND VETERANS' ENTITLEMENTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PRIVATE TRUSTS AND PRIVATE COMPANIES—INTEGRITY OF MEANS TESTING) BILL 2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-10-30,"—The Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1999 contains a wide range of unrelated amendments to the one bill. The two main issues at stake are the repeal of the sunset clause on existing arrangements for graduate doctors to access Medicare provider numbers and the introduction of new arrangements for pathology specimen centres. Because the changes to the pathology collection arrangements require the introduction of a new fee that is a tax, there is an accompanying bill to implement the necessary financial measures. This second bill is the Health Insurance (Approved Pathology Specimen Collection Centres) Tax Bill 1999. There are various other changes that refine the definition of various matters in the Health Insurance Act to make enforcement more easily achievable and to bring the procedures for registering overseas doctors on permanent and temporary visas into line. These do not raise significant policy issues, and the opposition has no objection to these amendments. I will therefore confine my comments today to the opposition's position on each of the major two issues. 
Items 7 and 9 of this bill seek to remove the sunset clause in the Health Insurance Act 1973, which relates to the arrangements for issuing provider numbers to young doctors in training. The opposition does not support the early removal of this sunset clause. The young doctors affected by this policy object to both the thrust of the current arrangements and the way they were imposed in 1996. The opposition supports the board principle that graduate trainees should be in a different category to fully registered doctors who have completed their training. It is not appropriate for young doctors to have unrestricted Medicare provider numbers, as they are still going through paid training to acquire the full range of skills that they require as a specialist or as a general practitioner. The doctors in training that the opposition has consulted agree with this.
The sunset clause was inserted by the opposition and the Democrats in order to get the government to examine how well these arrangements were working. In addition, a report was required after three years to examine the impact of the new scheme. This review was undertaken by former Liberal New South Wales Minister for Health Ron Phillips and was tabled just before the deadline in December 1999. It made few clear-cut recommendations and referred all the critical issues off for further study. However, it did recommend the repeal of the sunset clause to give certainty to young doctors about the arrangements that will apply in future. The opposition does not support this recommendation and will be opposing the removal of the sunset clause for a number of reasons.
Firstly, there is no clear-cut evidence that the new arrangements are working. The maldistribution of doctors in rural Australia is as bad as it was in 1996. More than anything, rural Australians need the facts and some way to measure whether the government is living up to its rhetoric. The government has refused to provide the latest figures for full-time equivalent doctors in rural Australia. The minister has been using the figure of an increase of 11 per cent over four years for the total number of doctors billing Medicare from rural areas, but he has publicly acknowledged that these are misleading figures because they include a large number of temporary placements occurring for short periods. The only meaningful data is the number of full-time equivalent doctors practising in these areas, and this data should be tabled so that we can see what impact the government policies are having. In addition, the minister should reveal how much of the recent improvement has been because of the use of overseas temporary resident doctors to plug gaps. Rural Australia needs long-term solutions and, to date, we have only seen short-term stopgaps that have alienated young doctors and exacerbated the problem.
Secondly, the government has introduced a succession of changes, including those currently being discussed for bonded rural scholarships and the changes to GP training. Several key elements are still being negotiated behind closed doors. For more than a year, the government has been promising an overall strategy, which was being prepared by Dr John Best. Unfortunately, his report called Rural stocktake was unhelpful and failed to deliver any solutions, despite costing over $300,000. The government policy on training has lacked coherence and there has been instability caused by the succession of proposals to tackle the major issue of rural doctor shortages. This year's budget measures, including a former bonded scholarship, have brought the government position closer to that of Labor.
There is no doubt that Australia needs to address the long-term imbalance in the distribution of doctors between urban and rural Australia. A solution depends on a well-thought-out strategy that starts with the recruitment of doctors into medical schools and goes right through to the allocation of resources for fully trained doctors. We cannot continue to rely on trainee doctors in their pre-vocational years and newly arrived overseas trained doctors as stopgaps without seeing a dramatic decline in the standard of rural health services. I think that most young doctors now accept that Australia will not go back to the days when graduates could get unrestricted provider numbers. What the junior doctors objected to, and what they still object to, is the artificially rigid rules that the government adopted back in 1996, which have given rise to various anomalies and problems for young doctors making decisions about which area of medicine they wish to practise in for the main part of their careers. 
The government has not listened to the arguments that young doctors have put forward through their representatives in the AMA, the Association for Salaried Medical Officers and the Health and Research Employees Association. Perhaps if the minister were paying his own dues he might be listening more attentively. There is a huge problem with the medical work force, particularly for ensuring adequate numbers of doctors in rural areas and in some less popular specialities. The minister has made a series of adjustments on the run, changing the rules to use partially trained graduates to plug gaps.
The minister has also failed to provide any evidence at all for his claim that failure to remove this sunset clause will result in 150 young doctors deserting rural Australia almost overnight at a cost of $248 million. There is no sign at all that doctors training in the bush will march into the cities if the sunset clause remains. They are all currently occupying positions and working towards their career plans. The maintenance of the sunset clause gives them some hope that there will be a proper re-examination of the current arrangements by 2002. The sunset clause is in place now and, unless the government gets its way, it will be in place for the next 2½ years. There is no reason for any young doctor to change their plans. The claim that there is support for repeal of the sunset clause on the grounds it would provide certainty has been strongly rejected by the young doctors who point out the lack of justification for this conclusion in the Phillips report. Removing the sunset clause would create further uncertainty.
The final reason that Labor will not support the removal of the sunset clause is that the minister's policies are just simply unsafe. Students are being sent to remote locations to practise far from support and supervision. One young doctor has spoken of being sent to a particular country town with a list of six phone numbers of doctors who might be able to help. It turned out that these doctors were often not available and the young doctor was very apprehensive about being confronted with the responsibility for a medical emergency which they were not yet ready to manage unassisted. Ron Phillips highlighted the contradiction in the minister's position that trainee doctors are not suitable to be allowed to practise in a supervised situation as part of a GP practice yet they are suitable to be sent to remote places to work without supervision. For all these reasons, the opposition is firmly of the belief that the sunset clause should stay until stability has been given to the training program. The government needs to work through the agenda of grievances raised by the students, and it needs to learn how to listen if it is to have any more success with its rural health initiatives.
I now turn to the reforms proposed for the pathology collection centre arrangements. In the year to June 1999 there were some 55 million pathology services delivered at a cost of over $1 billion and 80 per cent of these services were bulk-billed. Generally the opposition supports these measures which have their roots in actions commenced in the early 1990s when Labor was in government. The objectives of the measures are to encourage more judicious use of pathology, to improve the quality of services and to improve communication. The industry has matured since its early days when sharp practices and overservicing were not uncommon. The industry has stabilised around the public sector laboratories in hospitals and the private sector providers who have coalesced into half a dozen major groups.  
The two pathology funding agreements have added further stability to the environment with predictable budget outlays for government. There is a need to now focus on the quality of service delivery and education of doctors and pathology providers to ensure appropriate ordering and utilisation of services. I note that the government announced an initiative in this area as part of last year's budget, but no progress has since been made. The pendulum has swung perhaps too far in favour of centralisation of the industry and there is a risk that standards will decline if there is not healthy competition in the private sector and if a strong public sector network of pathology laboratories is not maintained.
I note in this year's budget that it is proposed to change the funding for urban public practices from the health program grants into the Medicare benefits schedule under the pathology agreement. The impact of this will need to be carefully considered. The specific effect of the changes in this bill will be to bring the system applying to approvals for licensing of public and private collection centres more into alignment. This will have some competitive neutrality advantages, but there are some issues concerning the impact of the arrangements on public pathology laboratories particularly in hospitals in regional centres. It is understood that a lot of behind the scenes discussions have been taking place about the allocations of quota between the public and the private sectors and that agreement has now been reached. 
The minister should be careful that his boundless enthusiasm for the private sector does not blind him to the critical role that the public sector laboratories provide. The private sector has specialised in high volumes and a strong network of collection centres in urban Australia. The public sector undertakes many of the more specialised tests that are not profitable for the private sector to tackle. In fact there is a strong flow of samples collected in the private system being directed to public laboratories for specialised analysis. Importantly, the small public laboratories attached to many rural hospitals are the only service providers that exist in many areas. The private sector has been loath to replicate its collection network outside of major cities despite the three-for-one collection centre incentive offered by the government. 
The opposition will be moving two amendments to this bill in relation to the arrangements for pathology providers. The first major concern the opposition has is that the bill will threaten the viability of small pathology services in rural areas. Many of the rural parts of Australia are dependent on public hospital based services. Private pathology is dependent on samples being couriered to larger laboratories in metropolitan areas with a consequential loss of time and service delivery. I am very conscious of the Prime Minister's declaration in Nyngan that his government had seen the red light flashing about the anger in rural Australia over the impact his government's policies have had on rural areas. The message does not seem to have got through to the architects of this bill. If there is a red light flashing in the minister's office, he is obviously not paying attention, because he has put no safeguards in this legislation to ensure that rural pathology collection centres are not lost. The opposition will be moving an amendment to require the reporting of the numbers of public and private collection centres for each major statistical division so that the community can see the impact of this legislation and whether it results in a further shrinking of public provision of pathology services and a loss of services in rural Australia.
The second major concern is that the proposed arrangements for the issuing of new licences are biased against new entrants and will further entrench the domination of the industry by a few larger players. The backbone of the industry will remain the large groups but it would be anticompetitive if the barriers to new entrants were allowed to remain as steep as they currently are. The second amendment to be moved by the opposition will simply require the minister to ensure that the approval principles will promote fair competition and the entry of new players. It is important that the minister sets the rules so that they do not squash competition and encourage further centralisation of this industry. 
I recognise that there is a wider review under way at the moment looking at the legislation, but the government has been unable to provide a commitment that this will adequately deal with the application of the national competition policy to this sector. Originally the government said that this bill was urgent but it has taken more than six months to be brought on for debate. The opposition can have no confidence that the next stage of reform will be given any higher priority, and hence it would be wrong for this bill to proceed in its current—and, we believe, anticompetitive—form. I hope that the government recognises this weakness in its scheme and agrees to the opposition amendments. I look forward to that debate when we move to the committee stage.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 4) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,2000-10-30,"—I will start where Senator Chris Evans left off, looking at the sections of the health bills which deal with pathology. We do support the legislative framework for new arrangements under the Medicare benefits schedule for collection centres. In recent years, pathology services have become an increasingly large component of Medicare expenditure. In 1998-99 Medicare paid out over $1 billion in pathology benefits. This government and previous governments have been concerned for some time about the increase in the costs to the community of pathology services. Indeed, for almost 20 years governments have been attempting to introduce, through regulatory measures, various processes that would slow down the growth and the blow-out in the budget.
There is, unfortunately, potential in areas such as pathology for unscrupulous operators to take advantage of government subsidies and to overservice. I have been through, on a number of occasions, a very interesting exercise with the providers of pathology services who are very concerned about this trend. They described how they were able to chart government measures which slowed down the growth only to see it take off again before another measure slowed it down. This is something the previous Labor government was tackling and now this government is tackling. Of course the various claims that have been made over the years about overservicing and kickbacks are unfortunately well known.
But this now has prompted the government to reach an agreement with the pathology profession to cap outlays on pathology services over the course of the three-year agreement. This agreement was very successful. In May 1999, the government and the pathology profession entered a second agreement, called the Pathology Quality and Outcomes Agreement, which is due to run until 2002. I would like to congratulate the government and particularly the pathology profession on this agreement. Basically, they have agreed to restrict to five per cent the average rate of growth of pathology outlays under the medical benefits scheme. A very important part of this agreement is what we are dealing with now; that is, the change to the licensing agreements for pathology collection centres. In order to claim a Medicare benefit for pathology services, the specimens must currently be collected in a licensed collection centre or by an employee of the approved pathology authority, which is the proprietor of the relevant laboratory. Under these amendments, such collection will be undertaken at an approved collection centre. The amendments also replace the present arrangements relating to licensed collection centres with simplified arrangements for approved collection centres. The restriction that prevents approved pathology authorities constituted by a state or territory from operating licensed collection centres will not apply to approved collection centres. As I said, we support these amendments. We have looked with interest at some of the changes the opposition are proposing, particularly other reporting, which seems eminently sensible.
Another section of this legislation relates to overseas trained doctors. Basically, we still cannot get sufficient doctors in rural and remote areas and also in some difficult to staff positions in our cities—particularly in public hospitals. Therefore, temporary resident doctors have become a fact of life in many communities. They play a very important role. Unfortunately, looking at some of the letters that have crossed my desk, the situation has got to the point where no sooner has the doctor settled in and the community begun identifying with the doctor than that particular person finds difficulties with their visa. The recruitment process for temporary resident doctors seems to be overly complex. It can be considerably cumbersome and time consuming and often involves a large number of government departments and other authorities. The problems with the recruitment process mean that, when a doctor's visa expires, if the doctor wants to stay and the community in which they work want them to stay, there is a considerable lapse of time and dislocation in order to get the difficulties sorted out. In many cases the community faces yet another long period of being without a doctor before this doctor returns or another temporary resident doctor is in his or her place. I am pleased to say that this legislation came about as a result of an agreement with Australia's health ministers in August last year and is a new framework for the recruitment of overseas trained doctors.  
We support this legislation and welcome the fact that this bill brings it into effect. It gives the medical boards greater flexibility, and should make the process much simpler for those overseas trained doctors that are being recruited here to work on a temporary basis to fill the vacancies that we simply cannot find Australian doctors to fill. I also support the introduction of a process to ensure that existing permanent residents who trained as doctors overseas are considered before new temporary resident doctors are recruited. This gives greater opportunity to those who are already permanent residents to have their qualifications recognised. Doctors who have made a commitment to come to Australia and who have worked here successfully for a period of time should be given priority consideration before others are recruited.
This brings me to the final issue in this legislation; that is, the removal of the sunset clause. We do not believe that the time is right to get rid of the sunset clause. It is a very useful tool in assisting us to monitor progress, particularly in rural and remote health, with the various incentives. We are seeking to split the bill to separate out the sections that need to be dealt with tonight and the section that relates to the sunset clause. We acknowledge that the government has addressed some of the concerns of doctors, particularly young doctors and doctors who are in training. In relation to private emergency services, I think we now need some time to see if they are going to work. But we thank the minister for the attention he has paid to this matter. We hope that it will be shown over the coming months that the services do work. We have some concerns about the training of general practitioners, in particular pre-vocational experience and training, and they are still to be addressed. There is no real urgency: we have got until the end of December next year—that is, 2001—before the sunset clause comes into play. I think the most appropriate course of action is not to defeat it, because we want it to stay there. We do not want to send a message that we are likely to eventually walk away from it. But at this point in time we simply should put it to one side and deal with it in six or eight months time when we have had a better opportunity to see how the various concerns of doctors have been met. Looking to the legislation we have to deal with in the next week or so as far as the rural health initiatives relating to bonded scholarships are concerned and the measures that have been put in place for allied health, particularly the additional amount of money to be spent in that area, we will have a better idea in six or eight months time as to how it is all shaping up and coming together.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 4) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"West, Sen Sue",ALP,2000-10-30,"—The Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1999 and the related bill that we are debating tonight are two very important bills. They relate very much to an issue in an area that I have great concerns about. I will start by declaring an interest. I am a member of the two colleges of nursing in this country and I am going to quote some of their material. I am also a member of the Health and Research Employees Association, which has concerns about the abolition of the sunset clause. So, up-front, I state my interest in and association with several of the organisations that have concerns about these bills. What these bills boil down to is the government looking at the issue of the provision of doctor services to rural areas. This government talk about a shortage of doctors in the country areas, but they cannot get through their heads that it is not a shortage of doctors in rural areas. There is, in fact, no shortage of doctors in this country; it is a maldistribution of where they practise. They would prefer to practise in the city areas rather than in the country areas, so there is an oversupply of doctors in city areas and a shortage in rural areas. 
But if you look at the other health professions, you will see there is a shortage of them across the board. There is a big shortage of nurses in the ACT, in New South Wales, in every state and territory in this country. There is a big shortage of registered nurses in just about all of the developed countries in the world. But what are the federal government doing to address that problem? Nothing, not a thing. They have chosen to ignore this problem. A health system does not run with just doctors; a health system requires a multidisciplinary team approach. It requires doctors, but it also requires nurses—be they enrolled nurses or registered nurses. It requires physiotherapists, speech therapists, podiatrists, social workers, occupational therapists, dietitians—to name but some. That is where this legislation and all of the legislation on health and the medical work force that this government have put through in recent times or will be putting through is deficient. The government are failing to address the issues, the real concerns and the real needs of the people of Australia, and particularly the people of rural Australia. That is the issue I want to pursue and have been pursuing for a number of years.
I have some questions and some issues that I would like the minister to address in his summing up or in the committee stage of the bill. They relate to the pathology specimen collection centres. In base hospitals in rural areas we have very good pathology systems—networks and units. What, I ask the minister, is going to happen to those? In many of those cases the hospital is not in the main street of town, which is easily accessible to everybody; the hospital is up on the hill, away from the doctors' surgeries in lots of cases and not as easily accessible for people when they go to the doctor, go to the chemist to get their prescription and go to have their blood taken. Base hospitals have put the collection centres down in the centre of town, which actually is a service to the people of those communities. It is providing a service for them so they can actually get the specimens collected at a place that is accessible.
The first elementary principle in the provision of a health service is accessibility. These collection centres are accessible, but they are outreaches of the main pathology centre which is up in the base hospital. How are they going to be affected by this legislation? We are now seeing the private sector move out to some of these areas of collection centres and outposts. I would be very upset if the private sector got an open slather and the public sector were restricted. With pathology services in the base hospitals, we are talking of level 4 types of hospitals, the ones that are just below the major teaching hospitals in the capital cities. They provide just about every service short of cardiac transplant and extremely complex neurosurgery. It is important for them to have a pathology service that is not actually costing them money and being a drain upon the public purse.
By them actually being able to provide this service down in the town, if someone has to go and have surgery they can go down to town, have their preoperative blood samples collected and the results will be up at the hospital when that person is admitted. I want to know how the government thinks this legislation will impact upon that group of collection services, because historically they have provided an excellent service, they are now providing an excellent service and they should be allowed to provide an excellent service into the future. I see what is happening with a number of the private ones. They have basically got a car running from point A to point B—60, 70 or 80 kilometres—with samples put in a car fridge and carried that way. That is not the same sort of high quality service that is being delivered by these public hospitals, particularly the base hospitals. So I certainly ask the government what they are going to do to address this issue. 
I now turn back to Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1999, because this is the bill that has the sunset clause in it. This is the one that is bringing into line procedures for registering overseas doctors on permanent and temporary visas. That is not a problem, because overseas trained doctors are providing almost the backbone in some areas of medical practitioner presence. The sunset clause is giving us some concerns, because this relates to some hasty legislation in 1996 which we had some concerns about. The opposition is very keen to see that doctors do continue to practise and do actually undertake training to become expert general practitioners and build up their skills there. That is not a problem.
The sunset clause was inserted by the opposition and the Democrats in 1996 to get the government to examine how well these arrangements were working. In addition, a report was required after three years to examine the impact of this new scheme. That review was undertaken by former Liberal New South Wales Minister for Health, Ron Phillips, who tabled it just before the deadline in December of last year. The report made few clear-cut recommendations and referred all of the critical areas for further study, which indicates that the opposition and the Democrats were correct in 1996 when we said there needed to be a review. This is a failure on the part of the government.
The opposition do not support the recommendation, and we are opposed to the removal of the sunset clause for a number of reasons. There is no clear-cut evidence that the new arrangements are working. The maldistribution of doctors in this country is as bad as it ever was—as bad as it was in 1996—but the government is getting fast, free and fancy with giving us statistics and information.
It is very hard to discern the number of full-time equivalents who are actually out there practising. When we were given the figure on this a couple of years ago it was very interesting. What I discovered through the estimates processes when I asked a question on this was that, while they might have been saying things like, `There has been an increase of so many per cent over however many years of doctors in rural areas'—this is done through billing though Medicare—when we did the hard work and found out the number of full-time equivalents there was no increase in the number of bodies out there.
It is fine for the minister to say, `There has been an increase of 11 per cent over four years in the total number of doctors billing Medicare from rural areas'—you can play with those figures any way you like—but I will tell you that there has been no improvement in the number of doctors out there in full-time positions. The government are now in a position where they are not going to give us those figures. Maybe the minister will give us those figures tonight; maybe the minister, through his department, can tonight give us a table indicating the number of full-time equivalents that have been billed under Medicare over the last five or six years. They have not done so up to now, so it will be very interesting to see if they will do so after this.
Of course one of the reasons they do not want to do that is that we have seen the feminisation of medicine. With the feminisation of medicine we have seen many female doctors choosing not to take on full-time loads. They are taking on part-time loads. While this is increasing the number of doctors out there, it is not increasing the number of full-time people. There is no increase in the number of actual hours being devoted to the practice of medicine. So it is a pea and thimble—smoke and mirrors—trick. The minister should also reveal how much of the recent improvement in percentages is due to overseas temporary resident doctors filling the gap. Australia does not need temporary residents coming in from overseas, coming in from anywhere, to fill the gap. We want long-term permanent solutions. We do not want trainees who feel compelled to go out there and we do not want temporary people. We want some continuity; we want some permanency. The government do not seem to be keen to go about encouraging that.
The government has introduced many changes, including bonded rural scholarships and changes to GP training. The key elements of these have been negotiated behind closed doors, so goodness knows what is going on out there. For more than a year the government has been promising an overall strategy, which was being prepared by Dr Best. His report, Rural Stocktake, was unhelpful and failed to deliver any solutions. The only thing it delivered was over $300,000 to Dr Best. It did not deliver any solutions or any assistance in terms of what we need to do to get doctors—let alone the rest of the health profession—to come and stay in rural areas. As I said before, we cannot continue to rely on trainee doctors in their pre-vocational years or on newly arrived overseas trained doctors. This government and this minister have to do more than resort to smoke and mirrors. 
The government has not listened to the arguments put forward by the young doctors through their representatives on the AMA, the Association of Salaried Medical Officers and the Health and Research Employees Association. There is a huge problem with the medical work force and the health work force, particularly in ensuring adequate numbers of doctors, nurses, physios, speech therapists, OTs and all of the other health professionals in rural areas. The minister has made a series of adjustments on the run, changing the rules to use partially trained graduates to plug the gaps. This is not adequate in the least.
One has to wonder if the minister is doing the bidding of some of his doctor and medical organisation colleagues. I am prompted to look at the 48th annual New South Wales College of Nursing oration, given this year on 13 October by Mrs Betty Mitchell, MCN (NSW), titled `Rural and remote nurses: third world practitioners or saviours of the bush?'. Betty Mitchell has been involved in a lot of work in the development of the proposal for nurse practitioners—that is:
... an advanced role for nurses that both demonstrates leadership and crosses professional boundaries in the pursuit of a primary and community health focus for the people of rural and remote Australia in our care.
She goes on to say:
The work of the rural nurse can be marginalised by the dominance of the medical model and the public's continuing belief that a doctor is the health service. Hegney, a professor of rural nursing in Queensland, makes reference to this when she argues that in the presence of a continuing inability to recruit and retain a medical presence, rural nurses have successfully maintained a formal health service for many years.
While nurses in metropolitan areas phone nursing agencies to access relief staff in an emergency or during peak periods, their counterparts in rural and remote locations are relying on a nurse who may also be a farmer, station cook, or schoolteacher to their children. Nursing staff from agencies are in many cases 800 kilometres or two days drive away—if they are available at all.
That goes back to my first point about the national and international shortage of nurses. She goes on:
It is not unusual for Health Service Managers to be found working the night shift as they attempt to ensure their facility is adequately staffed.
That is what is happening in health in this country. This government says that all of the health services, apart from doctors, are the responsibility of the states. It is quite clear from these eminent people I have quoted that health is not just about doctors and acute hospital beds; it is about a multidisciplinary team. If you do not have that team, you do not have a health system. The Commonwealth does have a role in the work force issues of the other health professions, because it is the Commonwealth that pays the money to the universities to educate them. This government has made big cuts in higher education, and this is obviously one of the things impacting upon the rest of the health service provision. But this government is not caring about that at all. I urge people to read the New South Wales College of Nursing's 48th Annual Oration by Mrs Betty Mitchell, a woman who has made a major contribution to nursing and health services in western New South Wales. She said:
Nurses are the largest single occupational group within the health services in Australia. Where for many years each small community had a resident or visiting general practitioner, now the most senior health professionals in residence are often registered nurses.
The ongoing opposition from the medical profession to the role of the nurse practitioner is yet another example of the undervaluing of the expertise of the rural and remote nurse. The Australian Medical Association, along with the Royal College of General Practitioners stated in the Medical Observer of June 2000 that they were conjointly discussing a `War Plan'. 
Mrs Mitchell went on to say:
On hearing these words from my colleagues, I first thought that finally doctors were getting serious about health care in the bush. What aspects of the appalling rural health statistics were they planning war against?
She quoted Humphreys referring to the state of health of rural Australia being in crisis, with poorer outcomes: a higher death rate for indigenous people in this country and higher incidence of cervical cancer, diabetes and respiratory disease. She thought that maybe they were talking about injury rates, she thought maybe they were talking about the war on drugs and alcohol in rural areas, but she discovered that the `war' was about impeding the implementation of the nurse practitioner so as to preserve the monopoly status of medical practitioners rather than exploring with an open mind other models of primary health care. That was the `war plan' that was being talked about. Later she talked about the need for all health professionals in rural areas to work together and not to feel that they are at war with one another. She said:
All health professionals are under siege in rural areas, doctors as well as nurses. Yet the Commonwealth Government has recognised the problem in regard to medical staff, and is actively working to alleviate it. The last Federal budget included a number of incentives for medical graduates, aimed at enticing them down to the bush. However, as Mahnken makes clear, large financial enticements and other incentives have not made more doctors want to go to rural areas and provide services. Most of the challenges facing nurses in these areas remain largely unsolved, and yes, ignored by the Commonwealth government.
I think the words of Betty Mitchell are well worth pondering, because this government has failed to address adequately the issue of the health work force—not the medical work force but the health work force. The government is not answering the call for the provision of health services to all of Australia. By health services, I mean all of the health professionals. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 4) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Crowley, Sen Rosemary",ALP,2000-10-30,"—I rise to speak on this Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1999. By way of opening I would like to simply say, as I have said a number of times in this Senate over past years, that titles like that of the Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1999 are not really helpful because they do not give you much clue as to what the bill is about. I take the opportunity to make the point yet again that information—for example, the title of the second bill is Health Insurance (Approved Pathology Specimen Collection Centres) Tax Bill 1999—certainly goes a long way to assisting me with some understanding. If, on behalf of the citizens out there, I were looking at the latest health legislation before the Senate, this would be just another amendment bill. The title does not give a clue as to what the legislation is about. I put that on the record yet again. I think it is something I learned from my years on the Scrutiny of Bills Committee when we were looking to make sure that legislation was at least nominally accessible to the community. One of the great rights of people is to know the law that will affect them. There are a number of points that my colleague Senator West has made, and I would like to try to come back to those.
—I could do it firstly, but I think I will try to get back to it secondly, Senator West. I want to pick up on some of the points that you were making particularly about the amendment to remove the sunset clause in this bill. It is extremely interesting that this is the government's proposal.
The doctors who were affected in 1996—and the doctors who are still affected—object to it. I think it is particularly important that, while we gave them very short shrift in 1996, we take different notice of them now when we have the opportunity to. I am pretty sure I spoke back then about the very unfair and arbitrary the way the changes to access to vocational registration provider numbers—or Medicare provider numbers—fell very unfairly on some medical graduates. Down came the crunch! There was not a period of a year or two to phase it in; it just fell. I remember Senator Cooney and me both speaking against the arbitrary unfairness of it. I should say—as I suspect Senator Cooney did at the time—that we both had a conflict of interest in that somebody close—a remote or close family relative—was experiencing the sort of restriction that fell as a result of that legislation. 
I certainly believed that it was important to oppose it then, and I certainly believe it is important that we argue tonight against the removal of the sunset clause so that an ongoing review of this provision is maintained in legislation to ensure that we do follow up and review whether it has been effective. An advantage of having been in government before this government came in is that I remember well Senator Herron being one of those who constantly castigated the Labor government because we failed to reduce the number of foreign medical graduates servicing rural Australia. I am sure you will remember saying all those words, Senator Herron.
—He didn't like late sitting hours either.
—He did not, but refrain from telling him that I said all of that 20 years earlier, so never mind. Senator Herron was one of those who railed against the Labor government for its failure to reduce the number of foreign doctors in Australia who were working in country areas, and then what did they do when they got into government? Goodness me, they actually increased the numbers of doctors coming from overseas into this country. My objection all along has been that this government's proposal was actually to restrict the number of medical school places for young Australian graduates and increase the number of doctors coming from overseas. I still believe that that is something we should oppose very strenuously. It is my view that young Australians should have an opportunity to go through medical school if they are competent and selected to win a place in such medical schools, and we should be working to make sure that it is young Australians who graduate and it is those people who are then encouraged to work in rural areas in Australia. What we need is innovative, creative and imaginative ways of training our young graduates so that they feel competent and confident to go and work in rural areas where they are remote from the support and fall back assistance that they would get from working in a city close to large hospitals or other medical colleagues.
This is called remembrance of times past—I will not try to do it in French—and Proust prompts my recollection at this point because I actually also chaired a Senate select committee inquiring into vocational registration of doctors, and I am pleased to note that at the time the deputy chair was the then Senator Peter Baume. We had an extremely fruitful inquiry at that time. We certainly came down in favour of vocational registration for doctors, but we had the assistance of the very interesting deliberations of the then Senator Glen Shiel, who also was a medical practitioner and who used to say such lovely things as, `When I was a student' or `Back then, we'. Senator Herron is smiling with recollection at this point, or, if not recollection, then at least with sympathy for that view. There was a time when doctors who went through medical schools in this country felt confident to go and practise medicine in rural and regional areas of Australia. But the evidence coming to us during the vocational registration inquiry, which really shook and shocked Senator Shiel, was that lots of doctors said that, when they had finished their training, they did not feel confident to go and practise in rural and remote Australia. I think that is one of the very important areas where some steps are being taken, but more need to be taken to provide that kind of training for doctors so that they have that kind of competence and confidence. I believe that that is very much a matter for curriculums within our medical schools, but also experience during the undergraduate and immediate postgraduate years, so that young doctors feel that they can pick up and cope with most of the situations that present in rural and remote areas of Australia. I think it would be much better to be developing our courses, our curriculum and our funding assistance for medical practitioners in this country rather than bringing in graduates from overseas and then providing ways in which the training for short-term and long-term foreign medical graduates can be adjusted so as to assist more of the foreign doctors to stay. 
It requires more money, more imagination and more persistence, and it requires long-term planning. We do not really have that. We have arbitrary changes, and we have some words to the effect that we would like to see improvement for young Australian graduates going to rural and remote areas, but we have not seen the change on the ground. As Senator West pointed out, the data is not available to show whether there has been a real increase in the numbers of doctors practising or whether they indeed are foreign graduates or whether they are cumulative figures that do not allow the distinctions to be drawn that Senator West was highlighting. Certainly I think those points are matters of major concern.
I had the pleasure of being visited this morning by the Rural Health Alliance, and some of the points that they made are very pertinent to this legislation. They are particularly concerned about the maintenance of suitable infrastructure in rural and regional areas in Australia. I asked them to say exactly what they meant by `infrastructure'—and certainly it means facilities like banks and so on—and in particular they were concerned that infrastructure be understood to mean the people living in rural and regional areas and that those people have an opinion and are asked about what is best for them in terms of their health care. At the moment, we still simply do not talk enough to rural and regional Australia about what services and facilities would best suit them and in particular how best to get them. There have been some interesting changes, I know, to try to take some graduates into medical school from rural areas in the hope that they will then prefer to return to rural and regional areas to practise their health care.
I think there are some interesting winds of change blowing in that area. In my own state of South Australia there are places where, despite considerable financial inducements—increased salaries, nominal rental, if any at all, free housing near enough, practice assistance and all of that—doctors are not ready to go and serve in the rural areas of South Australia. So clearly we have a challenge. I believe that this proposal to remove this sunset clause about the arrangements for issuing provider numbers to young doctors is just jumping the gun. It is far too early for us to be complacent that the arrangements put in place will deliver and that seems to be a concern that is certainly strongly felt by the Labor opposition, but I think it is a concern that the Democrats have to some extent, and it is certainly something that we should be concerned about in terms of the reports that the government have done. We have heard mention of the inquiry done by a former Liberal New South Wales health minister, Ron Phillips, which came in before the requirement in December 1999. It made a few recommendations, and one of those was to give certainty to young doctors about arrangements that will apply in the future. Leaving the sunset clause there does not in any way take away the decisions that young doctors will be taking about how they will continue to practise their medicine, or at least I cannot imagine what the arguments for it are. I will be very pleased if the minister might like to try to give us some decent argument about what that recommendation really means. What is the uncertainty that young doctors are labouring under at the moment? It is nothing compared to the uncertainty that happened when the changes to Medicare numbers were popped on them—bang, dropped from a great height. That was certain, unfair, unkind and arbitrary—certain, but not satisfactory.
I do not have any understanding from looking at this proposal that doctors will be in a state of anxiety or insufficiency if this sunset clause is not removed. There is no evidence that those doctors who are practising in rural Australia will say, `Well, that's it. If they're not going to remove that sunset clause, I'm packing up and leaving.' Of course they are not. They are practising their health care in rural and regional Australia because they have made the choice to go there, because they are remarkably dedicated, because they are being supported and because they are genuinely trying to choose general practice in rural Australia as their career path. A clause in this legislation is not going to change that commitment by most of those doctors. 
I also note, as Senator West said, that the report of former minister Ron Phillips referred to the critical issues of further study. That highlights the point I was making earlier: that there is still the need for further imagination and creative alternatives in this area. We admit there is a problem. Even though Minister Herron will not want to say that we were doing some of the right things when we were in government, we were. If he were genuine and generous—
—I did say that.
—He has just found the words. Minister Herron, I very much appreciate that interjection. He was generous and genuine, and he did acknowledge that we were doing some good things. 
—I called it a drop in the bedpan.
—He was vulgar and dismissive about it, but he was generous. What we do know though is that the Labor government were trying to address this problem. They knew it and they recognised it, just as the current government knows there is a problem. There is a major problem about getting appropriate and sufficient health services to rural and regional Australia. The maldistribution of doctors, despite the steps that this government has taken to this point, continues. There are claims by the government that it is better, but there is no substantial data to prove that. I would only echo Senator West's request that, if you have got the evidence over there, please pass it through to us and we will tick off on it. If you have not got it, you will understand why we do not believe there is really any significant change.
—$562 million over four years.
—I do not care how much you are paying. If there are no doctors out there, Senator, it is not making any difference. We appreciate that you are trying to put some funding out there. We tried to put funding out there, too. As I said, in South Australia there were arrangements, and there still are, for a huge financial incentive for doctors to go to rural areas, but they are not going. Secondly, Senator Glen Sheil put his finger on one of the important questions, which is that doctors might be able to go but they feel unsure and they lack the confidence that they would know what to do in the face of many of the emergencies that would confront them. They have not been trained to be independent of public hospital backup, of pathology services, of blood supplies, of good pathology and so on. Even if you have made a difference with all those dollars that Senator Tambling mentioned in his interjection, there is still a major maldistribution of doctors in this country. Most of them are in the cities and very few of them are in rural and regional areas.
As I have said before, I think it is very disappointing that we are still encouraging, and increasingly encouraging, foreign medical graduates to come to Australia and then stay, rather than looking at encouraging Australian graduates through our medical schools. I think it can be done. I note that eight Aboriginal medical practitioners graduated from the University of Newcastle's medical school last year, and I will be very interested to see where those young graduates finish practising their medical care. I hope that they, like non-Aboriginal medical graduates, will choose to go into a variety of areas rather than expecting that all Aboriginal doctors will work in Aboriginal communities. Some will, some may not, but I am interested to see the outcome of that program. I think it is a clear indication of what can be done if you have a medical school with imagination. I was told today that I must start including James Cook University in that area, and I will of course include my own South Australian Flinders Medical Centre. I think Newcastle and Flinders have been very imaginative in their choice of students to take into medical undergraduate programs for a number of years. They have provided the lead to the rest of the country, and I am told that James Cook now deserves to be included in that trio. There is nothing like a bit of Queensland self-pro-motion. So we thank you, Senator Herron, for that little tick off on James Cook. I think it may be worthy of that tick.
—There's more good news soon. 
—But there's more. There is more than a drop in a bedpan, and we are pleased to see that. I want to talk about a couple of other areas, and the first is the changes in pathology. I do not want to go into the full detail of that, but in terms of infrastructure in rural areas, you are far more likely to find a small rural hospital that does a lot of medicine and health care in the rural areas. That is the point Senator West was making that I strongly reinforce—that is, in many areas it is the nurse who is the primary health care provider, the first port of call. You are far more likely to find a nurse than a doctor in many rural areas, and quite often the assistance that those small, publicly funded hospitals in rural areas provide is critical—in particular, the pathology service associated with those hospitals. I sincerely hope that the changes proposed in rural pathology do not actually undercut that critical infrastructure in rural and regional areas of Australia.
In closing, I have had a number of letters into my office of recent times about the importance of providing ongoing antenatal care, particularly by midwives or double certificate nurses as we used to call them—that is, they could be trained as midwives or they could be nurses who have done midwifery training as well. Some pilot programs that received funding for 12 months are beginning to make a considerable difference to the antenatal visits, for example, of Aboriginal folk in those areas, only to find that the funding is under threat after the 12 months because it is a pilot project and funding is not continuing any longer. I have certainly written to the minister and I hope that we can find some satisfaction, because worse than no health service is some health service for a bit which then goes away. I have urged the local communities in those areas to take up the fight on their own behalf, but I will certainly stand here and fight for them. If we have got services that are making a difference in an area, I think it is terribly important that one way or another we maintain those services. If people thought it was worth while to do a pilot project in the first place, then I believe it is very important that we give that pilot project time to be properly tested. Then if it seems to be making a difference—and on any of the evidence these projects are making a considerable difference—I would like to see us find the funding to sustain and maintain that program so that there is the ongoing continuity of better health care in the area. I do not believe that this amendment to the legislation to remove the sunset clause is going to change the state of rural health at all. I think it is very important that we keep it there so that we can keep an eye on what is actually happening with doctors, in particular, in rural areas and give young doctors the assurance that this parliament will continue to keep a close eye on the sorts of support for their presence in rural and regional Australia and on training to get them there and to sustain and maintain them there. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 4) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Gibbs, Sen Brenda",ALP,2000-10-30,"—The Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1999 contains a wide range of separate amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973. While the opposition is supporting the majority of changes that would come into effect under this bill, there are several issues that do cause us concern. These matters are quite important, and they are particularly important on two fronts—on the issue of how much we spend on health services in Australia and, more importantly, on the issue of how well we provide services across the whole of the nation. The first and most substantial of these concerns is the removal of the sunset clause on the policy that currently limits the access of graduate doctors to Medicare provider numbers.
At the end of 1996, parliament passed the Health Insurance Amendment Act. That act was put in place to implement a part of the 1996-97 budget. The legislation restricted access to Medicare provider numbers for graduate doctors unless they had completed extra training to become either a specialist or a general practitioner. This policy was vehemently opposed by young doctors, who were, understandably, concerned about restrictions placed on the direction of their career in the future. The measure was passed with several amendments—the most important of which was the insertion of a sunset clause. On a broad perspective, the opposition supports the notion that graduates should be in a different category from fully trained doctors who have completed their training. It would not be appropriate for young doctors to have full and unrestricted access to Medicare provider numbers while they were still undertaking training. 
When the relevant legislation passed in 1996, the Senate imposed two conditions. The first was for a report to be made to parliament before December last year on the effectiveness of the new arrangements. The second, as mentioned, was to place a sunset clause to remove the restrictions after 1 January 2002. The report was conducted by former New South Wales Liberal health minister Ron Phillips and was delivered last year. It made few recommendations and referred the critical issues off for further investigation. The study did recommend, however, that the sunset clause be repealed to provide certainty to young doctors about future arrangements. Young doctors rejected that view, wanting more time to examine other options.
The Senate introduced the sunset clause to ensure the government could demonstrate that the new arrangements were working before they were made permanent. The government has failed to show that these measures have worked. Indeed, there is evidence that the arrangements are failing to achieve their objectives at all. It is obvious that there needs to be some limitation to the provision of Medicare provider numbers. The opposition knows, as I think do student doctors, that we cannot go back to open slather entitlement to provider numbers. The opposition would like to see the long-term issues addressed.
There is a tendency for graduates to be used to fill gaps in rural Australia where they are not properly supervised and allowed to do work they are not fully trained for. The December 1999 Phillips report recommended the repeal of a number of regulations instituted by the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Dr Wooldridge, that allow students to work unsupervised doing night locum work. Obviously, many students are keen to get any general practice work, but it is inappropriate that insufficiently trained graduates be put to work in this manner. There are still a number of issues facing young doctors that need further investigation. The government has failed to show that these measures are working. Until it does and until it comes up with a long-term plan to tackle the problems, the sunset clause should remain in place.
Another major impact of this legislation is the changes to the operation and regulation of pathology collection centres. It is important that those changes are made, but it is important they are made in a sensible manner. During the 1998-99 financial year, the Commonwealth paid out over $1 billion worth of benefits for pathology services under the Medicare Benefits Schedule. A total of 55 million pathology services were provided over the same period, of which 80 per cent were bulk-billed. The previous Labor government first took steps to control costs in this sector early in the 1990s. Changes in 1992 have managed to reduce the rate at which pathology outlays were increasing from about 13 per cent every year in 1990-91 to an average yearly growth of six per cent in 1998-99.
As the pathology industry is currently structured, relatively few providers operate the bigger laboratories and a network of smaller collection centres takes samples. The right to operate a collection centre is allocated by a quota system. Since 1992, the total number of collection centres has been reduced from 2,246 to about 1,300. Public hospitals are not currently included in the quota system. However, some privatised hospitals have recently extended their collection base outside the hospitals to attract work ordered by general practitioners. The majority of public hospitals have pathology laboratories that often provide specialist services that the larger companies do not. The larger companies do not tend to provide specialist analytical services because they concentrate on high-volume tests that are more profitable. As the situation currently stands, public laboratories are not able to access the same fee structure as private laboratories. In particular, they are not entitled to receive the $15 patient initiation fee that is paid to private laboratories for every new customer. 
In response to the need for new technology that allows higher throughput, public hospital collection centres have expanded their catchment areas. This has caused some concern in the highly competitive private sector. The main effect of this bill as far as pathology collection centres are concerned is to move both public and private centres under the same quota rules. This may have some advantages in increasing competition, but there is a legitimate concern that the changes could weaken the public system and possibly force the closure of regional pathology services.
In Queensland pathology services are provided by a network of laboratories, both private and public. The public network consists of 30 laboratories based at public hospitals throughout the state, including Atherton, Charleville, Dalby, Kingaroy, Longreach, Thursday Island and Roma as well as more populous areas. Services provided at the centres include specimen collection, analytical testing, results interpretation, clinical consultation, teaching and research. The public sector conducts many of the particularly specialised tests that are not profitable for the private sector. There are numerous instances where samples collected by the private sector collection centres are sent to public laboratories for specialist analysis. The new rules that apply to the public system need to be fair, and we need to ensure that we are not increasing the barriers they face. The new rules should allow public hospitals to collect samples outside hospital premises so that they can remain competitive with the private sector.
Our proposed amendments would give force to the Prime Minister's promise that there will be no further closures of services in regional areas. These amendments would require that existing services in rural towns not be closed unless an equivalent service replaced them. It is essential that existing pathology services in smaller towns remain open and viable. My concern is that these regulations could mean that the publicly provided pathology services in the regional areas of Queensland that I mentioned could be forced to close. Rural and regional Australia is already doing it tough enough. This parliament should make sure that it does not do anything that would further jeopardise the viability of small towns. It would also be advantageous if the levelling of the playing field were to work in both directions. This would include reviewing the quota rules and funding arrangements that exclude public providers from payment of the patient initiation fee.
Another major part of this bill is designed to simplify the process whereby doctors from overseas are given short-term registration to practise medicine in this country. Overseas doctors work alongside Australian-trained doctors and the differing arrangements for medical registration can sometimes cause problems. Owing to a shortage of doctors able or willing to work in rural areas, there is much pressure to keep temporary resident doctors for extended periods in rural areas where they settle. The process for recruiting temporary resident doctors is very complex. It involves consultation with the state or territory government health department, the medical board from the relevant state or territory, the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, the Commonwealth Department of Health and Aged Care and finally the Health Insurance Commission. The issues are further complicated when a temporary resident doctor's visa expires. 
The measures in this bill seek to resolve the problems by aligning the registration requirements for temporary and permanent resident overseas-trained doctors. However, the opposition has some reservations that these measures will simply increase the reliance by rural Australia on overseas-trained doctors. This government needs to work harder to find a solution to the ongoing shortage of doctors in rural and regional Australia. The government needs to look to the longer term and plan a system that serves all of Australia and is viable into the future. In this year's budget the government did provide a firm commitment to rural health. Only time will tell whether the government's efforts prove worth while. 
In the meantime, the government needs to provide solutions that are more than just a short-term fix. It is difficult to overstate the importance of getting this right. There is too much at stake: the health of the nation and the viability of rural and regional towns in Australia. The right of young doctors to enter the profession with a degree of certainty about their future is also at stake. We need to ensure that we do not adopt measures that are little more than short-term solutions. While supporting most of this bill, the opposition has real concerns that some aspects of this legislation will undermine all of those goals. ",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 4) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,20,1,speech
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,2000-10-30,"—We are addressing the Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1999 and a related bill. At the outset, let me just provide some answers to the concerns expressed by Senator West, particularly about an impact on the public hospital system's capacity to collect specimens. Recognised public hospitals will not be affected adversely by these new arrangements. The new pathology specimen collection centre arrangements open up what was previously a private sector based arrangement under Medicare to a uniform system applicable to both the public and the private sectors for Medicare eligible pathology services. The restriction that prevents approved pathology authorities constituted by a state or territory from operating as licensed collection centres will not apply under the new arrangements. Recognised public hospitals will continue to operate specimen collection centres on premises at which they provide their core business—that is, hospital treatment to patients, be they inpatients or outpatients.
The regulation of collection centres, particularly community based ones, is aimed at ensuring quality centres and a uniform approach, be they operated by the public or the private sector. The definition of a recognised hospital has become less clear in recent years, as hospitals have changed the way they deliver their services and where they deliver them. This has made it more difficult to define what is part of a recognised hospital and what is not. For the purposes of these new arrangements, the definition of a recognised hospital has been redefined as being the premises of the hospital where hospital treatment is provided—that is, where accommodation and nursing care is provided. Some parties are claiming that this requires overnight stays. This is not the case, and it may include premises that provide day surgery or other treatments, such as renal dialysis units.
Senator West also asked towards the end of her speech that the government make available a statistical table. I would indicate that it is not convenient to make that table available now, but we will certainly take that matter on notice. I am sure it will be provided and I am sure that Senator West will pursue it at estimates or at other times and places. We are keen to always ensure that training, particularly for overseas doctors, is an issue that must be incorporated.
Senator West also raised a series of questions with regard to female participation in the Australian work force. It was quite coincidental that at that time my colleague Senator Herron was sitting here and amongst the correspondence he had before him was some very interesting information that I think would be of interest to Senator West. In fact, in information that was made available from the AMA Women in Medicine Committee, there was information specifically extracted from data from the Australian Medical Workforce Advisory Committee report which was entitled Female participation in the Australian medical workforce. The report states that in 1994 25.9 per cent of all working medical practitioners were female. The report also states:
In general, due to lower average hours of family commitments, female lifetime contribution is estimated to be 68 per cent of male lifetime contribution. For specialties this is high at 75 per cent of male lifetime contribution.
In regard to general practitioners, 31 per cent of the GP work force in Australia is female. The percentage of rural and remote female GPs is around 25 per cent. Of interest are participation rates per 100,000 population in higher education medical courses: 101.2 per 100,000 in capital cities and 12 per 100,000 in remote places. I am sure that Senator West will also be indebted to Senator Herron for making that information available. I am surprised that she did not have it. I presume that it would have been available to her through her extensive consultation with the AMA Women in Medicine Committee. 
There are two main parts to the legislation that is before us this evening, the Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1999 and the Health Insurance (Approved Pathology Specimen Collection Centres) Tax Bill 1999. The first part is the new arrangements for pathology specimen collection centres. As part of the 1999-2000 budget, the government announced a second three-year agreement with the two peak pathology professional bodies—the Australian Association of Pathology Practices, the AAPP; and the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia, the RCPA—to cap pathology expenditure under the Medicare benefits arrangement. The agreement provides a framework for managing growth in pathology expenditure under Medicare at an average of five per cent per year, facilitating further structural reform in the pathology sector and improving the quality in pathology testing use and practice.
On the issue of structural reform of the pathology sector, the agreement contains an outline of new arrangements for pathology specimen collection centres and an agreement to review the Commonwealth legislation that relates to pathology. The new collection centre arrangements have been agreed for pathology specimen collection centres to replace the licensed collection centres scheme. They will commence on proclamation and will be open to eligible public and private sector approved pathology authorities—that is, APAs with a GX or GY category, category 1 and 2, prior to 1 January 2000.
Under these new arrangements, the number of collection centres an APA can operate for Medicare benefit purposes is determined on the basis of its Medicare and Department of Veterans' Affairs pathology activity and on the basis of its satisfying quality guidelines on collection centres, facilities and services. Under the LCC scheme, the number of LCCs that an APA could operate was based on a global entitlement and was relative to the number of participants in the market rather than individual activity. These arrangements reflect a major shift. They replace the artificial constraints imposed by a fixed pool of licences with a system based on individual APA performance. This will open up the section to more competition by allowing more entrants without putting at risk the quality of facilities for patients and access to services.
The three-for-one incentive will remain, whereby an APA can convert one of its metropolitan collection centres to three collection centres in designated rural and remote areas of Australia. The existing licence fee will be retained in the form of an annual tax of $1,000 per approved collection centre. At the same time, the phase-in arrangements introduce a responsible management approach to not put at risk the cap on growth in pathology outlays that applies under the pathology agreement. These transitional arrangements have been negotiated with interested parties and will occur over four years to allow time for the pathology sector to adjust to a less regulated environment. The Health Insurance Commission will administer the new arrangements and implement programs to inspect and audit approved collection centres against business practices and the quality guidelines developed by the National Pathology Accreditation Advisory Council and the profession. In the consideration in detail stage, the government will be moving amendments related to the start date to make it from the date of proclamation.
The second main part of this bill is related to work force issues. The provider number legislation provides a vital platform from which a range of measures have been established both to improve the quality of health care delivery and to ensure that rural communities have adequate access to doctors. The sunset clause was inserted into the legislation in 1996 to provide a safeguard against concerns that there would be inadequate training positions for graduates and that doctors would be unemployed. The following data indicate that there is no basis for either concern. There are 1,525 training positions in 2000, which is more than adequate for the 1,200 doctors who graduate each year. There are continuing vacancies in training programs, psychiatry, rehabilitation medicine, geriatrics, obstetrics and gynaecology. There are continuing shortages of doctors in public hospitals. No doctor is involuntarily unemployed. 
The review of the provider number legislation undertaken by the Hon. Ron Phillips in 1999 did not find a single graduate who was unable to secure a training position and recommended that the sunset clause be repealed to give certainty to medical students and doctors in training. If the sunset clause is not repealed, the benefits that I have just outlined will be lost. The number of graduates entering training programs will decrease as they choose to enter the oversupplied general practice work force in metropolitan areas. Rural areas will have reduced access to doctors, and the savings to government will cease.
Repealing the sunset clause in the provider number legislation is also fundamental to maintaining current support structures for a number of initiatives the government has introduced to address these quality and distribution issues. Rolling section 3J of the act into proposed section 19AB will eliminate the double processing of temporary resident medical practitioners who commit to remain permanently in Australia to fill a medical or work force strategy. Senator Lees has raised the Democrats proposal to split the bill. We will accommodate this request and continue to discuss the important matter of the sunset clause with the Democrats to address their concerns. I commend the bill to the Senate.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2000-10-30,"—Today when I read the press clippings I found an article in the Sydney Morning Herald headlined `UN call on mandatory sentencing'. It referred to the fact that the United Nations special investigator into the independence of judges and lawyers had called for Australia's mandatory sentencing laws to be repealed. He said they were a breach of the rights of every individual to a fair trial. The interesting thing about that was that it came from Malaysia's Dato Param Cumaraswamy. He was speaking at a seminar held in Sydney over the weekend on Australia's mandatory sentencing laws. It is interesting that somebody from Malaysia made those comments and somebody from Malaysia is the United Nations special investigator into the independence of judges and lawyers, especially when we take into account recent events in Malaysia in relation to the former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim, who as we all know over the last year has been taken through the courts in Malaysia in a trial which some people feel perhaps was not a good example of the independence of judges and lawyers. 
His wife, Dr Wan Azizah, was recently in Australia. Far from being critical of Australia, Dr Wan Azizah expressed great thanks for the support which the Australian people and government in general have shown for the plight of her husband. On the Channel 9 Sunday program on 30 October 2000, Dr Wan Azizah said:
Australia is seen by Malaysians as a partner, I mean as a neighbour—it's very important in this region, a stabilising factor ...
And she said:
I will seek further support from (the Australian government) whatever they've been giving so far, and continuing to help propagate the message because the fight for Anwar's freedom is to fight for democracy, for justice, for truth.
I thought they were interesting comments that she should make. And it was interesting that this Malaysian individual Dato Param Cumaraswamy should have been the United Nations special investigator into the independence of judges and lawyers and that he was so critical of Australia.
The same article in the Sydney Morning Herald this morning reported that the chair of Oxfam—a British aid organisation which, over the years, has largely provided aid to Africa—a Ms Hedy D'Ancona, who is a Dutch national, in a report to the United Nations called for the federal government to legislate to invalidate the mandatory sentencing laws in both the Northern Territory and WA in what was described as a `damning' report claiming a lack of respect for indigenous people in both those Australian jurisdictions. Again, I think it is interesting that somebody from the United Nations should repeat that kind of call, because, as we all know, earlier this year the United Nations Committee on Human Rights very severely criticised Australia's mandatory sentencing laws, particularly in reference to the Northern Territory and Western Australia, as well as our general record on the treatment of Aboriginal people. As a result, Australia has been pilloried in the world's press. We have been held up as a bad example of a nation which subjects its indigenous people to a very vicious regime of mandatory sentencing and does nothing for them. In fact, the United Nations Committee on Human Rights described our laws as `draconian' and our record on Aboriginal affairs as `dismal'.
I think it is probably time a little bit of perspective was applied to the United Nations reports and their views on Australia's record on mandatory sentencing. On 18 April this year I heard a very interesting law report on Radio National with Susanna Lobez on the question of mandatory sentencing. The report was called Mandatory Sentencing—A Wider Perspective. Susanna Lobez interviewed Professor Arie Freiberg of the Department of Criminology at Melbourne University and also Dr Candace McCoy, who was visiting Wollongong University from the School of Criminal Justice at Rutgers University in the United States. These two professors made an international comparison of Australia's mandatory sentencing laws, and I have to say that comparison was enlightening, to say the least. They did not compare Australia's mandatory sentencing laws with those of countries like Malaysia or any of those other Third World countries which claim that the rule of law reigns supreme in their jurisdictions; they compared Australia's laws with those of other developed common law countries and specifically with those of the United States and the United Kingdom. The program presenter, Susanna Lobez, as I said, interviewed Professor Arie Freiberg, a professor of criminology at Melbourne University. One of the questions she asked him was how Australian mandatory sentencing laws compared to those in other developed common law countries. Professor's Frieberg's reply was, `Very minor, very minor.' In other words, he was saying that, compared to other common law countries, the mandatory sentencing laws in place in Australia were quite trivial. When he was asked to give an international perspective to the debate on Australian mandatory sentencing, Professor Freiberg said: 
Australia is being singled out apparently for its use of mandatory sentencing laws which I think are quite mild in comparison to the laws in the United States where there are at least 23 States who have mandatory sentencing laws, some of which are quite enormous ... in California there have been 40,000 convictions under mandatory sentencing laws, and people can get up to 25 years for a third strike for stealing a pizza, so where is the outrage? Where is the condemnation of these very, very widely applied laws?
There is not any, and that is an interesting issue in itself. On the question of mandatory sentencing laws in England, the following exchange occurred. Susanna Lobez asked:
So in England, when are the judge's hands tied?
Professor Freiberg replied:
Well the legislation affects offenders convicted for a third time of certain drug offences, and they're liable to a minimum of seven years, and there are also automatic life sentences for certain repeat serious offenders and there are `third strike and you're out' for serious burglary offences.
On the subject of the abuse of human rights the US laws represented, Professor Freiberg, speaking in reference to the automatic sentence of 25 years to life for a third-time felony, however minor, added:
I think that is such a gross breach of human rights, that is such a violation of human rights, and I'm surprised that this indignation is not turned on the United States. 
The indignation he is referring to is the indignation against Australia. He went on to say:
I see a fairly wide range of media internationally, but I haven't seen the United States being hauled before the United Nations committees ...
Very interesting, when both the UK and the United States have much more severe and draconian mandatory sentencing laws which really do impair civil rights, isn't it? Then there is the question of our general treatment of Aborigines. This year's budget papers show that the Howard government will spend a record $2.3 billion on indigenous specific initiatives, covering housing, education, health and employment. In Australia we recognise that the problems of our indigenous people need special attention, and we are meeting the challenge to the best of our ability. The chairperson of the United Nations Human Rights Committee, which has been so critical of Australia, is from Chile. I must say when it comes to questions of respect for human rights I know which country I would prefer to live in. I wonder how much money the government of Chile spends on programs for its indigenous people. I have to say it seems to me that the UN Human Rights Committee and their special investigator on the independence of judges are both being unfairly critical of Australia.
