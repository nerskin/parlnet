Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation and Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations) (09:15):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


In January 2010, the Australian Financial Centre Forum released a report titled Australia as a Financial Centre. 


This has become known as the 'Johnson report' in recognition of Mark Johnson's leadership of the forum and his subsequent leadership of the Australian Financial Centre Task Force. 


The Johnson report concluded that Australia had arguably the most efficient and competitive financial services in the Asia Pacific. This is reflected in the fact that, even in this era of the mining boom, the financial services sector is the largest single contributor to GDP of any sector in the economy, and, furthermore, in the fact that the financial services sector employs in excess of 400,000 Australians who work very hard—from investment bankers right through to the important bank tellers in our communities.


Despite these strengths, the Johnson report observed that the sector could benefit from becoming more export oriented. 


One of the key initiatives aimed at making the sector more outward oriented was the Investment Manager Regime.


This initiative will put Australian fund managers in a stronger position to manage not just funds being invested in Australia—but funds invested in other countries. This will maximise the benefits flowing to the Australian workforce and Australian consumers of financial products.


In addition, the initiative will reduce tax uncertainty for widely held foreign funds investing in passive Australian investments.


This legislation contains two schedules, which contain the first two elements of the Investment Manager Regime. 


Schedule 1 will prescribe the tax treatment of conduit income of widely held foreign funds. These amendments will apply to the 2010-11 and later income years.


The amendments are designed to ensure that the complex tax issues that can currently arise do not operate to discourage foreign funds from engaging the services of an Australian intermediary, for instance an investment manager. 


These amendments will ensure that investment income of a foreign entity is not subject to tax in Australia simply because it engages an Australian advisor, where that income would not otherwise have an Australian source.


Schedule 2 will address the uncertainty surrounding the impact of United States accounting standard ASC 740-10—the amendments are often referred to as the FIN 48 measures. These measures will apply to the 2010-11 and earlier income years. 


The amendments in schedule 2 remove the potential for uncertainty regarding the Australian tax treatment of certain foreign fund income and will allow foreign investors to move forward in their arrangements with confidence of their Australian tax position relating to earlier years. 


The proposed amendments are designed to clarify the taxation treatment of certain income of foreign funds which have not lodged a tax return or have had an assessment made of their income tax liability. 


Where the conditions of the provisions are met, certain types of investment income and gains will be exempt from Australian tax. In addition, losses or outgoings in respect of certain investments will be disregarded.


Full details of the measures in this bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum.


Debate adjourned.

Mr KELVIN THOMSON
 (Wills) (09:35):  On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties I present the committee's report entitled Report 125: treaties tabled on 7 and 28 February 2012.


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Mr KELVIN THOMSON:
  by leave—The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties' Report 125 contains the committee's views on a series of treaties which were tabled on 7 and 28 February 2012.


One of the more important treaties covered in this report is the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment done at New York on 18 December 2002. The optional protocol aims to strengthen the protection of persons deprived of their liberty against acts of torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment. It provides for a mechanism to better ensure that detaining authorities are accountable for conditions in places of detention and for greater international transparency.


The optional protocol has now been in force for over five years and has more than 60 states parties, and a further 22 are signatories. Australia already has strong legal protections against torture and inhuman or degrading treatment. However, ratification of this optional protocol will improve outcomes for detainees in Australia by providing a more integrated and internationally recognised oversight mechanism. It will provide an opportunity for organisations involved in detention management and oversight to share problem-solving measures and other information on the conditions and treatment of detainees. Implementation should minimise instances giving rise to concerns about the treatment and welfare of people detained in places of detention in Australia. In addition to the human rights benefits, monitoring has the potential to minimise the costs of addressing such instances, including avoiding litigation costs and compensation payments.


The optional protocol is an effective mechanism even in jurisdictions that already enjoy preventive monitoring through pre-existing oversight bodies. The New Zealand Human Rights Commission noted in 2010 that the protocol had been 'valuable in identifying issues and situations that are otherwise overlooked and in providing authoritative assessments of whether new developments and specific initiatives will meet the international standards for safe and humane detention'. The committee does not want to see implementation of this treaty protocol delayed. We have recommended that, rather than making a declaration under article 24 to delay our obligations by three years, the Australian government work with the states and territories to implement a national preventive mechanism as quickly as possible.


The treaties committee has also approved another six treaties including the amendments to the Agreement Establishing the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development adopted at London on 30 September 2011. This agreement was in response to the events in the Middle East and North Africa in 2010 and 2011—the so-called 'Arab Spring'. The bank was called upon by the international community to extend its geographic scope to support the transition of the southern and eastern Mediterranean countries to become market economies. It is in Australia's national interest to accept the proposed amendments to allow the bank to extend its operations to eligible countries in the southern and eastern Mediterranean to support the transition to democracy in such countries. Egypt, Morocco, Jordan and Tunisia have taken steps so that they may potentially benefit from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development's expansion. The bank is well placed to support countries that are transitioning towards open and democratic market economies.


The report also covers amendments to the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals, which added two species found in Australia: the giant manta ray and the eastern curlew. The eastern curlew is a striking-looking bird with a long curved bill, which every year migrates around the world between the coastal beach and shore areas which it inhabits. Like many other migratory shorebirds, it is highly vulnerable to areas of its habitat being paved over for industrial or housing developments—the loss of habitat links in its migratory chain is devastating. We should all be concerned at declines in the eastern curlew and other migratory shorebirds from areas in the Yellow Sea in Korea, which they used to use as feeding areas, and I hope that all countries party to this convention will take their responsibilities under this convention seriously.


The remaining treaties covered in this report examined: the Prevention of Pollution by Harmful Substances Carried by Sea in Packaged Form; conformity assessment certificates between the European Union and Australia; the Convention on International Wills; and the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels. The committee concludes that all the treaties covered in Report 125 should be supported with binding action. On behalf of the committee, I commend the report to the House.

"Parke, Melissa, MP",ALP,2012-06-21,"



Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (09:40):  The 17 December 2010 marked the 20th anniversary of Australia's ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. I took the opportunity on that occasion to table a motion in which I outlined a number of promising and not-so-promising aspects of child protection both in Australia and overseas. These included the significant progress that has been made in the reduction of global child mortality, where now something like 10,000 fewer children die each day than did 20 years ago. That is a wonderful statistic. There has also been a sizeable increase in the number of children who have access to primary education compared with just 12 years ago following the introduction of the Millennium Development Goals.


My motion in December 2010 noted that, as one would expect, Australian children fare better than children in many other parts of the world. We know that Australia is, generally speaking, a wonderful place for most children, but while the majority of kids who are lucky enough to grow up in Australia benefit from the high quality of our health and education systems and from the opportunities that exist in a free, safe and democratic society, it must be acknowledged that kids within certain demographics face very different prospects indeed. Significant issues remain to be addressed in this country, including child abuse and neglect, youth homelessness and the disadvantage suffered by Indigenous children.


The motion, also spoken to by my parliamentary colleagues the members for Pearce, Newcastle and Bowman, called for the federal government to consider appointing a National Commissioner for Children. As the Chair of the UNICEF Parliamentary Association I was glad to move the successful motion at the ALP national conference last year on this issue, while noting that the establishment of a National Children's Commissioner has been a longstanding commitment of the Labor Party and of the Attorney-General herself. So I am absolutely thrilled to be speaking on the introduction of this Australian Human Rights Commission Amendment (National Children’s Commissioner) Bill 2012 for the creation of a National Children's Commissioner, which is not before time but which will be vital to driving efforts to establish a level playing field for all Australia's children.


I join with UNICEF and the Australian children's coalition of organisations in welcoming the government's announcement of the establishment of a National Children's Commissioner. This reform has been called for by a large number of organisations and individuals across Australia for many years. The Australian Child Rights Taskforce in the Listen to children report last year found a number of disturbing outcomes, including that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children have child mortality rates three times that of their non-Aboriginal peers. These are clearly the Australian children whose needs we listen to the least effectively. It also found that the number of children in out-of-home care has increased by 51.5 per cent since 2005. Yet Australia collects no data on the reasons children are placed in care.


The children of asylum seekers continue to be kept in detention facilities in direct contravention of the UN children's convention and Australia currently offers no legal remedies for any such breaches of child rights. Children with disabilities often miss out on crucial and early intervention services and lack the support necessary to assist with life transitions and the support needed to prevent family or career crisis and breakdown. Children and young people who are seeking help for mental health concerns often do not receive timely access to appropriate services. Particular groups are at higher risk of mental health problems, including Indigenous children, children from refugee and migrant backgrounds, same-sex-attracted children, gender-questioning or gender-diverse young people, young carers, children with disability and children in rural, regional and remote areas. In the report, more than 35 leading NGOs, ranging from UNICEF to church organisations to state based children's advocacy agencies, reinforced their agreed position on the importance of a Children's Commissioner and outlining the key roles and powers of such an office. The stakeholder organisations emphasised the importance of a Children's Commissioner being in a position to monitor and secure the effective participation of children; to oversee the observation of child rights principles; and to ensure coordination and nonduplication when it comes to existing child protection frameworks. They also placed great significance on the need to prioritise the protection of vulnerable groups; to recognise the special risks in relation to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children; to focus on endemic problems in the areas of discrimination and accessibility; and to be in a position to take a proactive and systematic approach to policy development. It goes without saying that the National Children's Commissioner needs to be adequately resourced, with properly defined functions and powers.


I am very pleased that this bill addresses these important principles. As a result of this legislation the role and office of the National Children's Commissioner will be in a position to: improve the monitoring of Commonwealth laws affecting the rights, wellbeing and development of children and young people; encourage the active involvement of children and young people in decisions that affect them, particularly in the development of government policies, programs and legislation; support government agencies to develop mechanisms which enhance the active involvement of children and young people; assist the overall Australian effort to meet its international obligations by promoting and advancing the rights of the child, in particular those enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child; and provide the commissioner with discretion when performing any of his or her functions to focus on particular groups of children who are at risk or vulnerable such as children with disability, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, homeless children, or those who witness or are subject to violence.


The introduction of a National Children's Commissioner will represent the first dedicated advocate for children and young people at the federal level. All Australian states and territories have established similar offices and a national commissioner will consolidate and coordinate the expertise and knowledge that exists at the state level. A National Children's Commissioner will give Australian kids a voice at the national level and bring attention to issues of neglect, abuse and discrimination. A national advocate for children will offer a powerful focus for hearing children's voices, especially on the subjects of youth justice, child protection, Indigenous health outcomes and homelessness.


The commissioner will have an important role in monitoring, reviewing and commenting on laws, policies, service standards and practices that affect young Australians. As part of the Australian Human Rights Commission, such a position will have the mechanisms to receive and investigate complaints of breaches of children's rights under the Convention on the Rights of the Child through the implementation of a child-specific complaints system. It will be able to assist in and drive law reform and policy development, and develop consultation mechanisms that encourage the participation of children.


The commissioner will collaborate and coordinate with the community and business sectors to develop and strengthen community understanding of the issues and experiences of children, and have the power to intervene in court proceedings involving the rights of children and young people. The commissioner will also advocate for effective data collection on children's health, wellbeing, development and participation.


In Western Australia, the office of a Commissioner for Children and Young People was created by the state Labor government in 2006, with Michelle Scott becoming the first commissioner on 7 December 2007. The WA commissioner oversees a broad range of areas relating to children's welfare, including early childhood, complaints about government agencies relating to children, mental health, young people and the law, participation, reducing alcohol related harm, middle years and sexualisation of children. As a Western Australian representative I am very much aware of the good work that Ms Scott has been able to do, and this was certainly a strong part of my motivation in pushing for a commissioner at the national level.


At this point I would like to particularly recognise the work done on this cause by the people at UNICEF Australia—CEO Norman Gillespie, Communications Manager Tim O'Connor, and Advocacy Manager Aivee Chew. In October last year, Ms Chew was a member of a delegation to the United Nations in Geneva with the task of briefing the Committee on Child Rights, and on the broad question of where Australia was succeeding and failing in protecting the rights of its most vulnerable. Ms Chew said at the time that:


We know that Australia is a wonderful place for most of its kids, yet not everyone experiences the same and just levels of opportunity in Australia.


Gross inadequacies remain in Australia's commitment to its children, despite recommendations made five years ago by the UN Children's committee. It has been more than two decades since Australia ratified the United Nation's Convention on the Rights of the Child—the most widely ratified human rights treaty in history. Yet despite 20 years of 'commitment' to child rights in Australia, there is still no national framework and no national children's commissioner.


The delegation presented findings to the committee from the Listen to children report I referred to earlier.


The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has long recognised that traditional mechanisms within governments do not provide sufficient protection to these vulnerable groups in society. When England introduced a Children's Commissioner in 2005—some time after similar offices had been created in Wales, Scotland and Northern Island—Australian based children's advocacy organisation Children's Rights International released a discussion paper on the issue. Its authors, Claire Bessant and Rhona Smith, wrote:


... children are frequently denied access to justice and indeed may even lack awareness of their rights. Accordingly, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has advocated the creation of national strategies promoting children's rights and independent human rights institutions to publicise and realise them.


Children's Commissioners, charged with defending and supporting children's welfare, rights and interests, guided by the principles of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Children, have clear potential as human rights institutions.


This makes an irresistible case for the introduction of a Children's Commissioner in Australia, and I am glad that we are now responding to that case. We cannot be complacent when it comes to children's rights, even though the rights and protections in for children in Australia are comparatively strong.


As I said in my speech on the motion in December 2010, there are actions against children in Australia's recent history of which no-one can be proud. The children of the stolen generation and forgotten Australians:


... did not receive this special protection. Our acceptance of responsibility, our sorrow and our sincere apology for the suffering of these children has a sobering resonance in the context of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. That episode in our history is a tragic demonstration of the vulnerabilities of children and of the susceptibility of government agencies to systemic failures when it comes to even the most basic protections. The two anniversaries, a month apart, should remind us of the terrible harm that can occur when the rights of children are not protected and should strengthen us in the ongoing imperative of recognising and protecting those rights.


The third anniversary, in a few months time, of the national apology to the stolen generations will be another point of reflection. It is of course an anniversary which tolls a heavy warning on the unacceptable consequences of neglecting the rights of children. The stolen generations and the forgotten Australians are not people who exist in some sepia-coloured, less enlightened Australian past. They are with us now, with their pain and also their courage and resilience.


Today we make a real and critical improvement to the protections that exist for children in this country, and in so doing we meet and strengthen the obligations and the spirit of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. I wholeheartedly welcome the creation of a National Children's Commissioner, and I commend the minister for moving so quickly to bring this bill forward. The Children's Commissioner at the Commonwealth level is certainly not a role and function that is arriving ahead of its time, but I am proud to be part of a Labor government that is learning from the past and looking to shape a future in which Australian children and children overseas can live to their potential with the protections and freedoms that all children should have.


Debate adjourned.

I wholeheartedly welcome the creation of a National Children's Commissioner, and I commend the minister for moving so quickly to bring this bill forward. The Children's Commissioner at the Commonwealth level is certainly not a role and function that is arriving ahead of its time, but I am proud to be part of a Labor government that is learning from the past and looking to shape a future in which Australian children and children overseas can live to their potential with the protections and freedoms that all children should have.

Mr HAYES
 (Fowler) (09:54):  I rise to support the Australian Human Rights Commission Amendment (National Children's Commissioner) Bill 2012. The bill amends the Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986 and creates the position of the National Children's Commissioner in the Human Rights Commission. The commissioner will have a monumental role in providing a voice for Australian children, particularly those who are living in disadvantaged conditions and those exposed to threats to their rights and safety.


Like many here, I have children—I also very proudly have five grandchildren—and for this reason this bill has a particular personal significance to me. Even though my children are all grown up, as a parent I cannot help but always want to lend support to them no matter how old they are. Grandparents and their grandchildren have a slightly different relationship to the relationship that parents and their children have, but still as a grandparent you are always looking after and lending support to your grandchildren. I am very blessed because, as I said, I have five grandchildren, and they are very much loved. One of my grandsons is afflicted by autism, and  this means that the relationship with him is slightly different again. As a family we do everything we can to ensure that he is not discriminated against in our community, in his schooling or, particularly, within the family.


I feel for people who do not have such a close family bond as we do. There are many in our community who, for various reasons, do not. Many children are forced to become adults well before their time. Children afflicted with disabilities, children living in homeless conditions and children exposed to domestic violence often are forced to take on the persona of mature adults well before their childhood has passed. Having a strong voice for children in this predicament reflects a caring society. This bill is not designed to bureaucratically impose the National Children's Commissioner to supplant the role of a caring family, but it does acknowledge that not every kid in this country—and the member for Fremantle has been very passionate about this for some time—has the support of a caring family. We as a caring nation need to ensure that they to have a strong voice.


I have had an interest in domestic violence for a heck of a long time, because I have had a long association with law enforcement agencies around the country. I am very proud of the efforts they make to suppress crime and minimise the impacts of crime on the community. When I look at the crime statistics—and it does not matter which date, which jurisdiction or which police station they come from—I see that the reported incidents of domestic violence remain stubbornly high. The number of incidents is in many instances going up. This is sometimes on the basis that people are now more confident about reporting domestic violence to authorities; nevertheless, domestic violence is of considerable concern in our society. We normally talk about the impact that domestic violence has on women, who are its main targets, but it also has a huge impact on children. According to statistics, one in three women in Australia will experience domestic violence and one in five women will experience sexual violence. These statistics are pretty bad on the face of it. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics 2005 personal safety survey, of all women who have experienced partner related violence that had children, 59 per cent indicated that the violence was witnessed by the children in a relationship. So the violence had a direct impact on the children in those relationships. Most of those relationships would probably have more than child. If you extrapolate the statistics, it is possible for the total number of victims of domestic violence to be almost the same as the number of children who have witnessed domestic violence. The impact of that is that 60 per cent of young males growing up in an abusive relationship are more than likely to become abusers themselves as they mature and 50 percent of young females growing up in an abusive relationship—and I am assured this is the case--are more than likely to take an abuser as a partner.


To assert that in these areas a child should not have a strong voice is an absolute absurdity and it certainly would be a situation where we would be closing our eyes to something that all of us in this place know is a reality—that is that the level of domestic violence is high. The victims are not just the women in the relationship who have been targeted specifically for the violence but the children themselves. In a similar way I see a role for the commissioner in terms of homeless children and others children in vulnerable positions in our society.


Homeless children are a group that are very vulnerable and many face unique challenges to survive on a daily basis. This is not just young people living rough. This also includes young people who for various reasons are not able to live at home and have been, using the popular term, 'lounge surfing'. They move from one sofa to another, from one family to another and regrettably they do not have a permanent place of abode. In my former electorate we did a lot of work with an organisation that was specifically providing shelter for young women. I had the opportunity to meet with these kids on many occasions, particularly at Christmas and Easter and occasions that would normally impact on a family. What I learnt from talking to many of the kids there—and they ranged from 12 through to 19—was that there were many reasons they were not at home. But what they really wanted was to have someone actually help them to make decisions in their lives. It was a church based organisation that was helping them in that direction. It showed me that young people do have rights. Young people do need to understand the social systems that we take for granted as adults and they need some person who has the legal authority to pursue their rights.


Back in 2005, when I was the member for Werriwa, in the lead up to the by-election the Macquarie Fields riots took place. There were a lot of young people throwing firebombs and stones and everything else that they could at the local police. At that stage I met up with Father Chris Riley and have had a very long and valued association with him ever since. He is a man who is absolutely passionate about children and making sure that children have every opportunity to succeed in our society. He is not a person who wants to come in and prejudge relationships. He certainly does not prejudge why kids are on the street. He wants to give them an opportunity. I have seen the passion in this man's face when it comes to kids.


Not long after that, we had the devastation of the earthquakes in Indonesia. Father Chris Riley became heavily involved in building a school at Aceh. Many of the kids who were throwing Molotov cocktails and stones at police and doing all that stuff in Macquarie Fields were the ones who accompanied Father Chris Riley to Aceh to help build the Islamic school there. I have met these kids many times. A number of these young people who were on the streets showing all the signs of being delinquent are now qualified social workers and are working within the system to try and assist young people, showing them there is a better way, helping them to be able to make those decisions because many of the young people that Father Chris Riley deals with do not have a stable adult influence in their lives. Unfortunately, many kids in that sort of environment mature rapidly beyond their age and miss out on their childhood. People like Father Chris Riley who are committed to helping young people do an absolutely fine job, but young people must be seen to be able to exercise appropriately their legal voice. They do need someone who can assist. In the short time I have available I would like to mention a person who in New South Wales absolutely stands out as someone who did much for young people. Barbara Holborow was a magistrate in the Children's Court of New South Wales. She received the Order of Australia earlier this year before passing away at the age of 81. She was a magistrate with the Children's Court for a number of years and she was a person who dedicated her life to disadvantaged youth. Barbara worked in a women's refuge. The first child she adopted was a young Aboriginal boy called Jacob. After that, many foster children came under Barbara's care. As a magistrate, Barbara had an impact on the lives of many thousands of kids. Fiercely committed to reforming the justice system for children, she was involved in setting up free legal aid for children in New South Wales and in creating a court which actually cared for the rights of children, particularly in cases of neglect. Sentences were able to be deferred and diversionary activities were set up for young people.


If Barbara were still with us she would be an excellent person to consider for the role of National Children's Commissioner. A person in authority, Barbara Holborow did so much to ensure not only that children's rights were observed but also that children were given the appropriate chance that all of us take for granted for our own kids. I commend this legislation. Like the member for Fremantle, I am proud to be part of a government that has taken on board the rights of children to ensure that they are properly protected in our modern society.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2012-06-21,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (10:09):  The Human Rights Commission Amendment (National Children’s Commissioner) Bill 2012, which establishes a National Children's Commissioner in Australia, fulfils a long-term commitment by Labor to appoint a national advocate for children. I underscore the comments of the previous speaker in saying it is an achievement of which we are very proud. The new commissioner will focus on promoting the rights, wellbeing and development of children and young people, advocating for their rights on a national level. The National Children's Commissioner will ensure the voices of children and young people are heard in the development of Commonwealth policies and programs, an incredibly important initiative. The new position will begin from 1 July this year or on royal assent, whichever is later. The National Children's Commissioner will join the six existing commissioners at the Australian Human Rights Commission: the Human Rights Commissioner, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, the Age Discrimination Commissioner, the Race Discrimination Commissioner, the Disability Discrimination Commissioner and the Sex Discrimination Commissioner.


We want every child in Australia to grow up safe, happy and well. The new commissioner will represent the views of children and young people, particularly those who are most vulnerable. It is time for children and young people to have a national advocate to ensure their rights are reflected in national policies and programs as more of our policies focus on the health and welfare of children. I would also like to point out—and this is important—that the commissioner will not duplicate but complement the work of states and territories, particularly the work of other commissioners and guardians. The commissioner will take a broad advocacy role to promote public awareness of issues affecting children. He or she will also conduct research and education programs and consult directly with children and representative organisations, as well as monitor Commonwealth legislation, policies and programs that relate to children's rights, wellbeing and development.


As part of the 2012-13 budget the government has committed $3.5 million over four years to fund the new Children's Commissioner position. This is welcome funding and will ensure the Children's Commissioner has the resources to carry out its important mandate. Certain comparable jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Norway, already have full-time children's rights commissioners, so this development is incredibly welcome and is one of which I am very proud.


The objectives of establishing this position are: to improve advocacy at a national level for the rights, wellbeing and development of children and young people up to the age of 18 years; to improve monitoring of Commonwealth laws affecting the rights, wellbeing and development of children and young people; to encourage the active involvement of children and young people in decisions that affect them, particularly in the development of government policies, programs and legislation; to support government agencies to develop mechanisms that enhance the active involvement of children and young people; and to assist Australia in meeting its international obligations by promoting and advancing the rights of the child, in particular as enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.


The commissioner will have discretion when performing any of their functions to focus on particular groups of children who are at risk or vulnerable, such as children with disability, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, homeless children or those who are witnessing or subjected to violence. The commissioner will also have discretion to consult with whomever is considered appropriate, with a focus on children—representative organisations of children, state and territory children's commissioners, and guardians. The commissioner will not, however, have a complaint-handling role or a role in dealing with individual children, including individual children's cases in the context of child protection or family law. Although the commissioner will have a limited role to seek leave to intervene in court proceedings that raise significant children's rights issues, this will not extend to representing individual children. They will not have a role as the legal guardian of unaccompanied children in the immigration area or in any other guardianship role.


I am pleased to say that the establishment of a National Children's Commissioner has been well received by stakeholders. Children's rights groups have heralded the establishment of this position as a major step forward in championing children's rights. Early Childhood Australia said:


The creation of a position dedicated solely to promoting the rights, wellbeing and development of children in Australia will ensure that children’s voices are no longer overlooked.


They say it will 'play an important role in ensuring children grow up in a happy and safe environment'. A coalition of Australian's leading children and youth focused organisations—the Australian Youth Affairs Coalition, Save the Children and UNICEF—have also welcomed the announcement as 'an important further step in establishing more robust accountability in government policy and practice for children'. Dr Norman Gillespie, Chief Executive of UNICEF Australia, said:


We need bipartisan support for the role to ensure that the outcomes for children are effective.


The Australian Human Rights Commission itself has also welcomed the news and said:


… the Commissioner will be an important advocate for the protection and promotion of the rights of children and young people across Australia and will help ensure that their voices are heard.


According to the commission:


A National Children’s Commissioner will play an important role in advocating for the protection of the human rights of some of the most vulnerable children and young people in Australia.


It is also important to note that many children and young people in regional and remote Australia who are at risk of social exclusion and poor outcomes will be better represented thanks to the establishment of this position. In recognition of this, the National Children's Commissioner proposal includes funding specifically for the commissioner and staff to travel to regional and remote Australia to consult directly with children and young people and to deliver education and public awareness sessions in those locations.


I applaud the Gillard Labor government for taking action to appoint a National Children's Commissioner. It says a lot about the way Labor thinks and feels about children and children's rights in our society. Gone are the days when children were seen and not heard. More and more we are seeing the rights of children being taken into account in our courts, our classrooms and our parliaments. This is important because human rights are children's rights too. International human rights instruments recognise that children as well as adults have basic human rights. Children, most importantly, also have the right to special protection because of their vulnerability to exploitation and abuse.


Every representative in this House has been exposed to children at risk and also children who have been the victims of abuse. Earlier this year I went to an event at one of my local schools. The kids were performing a concert, and there was one girl who was incredibly noticeable for the fact that for the whole time she covered her face in her hair and kept looking down. There was no engagement with the audience, with her teachers or with the other children in the choir. This child had, in a way, been stunted. It was obvious that she had low self-esteem, or no self-esteem at all. It was tragic to see this young person in, as I said, this stunted state. I turned to one of the teachers and said: 'Is that girl going through some body image issues? What's the story behind this young girl?' They told me that she had been a victim of abuse for many years, and essentially they had spent a lot of time helping her by counselling and trying to draw her out of herself and improve her self-esteem, her image of herself and her confidence. Putting her in the choir was part of that process to help her to engage with others—her peers, her teachers and also, hopefully, the audience. Judging from what I saw of that girl on that day it was going to take some time, given that, as I said, she was covering herself and almost wanted to become invisible through the hair over her face and the lack of engagement with anyone. It was just tragic to see that someone so young wanted to, in a way, write herself out of any presence on the earth.


In this job I have also, unfortunately, been exposed to many women and children who have been the victims of domestic violence. I have spoken many times in this House of women whom we have had to help out with social housing, including women with teenage kids. One woman in particular who came to see us very early in my term was a victim of domestic violence. She was sleeping in her car. She was undergoing chemo for breast cancer, and she had been living in this state in the car with these two teenage kids for weeks and weeks. She came to us to see if we could assist in any way with social housing, and we did, very fortunately, get a social house for her and her two teenage kids. The challenge she was also facing—as if she did not have enough challenges as it was—was the fact that one of her children was a teenage boy and there is a policy at some women's refuges that they do not take teenage boys. I understand why that is so, but it is an issue on which I have been in discussions with the ACT Minister for Women and for Community Services since I have been elected to see what we can do to allow teenage boys to access women's refuge services. I know that, as I said, there are very strong policies as to why some women's refuges do not take teenage boys, but it was particularly difficult for this woman, who was going through this dreadful predicament of not only being the victim of domestic violence but also undergoing chemo to treat breast cancer.


Late last year, during the school presentations, I had the privilege of going out to Galilee, which is out in the south of my electorate. Galilee looks after and educates kids at risk. They were largely young boys, but there were a few young women there too, and they had just spent the year achieving their year 10 certificate. It was a really special occasion just being there with them to celebrate this significant achievement. They had overcome a number of hurdles to attain that academic level—again, not just the self-esteem issues but also being the victims of abuse and other challenges—so it was a real privilege to be with Galilee. Galilee does great work with kids at risk in the community here in Canberra. I commend it for that, and this was an excellent example of the great work that it is doing to help kids through very difficult stages and get them an academic achievement that will form the building blocks for, hopefully, a bright and successful future. Again, very early on in my term I also had the privilege of going out to the Lions Youth Haven, where Galilee is located. I met with a number of young men who were also at risk and who were not doing particularly well at school. They had been signed up for a program where they were building barriers to protect the trees. At Lions Youth Haven there are a number of people who go horse riding and a number of horses are agisted out there, and the horses were eating the bark on these trees. A number of these trees were significant, and Lions Youth Haven and other members of the community rightly wanted to protect them. Lions Youth Haven decided to get these young men at risk to build barriers to protect the trees. This was great for the environment and it was great for the trees; it was not so great for the horses, who obviously liked the bark!


Just in talking to these young men I heard that it taught them not just a range of skills in how to build something and to see the product of their labour but also team-building skills. They had to build these barriers in a team but, most importantly, they had to erect these barriers as a team. It ensured that they improved their communication skills, and the fact that they had to manage as a group improved their abilities to work as a team and those interpersonal skills. If someone is a victim of abuse or if they are a victim of domestic violence they tend to shut those down, like the young girl that I saw in the choir at that school. In a way, they want to withdraw and become invisible and stunted. This program actually drew these boys out to engage with others and also to work in a productive way with others.


I hope that the establishment of this position will mark the beginning of a new era for children in Australia, particularly those who are most vulnerable, like some who I have just spoken about. Australia can be a wonderful place to grow up in; however, not all children have the same opportunities, and certain demographics are often at a disadvantage when they are young, which can lead to disadvantage later in life. We should do all we can to ensure that all children get the best start in life and are treated with dignity and respect. I have no doubt that this will have better long-term outcomes for those children and society at large. I commend this bill to the House.

"Grierson, Sharon, MP",ALP,2012-06-21,"



Ms GRIERSON
 (Newcastle) (10:24):  I too rise to speak in support of the Australian Human Rights Commission Amendment (National Children's Commissioner) Bill 2012. Obviously, this bill will establish for the first time the National Children's Commissioner, the first ever dedicated advocate for children and young people Australia-wide—something that our federal Labor government has been absolutely committed to.


Of course, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child is the foundation for this legislation. That convention outlines four key principles in advocating for the protection and the rights of children. They are: nondiscrimination; devotion to the best interests of the child; the right to life, survival and development; and respect for the views of the child.


Having spent 30 years of my professional life in schools as a teacher and as a school principal, for me this is a day of great significance and one of personal pride. I warmly welcome the young people who we can see in our galleries today because we are here today trying to represent their best interests. I remember very well teaching a unit of work on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and how wonderful it was for children and young people to know that they were part of global legislation and a framework to protect their rights. Of course, I also saw—too many times—the abuse of children's rights. I remember my very first year as a teacher, having a class of behaviourally disturbed children and knowing that one of those children was being beaten regularly by his parents. It is a very distressing situation for a young person, as I was then. I think what was also distressing was the conflict for that child, because that child loved his parents so much even though he was a victim of their abuse. So it is a very difficult situation to make sure that we get the rights of a child not just asserted for but also managed sensitively, managed strongly and managed well.


I have also had many experiences of dealing with disclosures of sexual abuse from children. That is the saddest thing of all: to have a child go to a teacher or to a counsellor in a school and disclose that they are a victim of abuse, because usually it is from a family member. I guess that I understand what mentors of children, teachers of children and people who support children through their lives come across every day. I heard the member for Canberra talking about a child at risk and, unfortunately, in education so many times we identify children who are clearly at risk and who are clearly victims of some sort of emotional, physical or sexual abuse. Unfortunately, restrictions in the law sometimes lead to very frustrating situations where we cannot address those problems as well as we might like to if there is no disclosure—and children will often protect the people who do the abuse, thinking that that is the right thing to do. So today is a significant day, and this is an important piece of legislation.


This bill seeks to amend the Australian Human Rights Commission Act to establish the position of National Children's Commissioner in the Australian Human Rights Commission. The intention of the Labor government in establishing the commissioner is: to improve national advocacy for the rights, wellbeing and development of youth under the age of 18; to improve monitoring of Commonwealth laws affecting the rights, wellbeing and development of children and young people; to encourage the active participation of young people in decisions that affect them, particularly in the development of government policies and programs—so it is always wonderful to have young people in this place; to support government agencies in enhancing and increasing the involvement of youth; and to assist Australia in meeting its international obligations by promoting and advancing the rights of the child as enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. To say that the phrase 'the children are our future' is a cliche denies its reality. The wellbeing of children and young people must be at the forefront of our minds as legislators, because obviously one day they will inevitably replace us. As the Attorney-General has stated, Australia's future depends on them reaching their full potential. The commissioner will stimulate national conversation about the key issues affecting young Australians, striving to fulfil and promote their best interests. I looked back at my first speech in this House and noted then that I was very mindful of the responsibility of representing young people in this place. I mentioned the very high expectations young people so rightly hold for government, and I hope this bill goes some distance in representing the best interests into the future. At the commissioner's discretion, they will be able to focus on particular vulnerable or at-risk groups of children and young people such as children with a disability, Indigenous children, homeless children or those who are witness or subject to violence and abuse.


Our bill also contains provisions enabling the commissioner to consult with bodies that have a focus on children, organisations that represent children and state and territory children's commissioners and guardians. They will research and promote programs that go to the core in both addressing and understanding the issues and challenges faced by young people in modern Australia, and I suppose we would all know that those challenges are much more complex. The internet itself is a liberator but, unfortunately, it also liberates the wrong people to prey on young children. Whilst not dealing with individual cases in the context of protection or family law, the commissioner will be able to seek leave to intervene in court proceedings which raise significant children's rights issues. That is a powerful tool. I know it will be used very sensibly but it is comforting that that is part of this legislation.


The 2008 report by the Australian Law Reform Commission indicated that, over the previous decade, children had slipped off the national agenda, citing a rise in child protection notifications and a lower rate of conviction. At the time, Minister Macklin noted that convictions often did not occur due to a lack of evidence, because for people such as children giving evidence can be a frightening thing to do—and I mentioned just how conflicted young people are in that situation. That is why our government has been determined to create a National Children's Commissioner, somebody who will champion and advocate for those who too often have little or no voice at all.


The facts are that children in regional and remote Australia are at greater risk. When compared with those in larger cities, social exclusion and poor outcomes can snowball and lead to a cycle of disadvantage in many walks of life. Funding has been specifically provided for the commissioner and staff to travel to remote places around the nation in order to consult directly with young people and to deliver educational and public awareness programs about the rights of children and the role of the commissioner.


In 2009, our Labor government established the National Framework for Protecting Australia's Children through the Council of Australian Governments, COAG. This was in recognition of the unacceptable levels of child abuse and neglect occurring in our community. The framework indicated that in 2007-08 there were 55,120 reported cases of child abuse and neglect that had been substantiated by child protection services, a very unacceptable figure. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare indicates that in 2010-11 there were over 31,000 children in substantiated abuse or neglect cases, or one in every 165 children under the age of 18. We can imagine that these figures are only a very small glimpse of the real tragedy facing some children in our communities, and it is unacceptable in a first-world country such as ours.


The institute tell us in its report, Headline indicators for children's health, development and wellbeing, 2011, that although Australian children generally fare comparatively well on a global level, when examining health, status and risk, there is considerable variation when it comes to some key groups. The report indicates that Indigenous children are severely overrepresented across the child protection system when compared with non-Indigenous Australians. In 2010, this group were eight times as likely to be the subject of substantiated abuse or neglect, nine times as likely to be on a care and protection order and 10 times as likely to be in out-of-home care. The report continues, indicating that Indigenous children have a greater chance of being disadvantaged in the areas of health, development and wellbeing. We have made great strides as a government in improving Indigenous outcomes. Year 12 retention rates have risen to 47 per cent, from 30 per cent in the 1990s for Indigenous youth. In Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory, mortality rates have fallen by 36 per cent, but there is clearly more to be done.


When examining another disadvantaged at-risk group—children in remote areas—we again hear a shameful story. Compared with their metropolitan counterparts, children in remote areas are two to three times more likely to die as infants or due to injury and 30 per cent more likely to be born with low birth weight or to be overweight or obese. Furthermore, they are more likely to be developmentally vulnerable at school entry, being around 40-50 per cent less likely to meet national minimum standards for reading and numeracy. In lower socioeconomic parts of our nation, we again see significant pockets of disadvantage and, similarly, those statistics put children at risk. They are astonishing figures for a country such as Australia, but they are the cold, hard facts that indicate that we must continue to introduce new measures to look after the rights of children.


Our government will continue to assist and advocate for those people particularly. There is not any single solution to the problems of social disadvantage. That is why we keep introducing policies and programs—and I see the minister here in the chamber—such as the new schoolkids bonus to help make ends meet, and Paid Parental Leave, and we have, of course, lifted the tax-free threshold to $18,200 to help low-income families. We know that financial pressure is often one of the triggers for relationship breakdowns and certainly for domestic disputes and violence.


Recent changes to the Family Law Act introduced by our government took effect this month. These changes better protect children and young people exposed to family violence, ensuring appropriate action be taken to put the child first in family law disputes. It is also why we are introducing the National Children's Commissioner, to work wholly and solely in the best interests of our young people. The Hunter Valley Research Foundation in my own area tells us that early school leavers, year 10 or below, have an unemployment rate twice that of trade qualified people and around three times the rate of somebody with a university qualification. Hunter region data from the foundation indicates that early school leavers without post-school education or training are generally the lowest paid. This is a nationwide phenomenon and one that is typically higher in areas of greater socio-economic disadvantage. Globally, Australia is above the average when it comes to OECD figures on all key indicators. However, there remains scope for dramatic improvement.


Dr Sharon Bessell, a senior director of the Children's Policy Centre at the Crawford School of Public Policy at the Australian National University, and Brian Babington, CEO of Families Australia, wrote in the Sydney Morning Herald, on 1 May, 2012 that 'four principles would be vital in guiding the National Children's Commissioner to ensure that an impact is actually made'. Firstly, they said that the position should complement existing state and territory commissioners, and we do understand the importance of value-adding. The new Children's Commissioner will join six other national commissioners in the Australian Human Rights Commission. Secondly, they said that the role of National Children's Commissioner should be above politics and remain impartial, with the rights of the child at the forefront of their decision-making process.


Thirdly, they note that the commissioner must adopt a consultative approach and engage with the children he or she represents. One of the key objectives in creating this role is involving young people in decisions that will ultimately affect them.


Finally, they write that, through the creation of this role, national leadership must be taken 'to promote an inspiring vision for the wellbeing, status and role of children and young people.' I hope that this role will deliver on that particular principle.


There remains much to be done to improve health, education and general wellbeing outcomes for particular groups of young children and all young people in Australia. Obviously, no single solution will fix everything. This bill introducing the National Children's Commissioner is a very strong signal that we are prepared to provide strong advocacy, strong representation for children, providing them with a beacon of hope and opportunity for better outcomes and ultimately a better quality of life. I commend the bill to the House.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2012-06-21,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (10:39):  I thank the earlier speakers for their contributions to this very important debate on the Australian Human Rights Commission Amendment (National Children's Commissioner) Bill 2012. Obviously, establishing a National Children's Commissioner fulfils a long-term commitment by the Australian Labor Party to appoint a national advocate for children. I am proud to be on this side of the House and supporting the bill.


I also make special mention of the work done by other ministers. I thank Minister Garrett for making a contribution in his role as education minister; Minister Ellis for ensuring that money goes into early childhood education; the health minister and particularly Minister Macklin for developing the child protection framework, which is important when you have states and territories that have different approaches to the reporting of child protection issues. In some states it is mandatory for everybody. In some states teachers have to report and in other states teachers do not have to. Medical practitioners have to report in every state and territory. But the reality is that we are a federation and, whilst that means good policy and good practice can develop, it does not necessarily mean that best practice and best policy spreads throughout the land. I guess that is why we are here as a Commonwealth to ensure that there are best possible standards for children. That is what this legislation before us today does.


I particularly acknowledge a Queenslander, Leneen Forde, who is actually on the board at Griffith University but who in an earlier role led a royal commission that looked at child protection and some of the horrific practices and injustices that had occurred in Queensland. I make mention of Leneen Forde and the great work that she did many years ago. 


I am sad to say that my wife, who has been working in child protection for 22 years, has seen some of these investigations and some of those changes. Whilst she always respects confidentiality—except for one case I might mention—she often tells me of the lifelong scars suffered by those who have experienced physical and emotional abuse in the family home and outside. Obviously, DOCS investigates abuse from within the family, then the police step in to investigate those matters outside the home. Sadly, the police do not have as much work as DOCS. The reality is that we tend to be harmed by those who profess to love us, or who should love us, or their children.


I will mention one case that is public and I can only mention this because it is written about in Terri Irwin's book about Steve Irwin. Steve Irwin, as members would remember, sadly passed away, but he was investigated for putting one of his children in a crocodile enclosure. My wife had the job of talking to Mr Irwin on a Friday night. This is all public—obviously, there are confidentiality issues—and it is quite interesting. She would not let me be in the room to hear the conversation, but she did say he even said 'crikey' in the phone call. Obviously, there was a child protection investigation, but nothing like the more serious ones that occur. Obviously, having a six-week old child near crocodiles does not happen too often. That autobiography by Steve Irwin's wife is interesting. I think the Governor-General's secretary phoned Steve to complain about it. It is an interesting representation of the facts surrounding the Governor-General's secretary, and the words which are attributed to my wife are nothing like what was actually said. But, anyway, I drift. I am supposed to be talking about the National Children's Commissioner Bill.


Unfortunately, there are many young children right across Australia from a broad range of backgrounds who are at high risk of abuse, discrimination and subject to poor circumstances. The introduction of a National Children's Commissioner is designed to speak on behalf of those children who do not have a voice and who are suffering alone and in social exclusion. The new commissioner will have discretion when performing any of his or her functions to focus on particular groups of children who are at risk or vulnerable, such as children with disability, those who are homeless or witnessing or subject to violence, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. In recognition of the particular disadvantage many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children face, the National Children's Commissioner proposal includes funding specifically for the commissioner and staff to travel to regional and remote Australia to consult directly with children and young people and to deliver education and public awareness sessions in those locations. 


The Gillard Labor government is committed to closing the gap of Indigenous disadvantage and this is another way of gradually achieving this aim. This Labor government is already increasing access to early childhood education for Indigenous four-year-olds in remote communities and we are confident that we are on track to halve the infant mortality rates of Indigenous children under five by 2018. Anyone who has young children knows how these dry statistics take on a completely different meaning when you think about your own children. As a father of two—one is only three years old—I cannot imagine what it would be like to have the sorts of statistics, in our own lounge rooms, in our own suburban areas, that are being experienced in some of the more regional and remote Indigenous communities around Australia.


The commissioner will also have discretion to consult with whoever is considered appropriate, with a focus on children, organisations that represent children, state and territory children's commissioners and guardians. So it will be a cooperative, collaborative network. The key objectives of establishing a national children's commissioner are to improve advocacy at a national level for the rights, wellbeing and development of children and young people up to the age of 18 years; and to improve the monitoring of Commonwealth laws affecting the rights, wellbeing and development of children and young people. As I said, Minister Macklin has already gone some way in terms of establishing the child protection framework. The previous Attorney-General, who is in the chamber, has done some great work in terms of changing the Family Law Act to make sure that we put children first. I commend the member for Barton for his great work. I commend the current Attorney-General as well for making sure children come first and foremost when it comes to family law decisions, because that is where so much horrible work occurs.


I also encourage the active involvement of children and young people in decisions that affect them. We see emerging child protection issues—things such as cybersafety, where you cannot go home to a safe place anymore. Schools have always been jungles, in a way—the blackboard jungle is a reality for some people—but at least children used to be able to go home to a safe haven. Now, sometimes, with Facebook, the internet and phones, people can be hassled, bullied and even driven to horrible deeds because of bullying that occurs through the internet. 


There are supports for government agencies to develop mechanisms which enhance the active involvement of children and young people. We also assist Australia in meeting its international obligations by promoting and advancing the rights of the child, in particular as enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.


As a Queenslander I flag an ongoing issue I have. Children in Queensland are treated as adults. The reality is that whilst Australia has signed up to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, in Queensland we treat 17-year-olds as adults. It is not exactly the sort of topic that you campaign on but it is something that I flag. I have an ongoing interest in it and hopefully my Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, subject to the approval of the deputy chair and the rest of the committee, will look at this topic of Queensland's treatment of children as adults.


The commission is to act as an overarching authority; it is not to deal specifically with individual children's cases. Obviously, that is for the states and territories. The Commonwealth will, however, have a limited role to seek leave to intervene in court proceedings which raise significant children's rights issues. But this will not extend to representing individual children. This bill sends a clear message to the Australian public that child abuse will not be tolerated and that there is help out there for the people who need it the most. Education and awareness is one of the best preventative measures, and that is why we are introducing a new Children's Commissioner to actively campaign and advocate for the rights of the child. Whilst this is obviously not a silver bullet, it is a small step towards stopping more child abuse. It should be supported by all of the members opposite.


I welcome the bill and hope it will have a positive impact on family relationships and children's health, development and wellbeing. I look forward to seeing the appointment of the first Children's Commissioner. I thank, again, Minister Macklin and all of those who have done great work in child protection—Chancellor Leneen Forde from the Griffith University in particular. I commend the bill to the House.

"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2012-06-21,"



Mrs MOYLAN
 (Pearce) (10:50):  Australia has a long history of advocating for and protecting the human rights of its citizens. A central tenet of that protection is the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which was established in 1986. Since then, the Australian Human Rights Commission, as it is called now, has continually expanded, creating specific commissioners for each piece of federal legislation enacted to protect citizen rights—such as the Age Discrimination Commissioner in response to Age Discrimination Act in 2004, and the Racial Discrimination Commissioner after the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. Six separate commissioners now exist and all sit within the Australian Human Rights Commission. Since the commencement of the Convention of the Rights of the Child in 1991, which Australia is a party to, there have been calls for the creation of a national children's commissioner to ensure compliance with the convention. Many inquiries have investigated the potential role and responsibilities of such a commissioner but the discussion stands apart as there is no single legislative instrument at the federal level encapsulating the protections which should be afforded to children. 


Because of this anomaly there is debate about whether such a commissioner duplicates the functions of current state and territory children's commissioners and even whether a commissioner can play a meaningful role. This is compounded by the fact that most services and legislation affecting children actually fall under the jurisdiction of the states and territories. The lack of a comprehensive legislative framework to guide the work a national children's commissioner calls into question its potential effectiveness. In Senate estimates on 23 May this year the Hon. Catherine Branson QC, the Human Rights Commissioner, confirmed that unlike all the other commissioners—that is, the Age Discrimination Commissioner, the Race Discrimination Commissioner and all the others—a national children's commissioner will not undertake any casework, specifically due to the lack of overarching children's legislation. 


This may also explain the relatively low amount of funding which is currently allotted for the commissioner. This funding will pay for the commissioner, a personal assistant and two research assistants at the most. The lack of funding is a dilemma in itself. Ms Branson confirmed that with the creation of a new commissioner, casework always increases. But there is not a substantial commitment to fund the children's commissioner, particularly due to its restricted functions. I put it to this House that it will simply not be effective in doing what it is intended to do.


This morning the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs tabled a report in this House. Unfortunately, we did not get an opportunity to speak to that. I would like to address a few comments specifically regarding that report because, like many of the bills referred to this place, the scrutiny of this bill was done in indecent haste without sufficient time to really prosecute the issues. The coalition has tabled a dissenting report, and I would like to explain the reasons this has happened. 


The coalition members do not agree with the committee that the Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986 should be amended to establish a statutory office of the National Children's Commissioner in the Australian Human Rights Commission. Coalition members of the committee recognise the importance of promoting public discussion and awareness of issues affecting children. We also acknowledge that legislation, policies and programs affecting the rights, wellbeing and development of children should be properly examined. However, we are not persuaded by the committee that this bill would necessarily advance these objectives any further than is currently being achieved.


Coalition members are of the view that the AHRC, the Australian Human Rights Commission, in cooperation with the relevant state and territory commissioners and guardians, already adequately performs the functions envisaged for the new commissioner. The establishment of a new commissioner at a federal level would unnecessarily duplicate the policy and advocacy functions of the respective state and territory authorities as well as the advisory functions provided for in the Australian Human Rights Commission Act. Additionally, given the new commissioner will only function as an advocate and not undertake any casework, coalition members are not persuaded its establishment would support the work currently performed by the state and territory commissioners. Rather, the bill would merely contribute to the expansion of Australia's already burgeoning bureaucracy.


Coalition members cannot agree with the commission that there is urgency surrounding the establishment of a national children's commissioner. There is no evidence to suggest that there has been an increase in the workload of the AHRC or that of the respective state and territory commissioners to justify the establishment of a new commissioner at federal level. Coalition members are not persuaded that there are any compelling reasons to further expand the number of AHRC commissioners, nor significant justification to create a stand-alone advocacy function for children's rights in Australia at the Commonwealth level. Therefore, sadly, the coalition does not support the bill.


It is fundamental that the most vulnerable people in our society receive care and protection, and none are more vulnerable than children. But tokenistic gestures do not equate to real protection on the ground. If the government were truly sincere about protecting the rights of children we would not see children continuing to be locked up in detention centres when they have committed no crime, and the government would not pursue policies that penalise single parents and force small children onto the street.


I take the first issue first because it is dear to my heart. In 2004 I, along with the former member for Kooyong, Petro Georgiou, Russell Broadbent, the member for McMillan, Bruce Baird, the former member for Cook and former senator, Judith Troeth, really struggled to convince the government that detention centres are not the places for people who have not committed any crime. In most cases—and nothing has changed—these are not detention centres but maximum-security prisons where we put murderers, rapists, armed robbers and people who are real criminals. These children have committed no crime. We fought tooth and nail to bring about changes and in 2005 the Howard government announced that it would only be under the most dire circumstances that children would remain in detention centres. A time limit was put on processing them and giving these families with children TPVs.


It greatly disturbs me that we have nearly 500 children—I think that is the number—who remain in detention centres in this country. If we are truly concerned about the plight of children then surely one of the first things we have to do is go back to the spirit of the agreement we made with the Howard government and make sure that we no longer keep children in detention centres in this country. It simply is not right. If the general public of Australia had seen what I saw when I visited some of the centres they would be shocked and would in no way sanction this policy. I continue to be concerned about these very basic and fundamental issues that could be addressed. So why are we pretending here that a children's commissioner is going to resolve some of the most fundamental problems that are before us today?


To go to the second issue, and I do not think I am out of order to speak on this now, social security legislation for what was formerly called Welfare to Work is scheduled to come into this House today and I will speak in greater detail on it then. But the issue here is that we have a bill coming before us which seeks to move single parents off the parent payment when their child turns eight and onto the Newstart allowance. This affects the most vulnerable people in our community, the most vulnerable families who are living below the poverty line. There are 100,000 single parents in this country and 90 per cent of them are women. They are not there because they want to be there. They are not there because they deliberately get pregnant and have children to get onto social security benefits, as many would want us to believe. They are there, very often, because they are escaping domestic violence. They are there because there is no-fault divorce. And sometimes they are there because their partner passes away. This group of people will, under the legislation to come before us later, lose a minimum of $60 a week from their entitlement by moving to Newstart.


What really upsets me is that this legislation says that it is to get people into work. If that is the case, why has the government taken $50 million a year out of job agency payments? These job agencies are already struggling to meet the needs of the long-term unemployed, and we are going to foist on them 100,000 people, or whatever the demographic might be that move over to Newstart allowance, who will be going to them to get help to go to work. These agencies are severely underfunded as it is and they are going to lose $50 million a year. It is just not right. If we truly wanted to move people from welfare into work then we would not be taking measures like that which provide them with very little support.


I listened to the radio this morning and heard about the many members of this parliament who will sleep rough on the streets tonight. I commend them for that. But I remind the House that if we were really serious about the human rights of children we would attend to their most basic and fundamental rights, which are to have a roof over their heads, to have food, to have clothing, to be able to go to school, to be able to have medical assistance and to be able to gain an education. The fact is that on the streets tonight more than 16 per cent of Australia's 105,000 homeless will be families—these are parents with children.


Mr O'Connor, the Minister for Homelessness, is a good minister for whom I have a lot of regard. I heard him say on the radio this morning that the number of women and children among the homeless on our streets are growing in number, yet we are going to drive them further into poverty by taking $60 a week off them by shifting them onto Newstart allowance. So I just wonder what we are doing in this place by standing up and trying to defend a piece of legislation to establish a children's commissioner. We are going to pay for another bureaucrat. I am not taking shots at bureaucrats; some are very good, they do a fine job and I have a lot of respect and a high regard for them. But we are going to pay for another bureaucrat while on our streets we are seeing those fundamental needs unmet. We are living in a wealthy country. Every person should think about this. I have heard a couple of members talk about the abuse and neglect of children. Fiona Stanley, a highly respected medical practitioner and worker in this field, wrote a very fine book a couple of years ago in which she pointed out that poverty is a big reason we are seeing increasing abuse and neglect of children. So I just shake my head at this legislation. It is not that I and the coalition do not want to see greater protection of children. We would like to see greater protection, but we need to address the fundamentals. (Time expired)

"Smyth, Laura, MP",ALP,2012-06-21,"



Ms SMYTH
 (La Trobe) (11:05):  I think it is fitting that, at the conclusion of the last contribution to this debate, I set the record somewhat straight on the question of housing and this government's commitment to social housing. It was clearly the last speaker's contention that we should be focusing on developments in housing that would assist families and people living rough to find a home or adequate housing. It is somewhat ironic that we are having this discussion when, as part of the stimulus package that this government—and this government alone—committed to, we have a commitment in my home state of Victoria for more than 4,500 social housing units, the vast majority of which have, in fact, been constructed. I visited one in recent weeks and saw the practical benefits that this government has delivered to people, to families and to children who were living in unacceptable circumstances. This was one of the first acts taken by this government, so I will not countenance any comments being put on the record in this place about the commitment of this government to ensuring that people have adequate housing in this country going unchallenged. Clearly, there is much more to do, but it is this government that, after more than a decade of neglect and disregard by the Howard government, made housing and social housing a national priority and backed it with funding. Those opposite simply cannot claim to have the same kind of record on these issues at all. That is the first point. The second point is that, as a member of the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, I was pleased this morning to be able to be part of the review of the report which has now been tabled in the House in relation to and in support of the National Children's Commissioner. I certainly do not see this as a token measure. I see this as an important measure which ensures advocacy for children in this country and it is something which is long overdue. It has been called for for a considerable time. I know that many advocates from a progressive policy view, and certainly many Labor people, have advocated for a National Children's Commissioner for some time.


Indeed, in 2009 we delivered the first-ever national framework for protecting Australia's children, and all of the policy measures that we have put in place—from education to mental health care for children and young people to early intervention to ensure that children are protected through early learning, through health measures that we have put in place and through education—go to our core beliefs that children should have a good start in life and be supported in their infancy to ensure that they have an opportunity to succeed in life. So it is consistent with those objectives and those policy measures that we today see debate on the National Children's Commissioner.


In 2009 and 2010 the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs conducted considerable public discussion on a national children's commissioner. The debate and discussion about this issue have been going on for some years in a formal sense and, prior to that, informally. Due to the variety of stakeholder views on the issue, the government conducted further targeted consultations about it. In December of last year the department produced a discussion paper on the question of a children's commissioner and, indeed, the matter is the subject of not only the House standing committee's deliberations on the matter but also the Senate committee's considerations about the establishment of a children's commissioner. And through those processes we have seen some 59 submissions to the Senate inquiry overwhelmingly supporting this bill and the concept of a national children's commissioner. Because we see that around Australia there is a piecemeal approach, it has to be said, to protecting the safety and wellbeing of children, it is important that we have a national framework and a national advocate for children. This is by no means the tokenistic measure that the coalition has referred to in its dissenting report to the standing committee's report earlier today. It is not the tokenistic measure that was alluded to in the previous member's contribution in this place.


Indeed, we have had comments from the Australian Human Rights Commissioner and the commission itself in relation to the establishment of a national children's commissioner, particularly in relation to the question of interoperability with state and territory agencies, which was mentioned in the previous speaker's contribution. At the Senate hearings on this issue the commissioner noted the considerable planning and consultation processes that had taken place on the development of the proposal for a commissioner. She said: 'There has been quite long-term consideration of the relationship between a national children's commissioner and the guardians and children's commissioner at a state and territory level. The topic of the possibility of establishing a national children's commissioner has been under consideration for some time.' She went on to note that state and territory commissioners and guardian representatives had made a combined submission to the Attorney-General's Department supporting the establishment of a commissioner. It was her view that there would be an opportunity for enhancement of the work of those respective agencies and advocates and that that work would continue.


So there is a high level of interest in the establishment of a national children's commissioner. It presents an opportunity to provide advocacy for children and young people right across the spectrum of issues affecting them, from welfare and safety considerations to the ongoing and important issue of 'closing the gap' of Indigenous disadvantage and issues like infant mortality. I see the commissioner as having a significant role to play and I fully support the objectives of the bill before us today. As a consequence, I am very pleased to be able to commend the bill to the House.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2012-06-21,"



Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Minister for Health) (11:12):  I will be summing up on behalf of the government. I thank honourable members for their contributions to the debate on the Australian Human Rights Commission Amendment (National Children’s Commissioner) Bill 2012, and I particularly thank the members for Pearce and La Trobe whose contributions I have been listening to very intently.


This bill will establish the National Children's Commissioner within the Australian Human Rights Commission. The member for Pearce was suggesting that we have a choice as governments between action and advocacy, and that a role like this, which is focused on advocacy, is necessarily in contradiction to, or intended instead of, action in the area of children's rights, which, of course, is not correct. This government has acted more than any other government in Australia's history to protect the rights and interests of our most vulnerable Australians—children—and that includes in areas like our Healthy Kids Check, and preschools where we are moving to universal preschool education for at least one year for Australian children. It also includes the types of investments that we have seen in policing and also in counselling in the Northern Territory and in other parts of Australia in communities where child abuse is at completely unacceptable levels.


Homelessness was mentioned as well, and we have built 21,000 public housing dwellings around Australia out of the global financial crisis stimulus package. There is the National Rental Affordability Scheme for 50,000 properties, with 10,000 built already and 10,000 to be built next year: 50,000 in total. There are dozens of new homelessness facilities right around Australia, including ones for families, and there has been significant investment in services that prevent homelessness because it is better to have families staying at home rather than losing their homes. 


The schoolkids bonus is the classic example in the most recent budget; a measure that supports families with children and makes life a little bit easier for those families—a measure opposed, extraordinarily, by those opposite. A Children's Commissioner is not in opposition to action in these areas but a complement to it. It is important for the voiceless to have a voice and that is what the Children's Commissioner provides for our children.


A National Children's Commissioner will be a strong and forceful voice for these children and young people and play a proactive and positive role in their wellbeing and development. Our children are our future and if we do not value them we can never hope to protect them. A National Children's Commissioner will put their needs front and centre, and that is why the government is so pleased that we will establish for the first time a dedicated advocate focused on the human rights of children and young people at a national level.


This bill's basic principle is that every child is a valued member of our society. A National Children's Commissioner will raise public awareness of nationally significant issues affecting children and young people through discussion, research and educational programs. The commissioner will examine relevant existing and proposed Commonwealth legislation to determine if it adequately recognises and protects children's rights in Australia and report their findings to the government. The commissioner will consult directly with children and their representative organisations to ensure that they can influence the development of policies and programs that affect them at Commonwealth level.


Importantly, the National Children's Commissioner will have a clear focus on vulnerable or at risk groups of children, such as children with disability, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, homeless children, or those who are witnessing or subject to violence. The commissioner will also report to government each year on matters relating to the human rights of children. The position will contribute to meeting Australia's obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child and reinforce our commitment to our international obligations and relationship with the United Nations.


The commissioner will not duplicate the roles of state and territory children's commissioners but will seek to work closely and collaboratively with them to identify national or cross-jurisdictional matters that would benefit from national leadership. Members of the Australian Children's Commissioners and Guardians Group have already indicated their willingness to work collaboratively with the new commissioner and have reiterated their support for the position. The commissioner will not have a guardianship role nor will it have a complaint-handling role or a role in dealing with individual children, including individual children's cases in the context of child protection or family law. However, the commissioner will have a limited role to seek leave to intervene in court proceedings which raise significant children's rights issues—but that will not extend to representing individual children.


I would like to now address some of the issues that have been raised in the debate. The member for Stirling raised the speed with which this has come forward. This has not been a speedy process for the Labor Party. We have been advocating for such a position since 2003. We have conducted consultation with state and territory commissioners and non-government organisations from a range of fields, including a child protection and service delivery, over the last two years. This Labor government wants to see a National Children's Commissioner up and running as soon as possible for the benefit of Australia's children, to give them an independent voice on the national stage. 


Funding was allocated in the 2012-13 budget and is available from 1 July 2012. I do not really see why for legislation such as this the opposition seems determined to tie up and delay such important reforms. Some members opposite also raised duplication with state and territory children's commissioners, but there is no duplication of function here. This will be a uniquely national cross-jurisdictional advocacy role.


The member for Fremantle has been a very strong advocate for this position and for children's rights across the board for a very long time. The Attorney-General particularly wanted to thank her for her support and assistance in developing this policy and the role of the commissioner. The member for Canberra highlighted some important functions the commissioner will undertake and the benefits that will flow from the commissioner's advocacy.


The Attorney-General particularly wanted to thank all honourable members for putting their considered views on this important piece of legislation. The Attorney-General thanks the House committee for its report, which recognises the urgency in establishing the position and the need to avoid unnecessary delay. The Attorney-General acknowledges the committee recommended funding be reviewed. The government is confident that funding will be sufficient to meet all its functions, but of course the government will closely monitor it through implementation.


The government looks forward to the passage of this bill to ensure a National Children's Commissioner can be established as soon as possible for the benefit of Australia's children and young people. The creation of the National Children's Commissioner is an important initiative in the government's work to protect our children and young people and promote and protect their human rights. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr HAYES
 (Fowler) (09:54):  I rise to support the Australian Human Rights Commission Amendment (National Children's Commissioner) Bill 2012. The bill amends the Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986 and creates the position of the National Children's Commissioner in the Human Rights Commission. The commissioner will have a monumental role in providing a voice for Australian children, particularly those who are living in disadvantaged conditions and those exposed to threats to their rights and safety.


Like many here, I have children—I also very proudly have five grandchildren—and for this reason this bill has a particular personal significance to me. Even though my children are all grown up, as a parent I cannot help but always want to lend support to them no matter how old they are. Grandparents and their grandchildren have a slightly different relationship to the relationship that parents and their children have, but still as a grandparent you are always looking after and lending support to your grandchildren. I am very blessed because, as I said, I have five grandchildren, and they are very much loved. One of my grandsons is afflicted by autism, and  this means that the relationship with him is slightly different again. As a family we do everything we can to ensure that he is not discriminated against in our community, in his schooling or, particularly, within the family.


I feel for people who do not have such a close family bond as we do. There are many in our community who, for various reasons, do not. Many children are forced to become adults well before their time. Children afflicted with disabilities, children living in homeless conditions and children exposed to domestic violence often are forced to take on the persona of mature adults well before their childhood has passed. Having a strong voice for children in this predicament reflects a caring society. This bill is not designed to bureaucratically impose the National Children's Commissioner to supplant the role of a caring family, but it does acknowledge that not every kid in this country—and the member for Fremantle has been very passionate about this for some time—has the support of a caring family. We as a caring nation need to ensure that they to have a strong voice.


I have had an interest in domestic violence for a heck of a long time, because I have had a long association with law enforcement agencies around the country. I am very proud of the efforts they make to suppress crime and minimise the impacts of crime on the community. When I look at the crime statistics—and it does not matter which date, which jurisdiction or which police station they come from—I see that the reported incidents of domestic violence remain stubbornly high. The number of incidents is in many instances going up. This is sometimes on the basis that people are now more confident about reporting domestic violence to authorities; nevertheless, domestic violence is of considerable concern in our society. We normally talk about the impact that domestic violence has on women, who are its main targets, but it also has a huge impact on children. According to statistics, one in three women in Australia will experience domestic violence and one in five women will experience sexual violence. These statistics are pretty bad on the face of it. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics 2005 personal safety survey, of all women who have experienced partner related violence that had children, 59 per cent indicated that the violence was witnessed by the children in a relationship. So the violence had a direct impact on the children in those relationships. Most of those relationships would probably have more than child. If you extrapolate the statistics, it is possible for the total number of victims of domestic violence to be almost the same as the number of children who have witnessed domestic violence. The impact of that is that 60 per cent of young males growing up in an abusive relationship are more than likely to become abusers themselves as they mature and 50 percent of young females growing up in an abusive relationship—and I am assured this is the case--are more than likely to take an abuser as a partner.


To assert that in these areas a child should not have a strong voice is an absolute absurdity and it certainly would be a situation where we would be closing our eyes to something that all of us in this place know is a reality—that is that the level of domestic violence is high. The victims are not just the women in the relationship who have been targeted specifically for the violence but the children themselves. In a similar way I see a role for the commissioner in terms of homeless children and others children in vulnerable positions in our society.


Homeless children are a group that are very vulnerable and many face unique challenges to survive on a daily basis. This is not just young people living rough. This also includes young people who for various reasons are not able to live at home and have been, using the popular term, 'lounge surfing'. They move from one sofa to another, from one family to another and regrettably they do not have a permanent place of abode. In my former electorate we did a lot of work with an organisation that was specifically providing shelter for young women. I had the opportunity to meet with these kids on many occasions, particularly at Christmas and Easter and occasions that would normally impact on a family. What I learnt from talking to many of the kids there—and they ranged from 12 through to 19—was that there were many reasons they were not at home. But what they really wanted was to have someone actually help them to make decisions in their lives. It was a church based organisation that was helping them in that direction. It showed me that young people do have rights. Young people do need to understand the social systems that we take for granted as adults and they need some person who has the legal authority to pursue their rights.


Back in 2005, when I was the member for Werriwa, in the lead up to the by-election the Macquarie Fields riots took place. There were a lot of young people throwing firebombs and stones and everything else that they could at the local police. At that stage I met up with Father Chris Riley and have had a very long and valued association with him ever since. He is a man who is absolutely passionate about children and making sure that children have every opportunity to succeed in our society. He is not a person who wants to come in and prejudge relationships. He certainly does not prejudge why kids are on the street. He wants to give them an opportunity. I have seen the passion in this man's face when it comes to kids.


Not long after that, we had the devastation of the earthquakes in Indonesia. Father Chris Riley became heavily involved in building a school at Aceh. Many of the kids who were throwing Molotov cocktails and stones at police and doing all that stuff in Macquarie Fields were the ones who accompanied Father Chris Riley to Aceh to help build the Islamic school there. I have met these kids many times. A number of these young people who were on the streets showing all the signs of being delinquent are now qualified social workers and are working within the system to try and assist young people, showing them there is a better way, helping them to be able to make those decisions because many of the young people that Father Chris Riley deals with do not have a stable adult influence in their lives. Unfortunately, many kids in that sort of environment mature rapidly beyond their age and miss out on their childhood. People like Father Chris Riley who are committed to helping young people do an absolutely fine job, but young people must be seen to be able to exercise appropriately their legal voice. They do need someone who can assist. In the short time I have available I would like to mention a person who in New South Wales absolutely stands out as someone who did much for young people. Barbara Holborow was a magistrate in the Children's Court of New South Wales. She received the Order of Australia earlier this year before passing away at the age of 81. She was a magistrate with the Children's Court for a number of years and she was a person who dedicated her life to disadvantaged youth. Barbara worked in a women's refuge. The first child she adopted was a young Aboriginal boy called Jacob. After that, many foster children came under Barbara's care. As a magistrate, Barbara had an impact on the lives of many thousands of kids. Fiercely committed to reforming the justice system for children, she was involved in setting up free legal aid for children in New South Wales and in creating a court which actually cared for the rights of children, particularly in cases of neglect. Sentences were able to be deferred and diversionary activities were set up for young people.


If Barbara were still with us she would be an excellent person to consider for the role of National Children's Commissioner. A person in authority, Barbara Holborow did so much to ensure not only that children's rights were observed but also that children were given the appropriate chance that all of us take for granted for our own kids. I commend this legislation. Like the member for Fremantle, I am proud to be part of a government that has taken on board the rights of children to ensure that they are properly protected in our modern society.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2012-06-21,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (10:09):  The Human Rights Commission Amendment (National Children’s Commissioner) Bill 2012, which establishes a National Children's Commissioner in Australia, fulfils a long-term commitment by Labor to appoint a national advocate for children. I underscore the comments of the previous speaker in saying it is an achievement of which we are very proud. The new commissioner will focus on promoting the rights, wellbeing and development of children and young people, advocating for their rights on a national level. The National Children's Commissioner will ensure the voices of children and young people are heard in the development of Commonwealth policies and programs, an incredibly important initiative. The new position will begin from 1 July this year or on royal assent, whichever is later. The National Children's Commissioner will join the six existing commissioners at the Australian Human Rights Commission: the Human Rights Commissioner, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, the Age Discrimination Commissioner, the Race Discrimination Commissioner, the Disability Discrimination Commissioner and the Sex Discrimination Commissioner.


We want every child in Australia to grow up safe, happy and well. The new commissioner will represent the views of children and young people, particularly those who are most vulnerable. It is time for children and young people to have a national advocate to ensure their rights are reflected in national policies and programs as more of our policies focus on the health and welfare of children. I would also like to point out—and this is important—that the commissioner will not duplicate but complement the work of states and territories, particularly the work of other commissioners and guardians. The commissioner will take a broad advocacy role to promote public awareness of issues affecting children. He or she will also conduct research and education programs and consult directly with children and representative organisations, as well as monitor Commonwealth legislation, policies and programs that relate to children's rights, wellbeing and development.


As part of the 2012-13 budget the government has committed $3.5 million over four years to fund the new Children's Commissioner position. This is welcome funding and will ensure the Children's Commissioner has the resources to carry out its important mandate. Certain comparable jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Norway, already have full-time children's rights commissioners, so this development is incredibly welcome and is one of which I am very proud.


The objectives of establishing this position are: to improve advocacy at a national level for the rights, wellbeing and development of children and young people up to the age of 18 years; to improve monitoring of Commonwealth laws affecting the rights, wellbeing and development of children and young people; to encourage the active involvement of children and young people in decisions that affect them, particularly in the development of government policies, programs and legislation; to support government agencies to develop mechanisms that enhance the active involvement of children and young people; and to assist Australia in meeting its international obligations by promoting and advancing the rights of the child, in particular as enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.


The commissioner will have discretion when performing any of their functions to focus on particular groups of children who are at risk or vulnerable, such as children with disability, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, homeless children or those who are witnessing or subjected to violence. The commissioner will also have discretion to consult with whomever is considered appropriate, with a focus on children—representative organisations of children, state and territory children's commissioners, and guardians. The commissioner will not, however, have a complaint-handling role or a role in dealing with individual children, including individual children's cases in the context of child protection or family law. Although the commissioner will have a limited role to seek leave to intervene in court proceedings that raise significant children's rights issues, this will not extend to representing individual children. They will not have a role as the legal guardian of unaccompanied children in the immigration area or in any other guardianship role.


I am pleased to say that the establishment of a National Children's Commissioner has been well received by stakeholders. Children's rights groups have heralded the establishment of this position as a major step forward in championing children's rights. Early Childhood Australia said:


The creation of a position dedicated solely to promoting the rights, wellbeing and development of children in Australia will ensure that children’s voices are no longer overlooked.


They say it will 'play an important role in ensuring children grow up in a happy and safe environment'. A coalition of Australian's leading children and youth focused organisations—the Australian Youth Affairs Coalition, Save the Children and UNICEF—have also welcomed the announcement as 'an important further step in establishing more robust accountability in government policy and practice for children'. Dr Norman Gillespie, Chief Executive of UNICEF Australia, said:


We need bipartisan support for the role to ensure that the outcomes for children are effective.


The Australian Human Rights Commission itself has also welcomed the news and said:


… the Commissioner will be an important advocate for the protection and promotion of the rights of children and young people across Australia and will help ensure that their voices are heard.


According to the commission:


A National Children’s Commissioner will play an important role in advocating for the protection of the human rights of some of the most vulnerable children and young people in Australia.


It is also important to note that many children and young people in regional and remote Australia who are at risk of social exclusion and poor outcomes will be better represented thanks to the establishment of this position. In recognition of this, the National Children's Commissioner proposal includes funding specifically for the commissioner and staff to travel to regional and remote Australia to consult directly with children and young people and to deliver education and public awareness sessions in those locations.


I applaud the Gillard Labor government for taking action to appoint a National Children's Commissioner. It says a lot about the way Labor thinks and feels about children and children's rights in our society. Gone are the days when children were seen and not heard. More and more we are seeing the rights of children being taken into account in our courts, our classrooms and our parliaments. This is important because human rights are children's rights too. International human rights instruments recognise that children as well as adults have basic human rights. Children, most importantly, also have the right to special protection because of their vulnerability to exploitation and abuse.


Every representative in this House has been exposed to children at risk and also children who have been the victims of abuse. Earlier this year I went to an event at one of my local schools. The kids were performing a concert, and there was one girl who was incredibly noticeable for the fact that for the whole time she covered her face in her hair and kept looking down. There was no engagement with the audience, with her teachers or with the other children in the choir. This child had, in a way, been stunted. It was obvious that she had low self-esteem, or no self-esteem at all. It was tragic to see this young person in, as I said, this stunted state. I turned to one of the teachers and said: 'Is that girl going through some body image issues? What's the story behind this young girl?' They told me that she had been a victim of abuse for many years, and essentially they had spent a lot of time helping her by counselling and trying to draw her out of herself and improve her self-esteem, her image of herself and her confidence. Putting her in the choir was part of that process to help her to engage with others—her peers, her teachers and also, hopefully, the audience. Judging from what I saw of that girl on that day it was going to take some time, given that, as I said, she was covering herself and almost wanted to become invisible through the hair over her face and the lack of engagement with anyone. It was just tragic to see that someone so young wanted to, in a way, write herself out of any presence on the earth.


In this job I have also, unfortunately, been exposed to many women and children who have been the victims of domestic violence. I have spoken many times in this House of women whom we have had to help out with social housing, including women with teenage kids. One woman in particular who came to see us very early in my term was a victim of domestic violence. She was sleeping in her car. She was undergoing chemo for breast cancer, and she had been living in this state in the car with these two teenage kids for weeks and weeks. She came to us to see if we could assist in any way with social housing, and we did, very fortunately, get a social house for her and her two teenage kids. The challenge she was also facing—as if she did not have enough challenges as it was—was the fact that one of her children was a teenage boy and there is a policy at some women's refuges that they do not take teenage boys. I understand why that is so, but it is an issue on which I have been in discussions with the ACT Minister for Women and for Community Services since I have been elected to see what we can do to allow teenage boys to access women's refuge services. I know that, as I said, there are very strong policies as to why some women's refuges do not take teenage boys, but it was particularly difficult for this woman, who was going through this dreadful predicament of not only being the victim of domestic violence but also undergoing chemo to treat breast cancer.


Late last year, during the school presentations, I had the privilege of going out to Galilee, which is out in the south of my electorate. Galilee looks after and educates kids at risk. They were largely young boys, but there were a few young women there too, and they had just spent the year achieving their year 10 certificate. It was a really special occasion just being there with them to celebrate this significant achievement. They had overcome a number of hurdles to attain that academic level—again, not just the self-esteem issues but also being the victims of abuse and other challenges—so it was a real privilege to be with Galilee. Galilee does great work with kids at risk in the community here in Canberra. I commend it for that, and this was an excellent example of the great work that it is doing to help kids through very difficult stages and get them an academic achievement that will form the building blocks for, hopefully, a bright and successful future. Again, very early on in my term I also had the privilege of going out to the Lions Youth Haven, where Galilee is located. I met with a number of young men who were also at risk and who were not doing particularly well at school. They had been signed up for a program where they were building barriers to protect the trees. At Lions Youth Haven there are a number of people who go horse riding and a number of horses are agisted out there, and the horses were eating the bark on these trees. A number of these trees were significant, and Lions Youth Haven and other members of the community rightly wanted to protect them. Lions Youth Haven decided to get these young men at risk to build barriers to protect the trees. This was great for the environment and it was great for the trees; it was not so great for the horses, who obviously liked the bark!


Just in talking to these young men I heard that it taught them not just a range of skills in how to build something and to see the product of their labour but also team-building skills. They had to build these barriers in a team but, most importantly, they had to erect these barriers as a team. It ensured that they improved their communication skills, and the fact that they had to manage as a group improved their abilities to work as a team and those interpersonal skills. If someone is a victim of abuse or if they are a victim of domestic violence they tend to shut those down, like the young girl that I saw in the choir at that school. In a way, they want to withdraw and become invisible and stunted. This program actually drew these boys out to engage with others and also to work in a productive way with others.


I hope that the establishment of this position will mark the beginning of a new era for children in Australia, particularly those who are most vulnerable, like some who I have just spoken about. Australia can be a wonderful place to grow up in; however, not all children have the same opportunities, and certain demographics are often at a disadvantage when they are young, which can lead to disadvantage later in life. We should do all we can to ensure that all children get the best start in life and are treated with dignity and respect. I have no doubt that this will have better long-term outcomes for those children and society at large. I commend this bill to the House.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER

"Grierson, Sharon, MP",ALP,2012-06-21,"



Ms GRIERSON
 (Newcastle) (10:24):  I too rise to speak in support of the Australian Human Rights Commission Amendment (National Children's Commissioner) Bill 2012. Obviously, this bill will establish for the first time the National Children's Commissioner, the first ever dedicated advocate for children and young people Australia-wide—something that our federal Labor government has been absolutely committed to.


Of course, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child is the foundation for this legislation. That convention outlines four key principles in advocating for the protection and the rights of children. They are: nondiscrimination; devotion to the best interests of the child; the right to life, survival and development; and respect for the views of the child.


Having spent 30 years of my professional life in schools as a teacher and as a school principal, for me this is a day of great significance and one of personal pride. I warmly welcome the young people who we can see in our galleries today because we are here today trying to represent their best interests. I remember very well teaching a unit of work on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and how wonderful it was for children and young people to know that they were part of global legislation and a framework to protect their rights. Of course, I also saw—too many times—the abuse of children's rights. I remember my very first year as a teacher, having a class of behaviourally disturbed children and knowing that one of those children was being beaten regularly by his parents. It is a very distressing situation for a young person, as I was then. I think what was also distressing was the conflict for that child, because that child loved his parents so much even though he was a victim of their abuse. So it is a very difficult situation to make sure that we get the rights of a child not just asserted for but also managed sensitively, managed strongly and managed well.


I have also had many experiences of dealing with disclosures of sexual abuse from children. That is the saddest thing of all: to have a child go to a teacher or to a counsellor in a school and disclose that they are a victim of abuse, because usually it is from a family member. I guess that I understand what mentors of children, teachers of children and people who support children through their lives come across every day. I heard the member for Canberra talking about a child at risk and, unfortunately, in education so many times we identify children who are clearly at risk and who are clearly victims of some sort of emotional, physical or sexual abuse. Unfortunately, restrictions in the law sometimes lead to very frustrating situations where we cannot address those problems as well as we might like to if there is no disclosure—and children will often protect the people who do the abuse, thinking that that is the right thing to do. So today is a significant day, and this is an important piece of legislation.


This bill seeks to amend the Australian Human Rights Commission Act to establish the position of National Children's Commissioner in the Australian Human Rights Commission. The intention of the Labor government in establishing the commissioner is: to improve national advocacy for the rights, wellbeing and development of youth under the age of 18; to improve monitoring of Commonwealth laws affecting the rights, wellbeing and development of children and young people; to encourage the active participation of young people in decisions that affect them, particularly in the development of government policies and programs—so it is always wonderful to have young people in this place; to support government agencies in enhancing and increasing the involvement of youth; and to assist Australia in meeting its international obligations by promoting and advancing the rights of the child as enshrined in the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. To say that the phrase 'the children are our future' is a cliche denies its reality. The wellbeing of children and young people must be at the forefront of our minds as legislators, because obviously one day they will inevitably replace us. As the Attorney-General has stated, Australia's future depends on them reaching their full potential. The commissioner will stimulate national conversation about the key issues affecting young Australians, striving to fulfil and promote their best interests. I looked back at my first speech in this House and noted then that I was very mindful of the responsibility of representing young people in this place. I mentioned the very high expectations young people so rightly hold for government, and I hope this bill goes some distance in representing the best interests into the future. At the commissioner's discretion, they will be able to focus on particular vulnerable or at-risk groups of children and young people such as children with a disability, Indigenous children, homeless children or those who are witness or subject to violence and abuse.


Our bill also contains provisions enabling the commissioner to consult with bodies that have a focus on children, organisations that represent children and state and territory children's commissioners and guardians. They will research and promote programs that go to the core in both addressing and understanding the issues and challenges faced by young people in modern Australia, and I suppose we would all know that those challenges are much more complex. The internet itself is a liberator but, unfortunately, it also liberates the wrong people to prey on young children. Whilst not dealing with individual cases in the context of protection or family law, the commissioner will be able to seek leave to intervene in court proceedings which raise significant children's rights issues. That is a powerful tool. I know it will be used very sensibly but it is comforting that that is part of this legislation.


The 2008 report by the Australian Law Reform Commission indicated that, over the previous decade, children had slipped off the national agenda, citing a rise in child protection notifications and a lower rate of conviction. At the time, Minister Macklin noted that convictions often did not occur due to a lack of evidence, because for people such as children giving evidence can be a frightening thing to do—and I mentioned just how conflicted young people are in that situation. That is why our government has been determined to create a National Children's Commissioner, somebody who will champion and advocate for those who too often have little or no voice at all.


The facts are that children in regional and remote Australia are at greater risk. When compared with those in larger cities, social exclusion and poor outcomes can snowball and lead to a cycle of disadvantage in many walks of life. Funding has been specifically provided for the commissioner and staff to travel to remote places around the nation in order to consult directly with young people and to deliver educational and public awareness programs about the rights of children and the role of the commissioner.


In 2009, our Labor government established the National Framework for Protecting Australia's Children through the Council of Australian Governments, COAG. This was in recognition of the unacceptable levels of child abuse and neglect occurring in our community. The framework indicated that in 2007-08 there were 55,120 reported cases of child abuse and neglect that had been substantiated by child protection services, a very unacceptable figure. The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare indicates that in 2010-11 there were over 31,000 children in substantiated abuse or neglect cases, or one in every 165 children under the age of 18. We can imagine that these figures are only a very small glimpse of the real tragedy facing some children in our communities, and it is unacceptable in a first-world country such as ours.


The institute tell us in its report, Headline indicators for children's health, development and wellbeing, 2011, that although Australian children generally fare comparatively well on a global level, when examining health, status and risk, there is considerable variation when it comes to some key groups. The report indicates that Indigenous children are severely overrepresented across the child protection system when compared with non-Indigenous Australians. In 2010, this group were eight times as likely to be the subject of substantiated abuse or neglect, nine times as likely to be on a care and protection order and 10 times as likely to be in out-of-home care. The report continues, indicating that Indigenous children have a greater chance of being disadvantaged in the areas of health, development and wellbeing. We have made great strides as a government in improving Indigenous outcomes. Year 12 retention rates have risen to 47 per cent, from 30 per cent in the 1990s for Indigenous youth. In Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory, mortality rates have fallen by 36 per cent, but there is clearly more to be done.


When examining another disadvantaged at-risk group—children in remote areas—we again hear a shameful story. Compared with their metropolitan counterparts, children in remote areas are two to three times more likely to die as infants or due to injury and 30 per cent more likely to be born with low birth weight or to be overweight or obese. Furthermore, they are more likely to be developmentally vulnerable at school entry, being around 40-50 per cent less likely to meet national minimum standards for reading and numeracy. In lower socioeconomic parts of our nation, we again see significant pockets of disadvantage and, similarly, those statistics put children at risk. They are astonishing figures for a country such as Australia, but they are the cold, hard facts that indicate that we must continue to introduce new measures to look after the rights of children.


Our government will continue to assist and advocate for those people particularly. There is not any single solution to the problems of social disadvantage. That is why we keep introducing policies and programs—and I see the minister here in the chamber—such as the new schoolkids bonus to help make ends meet, and Paid Parental Leave, and we have, of course, lifted the tax-free threshold to $18,200 to help low-income families. We know that financial pressure is often one of the triggers for relationship breakdowns and certainly for domestic disputes and violence.


Recent changes to the Family Law Act introduced by our government took effect this month. These changes better protect children and young people exposed to family violence, ensuring appropriate action be taken to put the child first in family law disputes. It is also why we are introducing the National Children's Commissioner, to work wholly and solely in the best interests of our young people. The Hunter Valley Research Foundation in my own area tells us that early school leavers, year 10 or below, have an unemployment rate twice that of trade qualified people and around three times the rate of somebody with a university qualification. Hunter region data from the foundation indicates that early school leavers without post-school education or training are generally the lowest paid. This is a nationwide phenomenon and one that is typically higher in areas of greater socio-economic disadvantage. Globally, Australia is above the average when it comes to OECD figures on all key indicators. However, there remains scope for dramatic improvement.


Dr Sharon Bessell, a senior director of the Children's Policy Centre at the Crawford School of Public Policy at the Australian National University, and Brian Babington, CEO of Families Australia, wrote in the Sydney Morning Herald, on 1 May, 2012 that 'four principles would be vital in guiding the National Children's Commissioner to ensure that an impact is actually made'. Firstly, they said that the position should complement existing state and territory commissioners, and we do understand the importance of value-adding. The new Children's Commissioner will join six other national commissioners in the Australian Human Rights Commission. Secondly, they said that the role of National Children's Commissioner should be above politics and remain impartial, with the rights of the child at the forefront of their decision-making process.


Thirdly, they note that the commissioner must adopt a consultative approach and engage with the children he or she represents. One of the key objectives in creating this role is involving young people in decisions that will ultimately affect them.


Finally, they write that, through the creation of this role, national leadership must be taken 'to promote an inspiring vision for the wellbeing, status and role of children and young people.' I hope that this role will deliver on that particular principle.


There remains much to be done to improve health, education and general wellbeing outcomes for particular groups of young children and all young people in Australia. Obviously, no single solution will fix everything. This bill introducing the National Children's Commissioner is a very strong signal that we are prepared to provide strong advocacy, strong representation for children, providing them with a beacon of hope and opportunity for better outcomes and ultimately a better quality of life. I commend the bill to the House.

"Perrett, Graham, MP",ALP,2012-06-21,"



Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton) (10:39):  I thank the earlier speakers for their contributions to this very important debate on the Australian Human Rights Commission Amendment (National Children's Commissioner) Bill 2012. Obviously, establishing a National Children's Commissioner fulfils a long-term commitment by the Australian Labor Party to appoint a national advocate for children. I am proud to be on this side of the House and supporting the bill.


I also make special mention of the work done by other ministers. I thank Minister Garrett for making a contribution in his role as education minister; Minister Ellis for ensuring that money goes into early childhood education; the health minister and particularly Minister Macklin for developing the child protection framework, which is important when you have states and territories that have different approaches to the reporting of child protection issues. In some states it is mandatory for everybody. In some states teachers have to report and in other states teachers do not have to. Medical practitioners have to report in every state and territory. But the reality is that we are a federation and, whilst that means good policy and good practice can develop, it does not necessarily mean that best practice and best policy spreads throughout the land. I guess that is why we are here as a Commonwealth to ensure that there are best possible standards for children. That is what this legislation before us today does.


I particularly acknowledge a Queenslander, Leneen Forde, who is actually on the board at Griffith University but who in an earlier role led a royal commission that looked at child protection and some of the horrific practices and injustices that had occurred in Queensland. I make mention of Leneen Forde and the great work that she did many years ago. 


I am sad to say that my wife, who has been working in child protection for 22 years, has seen some of these investigations and some of those changes. Whilst she always respects confidentiality—except for one case I might mention—she often tells me of the lifelong scars suffered by those who have experienced physical and emotional abuse in the family home and outside. Obviously, DOCS investigates abuse from within the family, then the police step in to investigate those matters outside the home. Sadly, the police do not have as much work as DOCS. The reality is that we tend to be harmed by those who profess to love us, or who should love us, or their children.


I will mention one case that is public and I can only mention this because it is written about in Terri Irwin's book about Steve Irwin. Steve Irwin, as members would remember, sadly passed away, but he was investigated for putting one of his children in a crocodile enclosure. My wife had the job of talking to Mr Irwin on a Friday night. This is all public—obviously, there are confidentiality issues—and it is quite interesting. She would not let me be in the room to hear the conversation, but she did say he even said 'crikey' in the phone call. Obviously, there was a child protection investigation, but nothing like the more serious ones that occur. Obviously, having a six-week old child near crocodiles does not happen too often. That autobiography by Steve Irwin's wife is interesting. I think the Governor-General's secretary phoned Steve to complain about it. It is an interesting representation of the facts surrounding the Governor-General's secretary, and the words which are attributed to my wife are nothing like what was actually said. But, anyway, I drift. I am supposed to be talking about the National Children's Commissioner Bill.


Unfortunately, there are many young children right across Australia from a broad range of backgrounds who are at high risk of abuse, discrimination and subject to poor circumstances. The introduction of a National Children's Commissioner is designed to speak on behalf of those children who do not have a voice and who are suffering alone and in social exclusion. The new commissioner will have discretion when performing any of his or her functions to focus on particular groups of children who are at risk or vulnerable, such as children with disability, those who are homeless or witnessing or subject to violence, and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children. In recognition of the particular disadvantage many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children face, the National Children's Commissioner proposal includes funding specifically for the commissioner and staff to travel to regional and remote Australia to consult directly with children and young people and to deliver education and public awareness sessions in those locations. 


The Gillard Labor government is committed to closing the gap of Indigenous disadvantage and this is another way of gradually achieving this aim. This Labor government is already increasing access to early childhood education for Indigenous four-year-olds in remote communities and we are confident that we are on track to halve the infant mortality rates of Indigenous children under five by 2018. Anyone who has young children knows how these dry statistics take on a completely different meaning when you think about your own children. As a father of two—one is only three years old—I cannot imagine what it would be like to have the sorts of statistics, in our own lounge rooms, in our own suburban areas, that are being experienced in some of the more regional and remote Indigenous communities around Australia.


The commissioner will also have discretion to consult with whoever is considered appropriate, with a focus on children, organisations that represent children, state and territory children's commissioners and guardians. So it will be a cooperative, collaborative network. The key objectives of establishing a national children's commissioner are to improve advocacy at a national level for the rights, wellbeing and development of children and young people up to the age of 18 years; and to improve the monitoring of Commonwealth laws affecting the rights, wellbeing and development of children and young people. As I said, Minister Macklin has already gone some way in terms of establishing the child protection framework. The previous Attorney-General, who is in the chamber, has done some great work in terms of changing the Family Law Act to make sure that we put children first. I commend the member for Barton for his great work. I commend the current Attorney-General as well for making sure children come first and foremost when it comes to family law decisions, because that is where so much horrible work occurs.


I also encourage the active involvement of children and young people in decisions that affect them. We see emerging child protection issues—things such as cybersafety, where you cannot go home to a safe place anymore. Schools have always been jungles, in a way—the blackboard jungle is a reality for some people—but at least children used to be able to go home to a safe haven. Now, sometimes, with Facebook, the internet and phones, people can be hassled, bullied and even driven to horrible deeds because of bullying that occurs through the internet. 


There are supports for government agencies to develop mechanisms which enhance the active involvement of children and young people. We also assist Australia in meeting its international obligations by promoting and advancing the rights of the child, in particular as enshrined in the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.


As a Queenslander I flag an ongoing issue I have. Children in Queensland are treated as adults. The reality is that whilst Australia has signed up to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, in Queensland we treat 17-year-olds as adults. It is not exactly the sort of topic that you campaign on but it is something that I flag. I have an ongoing interest in it and hopefully my Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, subject to the approval of the deputy chair and the rest of the committee, will look at this topic of Queensland's treatment of children as adults.


The commission is to act as an overarching authority; it is not to deal specifically with individual children's cases. Obviously, that is for the states and territories. The Commonwealth will, however, have a limited role to seek leave to intervene in court proceedings which raise significant children's rights issues. But this will not extend to representing individual children. This bill sends a clear message to the Australian public that child abuse will not be tolerated and that there is help out there for the people who need it the most. Education and awareness is one of the best preventative measures, and that is why we are introducing a new Children's Commissioner to actively campaign and advocate for the rights of the child. Whilst this is obviously not a silver bullet, it is a small step towards stopping more child abuse. It should be supported by all of the members opposite.


I welcome the bill and hope it will have a positive impact on family relationships and children's health, development and wellbeing. I look forward to seeing the appointment of the first Children's Commissioner. I thank, again, Minister Macklin and all of those who have done great work in child protection—Chancellor Leneen Forde from the Griffith University in particular. I commend the bill to the House.

"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2012-06-21,"



Mrs MOYLAN
 (Pearce) (10:50):  Australia has a long history of advocating for and protecting the human rights of its citizens. A central tenet of that protection is the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission, which was established in 1986. Since then, the Australian Human Rights Commission, as it is called now, has continually expanded, creating specific commissioners for each piece of federal legislation enacted to protect citizen rights—such as the Age Discrimination Commissioner in response to Age Discrimination Act in 2004, and the Racial Discrimination Commissioner after the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. Six separate commissioners now exist and all sit within the Australian Human Rights Commission. Since the commencement of the Convention of the Rights of the Child in 1991, which Australia is a party to, there have been calls for the creation of a national children's commissioner to ensure compliance with the convention. Many inquiries have investigated the potential role and responsibilities of such a commissioner but the discussion stands apart as there is no single legislative instrument at the federal level encapsulating the protections which should be afforded to children. 


Because of this anomaly there is debate about whether such a commissioner duplicates the functions of current state and territory children's commissioners and even whether a commissioner can play a meaningful role. This is compounded by the fact that most services and legislation affecting children actually fall under the jurisdiction of the states and territories. The lack of a comprehensive legislative framework to guide the work a national children's commissioner calls into question its potential effectiveness. In Senate estimates on 23 May this year the Hon. Catherine Branson QC, the Human Rights Commissioner, confirmed that unlike all the other commissioners—that is, the Age Discrimination Commissioner, the Race Discrimination Commissioner and all the others—a national children's commissioner will not undertake any casework, specifically due to the lack of overarching children's legislation. 


This may also explain the relatively low amount of funding which is currently allotted for the commissioner. This funding will pay for the commissioner, a personal assistant and two research assistants at the most. The lack of funding is a dilemma in itself. Ms Branson confirmed that with the creation of a new commissioner, casework always increases. But there is not a substantial commitment to fund the children's commissioner, particularly due to its restricted functions. I put it to this House that it will simply not be effective in doing what it is intended to do.


This morning the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs tabled a report in this House. Unfortunately, we did not get an opportunity to speak to that. I would like to address a few comments specifically regarding that report because, like many of the bills referred to this place, the scrutiny of this bill was done in indecent haste without sufficient time to really prosecute the issues. The coalition has tabled a dissenting report, and I would like to explain the reasons this has happened. 


The coalition members do not agree with the committee that the Australian Human Rights Commission Act 1986 should be amended to establish a statutory office of the National Children's Commissioner in the Australian Human Rights Commission. Coalition members of the committee recognise the importance of promoting public discussion and awareness of issues affecting children. We also acknowledge that legislation, policies and programs affecting the rights, wellbeing and development of children should be properly examined. However, we are not persuaded by the committee that this bill would necessarily advance these objectives any further than is currently being achieved.


Coalition members are of the view that the AHRC, the Australian Human Rights Commission, in cooperation with the relevant state and territory commissioners and guardians, already adequately performs the functions envisaged for the new commissioner. The establishment of a new commissioner at a federal level would unnecessarily duplicate the policy and advocacy functions of the respective state and territory authorities as well as the advisory functions provided for in the Australian Human Rights Commission Act. Additionally, given the new commissioner will only function as an advocate and not undertake any casework, coalition members are not persuaded its establishment would support the work currently performed by the state and territory commissioners. Rather, the bill would merely contribute to the expansion of Australia's already burgeoning bureaucracy.


Coalition members cannot agree with the commission that there is urgency surrounding the establishment of a national children's commissioner. There is no evidence to suggest that there has been an increase in the workload of the AHRC or that of the respective state and territory commissioners to justify the establishment of a new commissioner at federal level. Coalition members are not persuaded that there are any compelling reasons to further expand the number of AHRC commissioners, nor significant justification to create a stand-alone advocacy function for children's rights in Australia at the Commonwealth level. Therefore, sadly, the coalition does not support the bill.


It is fundamental that the most vulnerable people in our society receive care and protection, and none are more vulnerable than children. But tokenistic gestures do not equate to real protection on the ground. If the government were truly sincere about protecting the rights of children we would not see children continuing to be locked up in detention centres when they have committed no crime, and the government would not pursue policies that penalise single parents and force small children onto the street.


I take the first issue first because it is dear to my heart. In 2004 I, along with the former member for Kooyong, Petro Georgiou, Russell Broadbent, the member for McMillan, Bruce Baird, the former member for Cook and former senator, Judith Troeth, really struggled to convince the government that detention centres are not the places for people who have not committed any crime. In most cases—and nothing has changed—these are not detention centres but maximum-security prisons where we put murderers, rapists, armed robbers and people who are real criminals. These children have committed no crime. We fought tooth and nail to bring about changes and in 2005 the Howard government announced that it would only be under the most dire circumstances that children would remain in detention centres. A time limit was put on processing them and giving these families with children TPVs.


It greatly disturbs me that we have nearly 500 children—I think that is the number—who remain in detention centres in this country. If we are truly concerned about the plight of children then surely one of the first things we have to do is go back to the spirit of the agreement we made with the Howard government and make sure that we no longer keep children in detention centres in this country. It simply is not right. If the general public of Australia had seen what I saw when I visited some of the centres they would be shocked and would in no way sanction this policy. I continue to be concerned about these very basic and fundamental issues that could be addressed. So why are we pretending here that a children's commissioner is going to resolve some of the most fundamental problems that are before us today?


To go to the second issue, and I do not think I am out of order to speak on this now, social security legislation for what was formerly called Welfare to Work is scheduled to come into this House today and I will speak in greater detail on it then. But the issue here is that we have a bill coming before us which seeks to move single parents off the parent payment when their child turns eight and onto the Newstart allowance. This affects the most vulnerable people in our community, the most vulnerable families who are living below the poverty line. There are 100,000 single parents in this country and 90 per cent of them are women. They are not there because they want to be there. They are not there because they deliberately get pregnant and have children to get onto social security benefits, as many would want us to believe. They are there, very often, because they are escaping domestic violence. They are there because there is no-fault divorce. And sometimes they are there because their partner passes away. This group of people will, under the legislation to come before us later, lose a minimum of $60 a week from their entitlement by moving to Newstart.


What really upsets me is that this legislation says that it is to get people into work. If that is the case, why has the government taken $50 million a year out of job agency payments? These job agencies are already struggling to meet the needs of the long-term unemployed, and we are going to foist on them 100,000 people, or whatever the demographic might be that move over to Newstart allowance, who will be going to them to get help to go to work. These agencies are severely underfunded as it is and they are going to lose $50 million a year. It is just not right. If we truly wanted to move people from welfare into work then we would not be taking measures like that which provide them with very little support.


I listened to the radio this morning and heard about the many members of this parliament who will sleep rough on the streets tonight. I commend them for that. But I remind the House that if we were really serious about the human rights of children we would attend to their most basic and fundamental rights, which are to have a roof over their heads, to have food, to have clothing, to be able to go to school, to be able to have medical assistance and to be able to gain an education. The fact is that on the streets tonight more than 16 per cent of Australia's 105,000 homeless will be families—these are parents with children.


Mr O'Connor, the Minister for Homelessness, is a good minister for whom I have a lot of regard. I heard him say on the radio this morning that the number of women and children among the homeless on our streets are growing in number, yet we are going to drive them further into poverty by taking $60 a week off them by shifting them onto Newstart allowance. So I just wonder what we are doing in this place by standing up and trying to defend a piece of legislation to establish a children's commissioner. We are going to pay for another bureaucrat. I am not taking shots at bureaucrats; some are very good, they do a fine job and I have a lot of respect and a high regard for them. But we are going to pay for another bureaucrat while on our streets we are seeing those fundamental needs unmet. We are living in a wealthy country. Every person should think about this. I have heard a couple of members talk about the abuse and neglect of children. Fiona Stanley, a highly respected medical practitioner and worker in this field, wrote a very fine book a couple of years ago in which she pointed out that poverty is a big reason we are seeing increasing abuse and neglect of children. So I just shake my head at this legislation. It is not that I and the coalition do not want to see greater protection of children. We would like to see greater protection, but we need to address the fundamentals. (Time expired)

"Smyth, Laura, MP",ALP,2012-06-21,"



Ms SMYTH
 (La Trobe) (11:05):  I think it is fitting that, at the conclusion of the last contribution to this debate, I set the record somewhat straight on the question of housing and this government's commitment to social housing. It was clearly the last speaker's contention that we should be focusing on developments in housing that would assist families and people living rough to find a home or adequate housing. It is somewhat ironic that we are having this discussion when, as part of the stimulus package that this government—and this government alone—committed to, we have a commitment in my home state of Victoria for more than 4,500 social housing units, the vast majority of which have, in fact, been constructed. I visited one in recent weeks and saw the practical benefits that this government has delivered to people, to families and to children who were living in unacceptable circumstances. This was one of the first acts taken by this government, so I will not countenance any comments being put on the record in this place about the commitment of this government to ensuring that people have adequate housing in this country going unchallenged. Clearly, there is much more to do, but it is this government that, after more than a decade of neglect and disregard by the Howard government, made housing and social housing a national priority and backed it with funding. Those opposite simply cannot claim to have the same kind of record on these issues at all. That is the first point. The second point is that, as a member of the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, I was pleased this morning to be able to be part of the review of the report which has now been tabled in the House in relation to and in support of the National Children's Commissioner. I certainly do not see this as a token measure. I see this as an important measure which ensures advocacy for children in this country and it is something which is long overdue. It has been called for for a considerable time. I know that many advocates from a progressive policy view, and certainly many Labor people, have advocated for a National Children's Commissioner for some time.


Indeed, in 2009 we delivered the first-ever national framework for protecting Australia's children, and all of the policy measures that we have put in place—from education to mental health care for children and young people to early intervention to ensure that children are protected through early learning, through health measures that we have put in place and through education—go to our core beliefs that children should have a good start in life and be supported in their infancy to ensure that they have an opportunity to succeed in life. So it is consistent with those objectives and those policy measures that we today see debate on the National Children's Commissioner.


In 2009 and 2010 the Department of Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs conducted considerable public discussion on a national children's commissioner. The debate and discussion about this issue have been going on for some years in a formal sense and, prior to that, informally. Due to the variety of stakeholder views on the issue, the government conducted further targeted consultations about it. In December of last year the department produced a discussion paper on the question of a children's commissioner and, indeed, the matter is the subject of not only the House standing committee's deliberations on the matter but also the Senate committee's considerations about the establishment of a children's commissioner. And through those processes we have seen some 59 submissions to the Senate inquiry overwhelmingly supporting this bill and the concept of a national children's commissioner. Because we see that around Australia there is a piecemeal approach, it has to be said, to protecting the safety and wellbeing of children, it is important that we have a national framework and a national advocate for children. This is by no means the tokenistic measure that the coalition has referred to in its dissenting report to the standing committee's report earlier today. It is not the tokenistic measure that was alluded to in the previous member's contribution in this place.


Indeed, we have had comments from the Australian Human Rights Commissioner and the commission itself in relation to the establishment of a national children's commissioner, particularly in relation to the question of interoperability with state and territory agencies, which was mentioned in the previous speaker's contribution. At the Senate hearings on this issue the commissioner noted the considerable planning and consultation processes that had taken place on the development of the proposal for a commissioner. She said: 'There has been quite long-term consideration of the relationship between a national children's commissioner and the guardians and children's commissioner at a state and territory level. The topic of the possibility of establishing a national children's commissioner has been under consideration for some time.' She went on to note that state and territory commissioners and guardian representatives had made a combined submission to the Attorney-General's Department supporting the establishment of a commissioner. It was her view that there would be an opportunity for enhancement of the work of those respective agencies and advocates and that that work would continue.


So there is a high level of interest in the establishment of a national children's commissioner. It presents an opportunity to provide advocacy for children and young people right across the spectrum of issues affecting them, from welfare and safety considerations to the ongoing and important issue of 'closing the gap' of Indigenous disadvantage and issues like infant mortality. I see the commissioner as having a significant role to play and I fully support the objectives of the bill before us today. As a consequence, I am very pleased to be able to commend the bill to the House.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2012-06-21,"



Ms PLIBERSEK
 (Sydney—Minister for Health) (11:12):  I will be summing up on behalf of the government. I thank honourable members for their contributions to the debate on the Australian Human Rights Commission Amendment (National Children’s Commissioner) Bill 2012, and I particularly thank the members for Pearce and La Trobe whose contributions I have been listening to very intently.


This bill will establish the National Children's Commissioner within the Australian Human Rights Commission. The member for Pearce was suggesting that we have a choice as governments between action and advocacy, and that a role like this, which is focused on advocacy, is necessarily in contradiction to, or intended instead of, action in the area of children's rights, which, of course, is not correct. This government has acted more than any other government in Australia's history to protect the rights and interests of our most vulnerable Australians—children—and that includes in areas like our Healthy Kids Check, and preschools where we are moving to universal preschool education for at least one year for Australian children. It also includes the types of investments that we have seen in policing and also in counselling in the Northern Territory and in other parts of Australia in communities where child abuse is at completely unacceptable levels.


Homelessness was mentioned as well, and we have built 21,000 public housing dwellings around Australia out of the global financial crisis stimulus package. There is the National Rental Affordability Scheme for 50,000 properties, with 10,000 built already and 10,000 to be built next year: 50,000 in total. There are dozens of new homelessness facilities right around Australia, including ones for families, and there has been significant investment in services that prevent homelessness because it is better to have families staying at home rather than losing their homes. 


The schoolkids bonus is the classic example in the most recent budget; a measure that supports families with children and makes life a little bit easier for those families—a measure opposed, extraordinarily, by those opposite. A Children's Commissioner is not in opposition to action in these areas but a complement to it. It is important for the voiceless to have a voice and that is what the Children's Commissioner provides for our children.


A National Children's Commissioner will be a strong and forceful voice for these children and young people and play a proactive and positive role in their wellbeing and development. Our children are our future and if we do not value them we can never hope to protect them. A National Children's Commissioner will put their needs front and centre, and that is why the government is so pleased that we will establish for the first time a dedicated advocate focused on the human rights of children and young people at a national level.


This bill's basic principle is that every child is a valued member of our society. A National Children's Commissioner will raise public awareness of nationally significant issues affecting children and young people through discussion, research and educational programs. The commissioner will examine relevant existing and proposed Commonwealth legislation to determine if it adequately recognises and protects children's rights in Australia and report their findings to the government. The commissioner will consult directly with children and their representative organisations to ensure that they can influence the development of policies and programs that affect them at Commonwealth level.


Importantly, the National Children's Commissioner will have a clear focus on vulnerable or at risk groups of children, such as children with disability, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children, homeless children, or those who are witnessing or subject to violence. The commissioner will also report to government each year on matters relating to the human rights of children. The position will contribute to meeting Australia's obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child and reinforce our commitment to our international obligations and relationship with the United Nations.


The commissioner will not duplicate the roles of state and territory children's commissioners but will seek to work closely and collaboratively with them to identify national or cross-jurisdictional matters that would benefit from national leadership. Members of the Australian Children's Commissioners and Guardians Group have already indicated their willingness to work collaboratively with the new commissioner and have reiterated their support for the position. The commissioner will not have a guardianship role nor will it have a complaint-handling role or a role in dealing with individual children, including individual children's cases in the context of child protection or family law. However, the commissioner will have a limited role to seek leave to intervene in court proceedings which raise significant children's rights issues—but that will not extend to representing individual children.


I would like to now address some of the issues that have been raised in the debate. The member for Stirling raised the speed with which this has come forward. This has not been a speedy process for the Labor Party. We have been advocating for such a position since 2003. We have conducted consultation with state and territory commissioners and non-government organisations from a range of fields, including a child protection and service delivery, over the last two years. This Labor government wants to see a National Children's Commissioner up and running as soon as possible for the benefit of Australia's children, to give them an independent voice on the national stage. 


Funding was allocated in the 2012-13 budget and is available from 1 July 2012. I do not really see why for legislation such as this the opposition seems determined to tie up and delay such important reforms. Some members opposite also raised duplication with state and territory children's commissioners, but there is no duplication of function here. This will be a uniquely national cross-jurisdictional advocacy role.


The member for Fremantle has been a very strong advocate for this position and for children's rights across the board for a very long time. The Attorney-General particularly wanted to thank her for her support and assistance in developing this policy and the role of the commissioner. The member for Canberra highlighted some important functions the commissioner will undertake and the benefits that will flow from the commissioner's advocacy.


The Attorney-General particularly wanted to thank all honourable members for putting their considered views on this important piece of legislation. The Attorney-General thanks the House committee for its report, which recognises the urgency in establishing the position and the need to avoid unnecessary delay. The Attorney-General acknowledges the committee recommended funding be reviewed. The government is confident that funding will be sufficient to meet all its functions, but of course the government will closely monitor it through implementation.


The government looks forward to the passage of this bill to ensure a National Children's Commissioner can be established as soon as possible for the benefit of Australia's children and young people. The creation of the National Children's Commissioner is an important initiative in the government's work to protect our children and young people and promote and protect their human rights. I commend the bill to the House.


Bill read a second time.

"Irons, Steve, MP",LP,2012-06-21,"



Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (13:04):  I am pleased to rise to support the Social Security Amendment (Supporting Australian Victims of Terrorism Overseas) Bill 2011. Australians love to travel. It is part of our national psyche to pack the backpack, the suitcase and the travellers cheques and head for foreign shores. This travel can take our citizens to places that are exciting and very different from Australia's way of life and culture and where they can engage with the locals. Our expenditure overseas on these visits can be vital to the economy, in particular, of some of our closest neighbours.


Australians enjoy a standard of living and way of life that is envied by many and, unfortunately, hated by some. That hatred of Australians and Westerners has contributed to the terrorist attacks overseas in recent years which have left many Australians dead or injured. We as Australians, and particularly as Western Australians, shared the tragedy that was the Bali bombings with the people of Indonesia and the rest of the world. With the deaths of 88 Australians and the dreadful injuries to many others, the dark shadow of terrorism finally came to meet Australians face-to-face in the home of one of our nearest neighbours. In Bali, the holiday playground for many Australians, the peaceful, idyllic destination's ambience was shattered forever with that terrorist act. It brought home to all Australians how cowardly terrorists are given the use of senseless and brutal acts, as well as fear, violence and death, as their tools to achieve their religious and fanatical beliefs.


It is as a result of acts of terrorism like the Bali bombings, the Jakarta bombings, the London bombings and 9/11 that the Social Security Amendment (Supporting Australian Victims of Terrorism Overseas) Bill 2011 has become essential legislation. The government bill seeks to provide, for the Australian victims of overseas terrorist acts, compensation payments akin to those received by domestic victims of crime under the state and territory victims of crime schemes. It is a modest and important measure to fill a gap in the support that Australia gives to its citizens who have suffered through no fault of their own.


The bill will (a) enable Australians who are victims of a declared overseas terrorist incident to claim financial support of up to $75,000; (b) enable the Prime Minister to declare that a relevant overseas terrorist incident is one to which the scheme applies; (c) establish eligibility criteria so that payments can be made either to long-term Australian residents who are victims of a relevant overseas terrorist act or, in the event of the death of a victim, close family members; (d)    ensure that victims are not required to repay or deduct Medicare or other benefits from any payment received under the scheme; and (e) enable the enactment of legislative instruments to provide further guidance on the amount of assistance that each victim, or close family member, should receive. The bill proposes two categories of eligible individuals: primary victims and secondary victims. A primary victim will be a person who is harmed as a result of a declared overseas terrorist act; a secondary victim will be a close family member of a person who dies as a result of a declared overseas terrorist act. Payments will be capped at $75,000 for both primary and secondary victims. However, a person who is injured in a declared overseas terrorist act and whose close family member also dies in the same declared overseas terrorist act may claim as both a primary and secondary victim and may receive payments of up to $75,000 in relation to each claim. The payment for secondary victims may be apportioned between eligible close family members. 


I think it is vital that Australians should be aware of the detail in this bill and there are two areas that should be raised. They are, first, section 35B—Declared overseas terrorist act. Subsection (1) provides that the Prime Minister may declare in writing that a terrorist act that occurs outside Australia is a declared overseas terrorist act. This is effected by legislative instrument. Not every terrorist act that occurs overseas will result in a declaration activating the Australian Victim of Terrorism Overseas Payment scheme. The act must be declared in writing by the Prime Minister as a 'declared overseas terrorist act'. That declaration will then be lodged as a legislative instrument. This measure will ensure that remote events are not drawn into the scheme. 


Subsection (2) states that if the Prime Minister makes a declaration under subsection (1) then the minister is taken to have made a determination under subsection 36(1) that the terrorist act is a major disaster. The purpose of this subsection is to deem the major disaster declaration to have been made, avoiding the requirement for the minister to also make a declaration. Item 10 at the end of subsection 36(1) provides for a note to be added at the end of subsection 36(1). The note states that if the Prime Minister makes a declaration under section 35B that a terrorist act is a declared overseas terrorist act, the minister is taken to have made a determination under subsection (1) of this section that the terrorist act is a major disaster. So in simple terms, if you are injured in a terrorist attack you will only qualify for payment if the Prime Minister declares the act is an overseas terrorist act. 


Another area I wish to raise is section 1061PAF, AVTOP principles. Section 1061PAF provides for the principles that will assist in determining the amount of Australian Victim of Terrorism Overseas Payment payable in any particular circumstance to any particular claimant. Paragraph 2(a) states:


For a primary victim, these factors include: 


i. the nature of the injury or disease suffered as a direct result of the terrorist act, 


ii. the duration of the injury or disease, 


iii. the impact of the injury or disease on the person's bodily and mental functions, 


iv. the impact of the injury or disease on the person's life, 


v. the likelihood  of the person suffering future loss, injury or disease as a direct result of the terrorist act, 


vi. the circumstances in which the injury or disease was incurred, and 


vii. whether the person was directed by an official of Australia or a foreign country not to go to the place where the terrorist act occurred. 


In relation to subparagraphs 2(a)(i) to (a)(iv), the nature of the injuries, whether they were a direct result of the terrorist act, their duration and impact are factors that can be taken into account in the assessment process. In relation to subparagraph 2(a)(v), the likelihood of future loss is an important consideration to be taken into account when making an assessment. As a primary victim may only submit one claim, it is important that this claim reflects the true loss or harm from the terrorist act. Victims may wish to lodge a claim quite quickly following the terrorist act due to financial pressures. However, if the victim's injuries have not yet stabilised or there is delayed psychological injury, the assessed quantum may not fully realise the extent of future loss. The intention of this provision is to allow for future loss when making the determination. The victim should obtain medical advice in order to provide a correct prognosis of future loss. This would cover a situation, for example, where a person receives injuries to his back and breaks his leg as a result of a terrorist attack. An assessment based on the cost of his present medical expenses and injuries is $30,000. However, if the person develops severe arthritis 12 months later which is ongoing, the person is no longer able to work and is in continual pain, it would not be possible for the person to submit a further claim because it would create unnecessary ongoing administrative expenses. There needs to be an incentive to delay claims until all injuries are apparent. Accordingly, it is appropriate that possible future injuries be taken into consideration when determining quantum. It beggars belief that someone who has been a victim is going to know what, if any, or how severe any future medical conditions may be. I trust this is an issue that will be dealt with to ensure this amending legislation will provide the best possible assistance to any victims. 


There also were concerns raised by officers of the Attorney-General's Department that should there be a major terrorist incident the scheme could be in danger of a budget blow-out. The safety net for this scheme is that it should only apply to people who are Australian domiciled as well as Australian citizens. In that way Australian citizens who are not living here in Australia at the time of the terrorist incident would not be covered. Over the past decade, since 11 September 2001, over 300 Australians have been killed or injured in acts of terrorism overseas. However, acts of terrorism are unexpected and unpredictable. As a result, it is likely that the cost of this scheme will vary over time. It is likely there will be no payments made some years but a significant number of payments made in other years.


I know this is a bill which the opposition leader, Mr Abbott, along with the rest of the coalition, supports. At the time of introduction the Leader of the Opposition issued a press release saying:


I congratulate the government on taking this sensible measure. I thank the Independent MPs who had indicated to the government that they would have backed my private member's bill ... The government bill, as my bill did, seeks to provide for the Australian victims of overseas terrorist acts compensation payments analogous to those received by domestic victims of crime under the state and territory victims of crime schemes. An issue which the government has yet to resolve is whether the bill will have retrospective operation. 


I do believe there is an amendment to be moved by the shadow minister, the member for Stirling, who I also know has a close affiliation with victims of the Bali bombings, many of whom came from his electorate. Obviously it would be deeply disappointing if victims of the two Bali bombings, the two Jakarta bombings, the London bombing and September 11 were not able to access the compensation that will shortly be available. The Social Security Amendment (Supporting Australian Victims of Terrorism Overseas) Bill 2011 before parliament is not necessarily retrospective. It could therefore leave victims of those Bali bombings and other past terrorist attacks, as flagged in the March 2011 press release, without any financial support. I have spoken on the Bali bombings in this place on quite a few occasions and have attended the remembrance service in Perth, in Kings Park, with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and member for Curtin and the WA Premier, Colin Barnett, during the past few years. I have met victims of the Bali bombings and their families, and if anyone ever qualified for support from this government they certainly do. The Leader of the Opposition and member for Paterson have consistently said in the past that the Australians who were killed or severely injured in the second Bali bombing were the inspiration for the original bill. To keep faith with them, the coalition will move amendments, as I have previously mentioned, to ensure that they also have access to compensation.


I will now make some further comments about the Bali bombings which I have shared with the members of this place previously. The bombings took the lives of 202 people in the district of Kuta in 2002. As Australians and as Western Australians we shared this tragedy with the people of Indonesia and the rest of the world. With the deaths of 88 Australians and the injuries to many others, the dark shadow of terrorism finally came to meet Australians face to face in the home of one of our nearest neighbours. It brought home to all Australians how cowardly terrorists are. This was a tragedy for the peace-loving Balinese, who welcome all Australians and many other world visitors to their beautiful island. They shared the pain and tragedy suffered by many Australians and others from around the world who lost loved ones. Out of this tragedy, we have strengthened the relationship between Australia and Indonesia, and we are closer now in 2012 than ever before. We have found new strength not only between our governments but also between our peoples and our cultures.


Australia has been a friend and ally of Indonesia, our closest neighbour. At the closest point between the two countries there is less distance between Australia and Indonesia than there is between Sydney and Canberra. By being so close we have been able to share in great opportunities for relationships to grow on so many levels. The close proximity of our two countries has also meant that the security and prosperity of Australia is intimately linked with the security and prosperity of Indonesia, and we as a nation are committed to growth and stability for their nation and the region. We stood by Indonesia as they fought for their independence in 1948. Now, in 2012, we must also stand by the victims of the bombings who inspired this bill. I commend the bill to the House.

Ms ROXON
 (Gellibrand—Attorney-General and Minister for Emergency Management) (13:17):  I would like to thank all the members who have spoken on this bill. It is an area where people on both sides of the House have very strong feelings, for reasons that are extremely justifiable. I want to thank everyone for their contributions and the spirit in which they were given, in particular those members who have people in their electorates who were unfortunate victims or family members of victims of past incidents. I know that for all concerned it is a very delicate subject and one where people are committed to being able to provide appropriate support. No-one in this House disagrees with the fact that terrorism is a terrible crime, that it has a dramatic and long-lasting impact on the lives of victims.


This Social Security Amendment (Supporting Australian Victims of Terrorism Overseas) Bill 2011 will enable Australians who are victims of declared overseas terrorism acts to claim financial support of up to $75,000. The bill establishes a framework for the provision of this assistance. As the bill was introduced some time ago, it will not surprise the House as we flag that the government will be moving some amendments that have already been identified. I will go through those amendments in more detail when they are moved in the consideration in detail stage.


But I would like to address one of the major themes that has been raised throughout this debate, particularly from those opposite, and that is the question of whether or not retrospectivity should apply to this scheme. I understand that that will be the subject of an amendment to be moved by the opposition when we get to the consideration in detail stage. As I said, I respect the speakers who have spoken about this and their genuine commitment. However, I think we do need to look at some of the facts in the history surrounding these particular instances but also the consideration of whether or not retrospectivity should apply. Speakers mentioned in particular the September 11 attacks and the Bali bombings.


In relation to the September 11 attacks and the Bali bombings, the previous government made decisions about support and assistance for victims at the time. In fact, in August 2003, after the Bali bombing, then Prime Minister John Howard ruled out compensation and a compensation scheme for victims of terrorism. Further, in May 2006, the then Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Chris Ellison, ruled out a compensation support scheme for victims of the second Bali bombing. Of course, support was provided to past victims, and that drew on a number of existing measures, including the Disaster Health Care Assistance Scheme, ex gratia assistance, consular and repatriation assistance and immediate short-term financial assistance through the AGDRP. Since Bali 2002 the Australian government has expended more than $12 million on assistance and support for Australians killed or injured as a direct result of overseas terrorist acts. In addition, the September 11 Victim Compensation Fund provided generous financial assistance to those injured and the next of kin of those who were killed in the 9-11 attacks, including Australians.


So I am concerned that those opposite are raising an issue that they did not act upon when they were in government; that this has been pursued well after the opportunity to be able to consider these matters; and that it was ruled out explicitly by the Prime Minister of the day, and ruled out again by the Justice and Customs Minister, a senator from the shadow minister's own state. Here, our government has taken the step to establish a scheme, once and for all, for future events. That is now being politicised to try to make some sort of point about a history which is actually the previous government's history rather than our own. Payments have been made of between $250,000 and up to $7.1 million to the next of kin of those persons who were killed in the 9-11 attacks, including Australians. Accordingly, the government does not propose to extend the scheme to cover individuals who have already been supported. 


Our government is very committed to making the changes in this bill. We have welcomed the opposition's support. There has been agreement, in what is a difficult area, about how prospective payments should be capped. I think this is a scheme that will stand Australia in good stead. I am sure that every member of this House hopes that this scheme will never be used. That will mean that we never have Australians in parts of the world where they may be a victim of terrorism. But I fear that despite that ardent wish, we do not live in a world where that is likely to be possible in the future and therefore it is appropriate for us to put in place a scheme which allows for clear support and which sets out the rules and methods for that to be made available to people quickly. I will speak in a little more detail about the amendments that the government is moving when we move to the consideration in detail, and of course I acknowledge that the member for Stirling is also going to move his amendments after that.

Ms ROXON
 (Gellibrand—Attorney-General and Minister for Emergency Management) (13:23):  by leave—I present a supplementary explanatory memorandum to the bill and move government amendments (1) to (11) as circulated together:


(1) Schedule 1, item 11, page 10 (after line 12), at the end of section 1061PAF, add:


   (3) The AVTOP Principles may specify circumstances in which the amount of an AVTOP is nil.


(2) Schedule 1, item 11, page 10 (before line 13), before section 1061PAG, insert:


Division 4—Other


(3) Schedule 1, item 11, page 10 (after line 27), at the end of Part 2.24AA, add:




1061PAH  AVTOP is not compensation or damages



      For the purposes of any law of the Commonwealth, a payment of AVTOP is not to be treated as being a payment of compensation or damages.


(4) Schedule 1, page 13 (line 2), omit the heading.


(5) Schedule 1, item 15, page 13 (lines 3 to 6), omit the item.


(6) Schedule 1, page 13 (line 7), omit the heading.


(7) Schedule 1, item 16, page 13 (lines 8 to 12), omit the item.


(8) Schedule 1, page 13 (line 21), omit the heading.


(9) Schedule 1, item 19, page 13 (line 22) to page 14 (line 6), omit the item.


(10) Schedule 1, page 15 (after line 2), after item 25, insert:




25A  At the end of section 39



Add:


   (6) The Secretary may determine that a specified period, being a period that is longer than 13 weeks, applies for the purposes of claims for an AVTOP in relation to a declared overseas terrorist act.


   (7) If, under subsection (6), there is a determination of a period in force for the purposes of claims for an AVTOP in relation to a declared overseas terrorist act, then this Act applies to those claims as if references in subsections (1) and (3) to the period of 13 weeks were references to the period referred to in the determination.


   (8) Adetermination under subsection (6) is not a legislative instrument.


(11) Schedule 1, item 26, page 15 (lines 6 and 7), omit subsection 46B(1), substitute:


   (1) Unless the Secretary makes a determination under subsection (2), a person's AVTOP is to be paid:


      (a) in accordance with section 47; and


      (b) on the date that is determined by the Secretary to be the earliest date on which it is reasonably practicable for the payment to be made to the person.


The House would be aware that these amendments have been available for some time and throughout the period of the debate. These amendments have been identified from the lengthy period when this bill was originally introduced to the debating time and each of these amendments is consistent with the original intent of the bill. 


The amendments do a number of things, and I will just quickly take the House through them. They clarify that a payment under the proposed scheme can be between zero and $75,000. This will ensure that funds can be distributed in a fair and equitable manner where there is more than one claimant. For example, where a victim has left behind a widow, a dependent child and a brother, it might be appropriate for the widow and dependent child to receive the full $75,000 and, while the brother might also be eligible, it may be appropriate that he receive a lesser payment.


The amendments will also ensure a payment under the scheme does not adversely affect a person's entitlement to other forms of damages or compensation—those are amendments (2), (3), (6), (7), (8) and (9)—nor any family assistance benefit, amendments (4) and (5). It will allow the period for assessing claims to be extended to ensure that there is sufficient time to assess claims particularly if there is a large number of victims—amendments (10) and (11). 


As you would be aware, on 22 March this year the Senate jointly referred the provisions of this bill and a private senator's bill to the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. It tabled its report. We support six of the seven recommendations and, to implement a number of those recommendations, those details are set out in the revised explanatory memorandum. Having tabled that revised explanatory memorandum, I think this will provide greater guidance about how the Prime Minister will determine whether a specific terrorist act should be covered by the scheme and it will also clarify that the bill enables the extension of the scheme to cover Commonwealth employees working overseas who do not meet the residency test.


Finally, it clarifies how payments under the scheme will interact with other payments. To implement recommendation 6, the government is exploring options for the establishment of a central contact point for Australians affected by terrorist acts. The government does not support recommendation 5, which would double the maximum payment for primary victims. As I have said, the proposed maximum of $75,000 is appropriate for a number of reasons including that it is consistent with the most generous victims of crime scheme, those in Western Australia and Queensland, and the private senator's bill, and it would seem anomalous to award more to overseas victims than to those who are victims in Australia. It will supplement existing measures of assistance and support including the disaster healthcare assistance, ex gratia assistance, consular and repatriation assistance and immediate short-term financial assistance through the AGDRP. It will not adversely affect the victim's entitlement to a range of other benefits including compensation, damages and Medicare.


I understand that the opposition have indicated that they support these amendments. We welcome that support and I commend the bill with these amendments to the House.

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2012-06-21,"



Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (13:27):  by leave—I move opposition amendments (1) and (2) together:


(1) Schedule 1, item 9, page 4 (after line 17), at the end of section 35B, add:


(3) The Prime Minister may, within 6 months after the commencement day, make a declaration under subsection (1) in relation to a terrorist act that occurred outside Australia between 10 September 2001 and the commencement day.


(4) In this section:



commencement day means the day on which Schedule 1 of the Social Security Amendment (Supporting Australian Victims of Terrorism Overseas) Act 2011 commenced.


(2) Schedule 1, item 12, page 11 (lines 7 and 8), omit ""the day the close family member to whom the claim relates died"", substitute the following:


      the later of:


   (a) the day on which the declaration was made under section 35B of the Social Security Act 1991; and


   (b) the day the close family member to whom the claim relates died.


These amendments provide for this bill to do what the opposition leader has always intended it to do since he first raised this issue several years ago. They make sure that this bill will be applied retrospectively to Australians who have been victims of terrorism in the past. At present the bill does allow for that to occur. It would require the Prime Minister of the day to be committed to making that occur and, unfortunately, in the correspondence that the Leader of the Opposition has had with the Prime Minister and of course the comments of the Attorney-General, they have made it clear that they do not believe it is appropriate for these measures to apply retrospectively.


Obviously, we would hope that once this bill passes this place that it would never need to be called upon, and I join with the Attorney-General in hoping that that never happens. But in saying that, unfortunately, if history is to be our guide, the likelihood is that Australians may well be caught up, again, in terrorist incidents overseas. I do not understand the logic of the government's position in thinking that it is appropriate for future victims of terrorism to be appropriately compensated, but not past victims of terrorism, which of course was the original intent of the bill when it was raised by the Leader of the Opposition and also the member for Paterson, who joins me here at the table and who has been deeply committed to this measure. The logic of that just seems to be completely inconsistent to me. 


I appreciate what was said about the fact that in government the coalition parties had not instituted this measure. That is a reasonable point, although I think it is also fair to say that, over time, thinking on these matters can evolve. The thinking of the opposition has evolved on this. I note the Attorney-General smiling. We have gone out of our way not to politicise any of these issues at any stage during this process—




Mr Dreyfus:
  The amendments have been designed to do so.




Mr KEENAN:
  That is absolute nonsense. Only somebody who would ascribe the most base political motives to everything that people do in this chamber could ascribe those motives to the way the opposition has behaved in pursuing what we believe are very honourable objectives. We have never politicised these measures. We have done everything we can to work in a spirit of constructive cooperation with the government, and we are genuinely disappointed that the government has not seen fit to accept our point of view. I hope that when these amendments are divided upon the House will see fit to accept our point of view.


To compensate future victims is good and appropriate, and I congratulate the government on that, but it makes absolutely no sense without applying it to the Australians who have already been victims of terrorism because of the events of September 11, the events in Bali in 2002 and 2005, and further terrorist events in London in 2005, Mumbai in 2008 and Jakarta in 2009.


If this bill proceeds in its present form and the House does not see fit to accept our amendments, every member should be aware that all previous Australian victims of terrorism will not be eligible for compensation under this measure. That would be a shame, that would be a travesty and it completely defies the whole point about why we are debating this here today, because this bill has its genesis in the Leader of the Opposition and also the member for Paterson being concerned about and talking with and being heavily involved with victims of the 2005 bombing in Bali. The whole reason we are debating this here today is because the original intent was that those Australian victims of terrorism—some of the 300 Australians who have been killed in previous terrorist acts—get access to what we believe is appropriate compensation.


The 300 killed and the countless hundreds who were injured were killed and injured through absolutely no fault of their own. They were completely just in the wrong place at the wrong time. They were targeted because they were Australians and because they were Westerners by, quite frankly, very evil people who are attacking us because of who we are and because they hate what we stand for.


I would urge all members of the House to think very seriously about how they vote on these amendments. The government's position is inconsistent. There is absolutely no reason to apply this only to future victims of terrorism. I would sincerely ask every member of this House to think very carefully on their vote, because we believe it is completely appropriate to compensate all Australian victims of terrorism, regardless of when they fell victim to it.

Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson) (13:33):  This is a bill that is extremely important to me, important to the Leader of the Opposition and, most importantly, these amendments are important to the 300 that have already suffered at the hands of terrorists: people such as Colin and Fiona Zwolinski and Jennifer Williamson, locals in the Hunter who were killed in Bali, and to people that came home, like Paul and Penny Anicich, Tony and Maryanne Purkiss, Eric and Jenny Pilar, Aleta Lederwasch, Nicholas and Jennifer Scott, Kim and Vicki Griffiths, and Bruce Williamson, who lost his wife.


There is a time when the government must stand up and do the right thing. This government has had no restriction at all in spending money as displayed by previous evidence in this House—money that was spent on pink batts and wasted; money that has been overspent on BER projects. But this government, which always talks about having a social conscience, cannot do a single thing to help out these victims of terrorism. They are asking for no more than what the state would provide them if these acts had occurred in Australia. I am saying to this government and in particular to the members for Newcastle, Shortland and Charlton, who represent these people in the Hunter: have a heart and come and support these amendments. These amendments do what is fair and right in providing support to those victims of terrorism.


We have been arguing this for a number of years. This was going to be part of the national disability support scheme, according to the former Prime Minister. It is not a lot of money. Averaged out over the 10 years this would have been $2.25 million. The Attorney-General might be questioning that. It was actually here in question time that former Prime Minister Rudd, in trying to admonish me for raising this—




Ms Roxon:
  Former Prime Minister John Howard—




Mr BALDWIN:
  It was former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd, Attorney-General, who said in this House that it would be included in the National Disability Insurance Scheme, which is yet to come to true fruition. These amendments need to be supported because they are fair, right and justified. If the government cannot see that it needs to support our fellow Australians in this way then this is a truly mean and tricky government. You need to support fellow Australians. You have got billions of dollars to waste in other areas. What about supporting your fellow Australians? You are an absolute disgrace if you do not step up to the mark and support these amendments. Our fellow Australians deserve it and I call on all of those members on your side of the House that have had constituents affected by this to support their constituents instead of walking away. You have no problem in wanting to introduce retrospective taxation into this House; you should introduce retrospective payments for people who have been severely affected.

 (Gellibrand—Attorney-General and Minister for Emergency Management) (13:37):  I will speak very briefly, because I understand that it is in the interests of the House for us to vote on these amendments. As I have said, the government does not support these amendments. The reason the government does not support them is that retrospective legislation is not appropriate here. Those opposite have pretended that they do not want to politicise this; I do not think that has been evidenced in the debate, but I understand that people feel incredibly strongly about this issue.


I remind the House—all those who are about to vote on the amendments—that the previous government ruled out taking this action in 2003 and 2006, and made other payments to do this. Our government is now taking action to ensure that the people whom the member for Paterson and others talked about in such a heartfelt way will never again be in the position that they were in before—they depended on the goodwill of the government of the day, who did not take the action that we are now taking.


We support the introduction of this bill and are pleased that the opposition supports it, but we reject the politicised comments about retrospectivity and do not support the amendments moved by the member for Stirling.

Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (13:04):  I am pleased to rise to support the Social Security Amendment (Supporting Australian Victims of Terrorism Overseas) Bill 2011. Australians love to travel. It is part of our national psyche to pack the backpack, the suitcase and the travellers cheques and head for foreign shores. This travel can take our citizens to places that are exciting and very different from Australia's way of life and culture and where they can engage with the locals. Our expenditure overseas on these visits can be vital to the economy, in particular, of some of our closest neighbours.


Australians enjoy a standard of living and way of life that is envied by many and, unfortunately, hated by some. That hatred of Australians and Westerners has contributed to the terrorist attacks overseas in recent years which have left many Australians dead or injured. We as Australians, and particularly as Western Australians, shared the tragedy that was the Bali bombings with the people of Indonesia and the rest of the world. With the deaths of 88 Australians and the dreadful injuries to many others, the dark shadow of terrorism finally came to meet Australians face-to-face in the home of one of our nearest neighbours. In Bali, the holiday playground for many Australians, the peaceful, idyllic destination's ambience was shattered forever with that terrorist act. It brought home to all Australians how cowardly terrorists are given the use of senseless and brutal acts, as well as fear, violence and death, as their tools to achieve their religious and fanatical beliefs.


It is as a result of acts of terrorism like the Bali bombings, the Jakarta bombings, the London bombings and 9/11 that the Social Security Amendment (Supporting Australian Victims of Terrorism Overseas) Bill 2011 has become essential legislation. The government bill seeks to provide, for the Australian victims of overseas terrorist acts, compensation payments akin to those received by domestic victims of crime under the state and territory victims of crime schemes. It is a modest and important measure to fill a gap in the support that Australia gives to its citizens who have suffered through no fault of their own.


The bill will (a) enable Australians who are victims of a declared overseas terrorist incident to claim financial support of up to $75,000; (b) enable the Prime Minister to declare that a relevant overseas terrorist incident is one to which the scheme applies; (c) establish eligibility criteria so that payments can be made either to long-term Australian residents who are victims of a relevant overseas terrorist act or, in the event of the death of a victim, close family members; (d)    ensure that victims are not required to repay or deduct Medicare or other benefits from any payment received under the scheme; and (e) enable the enactment of legislative instruments to provide further guidance on the amount of assistance that each victim, or close family member, should receive. The bill proposes two categories of eligible individuals: primary victims and secondary victims. A primary victim will be a person who is harmed as a result of a declared overseas terrorist act; a secondary victim will be a close family member of a person who dies as a result of a declared overseas terrorist act. Payments will be capped at $75,000 for both primary and secondary victims. However, a person who is injured in a declared overseas terrorist act and whose close family member also dies in the same declared overseas terrorist act may claim as both a primary and secondary victim and may receive payments of up to $75,000 in relation to each claim. The payment for secondary victims may be apportioned between eligible close family members. 


I think it is vital that Australians should be aware of the detail in this bill and there are two areas that should be raised. They are, first, section 35B—Declared overseas terrorist act. Subsection (1) provides that the Prime Minister may declare in writing that a terrorist act that occurs outside Australia is a declared overseas terrorist act. This is effected by legislative instrument. Not every terrorist act that occurs overseas will result in a declaration activating the Australian Victim of Terrorism Overseas Payment scheme. The act must be declared in writing by the Prime Minister as a 'declared overseas terrorist act'. That declaration will then be lodged as a legislative instrument. This measure will ensure that remote events are not drawn into the scheme. 


Subsection (2) states that if the Prime Minister makes a declaration under subsection (1) then the minister is taken to have made a determination under subsection 36(1) that the terrorist act is a major disaster. The purpose of this subsection is to deem the major disaster declaration to have been made, avoiding the requirement for the minister to also make a declaration. Item 10 at the end of subsection 36(1) provides for a note to be added at the end of subsection 36(1). The note states that if the Prime Minister makes a declaration under section 35B that a terrorist act is a declared overseas terrorist act, the minister is taken to have made a determination under subsection (1) of this section that the terrorist act is a major disaster. So in simple terms, if you are injured in a terrorist attack you will only qualify for payment if the Prime Minister declares the act is an overseas terrorist act. 


Another area I wish to raise is section 1061PAF, AVTOP principles. Section 1061PAF provides for the principles that will assist in determining the amount of Australian Victim of Terrorism Overseas Payment payable in any particular circumstance to any particular claimant. Paragraph 2(a) states:


For a primary victim, these factors include: 


i. the nature of the injury or disease suffered as a direct result of the terrorist act, 


ii. the duration of the injury or disease, 


iii. the impact of the injury or disease on the person's bodily and mental functions, 


iv. the impact of the injury or disease on the person's life, 


v. the likelihood  of the person suffering future loss, injury or disease as a direct result of the terrorist act, 


vi. the circumstances in which the injury or disease was incurred, and 


vii. whether the person was directed by an official of Australia or a foreign country not to go to the place where the terrorist act occurred. 


In relation to subparagraphs 2(a)(i) to (a)(iv), the nature of the injuries, whether they were a direct result of the terrorist act, their duration and impact are factors that can be taken into account in the assessment process. In relation to subparagraph 2(a)(v), the likelihood of future loss is an important consideration to be taken into account when making an assessment. As a primary victim may only submit one claim, it is important that this claim reflects the true loss or harm from the terrorist act. Victims may wish to lodge a claim quite quickly following the terrorist act due to financial pressures. However, if the victim's injuries have not yet stabilised or there is delayed psychological injury, the assessed quantum may not fully realise the extent of future loss. The intention of this provision is to allow for future loss when making the determination. The victim should obtain medical advice in order to provide a correct prognosis of future loss. This would cover a situation, for example, where a person receives injuries to his back and breaks his leg as a result of a terrorist attack. An assessment based on the cost of his present medical expenses and injuries is $30,000. However, if the person develops severe arthritis 12 months later which is ongoing, the person is no longer able to work and is in continual pain, it would not be possible for the person to submit a further claim because it would create unnecessary ongoing administrative expenses. There needs to be an incentive to delay claims until all injuries are apparent. Accordingly, it is appropriate that possible future injuries be taken into consideration when determining quantum. It beggars belief that someone who has been a victim is going to know what, if any, or how severe any future medical conditions may be. I trust this is an issue that will be dealt with to ensure this amending legislation will provide the best possible assistance to any victims. 


There also were concerns raised by officers of the Attorney-General's Department that should there be a major terrorist incident the scheme could be in danger of a budget blow-out. The safety net for this scheme is that it should only apply to people who are Australian domiciled as well as Australian citizens. In that way Australian citizens who are not living here in Australia at the time of the terrorist incident would not be covered. Over the past decade, since 11 September 2001, over 300 Australians have been killed or injured in acts of terrorism overseas. However, acts of terrorism are unexpected and unpredictable. As a result, it is likely that the cost of this scheme will vary over time. It is likely there will be no payments made some years but a significant number of payments made in other years.


I know this is a bill which the opposition leader, Mr Abbott, along with the rest of the coalition, supports. At the time of introduction the Leader of the Opposition issued a press release saying:


I congratulate the government on taking this sensible measure. I thank the Independent MPs who had indicated to the government that they would have backed my private member's bill ... The government bill, as my bill did, seeks to provide for the Australian victims of overseas terrorist acts compensation payments analogous to those received by domestic victims of crime under the state and territory victims of crime schemes. An issue which the government has yet to resolve is whether the bill will have retrospective operation. 


I do believe there is an amendment to be moved by the shadow minister, the member for Stirling, who I also know has a close affiliation with victims of the Bali bombings, many of whom came from his electorate. Obviously it would be deeply disappointing if victims of the two Bali bombings, the two Jakarta bombings, the London bombing and September 11 were not able to access the compensation that will shortly be available. The Social Security Amendment (Supporting Australian Victims of Terrorism Overseas) Bill 2011 before parliament is not necessarily retrospective. It could therefore leave victims of those Bali bombings and other past terrorist attacks, as flagged in the March 2011 press release, without any financial support. I have spoken on the Bali bombings in this place on quite a few occasions and have attended the remembrance service in Perth, in Kings Park, with the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and member for Curtin and the WA Premier, Colin Barnett, during the past few years. I have met victims of the Bali bombings and their families, and if anyone ever qualified for support from this government they certainly do. The Leader of the Opposition and member for Paterson have consistently said in the past that the Australians who were killed or severely injured in the second Bali bombing were the inspiration for the original bill. To keep faith with them, the coalition will move amendments, as I have previously mentioned, to ensure that they also have access to compensation.


I will now make some further comments about the Bali bombings which I have shared with the members of this place previously. The bombings took the lives of 202 people in the district of Kuta in 2002. As Australians and as Western Australians we shared this tragedy with the people of Indonesia and the rest of the world. With the deaths of 88 Australians and the injuries to many others, the dark shadow of terrorism finally came to meet Australians face to face in the home of one of our nearest neighbours. It brought home to all Australians how cowardly terrorists are. This was a tragedy for the peace-loving Balinese, who welcome all Australians and many other world visitors to their beautiful island. They shared the pain and tragedy suffered by many Australians and others from around the world who lost loved ones. Out of this tragedy, we have strengthened the relationship between Australia and Indonesia, and we are closer now in 2012 than ever before. We have found new strength not only between our governments but also between our peoples and our cultures.


Australia has been a friend and ally of Indonesia, our closest neighbour. At the closest point between the two countries there is less distance between Australia and Indonesia than there is between Sydney and Canberra. By being so close we have been able to share in great opportunities for relationships to grow on so many levels. The close proximity of our two countries has also meant that the security and prosperity of Australia is intimately linked with the security and prosperity of Indonesia, and we as a nation are committed to growth and stability for their nation and the region. We stood by Indonesia as they fought for their independence in 1948. Now, in 2012, we must also stand by the victims of the bombings who inspired this bill. I commend the bill to the House.

Ms ROXON
 (Gellibrand—Attorney-General and Minister for Emergency Management) (13:17):  I would like to thank all the members who have spoken on this bill. It is an area where people on both sides of the House have very strong feelings, for reasons that are extremely justifiable. I want to thank everyone for their contributions and the spirit in which they were given, in particular those members who have people in their electorates who were unfortunate victims or family members of victims of past incidents. I know that for all concerned it is a very delicate subject and one where people are committed to being able to provide appropriate support. No-one in this House disagrees with the fact that terrorism is a terrible crime, that it has a dramatic and long-lasting impact on the lives of victims.


This Social Security Amendment (Supporting Australian Victims of Terrorism Overseas) Bill 2011 will enable Australians who are victims of declared overseas terrorism acts to claim financial support of up to $75,000. The bill establishes a framework for the provision of this assistance. As the bill was introduced some time ago, it will not surprise the House as we flag that the government will be moving some amendments that have already been identified. I will go through those amendments in more detail when they are moved in the consideration in detail stage.


But I would like to address one of the major themes that has been raised throughout this debate, particularly from those opposite, and that is the question of whether or not retrospectivity should apply to this scheme. I understand that that will be the subject of an amendment to be moved by the opposition when we get to the consideration in detail stage. As I said, I respect the speakers who have spoken about this and their genuine commitment. However, I think we do need to look at some of the facts in the history surrounding these particular instances but also the consideration of whether or not retrospectivity should apply. Speakers mentioned in particular the September 11 attacks and the Bali bombings.


In relation to the September 11 attacks and the Bali bombings, the previous government made decisions about support and assistance for victims at the time. In fact, in August 2003, after the Bali bombing, then Prime Minister John Howard ruled out compensation and a compensation scheme for victims of terrorism. Further, in May 2006, the then Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Chris Ellison, ruled out a compensation support scheme for victims of the second Bali bombing. Of course, support was provided to past victims, and that drew on a number of existing measures, including the Disaster Health Care Assistance Scheme, ex gratia assistance, consular and repatriation assistance and immediate short-term financial assistance through the AGDRP. Since Bali 2002 the Australian government has expended more than $12 million on assistance and support for Australians killed or injured as a direct result of overseas terrorist acts. In addition, the September 11 Victim Compensation Fund provided generous financial assistance to those injured and the next of kin of those who were killed in the 9-11 attacks, including Australians.


So I am concerned that those opposite are raising an issue that they did not act upon when they were in government; that this has been pursued well after the opportunity to be able to consider these matters; and that it was ruled out explicitly by the Prime Minister of the day, and ruled out again by the Justice and Customs Minister, a senator from the shadow minister's own state. Here, our government has taken the step to establish a scheme, once and for all, for future events. That is now being politicised to try to make some sort of point about a history which is actually the previous government's history rather than our own. Payments have been made of between $250,000 and up to $7.1 million to the next of kin of those persons who were killed in the 9-11 attacks, including Australians. Accordingly, the government does not propose to extend the scheme to cover individuals who have already been supported. 


Our government is very committed to making the changes in this bill. We have welcomed the opposition's support. There has been agreement, in what is a difficult area, about how prospective payments should be capped. I think this is a scheme that will stand Australia in good stead. I am sure that every member of this House hopes that this scheme will never be used. That will mean that we never have Australians in parts of the world where they may be a victim of terrorism. But I fear that despite that ardent wish, we do not live in a world where that is likely to be possible in the future and therefore it is appropriate for us to put in place a scheme which allows for clear support and which sets out the rules and methods for that to be made available to people quickly. I will speak in a little more detail about the amendments that the government is moving when we move to the consideration in detail, and of course I acknowledge that the member for Stirling is also going to move his amendments after that.

Mr RUDD
 (Griffith) (13:49):  Today is Motor Neurone Disease Global Day. Motor neurone disease is the name given to a group of diseases in which the muscles gradually weaken and waste away. One by one, people lose the ability to walk, talk and then to swallow. This disease has no known cause, no known cure and no effective treatment. It is estimated there are about 1,400 people Australians who have been diagnosed with MND.


Today I would like to pay tribute to one of these people. His name is Scott Sullivan. I met Scott just a few weeks ago. Scott, his wife Sarah, and their two young children, Abbey and Charlie, live in Coorparoo in my local community in Brisbane. In 2010, Scott, who is a very young man, was diagnosed with motor neurone disease. He told me his life expectancy is between three and five years. He is a strong man and resolute. Shortly after his diagnosis, Scott helped launch the MND and Me Foundation. A few months back he was awarded the Pride of Australia Courage Medal for Queensland for his efforts. The MND and Me Foundation is a not-for-profit organisation that raises funds for research into finding a cure and provides practical support to ensure that those who live with this terrible disease and their families are properly looked after. I urge all honourable members and the entire Australian community to show your support for organisations like the MND and Me Foundation. Let us try to beat this insidious disease.

Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (15:16):  I thought the acting Prime Minister was going to stay for my address but he was like Captain Emad. He was out the door. Captain Emad, what happened to him? 



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member for North Sydney may follow if he is not careful. 




Mr HOCKEY:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, the Westpac consumer sentiment index was released last week and Westpac described their latest survey for June as 'another disappointing result'. The National Australia Bank had its monthly business study last week and their chief economist, Alan Oster, said:


I have never seen a result like that ever.


He added that the degree of weakening in activity over the past couple of months suggests that the economy is struggling with conditions in some of the previously strong industries—namely mining and finance. Business and property are also looking somewhat laggard at present.


We get accused of talking the economy down. We get accused of negativity. Here are the worst consumer sentiment surveys that have been seen by the surveyors, and we get blamed for it as if it is our fault. The government is the one that is in charge of overseeing the Australian economy. The government is the one who is responsible through its policies for the direction of the Australian economy and this week alone we have seen the government bury and resuscitate policies in biblical proportions that have not happened for more than 2,000 years. Policies that came out during the budget were killed and then resuscitated by the Prime Minister last week. The first was company tax cuts. The second was the passenger movement charge CPI indexation which the government increased in the budget but this week dumped. The third one truly takes on Lazarus proportions—withholding tax on management investment trusts. It was announced in the budget that the government was going to reduce it from 30 per cent to 7½ per cent. The budget said it is going to go back up to 15 per cent. 



An opposition member:  It bounced.




Mr HOCKEY:
  It has not quite bounced, but they put it in their bill that was before the House yesterday. Then they excised it from the bill yesterday and today they have reintroduced it. So at first the government reduced it from 30 per cent to 7½ per cent. Then in the budget they said they were increasing this tax to 15 per cent. Yesterday they said they are dumping it back to 7½ per cent and today they have introduced a bill to increase it back to 15 per cent. And they are wondering why people are confused about the direction of this government. Seriously, it is a yoyo tax policy; it goes up and it goes down, it goes up and it goes down. But this is consistent with Labor in government.


We know the almighty proposal from the Prime Minister that there would be no carbon tax under a government she leads and then a few weeks later she introduced it. At the time, the Treasurer and I were on the 7:30 Report. That is when Kerry O'Brien was still hosting it. Red Kerry was still there interviewing. He asked a question of the Treasurer. He said, 'Would you introduce a carbon tax?' The Treasurer said: 'That is a hysterical assumption, a hysterical allegation. We will not do that.' Of course, Australians took him at face value. And here the Treasurer was giving us a brief analysis of what hysterical is today. He is the man hysterical because he is in a week and a half introducing the world's biggest carbon tax.


But this is part of the litany of broken promises from Labor. I thought I would get a list. There are more than 37 election promises broken, promises made solemnly by the government to the Australian people, promises that have resulted in back flips and contortions on a grand scale. You remember community consensus on taxing carbon. That was one of the love-ins. They said they were going to cut company tax—a $500 standard deduction on tax returns is what Labor promised. They dumped that in the budget. They promised to deliver the millennium goal on foreign aid. Well, they have dumped that. They have dumped a 50 per cent discount on interest income. They were so committed to dealing with the challenge of carbon dioxide emissions that they had a grand plan to give green buildings a tax break. They have dumped that. They promised to increase defence spending. They said there were going to be cuts in the defence budget but they were going to reinvest them in defence. The Prime Minister has broken that solemn promise and broken it quite spectacularly, because Australia is now at the lowest level of defence spending as a percentage of GDP since 1938, but that is what the Prime Minister calls a defence spending increase.


Believe it or not, those opposite said they were going to spare the Public Service from budget cuts. I believed them, too, because the Public Service is 20,000 larger in number than it was when they came into government just four years ago. They are making some cuts, but in the wrong areas. Remember gambling reform? Remember the agreement with the member for Denison? He remembers it, but you guys have forgotten. There is more. We know about onshore processing. We could get Captain Emad in here again. Where is Captain Emad? He has gone out the door with Swanny! And we remember the offshore processing centre in East Timor. What the hell happened to that? The Prime Minister forgot to tell the Timorese she was going to build a processing centre for refugees in their country. That is like reopening Fort Denison in Sydney and the Prime Minister of East Timor announcing that he is going to shuffle people there.


Of course, we had cash for clunkers—they believed in that. That did not even get to legislation. They had a big review into the Building the Education Revolution program, led by Mr Orgill. They promised to implement all the recommendations and they have implemented none of them. What happened to the Solar Credits scheme? And how about the national school curriculum, which the Prime Minister said was definitely going to start on 1 January this year? We are still waiting.


The list goes on. I could spend all day here, but do you know what? The first point to make is that this is what creates sovereign risk—these changes; these flip-flops on policy. We do not write the speeches. We do not write the press releases from business leaders and employers, not just here in Australia but also around the world, expressing grave concern about the incompetence of this government. The quotes I am about to give are all from 2012—this year. So I am putting aside all the legitimate criticisms of the Rudd government in 2008, the Rudd government in 2009, the Rudd-Gillard government in 2010 and the Gillard government in 2011 and just dealing with the concerns of employers, businesspeople and workers in 2012. Ian Matheson is from the Australasian Investor Relations Association—covering the whole region. In a report on the survey of the top 200 ASX companies he said:


In the comments from corporates, obviously reflecting what is being told to them by international investors, there is absolutely no doubt there has been heightened concern about things such as the carbon tax, the MRRT (minerals resource rent tax), growing industrial dispute activity and sovereign risk generally. That has been going on for 12 months now.


John Stanhope, former CFO of Telstra, said:


… people looking outside at Australia think we're a sovereign risk because of the uncertainty created by policy fluctuation.


Colin Beckett from Chevron, in charge of the $43 billion Gorgon LNG project in Western Australia, said:


The key is to create a policy and investment environment sympathetic to capability building for the long run—


pointing to the need for—


a tax system that provides … certainty, stability and low sovereign risk.


Bernie Ridgeway, Managing Director of Imdex Ltd, said:


You're taking a previously blue chip jurisdiction for investment (Australia) and we're turning into something where we've got sovereign risk and uncertainty.


I am going to keep going because I want to get these comments on the record. David Knox, Chief Executive Officer of Santos, said:


My clear message to the Australian Government is: do not create uncertainty.


Instead provide our investors with the confidence in Australia as a stable fiscal and regulatory region—allow us to stay competitive.


This is now extending overseas. David Denison, President and CEO of the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board, said—and I am sure the member for Leichhardt can add to it; he is providing plenty of commentary here:


… Australia’s budget that was tabled last week effectively doubled the tax burden on our real estate and infrastructure holdings in that country.


If we conclude that these kinds of risks within any country become significant enough to call into question the predictability and stability of cash flows that are at the heart of the investment rationale for infrastructure, our response will be very quick and rational—we will simply stop investing there.


This is about the withholding tax on managed investment trusts, which the government said they were going to reduce from 30 per cent to 7½ per cent. In the budget they went and doubled it to 15 per cent. Yesterday, they dumped it back to 7½ per cent and today they have introduced legislation to re-increase to 15 per cent. One of the biggest investors in the world is saying: 'What are you doing? We will put our money somewhere else.' And they do not just invest in mining; they invest in basic infrastructure like electricity, water, toll roads and transport more generally—and do you know what? They are saying it is getting too hard.


Ivan Glasenberg, CEO of Glencore, one of the biggest miners in the world and about to buy Xstrata, said in London:


At least in the Congo they need you, they want you there and if they start changing the rules on you, you may not continue investing.


   …   …   …


So Australia does have its risk, yes. We saw the carbon tax, we saw the mineral resource tax.


This is one of the biggest miners in the world saying that the Congo is proving to represent a lower sovereign risk than Australia under Labor. If you thought that was a one-off in London, Jac Nasser, who is the Chairman of BHP Billiton, is on the global board of News Limited and is a former global head of Ford, said:


I cannot overstate how the level of uncertainty about Australia's tax system is generating negative investor reaction.


He says Australia is increasingly 'one of the higher cost countries'. Tom Albanese, Chief Executive Officer of Rio Tinto, said:


I am sorry to say, now, frankly, when I meet with investors around the world they are saying, 'Tom are you worried about your over-exposure to Australia'  … that’s not a good thing, that’s a damming testimony for where Australia fits. It's not something to get fretful about, but it's something that should be recognised as a problem.


David Murray, former head of the Future Fund—I am going on, because these are important to list—said:


The consequence of introducing that tax at that level in Australia today is very, very bad for this economy, particularly in terms of its international competitiveness …  it raises costs further within Australia. It reduces our competitiveness for export of energy related commodities and it therefore renders us less competitive in the future. 


Bernie Brooks, Myer chief executive, said:


I'm not sure how you are going to get a greater degree of efficiency when you have the Fair Work Act—


I have hardly mentioned industrial relations—


which is going to cause an increased cost of labour … The reality is paying 225 per cent penalty rates on a Sunday is going to have a significant impact on business


We are not writing these things. These are people that employ other Australians. Bernie Ridgeway, managing director of Imdex, said:


You're taking a previously blue chip jurisdiction for investment (Australia) and we're turning into something where we've got sovereign risk and uncertainty.


Joe Ricciardo, Managing Director of GR Engineering, said:


It's in a de facto government arrangement where the Labor Party's being controlled by Greens and Independents and none of them are aligned to what needs to be done in the country.


Peter Agostino, Senior Managing Director of CBRE, said:


The Labor Party is in the hands of the Greens and Independents for every decision. The issue is we have a Government that doesn't have the ability to govern.


I can go on. Tony Sage, Executive Chairman of Cape Lambert, said:


Fund managers who control stock markets around the world all are telling me they are not investing in Australia because of the Government.


BGC owner Len Buckeridge says:


We have become the laughing stock of South East Asia as our reputation falls into a morass


I can keep going on. The bottom line is this: Labor is creating uncertainty in Australia. Labor is creating negativity in Australia. Labor's taxation incompetence and poor governance arrangements prove it is not ready to govern the country and should step aside. (Time expired)

Dr EMERSON
 (Rankin—Minister for Trade and Competitiveness) (15:31):  Listen not to what the coalition say but to what they do. Watch what they do, and that is to invest as hard and as fast as they can in mining shares in this country. This is their own money, and they are voting with their wallets, as revealed in the statements of pecuniary interest. One after another, they are falling over each other to get into mining shares. Then you have, yet again, the shadow Treasurer of this country walking in and trash-talking the Australian economy, seeking to gain the maximum political benefit while at the same time doing exactly the opposite to obtain the maximum financial benefit—that is, to invest in Australia's future by investing in our industries.


We have just had a diatribe from the shadow Treasurer, who knows nothing other than talking the Australian economy down, but I would rather look again at what businesses are doing. The Business Council of Australia has just released a report indicating that there is a pipeline of investment running towards $1 trillion. This is unsurpassed in Australia's history. The report says:


By 2013, expenditure on capital investment is likely to grow to 30 per cent of GDP and remain at that level for the rest of the decade.


How does that constitute perceptions of sovereign risk? Why would investment in this country rise to 30 per cent of GDP, compared to an average investment intensity of 20 per cent of GDP for OECD countries? So not only is Australia doing well in absolute terms and extraordinarily well in historical terms but Australia is also doing very well relative to the rest of the OECD. The Business Council of Australia is indicating that it is likely that investment as a share of GDP for the rest of this decade will be 30 per cent, compared with 20 per cent for the rest of the OECD. It goes on to say:


The size of the largest of the major projects in the pipeline is unprecedented in Australia’s history …


Of course, we have various statements from various business leaders and indeed from politicians. Just yesterday the Liberal Premier of Western Australia referred to that day's 'announcement by Rio Tinto’s board that it will fund the completion of a major expansion of Rio Tinto’s iron ore port at Cape Lambert, worth more than $2 billion'. He said:


It underlines the increasingly significant role that expanded iron ore production and a dynamic Pilbara are having in shaping the economic and social future of our State.


This is from a Liberal Premier. He is applauding the big new investments that Rio Tinto is making in Australia because he is playing it straight. He is telling it as it is, not—as the Shadow Treasurer comes in here and does—telling it as those opposite would like it to be; they would rather see Australia fail than the Labor government succeed. They will trash-talk the economy at every opportunity. We know that Shell is investing more than $30 billion in Australia over the next five years. The chief executive of Shell, Peter Voser, said:


Shell as a company is actually very much advocating that we need a price for carbon on the worldwide basis and we want that to be on a market mechanism.


So there you have Shell expressing its faith with a massive investment in this country.


We also had references to gas-producing companies in Western Australia. Here is one: Woodside. That is a very large gas-producing company and it had this to say last month. This is Peter Coleman, the CEO of Woodside. One would think he would know a bit about gas and sovereign risk, as it is a multinational corporation. He said:


Woodside and our peers benefit enormously from Australia’s low sovereign risk profile and open investment regime.


Australia is a place that major oil and gas companies want to do business.


You would not believe that if you were listening to the Leader of the Opposition or the shadow Treasurer.


The Leader of the Opposition comes in every day and says: 'That's it—on 1 July, it's all over red rover. There goes Whyalla. There goes the coalmining industry.' Only last week he talked about what would happen from 1 July—or some time thereafter, because I understand that this is now a python, not a cobra strike or a 'noa constrictor' or whatever he has up his sleeve or elsewhere. What I am saying is that this opposition leader is trying to talk down the Australian economy. He is saying that there will be no coal industry in Australia—that the coal industry of Australia will be annihilated. The problem for the Leader of the Opposition is that 1 July is now fast approaching, and he has not had the dexterity to even consider changing tack other than by changing metaphors from cobras to pythons and 'noa constrictors'. So he is still flat-footed, saying that after 1 July it will all be doom and devastation. That is why you see him today doing this tumble into a pool full of foam. But after 1 July he will crack his head on the diving board. That is what is going to happen: as he tries to do a spectacular backflip he will crack his head on the diving board and he will fall to the pool in a gigantic bellyflop, because the Australian economy will go on and the investment will increase—not because of what people say but because of what people are doing. And that is investing with confidence in the Australian economy.


You would reckon that the ratings agencies would know a little bit about sovereign risk. This is why they live and breathe; this is how they make their incomes. And this is what they said on 8 May—this is Fitch, first of all:


Australia's low general government debt-to-GDP ratio … is already a standout ratings strength, having given it a demonstrable capacity to absorb fiscal and economic shocks.


Fitch upgraded Australia to 'AAA' from 'AA+' in November last year, citing the country's strong credit fundamentals. At the time, we noted that successful implementation of the government's medium-term fiscal consolidation plans would support the ratings.


Now Moody's, also one of the three international ratings agencies, said:


The commitment to returning to surplus is important for Australia's credibility in accessing global capital markets.


And Standard and Poor's on the same day said:


Restoring the government's strong fiscal settings through a forecast return to surpluses over the cycle and maintaining low debt will provide flexibility to respond to large economic and financial shocks, and is consistent with maintaining the 'AAA' rating on Australia.


It is not just Standard and Poor's who are maintaining a AAA rating for the Australian economy; it is all three ratings agencies. This is the first time in Australia's history where all three ratings agencies have rated the Australian economy AAA. And if I were an investor and if I were considering Australia as a destination, I tell you who I would be listening to before I ever listened to the Leader of the Opposition or the shadow Treasurer, and that is the ratings agencies, because it is their job.


The coalition thinks that it is its job to trash-talk the Australian economy. Why? Because they do not want the Australian economy to succeed. They do not want people to get more and better jobs in the Australian economy. The other day—two weeks ago, when those very good figures came out—we had unemployment of 5.1 per cent, we had GDP growth at 4.3 per cent, we had a Reserve Bank cash rate of 3.5 per cent and we had an inflation rate of 2.2 per cent. And have you ever seen such a hangdog performance from the shadow Treasurer? There he was, and they said, 'Are you questioning the numbers?' and with an old hangdog look he said, 'Oh, the numbers are the numbers are the numbers.' I have never seen a more despondent shadow Treasurer in recent history, if ever. And the reason is that those opposite want to see the Australian economy fail. That is why they are 'glum and glummer'. That is why the shadow Treasurer was glummer—if possible—than the opposition leader on that day, with that performance. It was the old hangdog look: 'Oh, my God!' You can imagine what happened in the office when they read out the GDP figure of 4.3 per cent. He would have said, 'Oh no! No—it can't be right. I'm not going to do media.' And they would have said, 'Joe, you're booked in.' 'Oh, my God! Can you question the figures? I'd better not question the ABS. But, gee, I'll try to look happy.' But he could not. He could not raise a smile, because they were so despondent. They believed that that had damaged their electoral prospects, which are all they care about.


For further evidence of the fact that Australia is valued very highly around the world as an investment destination, a 2011 survey by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and the Asia Pacific Foundation of Canada found that Australia is seen by Chinese businesses as the second most open destination after the United States. We are not talking about a select number of countries: we are the second most favoured destination in the world as seen by Chinese investors. And this government is working very hard with China to ensure that there is the opportunity of further investment in this country.


But Mr Deputy Speaker Scott I have to say that members of your party—to whom I believe you are not very close—have been running around with anti-China rants. And I hope that you prevail, Mr Deputy Speaker, in the national interest. I am not being political here, I just think that it would be a terrible tragedy if Senator Barnaby Joyce ever made it into the House of Representatives and were to put himself forward as the alternative Deputy Prime Minister of this country. I genuinely believe that, Mr Deputy Speaker. You are a good man; you approach policy on a sensible and balanced basis and you represent your constituents properly. But this guy, because he cannot get off TV and because he cannot keep his mouth shut, runs around with his anti-China rants. These rants are, through the silence of the opposition leader, completely condoned by the opposition leader. Why? Because they come out of the same stable. They are out of the BA Santamaria stable. In fact, the opposition leader said, 'I worship the very water that BA Santamaria walks on.' He thinks that BA Santamaria was the messiah.


Senator Joyce knows that if he goes around scratching hard enough with this 'fortress Australia' mentality—this cringing mentality—he will find that there are some political votes to be harvested. He should be concentrating on supporting rural Australia harvesting grain and harvesting crops, rather than running around seeking to harvest votes in his quest to become the candidate for the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia. So I wish you every success, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, not only because I like you but because I think this guy is a genuine danger to Australia.


We abandoned the 'fortress Australia' mentality, really, around the fifties and the 1960s. And I will give credit to the now National Party back in 1957, because it was John 'Black Jack' McEwen—with whom I would otherwise not have a lot in common—who had the foresight, the vision and the guts to go to the Japanese after the terrible toll of the Second World War and propose a commerce agreement.




Mr Hunt:
  Menzies!




Dr EMERSON:
  That was supported by Menzies, so I am saying that they were visionaries in doing that. I think that that is the sort of leadership that is needed.


That sort of leadership was then followed up by Whitlam, with the recognition of China. He said he would do it when he became Prime Minister and he did. It was followed up by Hawke and Keating, and these are the people who have helped to put Australia in the right place at the right time in the Asian region in the Asian century. It is why we are undertaking this very big and ambitious project: the Australia in the Asian century white paper exercise. At the same time there is this rabid behaviour from Senator Barnaby Joyce, who is not some sort of erratic backbencher; he is bound by cabinet solidarity. The fact that he runs around with his anti-China rants tells me one thing—that is, his activities, his behaviour, his language are all condoned and supported by the Leader of the Opposition. If for no other reason—and I could list 25 of them—the opposition leader should never be Prime Minister of Australia. Senator Barnaby Joyce should never occupy a senior position on any frontbench in this country. I believe that from my heart because of all the work that has been put in by previous governments—Liberal, National and Labor governments—to position ourselves in the right place at the right time in the Asian region in the Asian century. So, when you talk about sovereign risk in these debates, look at the sovereign risk that is being created by Senator Barnaby Joyce and condoned by the opposition leader because, in their hearts, the opposition do want to return to a fortress Australia.


You have, on this side of the parliament, a visionary political party. The Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister said, 'We're the progressives; we do the big changes; we do the important changes for Australia's future.' On the other side are the reactionaries. You have the shadow treasurer coming in here with a hangdog look and saying, 'Look; I've found a negative quote. Oh, this is terrible. Oh, here's another negative quote.' Well, look at what they do rather than what they say. They fall over themselves to invest in shares. Look at what the ratings agencies say: Australia is AAA rated for the first time in its history. Look at what investors are actually doing. You have got Shell; you have got Woodside. You have got major projects here. You have got an investment pipeline of more than $900 billion. Investment as a share of GDP is set to rise to 30 per cent compared with 20 per cent for the rest of the OECD, all great news for Australia, all because people know that under this government the environment is right to invest in this country. Yes, of course we take advantage of our proximity to China but that is not through good luck; it is through good management, through visionary management. We will continue that. We will continue to say yes to responsible economic policy while they continue to say no to everything. (Time expired)

"Simpkins, Luke, MP",LP,2012-06-21,"



Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (15:46):  I think the minister ran out of things to say several minutes ago, particularly when he started talking about how our proximity to China is apparently due to good management, not luck. I really thought it was about distance, personally. As a proud Western Australian I see what great things the innovators and the courageous have done for our state and, as we know now, this country. I talk of the industry that, for all intents and purposes, carries this country at this time: the resources sector. There was a time when it was said that Australia rode on the sheep's back, indicating the dependence on the wool industry, yet I wonder where this country would be if it were not for those who backed themselves in the exploration and development of mines and gas and oil fields. Where would we be if no-one wanted to take a risk? Where would we be if people like Lang Hancock had not risked the shirt off his own back in the belief that he could find and develop mining opportunities for the sake of this country? Where also would we be if the big and the mid-cap miners just decided, 'Well, we will sit on what we have; we won't risk anything more'? Where would we be if the guys involved in the small start-up prospecting companies did not mortgage their houses on the belief that they could succeed? It is true that many of the great resource businesses in western Australia were established and continue to be established by pioneers. Whether it was 50 years ago or whether it is right now, success in mining at some point takes someone to go out to some dusty, barren landscape to start making decisions. At the start of some ventures there are no six-figure pay cheques.


Where we would be is that this country would be less developed in every respect of economic, social and other forms of its life. We would be in recession and cities like Perth would be towns, not cities. This country is being held up by those who have taken risks in the belief that for the high risk there will be higher returns. Every one of the fly-in fly-out workers and their families and supporting businesses in Malaga, Wangara or Lansdale within the electorate of Cowan owe their existence to the fact that someone was willing to take risks and get out there, away from the cities and look for oil, gas, iron ore, gold, uranium and many other minerals.


Those who are employed as a result of these origins and as a result of the continuing decisions to invest and take a chance are the ones spending money in our retail sector in Perth and around the country. Food, equipment, vehicles and everything that keeps mines, projects and supporting businesses going are being sought in most cases from other businesses around the country and so the cycle goes on. Of course not everyone can or wants to take those risks but those who can and do in exchange for that risk should get the returns.


This government falsely believes that what comes out of the ground is the property of every Australian, but if it comes out of the ground in WA it is the Western Australian taxpayers that are due the royalties, not the Australian taxpayers. The same applies for each mine in any state or territory. This government sees the resources sector and Western Australia as cash cows. In the case of Western Australia, they fleece in excess of 40 per cent of the mining tax money out of WA and give a pittance back as they try to buy the votes they need to save their political hides.


The carbon tax is a bizarre piece of legislation that will have absolutely no effect on the world's climate, despite it being the world's biggest carbon tax. On the carbon tax, a lot is said by the government about who said what about Whyalla being wiped off a map but, as we know, it was Wayne Hanson, South Australian Secretary of the AWU—probably the preselector for half of the South Australian members on the other side—who said that Whyalla and Port Pirie would be wiped off the map by the carbon tax. So if they want to quote their own preselectors and be accurate maybe they should do so.


The definition of sovereign risk does include uncertainty about a nation's economic policies, and the idea that regulations or laws can change without warning creates a lack of trust and consequent uncertainty. Sovereign risk is about certainty and consistency, and the carbon tax is an excellent example of a policy creating uncertainty and being inconsistent. Clearly, when the voters and investors hear a Prime Minister six days before an election say, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead' and the Treasurer say, 'Certainly what we have rejected is this hysterical allegation that somehow we are moving towards a carbon tax,' it is interesting to consider those pre-election statements versus the post-election reality, because this goes to more than just the outrageous deception of the Australian people. These facts about pre-election promises of no carbon tax and then post-election deals with the Greens for a carbon tax say something loud and clear to international and domestic investors. It says that if the going gets tough for the Labor Party they will ditch any key commitment in order to hold onto power. So those thinking about investing in Australia now know that a Labor promise cannot be relied upon and they have to factor that into their lack of certainty about Labor. Even the government's $23 a tonne as the carbon tax starting price represents a sovereign risk, as that is above any market price in the world and, indeed, the government predictions as seen in the Treasury documents. It seems that while economists everywhere predict the carbon cost per tonne will fall as low as $4 per tonne, Treasury says that it will rise to $29, and if it does not the whole scheme will fail. Investors are looking at the real world realities, and they can see the fallacies that surround the carbon tax.


Fortunately, they know that we are clear in our commitments, and they at least can rely on a future Liberal-National Abbott government. The question becomes: what outcomes are we seeing as a result of uncertainty and radical reversal of policy positions from this Labor government? The impact of sovereign risk on outcomes can be seen in projects such as the Port Hedland outer harbour. Instead of a full commitment to the whole project, now it is being phased so as not to risk the entire investment. This is where the lack of policy certainty and real sovereign risk are now playing.


Fortunately, when investors look around the world at mining and exploration projects, despite increasing levels of uncertainty concerning Australia under Labor, the fundamental political instability in parts of Africa still provides a deterrent. Yet there is increasing interest in South America, and if we are going to attract every possible cent from investors that translates into real jobs and economic activity then the national government needs to stay true to its policies and have policies that encourage risks through good returns rather than uncertainty and political cowardice.


What we have seen from this Labor government is that any critical analysis of its position is described as talking down the economy. Indeed, it is increasingly being made illegal in this country to dissent from the government. If print media is critical of Labor or the Greens then there is an investigation and new regulations or rules are imposed. Yet when the national broadcaster is critical of the opposition, that is okay.


At least one side of politics believes in free speech. I note that the Treasurer is so critical of Gina Rinehart seeking a seat on the board of Fairfax Media that he is actively trying to influence board membership in Australia. Again, this is what the government do when they wish to stifle alternative views—not that I think Fairfax journalists will ever allow themselves to be told what to do. I find the government's approach Orwellian and pathetic in their contempt of free speech in Australia.


Speaking of opposition to government policies and attempts by this government to suppress it, I should also mention the new responsibility of the ACCC to act against those who dare to suggest that the world's biggest carbon tax will push up prices. As I said, there is an increasing attempt to silence and to apply pressure to any opponents of this government, its Greens backers or its policies. I also count these efforts as akin to sovereign risk, as the Labor government is attempting to protect its policies through regulation, exerting pressure on legal media ownership and influencing the activities of businesses. This constitutes circumstances of doubt and uncertainty for those wishing to invest in and conduct legal business activity in Australia.


I previously spoke about the government's claims that we are talking down the economy and demonstrated how the government hate criticism and have attempted to regulate and influence any criticism of them or their policies. The reality is that at the core of any damage to the economy are the policies of the Labor government, including their terrible backflips, their taxing, their spending and their deception along the way. They have created all of these concerns for business and investors, and it is through their own failures and outlawing of the ability to question them that they are not going to stop Australians, businesses and investors from having an increasing lack of confidence.


The shadow minister has already outlined so many quotes from people who have increasingly identified the sovereign risk in this country. A further very recent quote from Ivan Glasenberg was:


It is a first world country but is doing things that are making people cautious of investing, so Australia is becoming another country where you have got to make sure that the rules aren't going to change on you.


So, unlike what the government says, there are an increasing number of people that are not afraid to speak out and identify the government's failures.


To conclude my contribution, I say again that the increasing levels of sovereign risk that the investors are concerned about are as a result of the Labor government's own decisions. No-one is making this stuff up. The government is wholly responsible and you cannot play the blame game here. We did not make you deceive the Australian people on the carbon tax, use Western Australia as a cash cow or increase the regulations on business. None of this came from the suggestions or the efforts of the opposition. The good news is that this will be reversed with the election of a consistent and economically responsible Abbott coalition government, a government that will allow Western Australia to thrive and that will stop the carbon tax and the mining tax.

"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2012-06-21,"



Mr HAYES
 (Fowler) (15:57):  Once again we come in here to be lectured by people who had the opportunity over 12 long years of the Howard government to make change. In fairness, they did make change. These are the people who stripped over $1 billion out of public health. As a matter of fact, that was under the Leader of the Opposition himself. These are the same people who decided to cut investment in education, specifically vocational education as we were building up to a skills crisis. The coup d'etat of this mob opposite was that when they had control of both Houses they wanted to pit worker against worker and bring in the most obscene forms of industrial legislation. For the first time in this country's history they made it possible and legal for people on the minimum wage to be paid lower than award rates of pay. I think we need to be reminded of their economic position, their fiscal rectitude and the way they have gone about them when they have occupied the Treasury benches.


The truth of the matter is that we have a $1.4 trillion economy. We have a growth rate that is exceeding four per cent. We have an unemployment rate hovering around five per cent. We have a sovereign debt rate of less than 10 per cent, which is about one-tenth of most mainstream economies, and we have low interest rates. As a country we should actually be crowing about that and saying that it is not a bad achievement. Outside the halls here and certainly outside Australia, they go overseas and they do crow about it. What was Tony Abbott's quote when he visited London recently? It was something to the effect that we have serious bragging rights about our economy. He also went on to say that our economic circumstances are most enviable. They get back on the 747, come back to Australia and want to say that this is a basket case. Quite frankly, the only basket case here is people coming in and wanting to talk down our economy and our economic performance, apart from everything else. You would have to say that that is just simply un-Australian. If you cannot stick to the facts, shut up.


In 2008, not all that long ago, the opposition, which had been in government for 12 years before it was dismissed in 2007, had an opportunity. In 2008, the worst economic shock hit this country and, as a matter of fact, the rest of the world—the global financial crisis. There was no text book on how to handle this. It is was a matter of trying to work together to stimulate the economy. We came up with what I thought were pretty clever ideas, like investing in our schools. Not only did that keep our construction industry working but it also meant that those kids are going to learn and, through these advanced learning technologies, are going to become more productive members of our society as they hit the workforce later on. So we get a double benefit out of that.


What did those opposite say about that? They just said, 'No.' It was not, 'Let's compromise; let's talk about it.' They voted no to any investment in schools. That is probably what they did when they had an opportunity in government, in any event.


We put money into social housing. The idea was to assist state governments with social housing—not only directly funding the development of new social housing but also funding maintenance so that they could get more housing stock on line. Those opposite voted no to that too. 


I turn to regional and local infrastructure. This is infrastructure that is owned and operated by all our councils. Whether they were Liberal, Labor or Callithumpian it did not matter; it applied to all our councils. We voted to use that as a way to stimulate our economy by investing directly in the councils, allowing them to oversee those projects. What did the opposition do? They voted no to that. 


But they did have an overlying philosophy. When they sat over there in the face of the world's worst economic crisis they did make a contribution to the debate. Their contribution was, 'We should wait and see what happens.' Some could argue that maybe Ireland, Greece and Portugal took their advice seriously and waited to see what happened in Europe and that this why they are almost economic basket cases. 


For the those on the opposite side of the chamber to get up and lampoon the Prime Minister for attending the G20 conference the other day and for saying how well the Australian economy is going, is, I have to say, a bit rich, when Tony Abbott goes overseas—to London—and talks seriously about the bragging rights we have in terms of the Australian economy.


But it is not just what they say. The shadow Treasurer has come in and quoted a whole range of people, again trying to develop the theory of doom and gloom in the Australian economy. But what about the recent IMF report? It was only released earlier in the week. It stated that the starting price on carbon should be around the level set by the Australian government in the Clean Energy Act. 




Mr Mitchell:
  What?




Mr HAYES:
  Yes, that was the IMF—not exactly a rabid organisation! And that was only this week—on Monday—so those opposite should not have forgotten it by now.




Ms Hall:
  Did they acknowledge it, on the other side?




Mr HAYES:
  No, member for Shortland, they forgot to. But you are dead right: they should at least have had regard to that. The IMF went on to say that what we have done is the least costly option if we are serious about addressing carbon pollution. Their economic forecasts were included in the same document. The IMF actually released an economic forecast that showed Australian economic growth will outstrip all other advanced economies. That is not bad going. But if something came out on Monday you would not think those opposite would have forgotten it by Thursday afternoon.


The Business Council of Australia is not a mob of left-wing ideologues—I think there may be a few on the other side who are associated with it—but in their report Pipeline or pipe dream? Securing Australia's investment future they state: 


By 2013, expenditure on capital investment is likely to grow to 30 per cent of GDP and remain at that level for the rest of the decade.


Thirty per cent is a huge growth. They are saying that this compares to 20 per cent for any other OECD economy. We are talking about the level of major projects in the pipeline. We are hearing that in excess of $540 billion worth of projects are lining up.


Shell have come out and said that they are going to be investing more than $30 billion in Australia over the next five years. CEO Peter Voser included a lovely statement. He said that Shell was actively advocating for a price on carbon on a worldwide basis, and that they would want it struck on a market mechanism. This is a company that is very much in the oil and hydrocarbon business coming out and saying that we do need to do that.


Woodside said something similar. I know that those opposite have been talking about Woodside earlier this week but they probably should have stopped and listened to the comments of Peter Coleman, who is the CEO. He said:


Woodside and our peers benefit enormously from Australia’s low sovereign risk profile and open investment regime.


Australia is a place that major oil and gas companies want to do business.


Where is the growth occurring in our economy? On the North West Shelf, in Queensland and the Timor Sea. And who is investing up there? Woodside. That is where the jobs are going. And here is the CEO saying that this is a place where his competitors also want to do business. 


We were lampooned for the fact that we were returning to a surplus. The only concern they have on the other side of the chamber is that they had a view that we should have an aspiration to have a surplus. They can be aspirational because when they went to the last election they could not find $11 billion in their costings! They went and engaged an 'independent' set of auditors to come out and justify where this money was. Those certain independent auditors got done for breaching professional standards. That does not auger well when those opposite want to come in here and try and lecture us on financial rectitude and how to go about transparency.


While we are at it, those opposite have a little bit of a problem with their current policies. At the moment even they admit that there is about $70 billion—




Ms Hall:
  A black hole.




Mr HAYES:
  It is not a black hole, member for Shortland; it is a bloody crater! You would need a mining company to fill this crater. Those opposite want to come in here and play this silly game of talking down the Australian economy in the hope that things will go badly. This is nothing short of what they have tried to do with respect to people coming on boats from overseas. You can see those opposite; they actually salivate when they hear of another boat entering our waters. 


These people do not care about management of the Australian economy. They just want to whinge and bleat. They have not been able to demonstrate any serious contribution to this debate. (Time expired)

"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2012-06-21,"



Mr RANDALL
 (Canning) (16:07):  I am pleased to speak on the adverse impact of government policies and the management of Australia's sovereign risk profile. I do so because it is very important to Australia and particularly to my electorate, with so many workers in Canning being employed in the fly-in fly-out side of the mining industry and the resources industry in general, where there are also drive-in drive-out workers. In this House my electorate is second to the member for Brand's in the number of metropolitan workers that fly-in fly-out or drive-in drive-out, so this is a very important issue.


What is sovereign risk? It is when people and companies see a country as a risky place to invest because the government is making the country less stable. We have become less stable for a number of reasons. The two main reasons are this government introducing a carbon tax and a mining tax. These taxes were introduced by the Gillard Labor government and, dare I say it, the former Labor government, the Rudd government. Prime Minister Gillard had an opportunity to do something about this and she did. Before the last election she said there would be no carbon tax under the government she led. Seven days before that the Treasurer, the deputy leader, said the same thing on The7.30 Report. Within days, when they were set to form a government, they told a total mistruth about this issue and worked towards a carbon tax. Those sorts of backflips do not engender any confidence in anybody wanting to invest in a country. These are the backflips you would expect from Third World countries, not a First World country.


It is ignorant to believe that there is no evidence for this. I say at the beginning, unlike those opposite who say, 'You're preaching doom and gloom,' I do not preach doom and gloom at all. This side of the House does not preach doom and gloom about the opportunities for this country. What we are saying is we could be doing so much better. We have the opportunity to be an outstanding economy and a destination for investment capital.




Dr Leigh:
  We are doing well!




Mr RANDALL:
  We are, but the point is we could be doing so much better. The little intellectual ideologue that interjects from the other side of the House will get up shortly and read some dissertation from his academic background and want us to believe his diatribe on these issues. But I come from where the workers come from. I do not come from this hothouse called Canberra, this social experiment. I come from a place where people wear fluoro jackets, working boots and working gloves. They earn real money from real jobs. They are not from the public service capital of this world. They do not feed on others, but actually produce something. That is where I am coming from. I come from the producing capital of the world. We have the richest mining province of anywhere in the world in the Pilbara, and right across Australia the opportunities are available.


Yesterday Atlas Iron were in this place talking to us. They said when they go overseas to sell the virtues of their company, investors in other parts of the world say to them there are three things they are concerned about: first, how is the minerals resource rent tax going to affect you?; second, how is the carbon tax going to affect you?; and third, what tax will they introduce next? This is a government that has not seen a tax that it does not like and does not want to hike.


China is the same. China says, before it invests in any of our companies: 'What is the story not only about your investment profile but also about your industrial relations profile?' On that point, this government has, through its Fair Work Act, allowed there to be an increasing militancy in the workforce which increases sovereign risk. This is borne out by adverse press, such as an article in the Business Spectator which states that for the first time in more than a decade BHP Billiton has been forced to declare it may not be able to supply its customers due to strikes, and the strike in its Queensland operations has gone on for more than 10 months. The article goes on to say:


Days lost to strike action have risen since the introduction of the Labor government's Fair Work Act in 2010 …


The strike has already cost BHP Billiton $2 billion in revenue. Isn't that seen as a risk by someone who wants to invest in our country? The article goes on to say:


Workplace Relations Minister Bill Shorten, who yesterday said the country had an 'overheated industrial environment'—


and this is the dog in the manger, the former union boss who is now the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations saying we have 'an overheated industrial environment'. But what is he doing about it? He said, 'We're monitoring it'. What a limp-wristed approach. We have a strike in Queensland and in the Pilbara we have the CFMEU and the Australian Workers Union fighting over members and demarcation disputes. All this goes towards the instability of doing work in our resources sector.


These issues scare countries like China which has invested in the CITIC Pacific project in the Pilbara. The company have said if they had the opportunity again they would not invest. They would not invest because they did not know there was going to be a mining tax. They would not invest because they did not know there was going to be a carbon tax. They did not know that doing business in Australia was going to be so expensive, because of so many factors hitting them now. These factors make this one of the most expensive places to do business.


The shadow small business minister, Bruce Billson, came to my electorate recently and pointed out that producing the same resources outcome in Australia is now 40 per cent dearer than doing so in the United States of America. This is not a Third World country or an African country but it costs 40 per cent more to do business here than to do business in the United States. Why is this a concern? This mining tax is concerning because the tax impost is not happening in other destinations. If you go to any junior or mid-cap miner in Western Australia you will find that they have alternative mines elsewhere in the world, whether it be in South America, Africa or Mongolia. BHP's largest mining operation in the world is Escondida in Chile. I have been to it; it is the most massive hole in the ground you have ever seen. In Chile they have a mining tax which is flexible, from half a per cent up to 14 per cent. I have been to Colombia where Cerrejon, an incredible coalmine, is owned, 33⅓ per cent each, by BHP, Anglo American and Xstrata. Where have you heard those names before? They all invest in Australia. In Colombia the tax regime is four to six per cent depending on the mineral. And here we are with a 22½ per cent mining tax. So where are people going to go invest? Are they going to go to Colombia where it is four to six per cent or are they going to come to Australia where it is 22½ per cent? They are not going to come here. It is a slow burn but they are out there looking at alternatives. Atlas Iron were telling us yesterday that they are eyeing off mines in Africa because they need an alternative. Even Mongolia is a safer place because at least they know they are not going to have retrospective, backward-glancing taxes.


Put this together with the almost racist view that the unions and union bosses came back to us with in relation to migration, that we could not have foreign workers come to our mines to help create jobs for Australians when we are talking about up to 1,700 foreign workers—I make the point it is 'up to' 1,700—coming to our mines which will eventually create 8,000 jobs for Australian workers. So those opposite are in an absolute mess in terms of their policy. This policy is confusing and they are completely hamstrung by it because it gives uncertainty for those who want to invest in great Australian companies.


Australia is a fantastic destination. It is a stable country. It is a good place to invest because it has a wealth of minerals. But this government is turning a good situation into a risky situation. It is sending out signals that Australia is a place that investors might have to beware of. However, the good news is that we have said we will reverse both the carbon tax and the mining tax. We are going to take them away.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (16:17):  I am a fan of the US e-zine Slate. John Dickerson had a piece in Slate a couple of weeks ago that I thought was pretty apposite to Australian politics at the moment. It was titled 'Is there any place for Jeb Bush in the GOP?' and it was about the radical shift to the Right of the US Republican Party. The author quoted Jeb Bush as saying, 'Ronald Reagan would have … a hard time in the Republican Party' today, and wrote about the fact that the modern US Republican Party has now moved from a party of small 'l' liberalism to being a party of conservatism and reaction, a party that is defined by its anti-tax rhetoric. Grover Norquist has asked for all Republican candidates to sign his anti-tax pledge. Mitt Romney, the frontrunner, has done so, and a moderate like Jeb Bush is left with no place to go.


Reading the piece I was struck by what has happened to the modern Liberal Party in Australia—a party that once stood for market values, that once stood for an open Australian economy, but that now increasingly stands against markets, whether they are markets in carbon or in water. It stands against an open economy, runs scare campaigns on foreign investment and spends its time trashing Australia's reputation in the world.


There is an old Liberal Party that valued the role of the Australian Public Service, that saw the Australian Public Service as having a proud role to play in building a better Australia. The Liberal Party of Menzies believed in the Public Service, but we have just heard from the member for Canning what the modern Liberal Party thinks of public servants. He thinks they are people who feed on others. That is what he just told the House, that Canberrans, public servants, are people who feed on others.




Mr Randall:
  They don't produce anything.




Dr LEIGH:
  They don't produce anything; they feed on others. Those Canberrans who are listening to the debate today should be aware that the spokesperson for the modern Liberal Party has the view of Canberrans and public servants that they feed on others.




Dr Mike Kelly:
  And Queanbeyans.




Dr LEIGH:
  And people from Queanbeyan, as the member for Eden-Monaro reminds me.




Mr Randall:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order on relevance: the title of this debate is the sovereign risk that this government has brought to the Australian resources industry, not the bureaucracy in Canberra. 




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  The member for Canning will resume his seat. This has been a very wide-ranging debate on both sides, I can assure you—I have been listening to the majority of it. The member for Fraser will be aware of the title of the matter of public importance, but he has the call.




Dr LEIGH:
  Thank you, Deputy Speaker. In understanding Australia's current context it is critical that we understand the role that public servants play in good policy. When the global financial crisis hit, it was the work of public servants in FaHCSIA, in Treasury, in Finance and in PM&C that put together the rescue package that saved 200,000 jobs and tens of thousands of small businesses. When Queensland was hit by natural disasters, it was public servants who went up there and made sure that people got payments. It was public servants that made sure that rebuilding work was done. But the coalition intends to cut 12,000 public servants. In fact, the shadow Treasurer has said that 12,000 public servants cut out of Canberra is the 'starting point', so it may well be a bigger cut than that.


I mentioned before that the Australian Liberal Party has taken a leaf from the Republican Party's playbook. It is libertarian Ron Paul who wants to cut 10 per cent of US public servants. The coalition say their starting point is seven per cent of Australian public servants. It was US presidential candidate Rick Perry who said he would get rid of three departments. The problem was he could not name them. Those opposite intend to get rid of three departments and at least they can name them—defence materiel, climate change and health—but of course they are just the start.


Those opposite are often called 'deer in headlights', but I think describing them as 'deer in headlights' when they are faced with economic questions is really unfair to deer. I think they are much more like fish out of water. You know that thing you do when the fish comes out of water—you drop it in the bottom of the tinny and it flips and flops and flips and flops around. We had the 2010 budget reply. Remember, that was a great budget reply, when the Leader of the Opposition was going to set out the savings that the coalition would achieve. He passed the buck over to the member for North Sydney who in turn said, 'Oh, no, I am not going to set out the savings. I am passing that to the member for Goldstein,' who then turned up to the National Press Club with a performance so embarrassing that even his own adviser was left at the back of the room shaking his head as the member flipped and flopped around. On the $70 billion black hole, some of those opposite will say: 'We do not know anything about that figure. It is the first we have heard of it.' Others will say, 'Yes, that is our savings target and what a big one to meet'—again, flipping and flopping everywhere. 


When the member for North Sydney said that Australian entitlements should be cut, that we should have a Hong Kong-style welfare state, the Leader of the Opposition was again flipping and flopping, saying: 'No, no, no, we do not believe in cutting benefits at all. I worship at the feet of BA Santamaria. I do not believe in cutting benefits—'




Mr Tudge:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order on relevance. The member has not mentioned sovereign risk once. He has been speaking now for 6½ minutes. We call on him to be relevant to the issue at hand.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Order! The member for Fraser is aware of the matter before the chair, but I remind both sides of the House that this has been an extremely wide-ranging debate and latitude has been exercised on both sides. I call the member for Fraser and remind him of the debate before the chair.




Dr LEIGH:
  Thank you, Deputy Speaker. If there is a sovereign risk to Australia it is those opposite talking down the Australian economy. It is those opposite who are willing to say anything and do anything to find their way into power. It is those opposite who are not willing to speak the truth about the Australian economy. There is something economists have called a 'misery index'. It is inflation plus unemployment. I find it hard to think of a time when the misery index has been as low as it is today—five per cent unemployment, less than two per cent inflation rate—and at the same time we have got a cash rate lower than at any other time when those opposite were in office.


There is only one member of those opposite who on economic questions does not look like a flopping fish out of water and that is the member for Wentworth. The problem is that when he sticks his head up to say things, as he did on the carbon price, for example, to make the point, his colleagues got a little uncomfortable. You will not find an economist anywhere that will tell you anything other than that the most efficient and effective way to cut emissions is by putting a price on carbon. When the member for Wentworth pops his head up to say things like that, of course, his colleagues get a little uncomfortable. 'Malcolm, come back down to the cool waters of populism,' they say, 'Come back down here. You do not look like a fish out of water up there, but really we would prefer that you came down here with the rest of the bottom feeders.'


Occasionally, young people will come to me and say that they are thinking about joining the Liberal-National Party. I say to them: that is fine, but let me tell you a bit of your legacy; let me tell you what it means to be a conservative. When Australia was threatened in World War II, it was a Labor government that brought our troops home to defend our shores, and conservatives who thought we should defend the Empire. When gender discrimination reared its ugly head it was a Labor government that proposed the Sex Discrimination Act; it was the conservatives who said no. In a nation built on Indigenous lands, it was a Labor government who brought about historic native title—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member for Fraser has had a lot of latitude and I will refer him to the matter before the House. He can confine his remarks to the matter before the House. He has had a lot of latitude, I can assure you. The matter is about sovereign risk.




Dr LEIGH:
  Thank you, Deputy Speaker. The sovereign risk that Australia faces is the sovereign risk of threats to economic confidence that come from those opposite running scare campaigns across the country. Barnaby Joyce says that a carbon price will raise the cost of a leg of lamb to $100. I say: pull the other leg of lamb, Barnaby!

Mrs ANDREWS
 (McPherson) (16:27):  Let me start with the words 'sovereign risk'. For the last 10 minutes we did not hear those words very often from the member for Fraser and they are the words inherent in today's MPI. Let me add to them the words 'Labor government'—so 'sovereign risk, Labor government'—because they go together. They are words that we are getting very used to hearing, and it is very sad that because of the Labor government Australia is in very dire circumstances, circumstances that it does not need to be in and that it should not be in. Sovereign risk in Australia is now here courtesy of an incompetent Labor government, one that should be removed.


There is a very long list of bad decisions by this Labor government and it is headlined by the world's biggest carbon tax, a toxic tax on working families and on household budgets. This government should be ashamed that it has failed to support our working families. It has further increased the cost of living here in Australia and put significantly more pressure on our working families and, particularly, on our businesses. 


Labor is trying to convince Australians that the carbon tax will be a great initiative for our country. In fact it was only earlier today that the Acting Prime Minister said that the government was proud to introduce a price on carbon. Is the government also proud to say to the Australian people that they are proud of reneging on the promise that they made before the last election not to introduce a carbon tax? Does that make the government proud? Does that make every Labor member in the House of Representatives who was elected on the promise not to introduce a carbon tax feel proud? Will each member feel proud when they face their constituents at the next election knowing that they did not honour their commitments the last time they were elected? Will they feel proud then? I doubt it and they should not.


The government keeps reiterating that this carbon tax will only apply to the top 500 polluters, but it has not been able to identify who they are.

"Ramsey, Rowan, MP",LP,2012-06-21,"



Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey) (16:30):  Last week I visited one of my northern towns, Coober Pedy. It pains me to once again have to bring to the attention of the House the price of electricity in Coober Pedy. Last July in this place I moved a motion condemning the Rann Labor government for its $1 million reduction in the electricity subsidy for 13 regional remote communities. In fact, it is no longer the Rann government. Mike Rann was dusted off by some union officials—that has a familiar ring to it in this place. The motion condemning the government for its reduction in subsidies was passed without dissent.


Coober Pedy has what we call 'off-grid electricity'. All other states support their regional communities in the generation of off-grid electricity but the South Australian government has vacated that space. To that end, it announced last year a reduction in the subsidy, which was going to lead to an increase in power prices of over 100 per cent. There was public outcry and my motion was passed in this parliament. Instead the government implemented a three-year scheme with the price going up each year. Here we are in year 2 and the carbon tax has been added to the result. The result is an increase of a further 30 per cent—




Mr Hartsuyker:
  How much?




Mr RAMSEY:
  Thirty per cent.




Mr Hartsuyker:
  Shame!




Mr RAMSEY:
 The result is an increase of another 30 per cent in the price of electricity for commercial users in the township of Coober Pedy. The commercial tariffs will be 124 per cent higher than for on-grid users—and there are more increases to come.


Coober Pedy is an opal mining town and a tourist icon. There is nothing like it in the world. For those who have not seen it, it is a fantastic destination. It has underground accommodation—from extensive award-winning underground backpacker accommodation right through to four-star luxury hotel rooms. You can experience the working mines, and fabulous opals are available at the numerous gem shops in the town. There is the landscape of one million holes, the stunning beauty of the Breakaways and the wild west atmosphere of the town. But Coober Pedy has to compete with every other tourist destination in Australia—places like Longreach, Broome, or, in my electorate, Port Lincoln and Edithburgh—and they have to operate with a 124 per cent penalty tied around their leg. When tourists come into businesses in Coober Pedy they say, 'Great place but it's incredibly dear!' That is the news that goes up and down the caravan parks of Australia and it is causing great pain for the community.


Until 2002 the government used to run the generators in Coober Pedy, and then they basically held a gun at the local council's head and said, 'You'll have to run them.' So they handed them over a bunch of what were, it must be said, very well used generators. Eventually the council had to replace the generators—and that was expensive enough—and then of course the government pulled the subsidy. But the percentage of the subsidy they still receive comes with the caveat that householders will not pay more than 10 per cent above the grid price for the rest of the state. Consequently, the council has no choice but to pass on the ever-increasing cost to the business community. That is why we are left with the 124 per cent.


I said in this place last year that providing a higher cost environment will cost business and it will cost jobs. Like a carbon tax, a higher electricity price must cascade through the whole economy. If a worker cannot afford to live in communities like Marree, Oodnadatta or Coober Pedy, why would they stay when the rest of Australia beckons? So these prices are passed on through the local businesses, through the local IGA, but the workers who are sent there in government jobs—teachers and policeman—are expected to get by on the normal wage. In fact, much of Coober Pedy's population are remote Indigenous people who live on welfare payments. The electricity prices, while they are only paying 10 per cent above the state average, are actually feeding down through all these other goods in the community.


This comes on the back of the state government and now also the federal government continuing to take from regional Australia but not being prepared to put back. The latest take from regional Australia is of course the mining tax. They are very happy to receive the receipts but they are not always so happy to support those communities that are actually providing the outcomes.

Mr TUDGE
 (Aston) (09:30):  I would like to pay tribute to a man whom we are losing from the Knox community, the Reverend David Devine. For the last 15 years, Reverend Devine has been the pastor at the Rowville Baptist Church. Last Sunday, however, he announced that he would be stepping down from this role and taking up a position with the Baptist Union of Victoria as head of church health and capacity building. This is a great gain for the Baptist Church generally but a loss for our community. Reverend Devine has made a remarkable contribution to our local community in Knox. He has touched the lives of hundreds if not thousands of individuals over the years and provided spiritual guidance, love and pastoral support. I have had the opportunity to attend a church service of his and witness his talents in preaching. In the great Baptist tradition, he is able to take single verses of the scriptures, delve into them and explain very clearly their significance and enduring relevance for us today. But what I have found additionally impressive about Reverend Devine is his willingness to engage in the broader public discussions in our community and get involved in community activities at large in a very practical way. I think the best church leaders are able to do this, to transcend their individual parish and provide broader community leadership. Reverend Devine has done this as well as any church leader that I know.


He has been involved in community discussions relating to foreign aid, Indigenous affairs, the need for better public transport, the requirement for church based schools to employ teachers of their own religion, mental health issues and poverty more generally. He has also been active in bringing other churches and community organisations together towards single causes, most notably the Knox Christmas Appeal, which supports those less fortunate in our community. He is a member of the Outer Eastern Prayer Breakfast Committee, which brings the broader Christian and business communities together in our local area. He has been on council committees and all sorts of other committees and activities—and I could go on. As one local resident put it to me, he is simply everywhere. I have got to know Reverend Devine particularly well over the last few years since becoming the member for Aston. I have valued his friendship enormously and his quiet advice, guidance and encouragement. He is a humble, decent man. I will miss him personally. I know his parish will miss him very deeply, and our community will miss a great man who has been a tremendous leader in the very best Christian tradition. We thank Reverend Devine for his service to God and to our community, and I know that that service will continue in his new role.

Mr ROBERT
 (Fadden) (10:01):  I am pleased to rise in the House to support this piece of legislation that is a direct result of the private member's bill put forward by the Leader of the Opposition some time ago. I understand that there will be some amendments being raised at a later juncture concerning the bill. 


The intent of the bill is designed to support Australia victims of overseas terrorist acts. These are people who suffer because they have been deliberately targeted by terrorist groups by virtue of being Australians or indeed for simply being Westerners. Over 300 Australians have lost their lives in the past decades to a range of acts of violence, which includes terrorism in New York and Washington; Bali; London; Jakarta; and Mumbai.


Whilst there is no universally agreed definition of terrorism, most definitions ascribe a terrorist act as an attack that causes harm when the attack is made with the intent of advancing a political, religious or ideological cause. By way of background, the word terror comes from the Latin word 'terror' meaning to frighten. This was exactly what happened when the perpetrators of the 2002 and 2005 Bali bombings had in mind when they killed 202 in the first Bali bombing, including 88 Australians. It was the deadliest act of terrorism in the history of Indonesia. A further 240 people were injured in subsequent attacks. 


It is a tragic reality that Australians are sometimes specifically targeted in overseas terrorist attacks. With news that substantial kinetic activity has occurred against the likes of the No. 2 in al-Qaeda and the No. 1, Osama bin Laden. While that can bring some small comfort—and indeed upon the death of Osama bin Laden, Paul Anicich, who is a survivor of the 2005 Bali attacks said, ' I don't feel joyous about it but I am pleased it has eventuated'. There is hope that news of this does bring a sense of justice to families of the victims of the atrocities carried out by terrorist organisations across the world.


A decade on from the terrible tragedy of 9/11 with the end of bin Laden and some of the terrorist ilk like him, we need to seize unique opportunities not just to continue to destroy terrorism where we find it but to wipe out its hateful ideology and all that causes that ideology to grow. We also need to address the fact that many people live with the consequences of the actions of terrorist strikes. 


This bill is a direct result of the important work done by the Leader of Opposition, Hon Tony Abbott and his private member's bill assisting the victims of overseas terrorism. The Opposition Leader's private member's bill was aimed to provide additional financial support of up to $75,000 to Australians affected by terrorism while they were overseas.


The government's bill adopts the same approach and will institute a mechanism through the social security system called the Australian Victim of Terrorism Overseas Payment. The payment will provide up to $75,000 for individuals who are injured or to a close family member of a person killed as a result of a terrorist act committed overseas. The payments are similar to those available under the state victim of crime compensation legislation. As noted in the explanatory memorandum, in particular the bill will enable Australians who are victims of declared overseas terrorist instances to claim financial support of up to $75,000. It will enable the Prime Minister to declare that a relevant overseas terrorist incident is one to which the scheme applies. It will establish eligibility criteria. It will ensure that victims are not required to repay or deduct Medicare or other benefits and payments and enable the enactment of legislative instruments to provide further guidance on the amount of assistance to subsequent victims or close family members.


While these measures will never ease the pain of losing a loved one or erase the memory of terror for victims, they will go some way to providing real and tangible support. We can agree that this bill is one that is based on great human compassion for those victims and those families who have suffered the most hateful of crimes—a crime that is directed to seek to kill them simply because of their nationality or the colour of their skin. This is about providing support to fellow Australians who, through no fault of their own, have suffered at the hand of merciless individuals and organisations who are so filled with either religious ideology, hate, anti-imperialism or anti-Western sentiments that they simply desire to seek out and destroy.


Terrorism is a crime that is devastating, not only to victims directly attacked but also to families. It is devastating to nations that have to bear the brunt of those assaults. The coalition supports the right of Australians to travel abroad freely, free of the risk of violence and attack. We as a parliament are determined that terrorism will not affect how we go about our lives. Terrorists seek to change policy through violence. We will never give in to terrorist attacks, terrorist assaults or terrorist threats.


I again acknowledge and thank the Leader of the Opposition, the Hon. Tony Abbott, for his foresight, his compassion and his work in relation to this important matter and his work with the government to achieve the realisation of the bill. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr VASTA
 (Bonner) (12:31):  You will remember that a couple of weeks ago I spoke in this chamber about one of the biggest issues that adversely affects my electorate—that is, the lack of fast, reliable and affordable broadband. Specifically, I drew to the attention of this House the inequity of Labor's current NBN rollout schedule, which would see Bonner receive an insulting 10 per cent of the electorate scheduled to commence work within the next three years, with the remaining 90 per cent having no schedule at all. I remind the House that this inequity is drastically highlighted by the fact that the neighbouring Labor electorates of Griffith, Moreton and Rankin have from 75 per cent to 90 per cent of their work scheduled to commence within three years. Needless to say, the residents of Bonner are furious. They justifiably feel let down by this Labor government yet again. As part of my continued fight for broadband services for my constituents, I spoke to my colleague Malcolm Turnbull, shadow minister for broadband and communications, about my concerns. He kindly offered to come and speak to the people of Bonner about the situation and to answer any questions that they may have.


Last week, over 200 local residents attended the Bonner broadband and communication forum at the Carindale PCYC. Countless questions were put to Mr Turnbull about the NBN and the coalition's future communications plan. It soon became obvious that part of the problem with the NBN's three-year rollout program is that it does not outline when people will actually receive services. People have no idea where they stand and when and if they will receive any benefit from the program at all. The reason for this is that the NBN has continually shifted the goalposts in the statistics they report, from telling when they will have an active service to telling people when the construction will begin in their area. The shadow minister highlighted the two main problems with the rollout schedule: firstly, that Labor failed to prioritise those areas with poor broadband, such as suburbs like Wakerley, Manly West, Gumdale, Ransome and Mansfield, to name just a few; and, secondly, that Labor have chosen the most expensive and time-consuming means of delivering upgrades.


Most present felt that it was not good enough and many were just plain fed up. They want to know where they stand. I once again call on the Labor government to provide the Bonner constituents with up-to-date and accurate information regarding when and if they will receive the NBN to their suburb. I want to thank Mr Turnbull for caring for the people of Bonner. They deserve to have the broadband services that they require. I also want to thank Sergeant David Beard, who kindly assisted us with the outstanding community facility at the Carindale PCYC. This month Bonner was also fortunate to have a visit from the shadow minister for seniors, the Hon. Bronwyn Bishop. In that role, Bronwyn Bishop has travelled the country and in the last 12 months she has visited 33 electorates, spoken at 54 forums and reached over 8,500 senior Australians. She reached more than 200 seniors when she conducted a forum at the Belmont Services Club. There was no doubt that people came to see Bronwyn Bishop in person not to just hear what she had to say but because they wanted to meet her face to face. It became obvious that there is such a high interest in the electorate because senior citizens have been let down by what the Gillard government has been doing through their mismanagement of the economy, including the introduction of a carbon tax which will reach into each and every nook and cranny of their lives and, most recently, the introduction of means testing for the private health insurance rebate. Story after story showed that this government is hurting senior Australians most as they cannot afford these continuing downward pressures on their fixed incomes. It is best to conclude with a statement about Mrs Bishop made to me at the forum by one of my constituents. He said, 'Isn't she wonderful'. I think both sides of this House will agree with the statement.
