Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Leader of the House and Minister for Education) (09:01)


I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.




Introduction



Today I introduce the Higher Education and Research Reform Amendment Bill 2014.


The reform bill gives effect to some of the greatest higher education and research reforms of our time.


The reform bill will spread opportunity to more students, including disadvantaged and rural and regional students, equip Australian universities to face the challenges of the 21st century and ensure Australia is not left behind by intensifying global competition and new technologies.


The passage of the reform bill will enable Australia to achieve the best higher education system in the world and have some of the best universities in the world.


We live in a time of constant change. The international economy is evolving, the employment market is shifting and tomorrow's jobs demand different skills to the jobs of today.


Currently our universities are at risk of being left behind and overtaken by the growing university systems in our region and across the globe as these systems increase their capacity and new forms of online and blended delivery take hold.


We must aspire to not only keep up with our competitors, but keep ahead of them.


The government's changes will give Australian universities the freedom and autonomy to work to their strengths, be internationally competitive and manage economic and social changes to the best of their abilities.


Students will benefit most. They will enjoy improved teaching and learning in innovative and creative courses that compete for their interests. They will be able to choose from a wider range of options and will have better information to help them make decisions about where, how and what to study.


In addition to increased international competition and a rapidly changing environment, the nation faces significant challenges in higher education and research that were not addressed by the previous government. These challenges include budget deficits and ballooning debt, and funding cliffs for essential research fellowships and research infrastructure.


The reform bill meets those challenges head-on in ways that are fair to both students and taxpayers.


Universities Australia, the body representing all university vice-chancellors, fully supports the need to deregulate and free up higher education in Australia. Deregulation is the only way to respond to what students and employers want. It is the only way to set our universities free to ensure they can deliver what we need. It is the only way to ensure Australia is not left behind. It is a one-off opportunity.



If we do not act, and act now, we risk Australia's higher education system falling into a downward spiral towards mediocrity. Universities Australia made this abundantly clear prior to the budget with its Keep It Clever campaign. We must not be left behind.



Fortunately, we won
'
t be. With the passage of the reform bill, we will have the right conditions to transform the Australian higher education system and give it the freedom to be the best in the world.


Australian Technology Network Executive Director Vicki Thomson has said:


 … to reject the [deregulation] legislation out of hand … would be to sign the death warrant on a globally respected higher education system.


The Vice-Chancellor of the Australian National University, Professor Ian Young, said at the National Press Club regarding the Government's higher education reforms:


… it would be a great tragedy for our nation, for our universities, for our future generations, if our Senators passed up this opportunity.




Spreading opportunities to students



This is not only about quality; it is about opportunity. This bill will see an additional 80 000 higher education students per year supported by government subsidies by 2018. These students will include more people from disadvantaged backgrounds, more students from rural and regional communities, Australians who require extra support to succeed at university and workers whose skills need to be updated.


Regional students and regional higher education institutions will benefit significantly as we expand the demand driven system to enable study in more places in more ways.


Universities, TAFEs and private providers will have new incentives and opportunities to develop innovative partnerships, particularly in outer‑metropolitan and regional areas, where they can work together to offer the skills and knowledge that local employers want in their employees.


Many regional institutions have warmly welcomed this opportunity. They are frustrated by the restrictions which prevent them from developing creative solutions that directly meet the needs of their communities and prevent them from marketing unique learning experiences to those who live in cities. They see the potential in these changes, including to market opportunities to study in the fields in which they teach especially well.


There have already been some moves in this direction—last year the University of Ballarat and what was previously Monash University's Gippsland campus joined to create the Federation University Australia, providing greater educational opportunities to the communities of regional Victoria.


This bill reflects the change in the name of the University of Ballarat to Federation University Australia.


The government's reforms will give institutions greater freedom to explore these kinds of opportunities while strengthening the service they offer to their communities.


Through these reforms students who choose to study higher education diplomas, advanced diplomas and associate degrees in their own right or as a pathway to university will be supported.


Students studying for higher education undergraduate qualifications at TAFEs, private universities and private higher education institutions will be supported.


Students who come from low-socioeconomic backgrounds—many who are first-generation university students—will be big winners from this extended support. We anticipate the nation will see improved success rates and reduced dropout rates for undergraduates.


This bill provides a level playing field for students, no matter what their study choices are. It removes the punitive loan fee of 20 per cent for VET FEE-HELP—helping tens of thousands of Australians undertaking VET courses—and gets rid of the 25 per cent loan fee for FEE-HELP for those who study with private institutions. It removes the lifetime limits on all Higher Education Loan Program (HELP) schemes and discontinues the ineffective HECS-HELP benefit.


In addition, this bill allows certain New Zealand special category visa holders to access the HELP scheme. This will assist a small number of New Zealand citizens who moved to Australia as children and deserve to be treated in the same way as Australian students to undertake higher education.




Equity and access



To support equity and access for Australian students, the reform bill also introduces a new Commonwealth scholarship scheme to support students from disadvantaged backgrounds, including from regional Australia. This is one of the most important and valuable elements of the reform package in the legislation. Higher education institutions with a Commonwealth supported equivalent full-time student load of 500 or more will be required to allocate one dollar in every five of additional revenue to this new scheme.


With this investment, institutions will be able to provide tailored, individualised support to help disadvantaged students, including help with costs of living while they study, something regional students and families will especially welcome. The scholarships will also be able to cover fee exemptions and mentoring, tutorial support and even relocation expenses.


The Commonwealth scholarship scheme will be complemented by the Higher Education Participation Program, which provides funding, irrespective of fee revenue, to allow universities to conduct outreach activities and undertake initiatives to support disadvantaged students.




Student support



There has been much debate about the measures in the reform bill to improve the sustainability of the higher education system and the HELP scheme in particular. It is worth remembering how much support the taxpayer provides to higher education students.


Most university students occupy a Commonwealth supported place. The taxpayer subsidises the fees that these students pay to the tune of 60 per cent, on average—students pay around 40 per cent, on average.


And that is not the full extent of the taxpayer's contribution.


Most students take out a HELP loan so they do not have to pay for their share of the tuition fees up-front. The government—the taxpayer—pays the institution the student's contribution up-front, on their behalf.


The student does not have to pay a cent back for their education until they are earning more than $50 000. In years when they are not earning this amount, they do not need to make any payments.


The student might also receive income support—youth allowance or Austudy—while they are studying.


We want a system that embodies the idea of a fair go—where there are no financial barriers to participating in higher education. We want all Australians who have the ability and the ambition to participate in higher education—this will help create a strong, vibrant economy and assure our future standard of living.


But running such a high level of support comes at a cost. In 2014:


The cost of subsidising degrees is more than $6 billion.


The value of HELP loans is more than $5 billion.


Student income support for higher education is more than $2 billion.


The amount of funding the government provides through HELP loans is going to double over the next few years. In 2017 we will be lending students $10 billion.


In a deficit environment the government needs to borrow the money that it lends to students. Because the government currently lends to students at less than it costs the government to borrow the money, there is an additional subsidy from taxpayer to student. Given the scale of costs now present in the higher education system, it is time that students picked up a fairer share of the tab for these interest charges. This is why we are changing the indexation rate for HELP debts from the consumer price index to the Treasury bond rate (safety capped at six per cent).


Most people would agree that HELP is the best loan you would get in your life—for the best investment that most people will ever make in themselves.


It is a good deal. It is the best deal an Australian will ever get. Australian university graduates on average earn up to 75 per cent more than those who do not go on to higher education after secondary school. Over their lifetime graduates may earn around $1 million more than if they had not studied at university. It is only fair that they pay a reasonable share of what it costs the taxpayer.


For students who were enrolled as Commonwealth supported students on the day of the budget, existing arrangements for Commonwealth and student contributions will apply until they complete their study, or the end of 2020—whichever comes first. This includes those who had commenced a course, or deferred commencement, or accepted an offer of a Commonwealth supported place on or before 13 May 2014.


From January 2016, with new levels of funding for Commonwealth supported places and with the commencement of deregulation of the higher education system, new university students will go on to contribute, on average, around 50 per cent of the cost of their higher education, up from 40 per cent. But only when they earn enough to cover it.




Equipping universities for change



In a competitive global economy we need to make sure Australian higher education keeps pace with the best in the world. And currently, as warned by Universities Australia, Australia's universities risk falling behind.


The Shanghai Jiao Tong index released a few weeks ago lists eight Australian universities in the world's elite 200. Universities in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and Singapore are rising strongly through the ranks. Five years ago there were no Chinese universities in the top 200, now there are six in just five years.


We need a relentless focus on the quality and impact of our higher education system. 


We need to ensure Australian higher education institutions do not stand still. 


The reform bill gives higher education institutions the freedom and the confidence to face the future and be the best that they can be. 


The reform bill will allow Australian higher education institutions to choose what courses they offer, what fees they should charge, which students they want to attract, what teaching methods they should use, what scholarships they provide and what other support services they give. 




International education



The new freedom for universities outlined in this legislation will position our universities to attract the best and brightest students from around the world. We have done well so far, but this is not something we can take for granted. International students bring different views and cultures that enhance our nation's knowledge and skills. They contribute to Australia's education export industry, which is earning around $15 billion per year—our third-largest export industry. 


International students also impact on local economies. They shop in our corner stores, travel to our towns and cities, spread the word about Australia to their friends and families, and buy our goods while they are here. The former government took all that for granted, and so wiped $4 billion off our export income, which hit our economy and our universities hard. We cannot let that happen again.




Competition and better information 



Quality is everything – for our students, for our institutions and for our international competitiveness. Students must know their qualifications will lead to a job. To assist students to make informed choices about where and what they study, new information will be provided through the quality indicators for learning and teaching—known as QILT—detailing the performance of each private and public higher education institution. 


Students and their families will be able to access this real and vital information about the quality of courses and institutions they are considering. There will be better information about previous graduates' success at finding jobs and what other students and employers think of the course they are planning to do. 


This information will also help Australian institutions compare their performance with other nations, and continually improve. 




Research



The government's broader changes to higher education and research will safeguard a strong, competitive research system. 


World-class research requires high-quality facilities and talented researchers. Yet the previous government left us in a state where there was not a single dollar set aside for the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy beyond 30 June next year. Nothing.


There was no provision for any new awards for the Future Fellowships program that supports mid-career researchers to undertake world-class research in Australia. Not a cent.


As part of the higher education reform package, the government will invest $11 billion over four years in research in Australian universities, including $139 million for the Future Fellowships scheme and $150 million in 2015-16 to continue the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy. Labor abandoned both.


The reform bill amends the Australian Research Council Act 2001 to index annual appropriations to increase funding for the Australian Research Council, and to apply a one-off efficiency dividend. We are providing for 100 four-year future fellowships each year, and making this an ongoing program.


The government's commitment to ARC funding for future fellowships, where the previous government left a funding cliff, means that ARC funding is increased by this legislation well above what was proposed by the previous government in forward estimates. Funding for future fellowships and for the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy are integral parts of the government's higher education reform package, and depend on the passage of this legislation.


The reform bill will also allow universities, if they wish, to require Research Training Scheme (RTS) students to make a small contribution to the cost of undertaking a higher degree by research course. The government will expand HELP to allow eligible RTS students to defer paying their contribution until they are earning a decent wage.




Indexation



The reform bill will support the government-wide decision to streamline and simplify indexation for programs. The Consumer Price Index will be applied to payments administered under the Higher Education Support Act 2003.




Consultation 



The reform bill is the result of extensive national discussion and consultation before and after the government announced its higher education and research reform package. 


There has been widespread debate in Australia over many years about the kinds of reforms that are necessary both to expand opportunity for students and to ensure that we are not left behind internationally.


The government's reforms as presented in this bill respond to the findings of the Review of the demand driven funding system by the Hon. Dr David Kemp, a former minister for education, and Mr Andrew Norton, which received over 80 submissions. The legislation also addresses issues raised in submissions from universities, their peak bodies and non-university higher education providers to the National Commission of Audit.


Since the budget, we have undertaken extensive further consultation with stakeholders, including through the Legislation and Financing Working Group chaired by the Vice-Chancellor of La Trobe University, Professor John Dewar, and the Quality, Deregulation and Information Working Group, chaired by the Chancellor of the University of Western Sydney, Professor Peter Shergold. 


Consultations have taken place with all vice-chancellors, all universities groupings and all non-aligned universities. There have also been meetings with non-university higher education institutions and students. 


The government has listened to views from across the community and is confident that this is a fair, balanced and necessary package of reforms.




Conclusion



The passage of the reform bill will spread access and opportunity to higher education to more Australians, including disadvantaged and rural and regional students.


The passage of the reform bill will equip Australian universities to play to their strengths and face the challenges of the 21st century.


The passage of the reform bill will ensure Australia is not left behind by intensifying global competition and new technologies. 


The passage of the reform bill can enable Australia to have the best higher education system in the world with some of the best universities in the world that are magnets for students everywhere. 


The reform bill is essential for the future prosperity of our nation. 


I commend the bill to the House.

Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (09:23):  Firstly, I would like to thank those members who have contributed to this debate. The Corporations Amendment (Streamlining of Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2014 amends the Future of Financial Advice legislation, also known as FoFA, to reduce unnecessary regulatory burden, provide more certainty and make advice more affordable whilst maintaining FoFA's key consumer protections. The amendments implement the improvements to FoFA which we took to the last election. There has been a lot of scaremongering and misinformation about the government's improvements to FoFA. The amendments will restore the balance between appropriate levels of consumer protection and access to affordable high-quality financial advice. The bill will not weaken the consumer protections currently provided under FoFA. Rather, the amendments add certainty to industry and consumers alike and make financial advice more affordable for all Australians. Brad Cooper, CEO of BT Financial Group, notes the amendments are: 


… striking the right balance between consumer protection and a practical way for our customers to get the information they want.


The concern raised by some is that the amendments will remove the best interests duty. This is not correct. Let me make it clear: the bill does not remove the best interests duty. The duty remains. Rather, as a result of the changes in the bill, consumers and financial advisers will now have certainty about the obligations that financial advisers have to act in the best interests of their clients. These changes have been welcomed by industry. John Brogden, CEO of the Financial Services Council, noted that the amendments:


… do not reduce in any way a financial adviser’s legal requirement to act in the best interest of their clients.


Another concern that has been expressed is that the amendments will allow the return of commission payments. Again, this is not the case. The ban on conflicted remuneration for benefits received in relation to personal advice will remain. There is a targeted general advice provision which explicitly indicates that payments commonly referred to as commissions are not permitted. Steven Munchenberg, CEO of the Australian Bankers' Association, notes:


It is a sensible balance and will ensure that banks can continue to provide free, simple and general advice.


In addition, clients will continue to receive information about the fees they are paying including the disclosure statements for clients who entered into arrangements post 1 July 2013. As Brad Fox, CEO of the Association of Financial Advisers, explains:


These sensible amendments … eliminate unnecessary red tape and costs and will help thousands more Australians receive the benefits of life-changing financial advice backed by the safety-net of strong regulation that enforces client best interests.


The bill delivers on the government's election commitment to reduce the regulatory burden on the financial services industry and contributes to the government's broader deregulatory agenda. Amendments will also be tabled to the bill to amend the statement of advice requirements to increase transparency in the services that clients receive, ensuring that they are aware of their rights and their advisors' obligations. These amendments implement the additional improvements agreed with the Palmer United Party and the Australian Motoring Enthusiasts Party. I commend the bill to the House.



The SPEAKER:  The question is that this bill be now read a second time.


Bill read a second time.

Statements of Advice



(1) The amendments made by items 1A to 1J of Schedule 1 to the Corporations Amendment (Streamlining of Future of Financial Advice) Act 2014, to the extent that they relate to Statements of Advice, apply in relation to Statements of Advice given on or after the later of:


   (a) the commencement day; and


   (b) 1 January 2015.


(2) The amendment made by item 1A of Schedule 1 to the Corporations Amendment (Streamlining of Future of Financial Advice) Act 2014, to the extent that it relates to instructions for further or varied advice, applies in relation to instructions given on or after the later of:


   (a) the commencement day; and


   (b) 1 January 2015.


Today I move amendments to better target the measures in the bill. Following the referral of the bill to the Senate Economics Committee, the government conducted additional consultation on its changes to the Future of Financial Advice provisions. The amendments I move today have been informed by this further round of consultation and the inquiry into the bill undertaken by the Senate Economics Committee. 


The amendments to the bill work to further clarify the operation of FoFA and better target the measures proposed by the bill. Further, the bill also amends the statement of advice requirements to implement the additional improvements agreed with the Palmer United Party and the Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party. The first and seventh amendments make a number of changes to the statement of advice requirements to ensure clients are aware of their rights and their adviser's obligations in providing advice in their best interests. The amendments require the statement of advice to be signed by both the adviser and the client, and require any instructions from clients for further or varied advice be signed by the client and acknowledged by the adviser.


The second amendment makes a change to the definition of a 'basic banking product' to ensure products functionally equivalent to those already listed in the definition or products that may not always be related to a basic banking product are included in the definition. The third amendment extends the time period that advisers are required to send a fee disclosure statement to a client in an ongoing fee arrangement from 30 to 60 days after the client's anniversary date. This will ensure the fee disclosure requirements are flexible and adaptable to different practices in the industry.


Amendment (4) makes two key changes. First, it amends the provision that allows benefits to be paid in relation to execution-only services to ensure that the benefit can only be given if financial product advice, as opposed to personal advice, has not been given to the retail client in the previous 12 months by the person receiving the benefit. Second, amendment (4) makes changes to better target the general advice provision and make it clear that commissions are banned under FoFA. The government has supported the ban on commissions and conflicted remuneration for financial advisers since it was first legislated. At no point has the government sought to reintroduce commissions or conflicted remuneration for financial advisers.


Amendments (5) and (6), and amendment (4) in part, put in place regulation-making powers that may prescribe circumstances in which all or part of a benefit is to be treated as conflicted remuneration. That is, if—contrary to our clear expectation and our intention not to bring back conflicted remuneration—developments in the market want our intervention, we could and would address this issue very quickly through regulations. We do not believe that this will be necessary. Amendments (4), (5) and (6) put absolutely beyond doubt how serious the government is about not permitting commissions.

Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (09:23):  Firstly, I would like to thank those members who have contributed to this debate. The Corporations Amendment (Streamlining of Future of Financial Advice) Bill 2014 amends the Future of Financial Advice legislation, also known as FoFA, to reduce unnecessary regulatory burden, provide more certainty and make advice more affordable whilst maintaining FoFA's key consumer protections. The amendments implement the improvements to FoFA which we took to the last election. There has been a lot of scaremongering and misinformation about the government's improvements to FoFA. The amendments will restore the balance between appropriate levels of consumer protection and access to affordable high-quality financial advice. The bill will not weaken the consumer protections currently provided under FoFA. Rather, the amendments add certainty to industry and consumers alike and make financial advice more affordable for all Australians. Brad Cooper, CEO of BT Financial Group, notes the amendments are: 


… striking the right balance between consumer protection and a practical way for our customers to get the information they want.


The concern raised by some is that the amendments will remove the best interests duty. This is not correct. Let me make it clear: the bill does not remove the best interests duty. The duty remains. Rather, as a result of the changes in the bill, consumers and financial advisers will now have certainty about the obligations that financial advisers have to act in the best interests of their clients. These changes have been welcomed by industry. John Brogden, CEO of the Financial Services Council, noted that the amendments:


… do not reduce in any way a financial adviser’s legal requirement to act in the best interest of their clients.


Another concern that has been expressed is that the amendments will allow the return of commission payments. Again, this is not the case. The ban on conflicted remuneration for benefits received in relation to personal advice will remain. There is a targeted general advice provision which explicitly indicates that payments commonly referred to as commissions are not permitted. Steven Munchenberg, CEO of the Australian Bankers' Association, notes:


It is a sensible balance and will ensure that banks can continue to provide free, simple and general advice.


In addition, clients will continue to receive information about the fees they are paying including the disclosure statements for clients who entered into arrangements post 1 July 2013. As Brad Fox, CEO of the Association of Financial Advisers, explains:


These sensible amendments … eliminate unnecessary red tape and costs and will help thousands more Australians receive the benefits of life-changing financial advice backed by the safety-net of strong regulation that enforces client best interests.


The bill delivers on the government's election commitment to reduce the regulatory burden on the financial services industry and contributes to the government's broader deregulatory agenda. Amendments will also be tabled to the bill to amend the statement of advice requirements to increase transparency in the services that clients receive, ensuring that they are aware of their rights and their advisors' obligations. These amendments implement the additional improvements agreed with the Palmer United Party and the Australian Motoring Enthusiasts Party. I commend the bill to the House.



The SPEAKER:  The question is that this bill be now read a second time.

Ms RYAN
 (Lalor—Opposition Whip) (13:30):  There will be no surprise today that I rise to speak about higher education. Before the election this government promised no cuts to education. The higher education bill introduced today confirms that this government has introduced cuts to every level of education, from child care through to postgraduate study. The Minister for Education introduced into the House today legislation that will negatively change the face of higher education in this country. He did this in the wake of a budget that acts to entrench inequity at all levels of education. He did this while the government ushers in draconian cuts to Newstart eligibility, apprenticeship support programs and supported access to TAFE programs. He did this while those opposite scream at our young people, 'You must earn or learn!'


Today's legislation closes the loop on access to equity in education and makes the ability of young people in this country to meet that demand so much harder. The changes again hit low- and middle-income families and risk locking young people from my community out of university. In Lalor, people of all ages want to talk about this unfair change. Families are seriously looking at their options to assess if university is possible for their children, and meanwhile the minister cruelly quips that he is not asking for their left kidney. This is an outrageous move by this minister. It includes a 20 per cent cut to university funding and will see fees rise and students burdened. My question to the prime minister is simple: why is some debt bad but student debt good? (Time expired)

"Shorten, Bill, MP",ALP,2014-08-28,"



Mr SHORTEN
 (Maribyrnong—Leader of the Opposition) (15:15):  It was a year ago today that the Prime Minister, the then opposition leader, visited Rooty Hill and he made a promise to Australians—what will go down as one of the most outrageous and egregious lies in Australian political history—where he said, 'No cuts to health, no cuts to education, no cuts or changes to pensions.' 


A year on we know and, more importantly, Australians know that the leader of the Liberal Party misled Australians at the last election. The Prime Minister got up here in high dudgeon in question time, outraged, and he said, 'Stop going around, Opposition, and scaring Australians.' We do not scare Australians; we tell them the truth of their unfair budget. And the budget scares Australians.


Then I listened to that blowhard of Australian politics, the puffed-up Treasurer, saying, 'Everything we do is good for Australia.' Oh no, it isn't, Treasurer, not by a long shot. To remind the people of Australia, because this mob sitting opposite us have stopped listening to people a long time ago, the government have in the last 12 months broken promise after promise. They have a pathology for breaking promises and the victims of their broken promises are legion. They talk about taking the pressure off the cost of living, so then they cut child care, family support and increase the cost of petrol. Of course Tony Abbott is all against putting a price on carbon in Australia, but he is sitting down with President Obama, saying, 'Oh yes, Mr President, we've got a carbon tax, because we are putting up the price of petrol.' 


The government said there will be no new and increased taxes. There is the GP tax and the higher cost of medicine. They say they do not want to cut health. But $50 billion has gone from health. No cuts to education, they say. No-one believes them. We see $30 billion gone, $1 billion from schools and $5 billion from universities. Look at this self-satisfied mob opposite me. They think that if they repeat the lie long enough, people will believe them. Do not underestimate the wit and wisdom of the Australian people. They will certainly remember your lies at the time of accounting.


The coalition talk about jobs. They say they are going to create one million new jobs and yet they have now given us North American unemployment rates. They have done nothing to defend shipbuilding, the aluminium sector or a whole range of manufacturing jobs. They do nothing at all. They almost seem to dislike blue-collar manufacturing jobs. But it is not only in the big issues that they are a mean government. The government are addicted to random acts of parsimony and small gestures of random meanness. The bar can never be too low for this lot. They are petty and there is no group that they do not go out of their way to lie to, mislead and deceive. 


What about the cleaners in Parliament House? Remember Tony Abbott saying, 'I'm the best friend the cleaners in Parliament House have? He was gracious enough to remember a couple of their first names, as if that is enough. That is a regal way from the Prime Minister and a cheerio from the green benches of parliament. That does not put bread and butter on the table. Cutting their wages is the real judge of someone's words.


Look at the ABC. What did the ABC ever do to the government except occasionally criticise them? They attack the national broadcaster. No-one struck home.


Who else does this government not talk about? We waited all question time this week for one question from the government to the Prime Minister about the budget. We did not wait for two questions or three. Even one question would have done. A cursory survey of the government questions to the Prime Minister shows that this brave bunch say nothing about the budget to the Prime Minister. I am sure they leak about it to other journalists. I am sure that perhaps in the dark of the night, as they sit there wondering what is to become of their parliamentary careers, they realise this unfair budget is indeed deeply unpopular.



Mr Sukkar interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  I would not laugh, Member for Deakin. Take it from me: I would not laugh. But when we look at other acts of random meanness, this MPI is important because there are other groups who never get the attention of this government. What did the full-time Disability Commissioner in Australia, Graeme Innes—a distinguished Australian, who has done more for people with disabilities than this mob combined together ever did—do wrong? They got rid of him.


Then we look at the War Memorial. I love what the government said today about the War Memorial. They said, 'Labor promised $10 million for Anzac. That gets us off the hook for breaking our promises.' Oh no, it doesn't. When Brendan Nelson is criticising cuts to the War Memorial, this Prime Minister, who lives in a sufficiently parallel universe, says, 'The War Memorial does not know if they are being cut—what would they know'? His own minister, Minister Ronaldson, says, 'Yes, it's a cut,' but not this Prime Minister. This Prime Minister is very good at denying the truth in front of him.


This travelling exhibition, which the Prime Minister says can be replaced in one year by a Centenary of Anzac, is a map of Australia—3.8 million Australians have seen it over 17 years. What John Howard started, Tony Abbott has ended.


Then we go to another area, which I vow on behalf of the Labor Party we will ensure every coalition member lives to regret. It is the privatisation of Australian Hearing services. There are nearly 500 outlets of Australian Hearing services. We asked a question this week of the Treasurer: 'Why are you privatising Australian Hearing; why are you doing this to families in regional Australia?' He got up, as he loves to do, and gave a pious speech. He said, 'How dare you criticise my credentials? I was a good minister for Human Services.' Certainly, he might have been better at that than at being Treasurer!


There are good minded people over there on that side. There are people who care about the profoundly deaf. What I say to them is: it is time that you awaken. It is time that you stand up for families in regional Australia. I love getting a lecture about the bush by Comrade Turnbull from the eastern front of Sydney! What about all the Australian Hearing Services centres in the bush? What about in regional Australia? The fact of the matter is that families are contacting Labor and asking, 'Is it really the case that this government will privatise Australian Hearing Services?' And we say, 'We're afraid that's right.' Then we get this B-grade acting—this ham acting—from the wannabe poor man's Hamlet of treasurers, 'Woe unto me,' and then he says that it is a good thing.


Please, I ask the government—and I will even use the word 'please'—please reconsider the privatisation of Australian Hearing Services; 450,000 kids use this service, as well as adults. Why on earth do you want to wreck something that is working so well? You know, and there are good National Party members here sometimes—I do not mean to make eye contact with a couple of them—but I say this: do not sell out the bush and let the city based people privatise Australian Hearing Services, because it is your voters who will miss out most of all.


But it is not just Australian Hearing Services, it is not just the War Memorial and it is not just many other small voices. Today, Labor wants to put on the record here the attack on legal services in this country in this unfair budget. What does this government have against advocates? They got rid of the disability commissioner—well, that is a shame. They are going after Indigenous legal—



Mrs Wicks interjecting—




Mr SHORTEN:
  Half these people over here, including the member interjecting—I do not know if she has ever been to an Indigenous legal service—let me tell you, you are weakening the protections for ordinary Australians by cutting the funding to legal services, including Indigenous legal services.


There are topics which do not make the front page of the newspapers of this country. There are pockets of misery which you are inflicting upon ordinary Australians. We give you fair notice—fair notice—that we will fight you on all of these measures, not because we wish to fight you but because we cannot let you wreck a whole lot of good services and the lives of a whole lot of ordinary people because they do not come up to be represented by the mob on the frontbench.


The Prime Minister quoted Ben Chifley in some words earlier today. Let me remind this party about a term that Robert Menzies coined—'forgotten people'. Your unfair budget has many forgotten people. You are unfair budget robs people of aspiration, it robs people of opportunity and it takes away the mobility in this country. You are a party who seek to punish the many for the few. I love looking at the outraged eyebrows being raised by coalition members, saying, 'How dare he say that!' Well, how dare you give this budget to Australia! I cannot wait until you are defeated on your reforms in higher education. I cannot wait until you bury that GP tax—I am sure some of you cannot wait either! I cannot wait until we defeat the unfair taxes that you are imposing.


I look forward to you on the other side saying one day, after the battle has been had, after the pensioners' indexation rates are not cut, I look forward to you saying— (Time expired)

"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2014-08-28,"



Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (15:25):  Once again we see the extraordinary hypocrisy of the Australian Labor Party. Once again we see the man who is meant to be the alternative Prime Minister of this country stand at the dispatch box and make comments about what he believes to be fair and unfair, and to slander those on this side of the chamber.


And for what purpose? For the single purpose that the Australian Labor Party is unwilling to confront the truth about their legacy. We on this side of the chamber understand Labor's legacy. We on this side of the chamber perhaps are more willing to be up-front with the Australian people about the challenges that we as a nation face. But not the Australian Labor Party. They want to bury their legacy underneath the carpet. They want to pretend that the problems that they bequeathed not only to this government but also to future generations of Australians do not exist and, in fact, possibly the person with the most invested in the betrayal of the Australian people is none other than the opposition leader.


That is why we see the Australian Labor Party stand up and rail about the unfairness of the budget. The fact is, there is no bigger unfairness on the national debate across the country right now than the unfairness of the Australian Labor Party, which says, 'We would rather leave to future generations of Australian children all the problems of paying back the multi-billion dollars of debt and deficit than we would face up to the reality .' We as a government are proud of this budget. We are proud of this budget because this budget actually does have the right priorities, because they are anchored around one central tenet. That central tenet is that we can only afford to do what we can afford to achieve in terms of our fiscal priorities. We can only undertake reforms if we can pay for them. We can only undertake policy spending if we can pay for it. We can only engage in new initiatives if there is a way to pay for them. And if there is no ability to raise the money necessary it is not appropriate to say that it is good enough to kick the can down the road. It is not appropriate to say to Australian children, 'We don't care what the impact is going to be on you; we're going to undertake this particular proposal because we think there are a few votes in it.' That is Labor's approach.


That is not the coalition approach. That is not our approach, and we will stand in this chamber each and every day and defend decisions that we know are not the most popular decisions. We did not undertake this budget reform process because we thought it was going to make us 55-45 in the polls. No. We undertook these decisions because these are decisions that are in the national interest. We undertook these decisions because these are decisions that are financially sustainable. We undertook these decisions because we know in the long term that the Australian people can see through the salesmanship of the Australian Labor Party—they can see through the falseness of the confected outrage that we see from Labor members opposite. And they fundamentally know this: that no promise from the Australian Labor Party is worth anything if they cannot afford to pay for it.


That is why as a government, to tackle the fact that we have an ageing population and to address the fact that we have a tax base that is getting smaller relative to the size of the population, we have said that one of our very top priorities must be investment in infrastructure. And the Prime Minister has made it clear that he wants to be remembered as an infrastructure Prime Minister—and he will be. He will be, because the government, together with the private sector and state government partners, will allocate $125 billion for productive infrastructure for this nation.


Compare the coalition's approach to infrastructure with that of the previous, Labor government. There has been $125 billion put into productive infrastructure across the nation, including the East-West Link, the Gateway duplication, the expansion on the northern side of the Gateway Bridge in Brisbane, and the freight route in Perth—a whole host of projects. Compare that to Labor's grand infrastructure projects. Perhaps none was more grand than Building the Education Revolution. Who could forget Labor's $16 billion Building the Education Revolution vision, which saw school halls and covered out-door learning centres rolled out across the country. Sure, there were a couple of examples where schools already had one and they did not want another one, but that did not matter because it got in the way of Labor's grand vision. Sure, there were a couple of examples where the Australian Labor Party, through their haste to roll out this program, where paying two or three times the going rate, but that did not matter; it was just taxpayers money! They did not need to worry about that! 


We have seen the Australian Labor Party's approach with their $900 cash splash. Labor said, 'There's some wastage, sure, but don't worry about it; it's necessary.' But the fact is that it has been left to this generation and future generations to pay back all of that spending. And when Labor says that they are opposed to this government making reforms around, for example, pensions, they are actually saying, 'We will sacrifice future generations of Australians and make them pay that debt for decades in order to secure ourselves a couple of extra votes today.' That is Labor's central massage.


As a government we will not stand idly by, so I say to the Australian Labor Party, on behalf of the coalition, 'We will stare you down in every single debate, because there is one thing that we know about—and that is good fiscal governance.' We know that we do it better than Labor. And if you ever want an example of that, look no further than the facts. The Australian Labor Party is very big on rhetoric but very poor on actions. We know that they promised over 500 times to deliver a budget surplus. How many did they deliver?—not one. 


We know that the former Treasurer in the Labor government, the member for Lilley, stood here at this very dispatch box, in 2012, and said, 'The four years of surplus I announce tonight…' only to deliver four more years of deficit. Labor's legacy is $123 billion of deficit and $667 billion of gross debt. And all of the huffing and puffing from the Leader of the Opposition and from Labor members opposite will never undo one fundamental fact: that that debt trajectory—the fastest growing level of spending in the 17 developed nations monitored by the IMF; the fastest growth rate of debt, basically, on the face of the planet—was Labor's legacy at a time when our terms of trade were among some of the best this nation has ever seen.


With the policies that Labor continues to espouse today, they would sacrifice the future by ensuring that we have another four years of budget deficits, which would mean that, as a nation, we have had 10 years of budget deficits—the longest single period of budget deficits in over 45 years, since budget records were kept in 1971. That is Labor's approach, and that is why, as a coalition government, we are committed to economic reform, productive infrastructure and to being upfront and frank with the Australian people in saying, 'We know that not everything we say is good news but—do you know what?—it is the truth.


We will always level with the Australian people and tell them what we can afford and what we cannot afford. And the only thing that Labor's shonky approach—the snake-oil-salesman approach that says, 'Don't worry about it; we'll kick the can down the road'—will bequeath is a situation where Australian kids are poorer tomorrow than they are today. It might be acceptable for the Australian Labor Party to say: 'We don't care about $25,000 of debt for every man, woman and child. We don't care that an Australian family of four will have a starting point of being $100,000 in debt thanks to Labor's policies.' 


But in the coalition we do care, and we will not stand by and allow that failed Labor Party approach to continue. We saw the consequences of six years of Labor ineptitude when it comes to good governance. As a coalition government we may not always do what is popular but we will always do what is right. And in the fullness of time I would rather go to the electorate every day of every week and look the constituents in the eye and say to them, 'We make decisions because they're the right decisions in the national interests, and we prioritise the right kinds of spending, and not the cash splashes which might, in the short term, be a nice little sugar hit.' Those things might, in the short term garner a couple of extra votes for the Australian Labor Party but in the long term they will betray the single most important trust the Australian people put in us—the future of their children.

"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2014-08-28,"



Mr RIPOLL
 (Oxley) (15:35):  Everybody loves an anniversary, except maybe the one today, because on this day last year, at Rooty Hill, Tony Abbott made a very big promise to Australians. He stood up there, looked people squarely in the eye, and said:


No cuts to health, no cuts to education, no cuts or changes to pensions …


We have heard a diatribe coming from the other side about making tough choices. They say they are all about caring and sharing and they will do the right thing by Australians, but they are just words. The evidence of what happens in practice is completely at odds with the words—just words, written on a bit of paper and regurgitated. But if the truth is thrown right in front of you, how can you deny it? Maybe the Prime Minister can continue to deny it but Australians are not fooled. A year later we all know that all those promises that were made 12 months ago—and the promises that continue to be made—were just lies. It just was not true. It is as simple as that—they were uncaring, calculated lies.


We have heard from members opposite that it is not about popularity. They say things like, 'I'd rather stand in front of the people,' and 'We'll march until we take the beaches,' and other types of garbage, but none of it was about tough choices 


Think back to 12 months ago. It was not about making a tough, hard choice. It was just about winning votes. It is pretty simple politics—it really is. You do not need to pay someone millions of dollars to consult and give you this advice. It was just about winning votes: 'That is what the focus groups want, that is what people say they want and that is what we will say we will do.' Unfortunately, what they actually do—that is the Liberal Party and this government—is something completely different. In less than a year the Prime Minister has set a new standard of lows, a new standard for dishonesty and a new standard for breaking promises. The Prime Minister has broken, on his own record, more promises than probably any other Prime Minister in history. For example, what happened to the promise of a million new jobs? I see jobs actually going in reverse gear. We just heard the Treasurer admit that is true, but he says, 'It's somebody else's fault.' The Liberal Party promised a million new jobs and it then goes into reverse. Every time they break a promise, it is somebody else's fault. It is the media's fault. It is the ABC's fault. It is probably some of the other ministers' fault. It is always somebody else's fault—but their broken promises stand as broken promises. That is what they have to live with. 


This is an unfair budget and there is no question about that. Why is it unfair? It is simple: because people right across the country are telling Labor—I am sure they are telling the Liberal and National parties too—that this is unfair. No-one remembers being promised a new GP tax. I cannot remember that promise. I cannot remember a promise of a new fuel tax. That may have been unpopular, but I would have loved to see you stand up and make those promises. No-one remembers a promise to change pensions and to cut pensions. No-one remembers a promise to cut school funding. In fact, I remember the exact opposite.




Ms Rowland:
  The unity ticket!




Mr RIPOLL:
  Yes, the unity ticket. Tony Abbott and the coalition just will not listen and they will not listen to the Australian people. Why? Because they do not care. Tony Abbott just does not get it. It is as simple as that. You cannot dress up this budget with another three-word slogan. There is no three-word slogan that could get you out of trouble on this one. But I have got one for you: dump this budget. It is no good. It is rotten. No group, big or small, is safe from Tony Abbott's cuts and broken promises. There were promises to take the pressure off the cost of living, and what do we see? We see the exact opposite. The cost of living is going up. The cuts to child support, family support and the increasing cost of petrol—these are called increasing the cost of living and that is not what was promised. You promised no new or increased taxes. What did we get? The GP tax and higher cost of medicines and petrol. You promised no cuts to health, and what did we get? A $50 billion cut to hospitals. What do the states think about this? They are not too happy about this. There were all sorts of promises. The Liberal Party kept saying there was a fire, a budget emergency, a crisis. That is what they say on one day, and then on the next day they say, 'It is actually all okay; the Australian economy is actually in good shape.' In fact, 23 years of uninterrupted economic growth is not too bad at all.


The Labor Party will stand for something. We will stand for families, for fairness, for universal Medicare, for family support, for the aged, for the sick and for all of those people who expect us, as an opposition, to do the right thing by them—because the government will not!

"Frydenberg, Josh, MP",LP,2014-08-28,"



Mr FRYDENBERG
 (Kooyong—Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister) (15:41):  The member for Oxley has a very short memory, because after six years of the worst government we have ever seen in this country the Australian people delivered a verdict on 7 September last year. That verdict saw the Labor Party get its lowest vote since 1903, and then when it came back to this place it turned its back on its people's choice and selected the member for Maribyrnong as its leader. Since then we have had negativity and opposition for opposition's sake. When we went to the last election we took three key policies: we were going to stop the boats, and we have done that; we were going to repeal the carbon tax, and we have done that; and, most importantly of all, we were going to repair the finances of this country. Do you know why? Because the legacy that the Labor Party left the Australian people is debt and deficit as far as the eye can see: $667 billion dollars of debt is where we are heading if we do not take corrective action. We are currently spending $1 billion a month on the interest bill just to finance the debt. Do you know what $1 billion a month—$12 billion a year—equates to? That equates to half the defence budget of this country or all the aged-care spending of the Commonwealth. That is just meeting the debt and deficit legacy that Labor left us. 


We have to take corrective action. It is not just the Liberal Party and the coalition who are saying that. It is independent players like the Parliamentary Budget Office; it is the IMF, who have pointed out that of 17 advanced economies Australia has the fastest growing level of spending in the world; and it is the Commission of Audit. The Commission of Audit, amongst its many important findings, found that Australia faces a major demographic challenge. That major demographic challenge means that, while today we have five working Australians to every single retired Australian, that ratio will fall to 2.7 to one, and that is a problem.


Government spending in this country as a proportion of GDP has risen from 23.1 per cent in 2007, when we left government, to 25.9 per cent today. Again, if we do not take corrective action, that will go to 26.5 per cent of GDP equivalent to government spending. Why is this a problem? Because the government's tax revenues as a proportion of GDP are only around 22 per cent, so we are in structural deficit. We are spending more money than we are taking as a government, and that needs to stop.


In this budget we do a number of important things. First, there is the fiscal consolidation—paying back about $300 billion of Labor's debt and saving about $16 billion a year in interest over the next 10 years. That is critical. Second, we are putting a record spend on infrastructure, equivalent to about $125 billion a year if you take into account the private sector and the state governments' expenditure on infrastructure, which is stimulated by this budget, including through the Asset Recycling Fund. We are getting more young people and more older people into work than previously has been the case. Our 'earn or learn' strategy for under 30s is vital if we are going to reduce youth unemployment from the stubborn number of around 13 per cent, which continually went up under Labor. For over 50s who have been out of work for more than six months, we will provide an incentive payment to employers to take them on. This is absolutely critical. We are making a record spend investing in education and innovation. The medical research fund—where we are world's best—is now going to be stimulated by up to $20 billion as a result of those initiatives. We are giving real support to apprentices for the first time with a HECS-type loan of up to $20,000. This is making a real difference. Our universities will be unshackled with the deregulation of university fees, allowing them to compete with the world's best. This is what we are doing in this budget and this is critical to Australia's future.



Those opposite are hypocrites because they know that when they were in government under Bob Hawke they supported a Medicare co-payment. They know they support a PBS co-payment. They need to take their heads from under the sand and support our important measures contained in this budget. (Time expired)

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2014-08-28,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (15:46):  The member for Kooyong went through a range of promises. He talked about promises; well, I just want to remind him of some other promises that were made 12 months ago by the Prime Minister of today. He promised Australians there would be no cuts to health, no cuts to education and no cuts or changes to pensions.


Perhaps the Prime Minister thought those words were meaningless, or perhaps he thought it was just a throwaway comment that no-one really paid much attention to. I can assure the Prime Minister that Australians believed him—they trusted him and took him at his word. So you can imagine the betrayal felt by millions of Australians when he became the Prime Minister and, through his horror budget, broke each and every one of those promises. He cut health, he cut education and he cut pensions.


Perhaps the worst betrayal was felt by our war veterans—those who have selflessly served our country. The Abbott government has shamefully betrayed our war veterans by slashing Labor's fair indexation system for veterans' pensions, which will impact more than 280,000 for veterans including 140,000 service pensioners and 84,000 war-widow pensioners. Under the Abbott government's cruel budget, veterans' pension indexation will be linked to CPI only from 1 September 2017. The current indexation system, as we all know, links pensions to whichever delivers a higher pension out of the CPI, the MTAWE or male total average weekly earnings, or the pensioner and beneficiary living cost index. This indexation was introduced by the Labor government to reflect the actual daily cost of living for those on veterans' pensions—those who selflessly served our country.


If the Abbott government's indexation system had been in place for the last four years, a veteran on a single pension would be $60 a fortnight worse off. That is $1,560 a year worse off, and that is only over four years. In addition to these cruel cuts to veterans' pensions, veterans will also have to cope with other budget measures including: axing the three months backdating of veterans' disability pensions for new recipients, costing new recipients up to $8,405; scrapping the $870 seniors supplement for some veterans; and cutting $217 in annual payments for the children of war veterans—which is just outrageous. We have seen the response to that in this chamber and right across the nation. They will also be hit with a GP tax, the petrol tax and the increased cost of prescriptions and pathology. Veterans rightly feel betrayed by the Prime Minister's broken promises.


Do not just take it from me: I have had plenty of conversations with veterans over the course of the last five weeks and since this cruel budget was released, and there have been a number of statements made by veterans that show they are not happy. They feel incredibly betrayed.


There was this statement from 26 August—this week. The national spokesman for the Alliance Of Defence Service Organisations, David Jamison, said in his media release that the veterans' disability pension budget is a disaster. He said:


 … The leaders of the national veterans' organisations are bewildered by the Government's budget proposal to wind back the level of indexing the Veteran Disability Pensions to the pre 2007 formula of CPI only.


He says in this release that this:


 … means that the incomes of our most disabled will no longer keep pace with community income standards. 


Jamison says:


 … there was no justification for this unfair proposal because after all, the Veteran Disability Pension is a long-recognised compensation entitlement not a social security payment.


He also says he has written to the Prime Minister asking for this proposal to be dropped and calling on all parliamentarians to reject it in the name of fairness for our veterans.


The Vietnam veterans peacekeepers are not happy either. They regard these budget measures as: 'A slap in the face for veterans: pensions under attack'. They say: 'Service pension concessions under attack' and: 'Backdating of pension claims scrapped'. They are so not happy.


They are also very concerned about DVA offices in regional areas and Centrelink services being scrapped. They say: 'Senior supplements scrapped'. 'Is this the thin edge of the wedge?' they ask.


It is unacceptable and shameful that the Abbott government has betrayed those who have served our country. Veterans took the Prime Minister and the Minister for Veterans' Affairs at their word when they promised no cuts to pensions before the election.

"Porter, Christian, MP",LP,2014-08-28,"



Mr PORTER
 (Pearce) (15:51):  The MPI today talks about wrong priorities and I suggest that with the use of that word it conceals at least one accurate observation—that is, that budgets are all about priorities. It recalls to mind some advice that was given to me in preparation for a Treasury role. The advice was tongue-in-cheek, admittedly, but I found it very depressing. The advice was from someone who had experience in this matter. They said it was very easy to be a Treasurer because people knew with particular individual precision exactly what they wanted from government. Firstly, they wanted increased spending on services and infrastructure of every type and secondly, they wanted lower taxes, fees and charges.


I think that is depressing and, in my observation, not entirely true. The reason it is not entirely true, although it may be pithy and perhaps to some amusing, is that, if you accept that no Australian likes paying more in revenue for anything or paying more for a service or receiving less of something than they expected to receive—if you accept that, and it is not difficult to accept—there is a truth that it does not necessarily follow from that that this natural part of human nature somehow seamlessly translates into a situation where people's No. 1 priority in Australia for a federal budget is for it to run at a deficit. Poll after poll reveals this fact: what people want consistently from the federal government, and what they wish for and what they want prioritised in federal finances, is exactly the same thing that they wish to have prioritised in their own household budgets, and that is that they be able to maintain a situation where they earn more than they spend on a consistent basis. That is the single, primary, overarching priority of this Treasurer, and it accords perfectly with the single overarching priority of the Australian people with respect to this budget.


Interestingly, it used to accord with Labor's priority. They promised a surplus 500 times, but why was it that the No. 1 priority for Labor, stated over 500 times, turned into the priority that dare not speak its name? I suspect it was because Labor made a mistake in judgement. They first of all made a mistake in terms of the nature and quantum of the expenditure that they embedded in the budget after the GFC, but then they made the fundamental mistake, which occurred to them as reality only very late in their term of office. That was that it would be somehow straightforward or easy to return that embedded level of overexpenditure to a position of surplus without serious criticisms of unfairness or in a way that was somehow magically popular. That was never going to be the case.


If you look at the Labor position, as far as I can determine what it is, there are two primary problems in the position that they have consistently put in response to the coalition's, in my view, very responsible budget. The first is this: if you label anything by way of a slowing of any growth in any transfer payment or departmental budget as a cut and thereby unfair, you resign yourself to the governmental position that it is impossible to return to surplus by expenditure restraint. You simply say it is impossible to do so. If a little boy stands to be measured next to the kitchen door and expects to grow 3½ centimetres in a year but only grows three centimetres, and you say to him, 'You've shrunk'—if that is your logic—then you say to yourself as a government, 'You cannot restrain expenditure in a manner which is fair at all.' The second major problem is this: if you label any expansion in revenue as unfair on the basis that it is unfair if it represents a high percentage share of a total lower compared to a total higher income—if that is the measure for fairness in any revenue measure—you rule out any broad based revenue measure at all. If you say that 40c a week from a low-income household on the re-indexation of the fuel excise is unfair, then you effectively say no to every single conceivable broad based revenue measure, whether it be re-indexation or an increased fee for service that attaches to all Australians. You rule that out.


So, if you still believe, as seems the case after 500 promises, that you wish to return to surplus, and all expenditure restraint is unfair and any broad based revenue measure is unfair, what does it leave you with? It leaves you with targeted revenue measures against Australia's 'top' income earners—that is, those earning over $70,000. That must be the only thing that Labor can leave in its kitty if it were ever in the position of trying to return Australia to surplus. Before anyone ever contemplates that, they need to realise that we rely now more on income tax than we did in 1950. The top two per cent of taxpayers pay one-quarter of all income tax. The top 10 per cent pay two-thirds. Our effective income tax rate is three per cent higher than Canada, five per cent higher than Sweden and 10 per cent higher than the USA. That is not fair.

"Griffin, Alan, MP",ALP,2014-08-28,"



Mr GRIFFIN
 (Bruce) (15:56):  Twelve months ago, what did the now Prime Minister say? At Rooty Hill, he said:


No cuts to health, no cuts to education, no cuts or changes to pensions …


To pick up the member for Pearce, it is very much like that child he was talking about, standing in the doorway, focused on how much he was going to grow. Twelve months ago the Prime Minister, in effect, just stood there and said: 'I'm already three centimetres taller. I'm already bigger than I said and it doesn't matter what happens after that.' That is the point.


The very advice that the member for Pearce has given today is the very advice that the Prime Minister should have been following before the last election—but he did not. What he did was indulge in the sort of activity he has been known for over the years. In fact, he has admitted it himself. He said: 'Don't believe what I say; only believe it if it's written down.' The fact is that he knows, as we do, that much of what he says means nothing.


When we go to that question of there being no cuts to health, no cuts to education and no cuts or changes to pensions, I particularly want to focus on the pensions issue. It happened again today, from a number of speakers, including again from the Prime Minister himself. They say: 'What do you mean cuts to pensions? Pensions will increase every six months, as they do now. The difference is only the indexation method.' Again, that does not make sense because it misses the point about what a pension actually is. A pension is an income support payment. It is an income support payment in the context of what we mean what we talk about social security pensions—the age pension et cetera. It is a payment designed to try and give people a chance to live. Of course, we all know, we all accept and we all understand that the cost of living increases over time. When it increases, therefore the cost to live increases. In those circumstances, the situation is that benefits alter accordingly.


The thing about that is that now, all of a sudden, the coalition have discovered CPI—that is the actual way you measure this. That is the way you know what the change is. Funnily enough, only a matter of a few months ago, you passed legislation about fairer indexation of military pensions, where the whole basic premise to it was that CPI was not sufficient. The whole basic premise was that it was not fair. The whole basic premise was that the cost of living was not taken care of by CPI changes on a six-monthly basis. You needed to make it more, and that is what you did. You sat there—in fact, many of you did not sit there; many of you got up and railed about what an unreasonable bunch of so-and-sos we were because we had not done this when we were in government.


The fact is that the very system that you legislated for some military pensioners only a matter of weeks ago is the very system you are now legislating to remove. What it will lead to is a significant cut in what would have been the pension people would have been trying to live on in the years ahead. If you do not get that, maybe have a bit of a think about it; because, when you go out there and say, 'There will be no cuts to pensions,' you are relying on grammatical fallacies. You are relying on untruths and mistruths. You are relying on trying to con and confuse people with regard to the actual changes you are legislating. You need to understand that.


When you go to those senior citizens groups, you need to tell them that the pension value under this system that you will implement is going to be significantly lower in the years ahead. If the same system were in place over the last four years, you are talking about a situation where pensioners would have been something like $1,500 worse off every year. ACOSS has estimated that in about 10 years time a pensioner will be worse off under this system by some $80 a week. That is a lot of money if that is all you have. That is a lot of money if that is what you are relying on to live. As we also know, the Parliamentary Budget Office has come out with figures which have shown that, in terms of the estimated cost of pension benefits into the future, there will be massive loss—billions of dollars gone over time. In fact, as I recall, there will be a cut in 2024-25 from $74.8 billion to $67.9 billion—a cut of $6.9 billion in just that one year. Over the next 10 years you are talking about something like $23 billion out of the hands of those who rely on benefits to live.


The fact is this is unfair. It is completely unfair to the people who really need assistance within this community.

"Hogan, Kevin, MP",Nats,2014-08-28,"



Mr HOGAN
 (Page) (16:01):  It is a very interesting topic we are talking about today. A federal budget sets the parameters of our economy, and one of the most important things the federal government can do is make sure the economy is in good shape. The budget is about jobs. The economy is about jobs. It is about cost of living and a lot of other issues that are very dear to everyone's hearts.


This budget is a very important word used by the other side of politics on a lot of different issues: 'sustainable'. We hear a lot of people on the other side of politics talk about other sustainable things, but what we need to hear more about from the other side is the sustainability of this country's finances, and that is what this budget is about.


I was thinking about the different culture or history of different political parties as well. I probably look a lot older, but the first Prime Minister I have a conscious memory of is Gough Whitlam. I am sure Mr Whitlam is a lovely character, but economic management certainly was not part of his repertoire. The history of the Labor Party and the economic management of the Whitlam years are well documented. Our country was in a very bad way at the end of it with the Khamlani Loans Affair and other issues.


When I left university, in 1984 we had the Hawke-Keating governments. I am not going to talk about the physical limitations of either of those gentlemen—other people have been doing that in the last couple of days—but they did many good things. They made some reforms of our country. But, again, when it came to the budget and longer-term economic management, they left this country with 'the recession we had to have' and interest rates at one stage of 18 or 19 per cent. And then they left us with that lovely $96 billion deficit.


So what did a coalition government do for the next 11 years of Howard? As we on this side knew—and it was not easy—long-term sustainability was more important than short-term populism. That is what this debate is about. So we paid back the $96 billion and put $50 billion aside to fund unfunded Commonwealth public servant superannuation. Again, it was all about long-term sustainability.


Part of the word in this somewhere is 'hurting'. I know what hurts Australians and what hurts normal mums and dads. What hurt was that we then had the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd fiasco, which has been well documented again and commented on again today. This side will never mention the debt that they ran up—one of the fastest growing debts in the Western world? What hurt did that cause the normal mums and dads of Australia/ The hurt is the billion dollars that was spent on interest every month. That might just sound like a figure to that side, but what could that billion dollars be spent on? All these wonderful programs that we all love.


There is nothing nicer for a politician than to run around handing out money. We can see around the world the problems that gets you into if you are not doing it sustainably. We can see countries in Europe where they do not have a lot of choice about what they have to do with austerity measures. They are forced upon them because of the short-term populism of handing out money. But, if we were not spending $1 billion a month on interest, there would be a lot of wonderful projects we would love to spend that money on rather than just paying it back on interest—not paying back the debt; just paying back interest on that debt.


It is very easy for politicians to run around and hand out money for short-term popularity, but this budget is about long-term sustainability. And there are a lot of good things in this budget. One that I want to comment on that is very important to my electorate is the duplication of the Pacific Highway. They will not tell you this either, but the Labor Party wanted to withdraw the 80 per cent federal funding of the Pacific Highway and were only committing $3 billion to it. This side of politics said it important, federal funding will remain 80 per cent and we will fund it at $5 billion. That is an extra $2 billion this side is funding for the Pacific Highway when compared to that side, because we know it is important to save lives and we know it is important for the economy such as that in my electorate and in the areas that it goes through.

Mr KELVIN THOMSON
 (Wills) (16:06):  The government has gone back to the three-word slogans. We are hearing about Operation Budget Repair. I know that the three-word slogans worked a treat in opposition, but they are no way to run a government. But, if it is going to be three-word slogans, how about Operation Cut Unemployment? We now have unemployment at 6.4 per cent nationally, the highest level in 12 years, with 789,000 Australians out of work. In my home state of Victoria unemployment has now reached the quite unacceptable level of seven per cent. Youth unemployment in Victoria is at an even more disturbing 15 per cent.


The Liberal government is undermining young Australians looking for work with its savage cut of $1.2 billion to income support for people under 30. From 1 January next year, job seekers under 30 who need Newstart and youth allowance will be forced to wait six months before receiving any support. As a delegation from the Australian Council of Social Service, who visited me this week, pointed out, 'What will they live on if they cannot find a job?' Requiring job seekers to apply for 40 jobs each month is ludicrous. The jobs simply are not there. It is simply a recipe for red tape for business. This budget risks condemning a generation of young Australians to a vicious cycle of poverty.


If it is going to be all about slogans, how about 'operation keep your word'? They promised to take the pressure off the cost of living, but then they cut child care and increased the cost of pharmaceuticals. They promised no new or increased taxes and then gave us a new GP tax and raised the tax on petrol. They promised no cuts to health and then cut $50 billion from hospitals. They promised no cuts to education and then cut $30 billion from schools, $1 billion from skills and $5 billion from universities. They promised no increase in university fees, but fees are set to double and triple. They promised to create a million new jobs, but unemployment is on the rise and youth unemployment in Victoria is at 15 year highs. The Prime Minister promised to be the Prime Minister for Aboriginal affairs and then cut $500 million from essential health and services. They promised no change to pensions but then cut pensions by $23 billion over the next 10 years—$80 a week from the pockets and purses of pensioners.


On this day last year at Rooty Hill, the then opposition leader, now Prime Minister, promised Australians 'no cuts to health, no cuts to education, no cuts or changes to pensions'. What a difference a year makes. And Education Minister Pyne said in a media release of 26 August last year, just over a year ago:


While we welcome debate over the quality and standards in our universities, we have no plans to increase fees … 


What is he saying a year later? Last weekend he said student protesters should 'get some perspective' because the government is 'not exactly asking for their left kidney'. Well, I checked this out, and it turns out to be even worse than that. I looked up the Transplant Australia website. It says the cost of a kidney transplant from a live donor is $75,000 and the cost of a kidney transplant from a deceased donor is $65,000. So getting a new left kidney would be less costly than the debts many graduates are going to pay if this government's budget passes.


Under this budget, university fees are set to double and triple. The government wants to cut funding for undergraduate places by up to 37 per cent, deregulate fee levels and allow universities to charge what they like and, outrageously, introduce a compounding real interest rate of six per cent for all student debts. We will see science degrees increase from the current average of $44,000 up to $170,000 over 20 years; nursing degrees rise from $23,000 to $62,000; and teaching degrees rise from $32,000 up to $87,000.


This is not a government of adults. This is a government of intergenerational warriors taking the under-25s off Newstart and fitting students up with 60 per cent of the cost of their education. It is a shameful way to treat our young people, and this government should be condemned for this unfair, short-sighted, incoherent dog's breakfast of a budget.

Mrs WICKS
 (Robertson) (16:11):  I am really pleased to speak on this matter of public importance today because, far from what members opposite claim, this budget is one that is not only delivering on our commitments that we took to the last election but also delivering on the right priorities that will benefit our nation for all Australians and for future Australians. 


Let me remind members opposite of the size of the task we face—I know other members have also reminded members opposite of this. We borrow $1 billion every single month just to pay the interest on Labor's debt. Members of the Labor Party have no plan. Our budget is the only plan to fix Labor's debt and deficit disaster.


We have already improved the budget by around $15 billion over the forward estimates. In contrast to the assertions made by those opposite, let me state that this is not only a responsible budget but also a budget that is delivering on the commitments and priorities that we took to the people of Australia and that we particularly took to the people of the Central Coast. They are the commitments and priorities that reflect the heartfelt concerns that the tens of thousands of people that I spoke to in the lead-up to the last election asked us to address. Let me restate what we said we would do: we said we would stop the boats; that we would build the roads of 21st century; that we would scrap the carbon tax; and that we would get the budget under control. And we are doing just that.


We are not the party with wrong priorities. We are doing what we were elected to do, and in my electorate of Robertson many of the commitments that we made to the Central Coast are already being delivered in less than 12 months. We are delivering on our growth plan for the Central Coast, and the first priority in that growth plan is local jobs. We are determined to generate more local jobs on the Central Coast because we want to see our region thrive. That is why this government is committed to delivering 600 new jobs in the Gosford CBD, including a purpose-built Commonwealth agency building. The ATO has advised that the building is expected to be completed by the end of 2017. As further evidence of our right priorities, we have recent modelling from Regional Development Australia, Central Coast NSW, indicating that the 600 Commonwealth jobs in Gosford will create an additional 1,400 new jobs on top of that. That is 2,000 new jobs in the heart of Gosford and in the heart of the Central Coast within a few short years. As the Treasurer said when he joined me in Gosford last week, this is what the budget is all about. It is about creating jobs. It is about stimulating growth, and everything we are focused on is about jobs and more prosperity for Australian and future Australians. This government is also building NorthConnex, another key item in the growth plan and the missing link that has been talked about for decades and never built. Now, with $405 million from the federal government, it will be finished by 2019. 


With 30,000 to 40,000 commuters leaving their homes early in the morning and returning late at night to their families, these commitments have the potential to be a game-changer for the Central Coast. But it is not all we are doing. There is $675,000 in this budget to help address the accident-prone black spot at Langford Drive and Woy Woy Road in Kariong. There is also $3.5 billion to help make Woy Woy oval a civic centrepiece, with a 600-seat grandstand rather than a crumbling structure for our local sporting heroes and sporting clubs.


Unfortunately, we are seeing more and more just how much Labor failed our region, even on so-called signature policies like the NBN. Despite Labor's great fanfare in Gosford in 2013, despite the big red buttons that the minister and the Labor member liked to push, when we came to government last September only 203 premises were actually connected on the Central Coast. We now have 2,600 premises connected to the NBN, more than 7,000 premises passed and work currently underway to connect an additional 10,200. 


Last week, the Minister for Communications Malcolm Turnbull joined me to announce that the NBN will expand its rollout in Umina to pass 54,000 homes in our region in the next 12 months, including in Woy Woy, Umina Beach, Ettalong Beach, Killcare, Kincumber and Saratoga. This is a government that has the right priorities for my electorate of Robertson and the right priorities for Australia. This budget delivers on many of those and it will make the Central Coast a place where I can proudly say we not only live in the best part of the best country in the world but also work in the best part of the best country in the world.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (16:30):  Last week we celebrated National Science Week, Australia's annual celebration of science and technology. During Science Week, in fact on Saturday, I was lucky enough to open the VEX Robotics Competition at Dickson College. This was a fierce and exciting competition where robots built by high school students from Australia and New Zealand battled it out for supremacy. It was Oz bots versus Kiwi bots. It was a wonderful example of the types of activities that can encourage high school students to continue to maintain an interest in and passion for science throughout their education. Unfortunately, in Australia at the moment not enough high school students are studying science and related subjects. Between 1992 and 2010 the percentage of year 12 students enrolled in biology fell from 35 to 24 per cent, in physics from 21 to 14 per cent, and in maths from 77 to 72 per cent.


Also during Science Week some 10,000 people attend Geoscience Australia's open day at Symonston, which is in my electorate. They learnt about Geoscience Australia's wide range of work in the fields of petroleum, mineral, marine mapping, groundwater and natural hazard research. They learnt about working as a surveyor in Antarctica, they learnt about using a super computer and satellite imagery to understand flood risk information, and they learnt everything they had ever wanted to know about dinosaurs. There was also a targeted campaign that focused on women and trying to get female scientist into the great work that is done at Geoscience Australia. National Science Week is a chance to reflect on the wonderful work that is done in Australia in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics, such as the work, as I said, that is done at Geoscience Australia.


Science Week is also an opportunity to reflect on where we as a nation stand in the world in terms of science and innovation, a chance for us to work out what we need to do to be a world leader in these fields. Unfortunately, under the Abbott government, Australia has a very, very long way to go. Science has never really had a fair go under this government. In fact the Abbott government's record in science, innovation and research to date has been disappointing. In fact, it has been unacceptable: from the member for Mayo's press release prior to the election, in which he called the Australian Research Council's grants 'increasingly ridiculous', 'completely over the top' and a waste of taxpayer dollars to the revelation on the very eve of the election that $103 million in ARC funding would be 'reprioritised' over four years under a coalition government. Then there was the decision to not appoint a minister for science, the abolition of the Climate Commission and the significant cuts and job losses at some of our leading scientific institutions. Under this government, nearly 900 scientists will lose their jobs. At least 500 jobs will be going at CSIRO, 96 at Geoscience Australia, 64 at the ANSTO and 58 at the Bureau of Meteorology.


I hope that some government members heard the wonderful speech given by our Chief Scientist, Professor Ian Chubb, ahead of National Science Week. Professor Chubb spelt out a vision for an Australia in which our economy is 'organised to support our aspiration and not to limit it'. He pointed out that 'Australia is now the only OECD country that does not have a contemporary national science and technology or innovation strategy'. Today, as we all know, the Minister for Education introduced legislation into this parliament that will make the dream of higher education unaffordable for thousands of Australians, and science will be one of the areas worst hit. Currently, a science degree in Australia costs an average of $44,000. But modelling shows that under the Abbott government's new higher education policy, the cost of a science degree could go up to as much as $170,000. How will we ever reach our aspirations to be a world leader in science if young people cannot afford to study science at university? What is the point in encouraging students to study STEM subjects—that is, science and technology, engineering and mathematics—at high school if they won't ever be able to afford to follow their passion and study it at university?


As Professor Chubb said:


… science is a long haul. It is not something that can be turned on or off when we feel like it.


And it isn't like a tooth brush: something you can buy when you get there because you forgot to pack one.


If Australia wants to be a world leader in science, and we should want this, we need to support our young people, because they will be the world-leading scientists of the future. The Abbott government just does not seem to get it. This government's inaction, ambivalence and carelessness when it comes to science are irresponsible and reckless and will jeopardise Australia's future prosperity. This Science Week, members opposite should be ashamed. (Time expired)

Mr BYRNE
 (Holt) (09:42):  Last week I had the pleasure of visiting the Casey Regional Veterans Welfare Centre and met with John Hopkins and Peter Godfrey to present the organisation with a $3,000 grant under the Building Excellence in Support and Training—with the acronym BEST—program. The BEST program is administered by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, and it provides support and resources to ex-service practitioners for pension and welfare work to assist veterans and war widows and widowers. The Casey Regional Veterans Welfare Centre is made up of a wonderful group of volunteers that include people like John Hopkins, Peter Godfrey, Terry Busk, Dennis Warnecke and David MacNamara. Each volunteer spends around one or two days a week at their office in Cranbourne, or driving around visiting veterans to assist them with getting support, and at times compensation, from the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Each volunteer benefits from training provided under the TIP program before they assist veterans. John Hopkins has said that the TIP training has been fantastic for volunteers who get welfare training, e-learning welfare training, compensation course training and advocacy training. 


After completing the training, each volunteer is better able to assist veterans, serving and ex-serving members of the permanent reserve forces, cadets, officers of cadets, and other persons nominated by the Australian government, and their dependants, to access benefits and services from the Department of Veterans' Affairs. However, one of the things that John, Peter, and other local veterans have been concerned about is the recent changes to the Veterans' Access Network shopfront services, announced in April 2014, by the coalition government. In particular, local veterans were concerned about the Morwell VAN office now being co-located into the Department of Human Services in Morwell, and the Frankston and Bairnsdale VAN offices basically closing—with veteran information support services being provided from DHS service centres in Frankston and Morwell respectively. I appreciate the government's decision to consolidate its services. However—and I had a detailed conversation with one veteran in particular—a number in our veteran community experience PTSD. We know that with the new cohort coming out of Afghanistan and Iraq—Afghanistan in particular—accessing a specific VAN network shopfront is much easier for them than going into a DHS service. My view is that these people have sacrificed, or have been prepared to sacrifice, their life in defending of our country.


I think that we owe it to them, notwithstanding that we understand the Australian government's decision, as I said, to consolidate its service, to provide accessible shopfront services so members of our veterans community who have served our country so well in conflicts feel comfortable accessing these services. If I could, on behalf of the Casey Regional Veterans Welfare Centre, I respectfully ask the government to reconsider its decision. It is in the best interest of our veterans that it does so.

"Hendy, Peter, MP",LP,2014-08-28,"



Dr HENDY
 (Eden-Monaro) (10:11):  I rise to support the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Industry Code Penalties) Bill 2014. I do not intend to speak for very long because I just want to make a few points. This bill is a significant advancement on the existing laws regarding franchising. As the Minister for Small Business stated in his second reading speech introducing the bill, the purpose of this bill is to enable the government to include civil penalty provisions in a forthcoming new franchising code. He noted that a breach of civil penalty provisions will expose a franchisor or franchisee to an infringement notice issued by the ACCC or a pecuniary penalty imposed by the court.


As I have previously told the chamber, as a former chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, I know a bit about this topic and I am well aware of the difficult balancing act that government regulation—rightfully, I might add—has to play in the relationship between franchisors and franchisees. Indeed, further to that I was personally involved in the introduction of the Franchising Code of Conduct, which was introduced by the Howard government in 1998. In 1998 I was the Chief of Staff of the Minister for Small Business. I was involved in a lot of the negotiations and know how difficult this area can be.


The franchising sector has been the subject of eight reviews at either the federal or state level over recent years. The last was an independent review by Mr Alan Wein in 2013. As the Wein review summarises it:


The Code is a prescribed, mandatory industry code under Part IVB of the CCA—


The Competition and Consumer Act. The report states:


Broadly, the Code requires franchisors to disclose specific facts to franchisees and to follow set procedures in their dealings with franchisees. The Code also provides a cost effective dispute resolution scheme for franchisors and franchisees.


The coalition government recognises that the franchise industry is a significant and growing part of the small business sector. A recent Griffith University survey indicated that franchising contributed more than $130 billion to the national economy and employed over 400,000 Australians. There are over 70,000 franchise business arrangements in Australia today.


The difficulty in dealing with regulation in this area is highlighted by the fact that there have been those eight reviews. This has created a high level of review fatigue and in moving forward in light of the recent review we are very cognisant of that fact. Indeed, the coalition government is committed to generating certainty in the sector and strengthening the effectiveness of the franchising code.


Mr Wein's 2013 report stated, 'We have a good franchise industry model in Australia,' but nonetheless recommended some reforms. Thus Mr Wein made 18 substantive recommendations in relation to the code and the Competition and Consumer Act 2010, which is the renamed Trade Practices Act 1974. He also recommended about 24 technical amendments to improve and clarify the code rather than change the underlying policy. He was examining issues such as good faith in franchising, the rights of franchisees at the end of the term of their franchising agreement, and provisions for enforcement of the code. The government has been considering those recommendations in coming to its conclusions.


Importantly, the Wein review also concluded that there was widespread industry support for introducing pecuniary penalties to deter breaches of the Franchising Code. Of course, the question of pecuniary penalties for breaches of the code has been considered many times in the past. The government believes that this will promote better practice in franchising, which will in turn make the sector more attractive to investors, both locally and internationally. It is an example of the government's pragmatic and balanced approach to industry regulation.


It also highlights our abiding commitment to support small business. That is vital to my electorate of Eden-Monaro. Eden-Monaro is a predominantly rural seat and as such it is heavily dependent on small business for jobs. The provision of sustainable jobs is the No. 1 issue in my electorate, along with cost-of-living pressures. We believe that these reforms will support the creation of jobs and small business in regional and rural Australia.


The key part of this bill is to allow for the introduction of penalties to give teeth to the Franchising Code. Substantial penalties of up to $51,000 will apply. However, while the bill will allow the potential for penalties in other industry sectors, it will not apply to other industry codes unless separate policy and regulatory action is taken to specifically introduce penalties under those codes.


The minister has noted that this bill is the first step in a new era of regulation for the franchising sector. The bill is part of the government's comprehensive package of reforms to improve the way the franchising sector is regulated, and we will bring forward a new Franchising Code of Conduct to be progressed later this year, subsequent to the passage of the bill that we are discussing today. The new code will enhance and update the current code and will introduce an overarching obligation for parties to a franchising agreement to act in good faith in their dealings with each other. This is something that many of those in the franchising community have been calling for over many years. It will provide a mechanism to deal with the diversity of issues that often stem from the unique interdependent relationships in franchising.


As the minister stated, the term 'good faith' under the code will have the same meaning as in common law, but we will be providing some guidance for participants around what might be considered good faith. These measures go to the heart of strengthening business relationships and will underpin the wider reforms that we are making to the franchising regulation. It is expected that the new Franchising Code of Conduct will be finalised soon and will take effect from 1 January 2015.


I conclude by noting that, under the last Labor government, 519,000 jobs were lost in small business, while the number of employing small businesses declined by 3,000. When Labor came to government, small business employed some 53 per cent of the workforce. It is now just 43 per cent. That is a devastating blow to small business. Do not forget that most franchise businesses are small businesses. In the end, the story is very simple: we highly value the franchising industry. As a result we have been going through the issues in a purposeful and methodical manner. We will get it right and will provide for a sustainable and strong franchising sector. I commend this bill to the House.

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2014-08-28,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (10:18):  I rise to speak on the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Industry Code Penalties) Bill 2014. It is a great pleasure to follow the member for Eden-Monaro, who has such wide knowledge in this particular area. I would like to briefly talk about the franchising sector. There are currently 73,000 business units employing over 400,000 Australians, with estimated sales of $131 billion annually. It is an enormous section of our Australian economy. Here we are introducing a bill to improve that section.


How many speakers do we have from the opposition on this? A duck egg. Not one single member of the opposition here in this parliament today is prepared to speak on this bill about an important franchising sector. It is a sector of the economy that employs 400,000 people, and we cannot get one single speaker from the opposition. I think that says it all.


But we have seen this during the past six years. As the member for Eden-Monaro correctly said, we saw the small business sector in this country shed 518,000 jobs. I will say that again: 518,000 jobs. If you are at the MCG and you look up and there are 100,000 people there, you see enormous, vast crowds. To think that, under the previous Labor government, we could have filled that MCG five times over with the number of people from small business who lost their jobs and still have 18,000 people left over!


But, really, is it any wonder, when we look at what we were served up under the previous Labor government? There was a revolving door of small business ministers who did not have a clue about the subject that they were talking about. We had the good Dr Emerson, an economist and public servant. We had Mr Nick Sherry; his background was as a state secretary of an employees' union. Then of course there was Senator Arbib; his background was as the general secretary of the Australian Labor Party, and he was from the good old New South Wales Sussex Street branch. Then we had Mr O'Connor, whose background was as the assistant national secretary of the Australian Services Union. The current member for what used to be Prospect was an industrial officer for the Finance Sector Union and a ministerial adviser. And it goes on. Now we have the current opposition leader, who is now the spokesman for small business—though we hardly hear him mention the words—whose previous background was as the national secretary of the Australian Workers Union. So is it any wonder that, under the past six years of Labor government, those small business ministers seemed to think that their job was to make small business smaller? And they succeeded remarkably.


So now the coalition is proud to have, in Minister Bruce Billson, a minister for small business, in cabinet, actually getting on with the job and trying to get small business moving again. Just look at some of the things we have done in the short 12 months that we have been in office.


We have repealed the carbon tax, because the carbon tax was probably one of the things that hurt small business the most. That is gone. But we need to be ever-vigilant on that point, because we know that, should Labor ever come to power again, as sure as night follows day, that carbon tax will be coming back and they will be smashing small business with it; it will be the small business sector that will pay.


We have also established the $484 million Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Program which will provide practical support for businesses, including advice for people with relevant private-sector experience, and small co-contributions for re-engineering or regrowth opportunities for business.


We will provide an additional $304 million over four years to boost wage subsidies for mature-age job seekers, to get those mature-age workers with all that experience back in the workforce. I am sure that a lot of small businesses will be taking that up.


Most importantly, we have started the root and branch review of our competition act. That is an act that, under the previous six years of Labor government they said was—and they say now is—all fine, and that nothing needed or needs to be done. We need to look at that act seriously. We also know that the old section 46 of the Trade Practices Act on the misuse of market power is simply not working. We are seeing more and more concentration in industry, in almost every sector of the economy, squeezing out small business because of anticompetitive practices that are allowed here in Australia under our laws but would not be allowed to occur under the laws in other countries. And that is harming the most innovative, productive sector of the economy—the small business sector, which we need to provide those jobs in the future.


We have made changes to the tax thresholds, saving small business $56 million a year in red tape. We have also put money back into the ACCC so that they can actually run cases and look after the interests of small business. We saw the previous government basically let the ACCC's funding run out, because they had simply run out of money. Despite the difficult budgetary situation, we have put an extra $80 million into a funding boost to the ACCC so that they can actually get on and do their work.


Also important for small business is the export market development awards. It is most important to encourage small business to go out there and tackle that international economy. After all, over 98 per cent of the world's economy is beyond our shores. Small business has to look not only in Australia but also beyond our borders—especially to those growing areas of China, South-East Asia and India—to see what products we can sell to them. That is what we want to encourage our small business sector to do. We have also removed $48 million worth of red tape burden from small business by removing the burden on small business to have to be the pay clerk for the Paid Parental Leave Scheme.


Of course, with this bill, we are working to improve the franchising sector. The franchising sector does need some regulation because of the information imbalances—or information asymmetries, as they are often called—where the franchisee does not have the same information as the franchisor. Back in 1998, the previous coalition government brought in an industry code, and if you were setting up a franchise system you had to provide that code and certain disclosure documents to a potential franchisee. But one of the weaknesses of this code—and it has been developing and it will need further development as we go—is that if you broke the code there were no penalties involved.


This bill brings in a pecuniary penalty for breaches of the code. The penalty will be 300 penalty units, which is currently $51,000 maximum. I think this is a fair balance. People who want to use their money to go into a franchise system need to be sure that the person running that franchise is doing everything correctly, that they are acting in good faith and that, if they break the code, there is some mandated penalty. This should reinvigorate our franchising system throughout Australia and should give encouragement to people to actually take on a franchise and go into business and take those risks.


One of the big areas of concern for franchising, especially, in the retail sector, is the cost of retail rent in Australia. That is where a lot of disputes and business failures arise from. Fortunately, the Treasurer asked the Productivity Commission to undertake an inquiry into the relative costs of doing business in the retail sector in Australia. The Productivity Commission handed down an interim report, as at June 2013, which had some quite concerning information.


Firstly, the Productivity Commission did an international comparison of the costs of running a retail business in Australia. Why that is probably more than ever is that, in the past, we were almost like an island continent but today, with the internet, people can by fashion, books, clothing and many different products over the internet from overseas retailers. So like never before in our nation's history, our retail sector is actually competing with retailers overseas. We need to ensure that our retail sector and our Australian retailers—many of whom are in franchising—are internationally competitive. If they are not, they will lose business and the nation will lose business, lose employment and lose innovation.


The Productivity Commission's inquiry found a bit of good news. It found that the cost of rent for our supermarket sector is less than the cost of rent in the United Kingdom and the USA. That should be good news for consumers, but it still does not explain the reason that, when you go to a supermarket in Australia, you pay a higher price for a jar of Vegemite, which is made in Australia, than you would pay if you bought that same jar of Vegemite in the UK or in New Zealand. It does not explain why the price of Coca-Cola—probably the most basic supermarket staple in everyone's shopping trolley—is so much higher in Australia than it is elsewhere in the world. An excuse that has been given previously is that the cost to operate these supermarkets in Australia is much higher. But that excuse no longer holds up.


It is also concerning when we look at the comparison the Productivity Commission has done with respect to the clothing and fashion retailing sector. The Productivity Commission found that, on average, if you are a fashion retailer here in Australia, the cost of your rent is almost three times higher than it is for a retailer in the UK and the USA. That simply means that you have to have higher retail prices, which are paid for by the consumer. 


Although I am glad that the Treasurer got the Productivity Commission to go ahead and look at this, back in 2007, before I came to this place, I put together a paper along similar lines, called International retail rent comparisons: are Australian retailers at an international competitive disadvantage? In that paper in 2007, I detailed how occupancy costs and rents in Australia are three to four times higher than in comparative countries, whether we look at Europe, the USA, Canada or even Japan. This is something that we need to address. 


One of the great problems we have and the reason why this occurs is our local zoning laws. We have been trying to protect some of our large retailers from competition and shopping centres from our zoning laws. As when the government interferes in the market, when it puts those artificial restraints in, it distorts the market. The result is that our retail rents in Australia are three times higher than in the rest of the world. The ultimate victim of that? Yes, it is those small business people in the franchise sector. But the ultimate victim is the Australian consumer. If we do almost any international price comparison, the Australian consumer is paying far too high a price for the goods in retail shops in Australia.


This is a problem we must address, as I said previously. With the advent of the internet and the growing amount of online sales, we have to address this because we have to make our Australian retail sector competitive, and the way to do that is to allow the forces of the free market to operate. We simply cannot interfere to try and protect inefficient retail centres and retail shopping centres. We must allow people to set up new businesses, to establish new businesses, because that is the only way we can bring these retail rents back to the true market price. If we do an international comparison of office rents, our office rents are very similar to those in the rest of the world and in fact lower on a city-to-city comparison with the USA. But, when it comes to retail rents, we are out of step. That is harming our franchising sector. It is harming our consumers. These are some of the issues we have to address. I have great faith in our minister for small business, and these issues will be addressed, hopefully, in that root-and branch review of our competition policy.


The bill before us today, the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Industry Code Penalties) Bill, takes an important step towards strengthening our franchising sector. It will strengthen the relationship and the trust between the franchisor and the franchisee, introducing the provision that they both act in good faith and bringing in penalties for a breach of the code. This will strengthen the sector, it will strengthen small business, and I commend the bill to the House.

Ms SCOTT
 (Lindsay) (10:33):  I rise in support of the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Industry Code Penalties) Bill 2014. This amendment bill introduces a new franchise code of conduct into the Australian business sector. The franchise industry is a critical pillar of the small business community, particularly within retail, and includes amazing brands that we all know and love. Battery World, Gloria Jean's, McDonald's, Hungry Jack's, Subway, Hairhouse Warehouse, Pie Face, OPSM, Total Tools, Boost Juice, Grill'd, Bakers Delight, Terry White Chemists and Laser Clinics are just some of the brands that all Australians know and use every day of the week. All too often, it is these brands that fill our urban shopping centres, our high streets or even Queen Street in St Marys, and are local icons within the retail and shopping sector in Australia.


According to the NSW Business Chamber, 90 per cent of franchise businesses are in fact Australian and most franchise businesses are small businesses. So many Australians dream of owning and running their own small business. Often, when you talk to them about this dream, it involves a franchised coffee shop or a franchised clothes shop—a franchise where they think they can have autonomy, running their own life and running their own business. 


My upbringing was no different to many other types of families. My family started their own business in 1936. 


When a large multinational business decided to come into our area, in fact, to directly challenge my father's business and the life of our family,— our family home was mortgaged against the business—my father went with 10 other local businesses across the Sydney basin and started his own franchise. This franchise grew from being just a Sydney basin to right across Australia and then, eventually, into New Zealand. The business he started was, of course, the Auto One business. My experience within the franchise sector is not unique. It was through the Auto One business that we were able to compete with Federal Mobil at the time, hold onto our business. The business still exists to this day as does the Auto One group, although we have now sold the business on.


This sector has such great capacity. It has great capacity of nurturing small businesses. It has great capacity of our entrepreneurial community binding together, working together, being competitive against some of the multinationals. Today the franchise businesses in Australia number some 73,000, and employ over 400,000 Australians producing a sales turnover in excess of $131 billion annually. In fact, Australia is one of the most heavily franchised countries per capita in the world.


Since its introduction in 1998 the franchising code of conduct has been reviewed many times—eight times in fact. When the Howard government introduced this important piece of legislation it was to regulate the conduct of participants in franchising towards other participants in franchising. As the Minister for Small Business identified upon introducing this legislation in July, the code is now 16 years old and in the minister's words is beginning to look its age. This is why the coalition government is introducing a new franchising code, one that simplifies and modernises the way franchising is legislated, one that fulfils our election commitments to refine the franchising code, to strengthen its effectiveness, improve its responsiveness to the sector's unique commercial characteristics and tensions and also to guard against additional state based regulation.


The new code of conduct aims to strike the balance between the needs of franchisors and franchisees while understanding the unique nature of the relationship between them. We want to promote growth in this sector, reduce red tape and make sure all participants in the industry follow best practice principles. The reforms will give the ACCC greater flexibility in how it enforces the franchising code to encourage increased compliance and reduce disputes within the sector. Further, they will result in an estimated compliance saving $8.6 million annually for the sector.


In 2013 Mr Alan Wein conducted the most recent review of the franchising code. This independent review involved comprehensive stakeholder consultations across the franchising community and found that there was widespread industry support for introducing pecuniary penalties to deter breaches of the franchising code. The coalition welcomed the Wein review and its recommendations and at the time stated that it was a useful roadmap to franchise reform. Building on the recommendations and the strong feedback from stakeholders, in April 2014, this government took swift action to develop and release exposure drafts of the bill and the new franchising code for public comment. Feedback on the proposed reforms was very positive and received widespread support across the sector.


The ability to include civil penalty provisions in the franchising code is a key component of the reform package. The Competition and Consumer Amendment (Industry Code Penalties) Bill 2014 will facilitate a change to the way the franchising code of conduct is enforced by amending the Competition and Consumer Act to, firstly, allow regulations to be made that prescribe a pecuniary penalty not exceeding 300 penalty point units for a breach of a civil penalty provision of an industry code and allow the industry regulator, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, to issue an infringement notice where it has reasonable grounds to believe a person has contravened a civil penalty provision of an industry code.


These measures will more effectively deter breaches of the code and enhance the enforcement tools available to the ACCC, by allowing it to take rapid action when breaches of the code do occur. This will facilitate greater compliance across the sector and may assist in reducing the number of protracted, costly disputes. This better  practice in franchising will in turn make the sector more attractive to investors both locally and internationally.


The bill sets the limit for pecuniary penalty for contravention of an industry code at 300 penalty units, currently $51,000. The amount of an infringement issued by the ACCC for the code breach is 50 penalty units, $8,500, for a body corporate and 10 penalty units, $1,700, in any other case. The new code will also: improve disclosure by including the introduction of a short, easy-to-understand information statement for prospective franchisees; cut red tape by clarifying and streamlining provisions; improve the transparency of marketing funds; make franchisors more accountable to franchisees and required to pay for significant capital expenditure; and, finally, offer protections to franchisees by limiting, in a fair and balanced way, the enforceability of restraint-of-trade clauses at the end of a franchise agreement in special circumstances.


I am very passionate about this legislation, not just because of my family business background but because I also have had the privilege of working for Westfield, at Westfield Penrith, which was a post-acquisition development and rebranding of a billion-dollar shopping centre, and I met pensioners, or people who had just retired, who had taken their entire super and dumped it into a franchise. These were people that invested their whole future in getting that Donut King or that Gloria Jean's up and running. These are the people we need to protect. We need to make sure that they have the best possible go. These provisions will help so many of these businesses. They will help these businesses to be so much more competitive. We need to protect small business in this country. We need to protect the employment that small business creates. I commend the bill to the House.

 (Herbert) (10:42):  I have got some text I need to read first, and then I would like to make some comments, so bear with me, because the first bit is a bit dry. I rise to speak on the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Industry Code Penalties) Bill 2014. The amendments in this bill form part of the government's election commitment to refine the franchising code. The bill outlines the government's franchising policy reforms and builds on the 2013 Wein review, including: ensuring that franchisees and franchisors act in good faith—and that is the key term in these things and I will be speaking a little bit more about 'in good faith'—in their dealings with each other; introducing penalties for breach of certain provisions of the franchising code; improving the transparency of marketing funds; improving disclosure by including short-form, easy-to-understand information for prospective franchisees; and cutting red tape by clarifying and streamlining the Franchising Code of Conduct, reducing unnecessary and sometimes unclear provisions.


The coalition promises to reduce red tape for business. Tony Abbott's plan is to build a strong, prosperous economy. Small business owners told us that red tape was harming business across Australia. I see that in my electorate all the time. This government will ensure the franchise industry has the support it needs to flourish. That is why, before the election, we said we would refine the national franchising code. We want to promote the growth in the sector. We want to reduce red tape and we want to make sure all participants in the industry follow best practice principles. The government has also committed to guard against separate and additional state regulations.


We are the government helping small business, not hindering it. Just as an aside, I think that having a stand-alone Minister for Small Business in cabinet, under the Treasury portfolio, is a huge statement to the business community. I know there are a few complaints around the country about where our priorities lie in relation to portfolios, but I think it makes a massive statement to the people of small business that it is not just an adjunct to another portfolio. In my time in the parliament, we have had the one person in that portfolio. Bruce Billson takes this thing very seriously. When he speaks about the pillow talk of having to fill out the BAS and that sort of thing when he speaks to you in your electorate, you know that he has been there.


In relation to being a friend of small business: I think we have to get down to what we actually have done so far. We have axed the carbon tax and we have scrapped 50,000 pages of red tape, saving over $700 million this year. The government has committed to saving $1 billion each year. Josh Frydenberg, as the member for Kooyong and Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister in relation to red tape, is in charge of this repeal. We are having a second repeal day—it is coming up. The first one was a tidy-up of the books, if you like. What we are looking for a practical examples of where we can help business and get rid of that red tape, making sure that we are not ceding an area where a state government or a local authority can come in and crib some money back. So we are making sure that business will be protected on the way through.


We have implemented a dedicated small business support line, which has had over 100,000 calls in just eight months. Small business operators are now able to rely on advice from the Fair Work Ombudsman without fear of prosecution should the information provided by the Fair Work Ombudsman be incorrect. We have developed a 'Your First Employee' guide to help time-poor business to understand what to do when they hire their first employee.


The first franchising code was brought in by the Howard government in 1998 with the idea to regulate the conduct of participants in the franchising industry. Despite many reviews, the code is fraying at the edges and needs to be reviewed. The former government commissioned an independent review by Mr Alan Wein in 2013. The report found from evidence received that there was widespread industry support for allowing a court to impose a pecuniary penalty for some breaches of the code. But despite the then government supporting this and despite the then government asking for the report, Labor just failed to act. They failed to implement any policy before the last election. Labor once again left the work of the heavy lifting for the coalition.


Every speaker on this side has made the comment that under Labor 519,000 jobs were lost in small business. We faced the GFC and banks—everything like that—made it very hard for small businesses. But at the end of the day, it does not matter what the circumstances were: the facts speak for themselves—519,000 jobs lost. That is the challenge for us to get back.


The Abbott government supported Mr Wein's recommendations to make more flexible enforcement options available to the ACCC. Following the recommendations from the 2013 Wein review and ongoing consultations with the franchising sector, the government has committed to ensuring franchisees and franchisors act in good faith in their dealings with each other. We are use to the term 'in good faith' and we hope that the common law meaning of 'in good faith' is held as a central principle to these negotiations.


Currently, the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 does not allow pecuniary penalties to be imposed for a breach of the industry code. Nor does it allow the ACCC to issue an infringement notice in respect of a contravention of an industry code. The amendments will allow regulations to be made for a pecuniary penalty not exceeding 300 penalty points or $51,000 for a contravention of the industry code. The ACCC will be able to issue an infringement notice to the amount of 50 penalty points, or $8,500, if the person is a body corporate, and 10 points or $1,700 in any other case.


Franchising gives the public access to recognisable international and Australian brands. It is a great way for people—as the member for Lindsay was saying—who do not really have a business background to get a business model that works. That is the beauty of it. That is why you pay the fees to get into a franchise. It is not about starting something from scratch but taking someone else's business model which has been proven to work and you  try to make it work. That is the value of a franchise. So each party to a franchise agreement must act towards the other in good faith in respect of any matter arising under or in relation to the agreement of the franchising code.


A franchisor must provide a disclosure statement in the form set out in the franchising code to a franchisee or prospective franchisee and within the time frame set out in the clause.


A franchisor must provide a franchisee with an annual financial statement for marketing and for other cooperative funding, along with a disclosure document following a written request. A franchisor must give a franchisee reasonable notice where it proposes to terminate the franchisee agreement for breach and give the franchisee a reasonable time to remedy the breach. A franchisor must give a franchisee reasonable written notice where it proposes to terminate the franchise agreement and the reasons for the termination.


The hard part about all this is that a franchise agreement between a franchisee and a franchisor is pretty much like a marriage. There has got to be a lot of trust, and when there is trust between people who are not married to each other and there is money involved, there is a lot of tension there and this is where you need to get in—and I know the member for Hughes was jumping up and down about this as soon as he was elected in 2010, he has been speaking to me about franchising agreements.


The pressure to get the thing working and to start seeing an income leads people to try and reinvent the wheel. This is a two-way street: this is not just the franchisor cutting corners and getting the money and running; this can be the franchisee reinventing the wheel, moving away from that business model and not committing to the formula. We have to ensure that both parties act in good faith, that both parties understand the pressures that are involved here and work towards a great resolution.


There are 73,000 businesses employing over 400,000 people in Australia contributing in excess of $131 billion annually. The number of business franchisors has grown over the last four years, a period that spanned the peak of the global financial crisis. In contrast, the broader small business sector is recovering more slowly from the GFC.


When people are talking about banking to me, they say that getting money out of banks for small business is incredibly difficult. The banking regulations, the systems they use, the pressures they put on small business to perform and the interest rates they are charging for small business loans are very, very tough and onerous. There has been constant criticism in newspapers and journals in relation to the way the banking system has worked.


In my seat of Herbert in the City of Townsville, there are over 11,000 small businesses. Townsville has a very strong small business sector. We need to back small business and support the people who are willing to lose it all to get ahead. That is the thing: to go into business—I was never in my own business; I never had a ticker but I was also very, very aware of my strengths and weaknesses. I am a very good manager of somebody else's business, but I know my weaknesses when it would come to running my own business. I was never prepared to risk my house, my family's future and that sort of thing on that prospect. 


Townsville has a very small business sector, but we need to back small business and support the people who are willing to lose it all to get ahead. We have a diversified economy in Townsville, and that is under threat. Retail and franchising in particular is a major employer, and we need to make sure they have got that there.


These amendments will deter breaches of the code and enhance the work of the ACCC by allowing it to act, if a breach occurs. The government's changes strike the right balance between the needs of the franchisors and franchisees that reflect the unique nature of the franchise relationship. This will promote better franchise in business and will also make the sector more attractive to investors. The government must get out of the way of small business and get their hands out of their pockets.


Franchising is not easy. I have always said, with free trade agreements, that Minister Robb has been able to score. There are too many people in this world who think that with a free trade agreement, we just have to sit back once we have signed the agreement and the money will just keep rolling in. It is the same with a franchise: signing up for a franchise is the start of the hard work. It is not the end of the hard work. Deciding which franchise you want to be in is the beginning. After that comes a lot of hours, a lot of organisation and a lot of commitment. As the member for Lindsay was saying, people retiring from wage-earning businesses where they were not in business for themselves can find it a very, very rude shock of just how much work is required to run a franchise, a small business.


A friend of mine is an accountant and he does transitions when people get their superannuation. He says that, quite often, people will come and see him and say, 'We have got some money here and we want to invest in a business. We want to be able to work a couple of days a fortnight; be able to write our travel off to tax; and make $100,000 to $200,000 each on the way through.' Troy then leans across the table and says, 'If you think that business exists, do you really think that I would be here talking to you?' Those sorts of businesses do not exist.


All businesses require a lot of hard work to get them up and running. That is what the franchise arrangement is. The franchisor has to act in good faith to make sure that they are picking the right person to go into that business and that they are prepared for it. The franchisee has to understand that this is the start of the hard work and that putting the sign up over the front door is not a guarantee that people are going to come in. They must make sure that they stick to the business case—that they are doing everything right, that they are participating in the community, and that they are doing the extra things. You cannot cut corners when you own your own business; you must commit wholly. The one thing that you can go without when you are a small business owner is sleep. The business takes up a lot of your time and you must be prepared for that.


That is the whole thing about 'in good faith'. What the minister wants to do here is make sure that people on both sides of this arrangement understand their responsibilities. A franchisor cannot just sit there and say, 'Give me $50,000 and I will set you up in a business and that is all the work that has to be done.' I know the minister is a Richmond supporter, but Bruce Billson is a good man and he understands what people are going through in business. That is the thing: you do not have to have cancer to cure it. When you have been in a situation where you have seen a business struggle or you know how much work has to be done, that is when you really understand what needs to go into these negotiations. So when the minister is standing in front of these people and explaining what he wants, he is coming at it from the perspective that he knows how much work is involved. I like these amendments. I think they are common sense. I want all parties to understand that they are about working in good faith. I commend the government for this bill and I thank the House.

"Irons, Steve, MP",LP,2014-08-28,"



Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (10:57):  I am always pleased to follow the member for Herbert and listen to his experience in business. I rise to speak on the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Industry Code Penalties) Bill 2014. This bill will act as a first step in a series of much-needed amendments to Australia's franchising code. I have spoken previously in this place about the need to reform current codes of practice to ensure that the franchise industry is operating both fairly and ethically, particularly with regard to the conduct of franchisors towards franchisees. It has been obvious for a long time that reform is needed, but governments on both sides of the political divide have shied away from implementing the necessary amendments that will hold franchisors and, to a lesser extent, franchisees to account when unconscionable conduct takes place, such as nondisclosure. This is despite eight official reviews of the code taking place in the past eight years at the federal, state and territory levels.


As members in this place would know, franchises are predominantly small businesses. They are owned by families in each of our electorates, and these families quite often put their life savings into these businesses—believing that, by being part of a larger corporation, they will have the support they need to see their business thrive, rather than trying to develop their own business from the ground up. In the majority of cases this concept works well and Australia's franchising code provides the necessary mechanisms to facilitate contract agreements between franchisors and franchisees and sets out the procedures for dispute resolution when those instances arise. The national regulator for the code is the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, or ACCC.



As I have said before, one reason that people go into a franchise situation is that they do not have the necessary experience that they need to be able to run a business. They have the money—they might want to invest their superannuation or take a loan out against their house—and they rely on the franchisors to give them the experience and the necessary disciplines. But where there is churning or situations where they are in conflict, the franchisors always seem to have it over the franchisees, because they are the ones with the experience and the franchisees have gone to them in the first place. A number of these issues have been identified in the most recent review of the franchising code, by Mr Alan Wein—particularly in regard to the practical applications of the code, as I just said, unnecessary red tape impositions and concerns surrounding levels of disclosure in this unique business relationship.




Many of the issues outlined were not new to me, and I am sure they were not new to many of my Western Australian colleagues who, like me, have supported the plight of constituents in their electorates who were faced with severe financial distress and hardship as a direct result of franchisor conduct.


I acknowledge the member for Canning, Don Randall
,
 who has introduced two private member
'
s motions to this place calling for amendments to be made to the franchising code in relation to dispute resolution. Like Mr Randall, I have witnessed how the current franchise model and behaviour and 
the 
conduct of some franchisors ha
ve
 the ability to send franchisees into bankruptcy.





By way of background, in 2008 three Western Australian franchise owners came to my electorate office in a state of distress, as they were on the verge of financial ruin after purchasing and continuing to run a franchise business from a company called Michel's Patisserie.


I then proceeded to find out that this was not an individual case where the ability of the franchisees to run their business could potentially be questioned, but in fact five out of the 16 franchisees in Western Australia were in 
exactly 
the same position of distress
,
 along with at least another 10 in Queensland.


These middle-class, hardworking Australians placed their homes and financial lives at risk when they signed this franchise agreement based on 
the
 flawed business model where return on investment, without sufficient profits, was not forecast in the model provided.





As a result of this flawed model my constituent left the business and was left with a huge debt to the franchisor because the franchisor continued to trade with him when his business was clearly insolvent. When they did come to me they brought the necessary figures that were used to go to the bank in this situation and I looked and them and thought: I would never invest into a business on these figures
. T
hat 
is what their bank said as well
 when they went to the bank
:
 they said
, 'We won'
t invest on those figures.
'
 So they went back to the franchisor and said
, 'W
e 
can't
 get any finance,
'
 and 
the franchisor said, 'O
ur bank will finance it for you.
'
 That is the model that is actually flawed and this is what I am hoping this bill will help address.


The purpose of those franchisors clearly trading with the business while 
it was
 insolvent could only have been to drive him back into a position where he would have to sell the franchise back to the franchisor for a 'walk away' sum of money and then they could sell the franchise to another potential client—a concept, as I just mentioned before, known as 'churning'.





I have previously joined my Western Australian colleagues in calling for reforms to the Franchise Code to ensure there is greater accountability for unconscionable 
conduct, particularly in regard
 to nondisclosure, and to ensure the franchise industry is operating both fairly and ethically.


The coalition government has a strong record of supporting small business and we are progressively rolling out key policy measures such as the $484.2 million Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Programme to provide practical support for businesses
, and
 $304.1 million over four years from 2014-15 to boost the wage subsidy for mature age job seekers
. W
e have started the root
-
and
-
bra
nch review of competition laws
 and have implemented a dedicated small business support line within Fair Work, to name a few of those new progra
m
s.





The government has implemented these key measures because we understand small business and the vital contribution this sector makes to our communities and the economy.
 I know from looking at our side of the House that there are many people with small business experience and other business experience—so the coalition gets it.





Franchises are a significant part of this small business sector, which the coalition government recognised in 1998 when the Howard government introduced the original franchising code.


However, as I have previously stated, reform is needed.


This view was endorsed by Mr Wein in his review of the code, and by industry following significant stakeholder consultation during the review process and when exposure drafts of the bill were released for public comment by the Minister for Small Business.




I am pleased the government has swiftly acted on Mr Wein's recommendation by introducing the bill before the House today
,
 which will directly respond to my call for greater accountability for unconscionable conduct.

The government will achieve this by giving the ACCC greater enforcement tools to appropriately regulate this industry and determine its conduct by allowing it to apply fines to businesses which breach prescribed industry codes.


The ACCC does need more teeth on this particular issue. When I went to them in the first instance with the people who came to my electorate they said, 'We can't really help in franchise situations when they are already in court.' I said, 'I've got five live cases that aren't in court. Let's go for it.' Unfortunately, the ACCC failed to act and these people ended up still in bankruptcy. Hopefully this legislation will improve that situation and allow the ACCC to act on a far quicker and far more efficient basis.


Currently, there are a range of possible consequences for a breach of the franchising code, which includes arbitration in court. The types of orders that a court can make in these instances are, however, limited to providing a remedy. During the review process, stakeholders indicated that these remedies do not suitably deter breaches of the code and that sanctions imposed do not appropriately compensate for the harm that has been suffered. As I noted when assisting my constituents in their plight against a franchisor, some franchisors have been experts in creating a history of evidence that supports their argument that the franchisee was not performing to their model and therefore the franchisee deserves no protection or compensation from the authorities or the legislation in its current format.


The implementation of Mr Wein's recommendation to introduce pecuniary penalties and infringement notices as remedies for contraventions of the franchising code, which this bill will facilitate, will directly respond to this ongoing issue in the franchising sector. This is not a new recommendation in reviews of this code; however, it has never been introduced despite it being a necessary measure to effectively deter ongoing misconduct in the industry. Although statistics relating to the number of disputes and enquiries to the ACCC support the belief that problems in the sector are moderate to low, that does not mean issues do not exist and that appropriate amendments do not need to be made to resolve these issues.


It is clear from the types of complaints and enquiries that have been received that greater enforcement tools are necessary to effectively regulate the franchise industry. In 2013, the ACCC received 595 complaints and 189 enquiries relating to franchising. The Office of the Franchising Mediation Adviser reported 504 enquiries from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013. The highest level of complaints and enquiries in these instances related to exit and misrepresentation or deception, followed by other key issues including moneys owed by the franchisor, termination or renewal, and inadequate support. The amendments before the House will provide the legislative framework to allow pecuniary penalties to be imposed by the courts and infringement notices to be issued by the ACCC for breaches of the new code. 


The bill sets the upper limit for a pecuniary penalty for a contravention of an industry code at 300 penalty units, which is currently $51,000. The amount of an infringement notice issued by the ACCC for a code breach is 50 penalty units, or $8,500 for a body corporate, and 10 penalty units, or $1,700, in any other case. Infringement notices provide a timely, cost-effective enforcement alternative to commencing court proceedings and give the recipient the option of paying the penalty amount to avoid further action by the ACCC in relation to the alleged contravention.


Seeing these key reform measures implemented is important to me, not just because of the plight of my constituents but because franchises make up a significant part of Australia's small business sector, with the most recent Griffith University survey indicating that franchising contributed more than $130 billion to the national economy in 2012 and employed over 400,000 Australians. In 2012 there were approximately 8,400 franchises operating in my home state of Western Australia alone. Although figures are not available on an electorate level for franchises, as of June 2013 there were 16,153 small businesses in Swan. As a former small business owner myself, and Swan being home to many franchises—particularly in the automotive, retail and manufacturing sectors—I take a very keen interest in ensuring that government policy is aimed at facilitating their future success.


Although the bill before the House today will amend the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 to introduce pecuniary penalties and infringement notices, which will commence on 1 January 2015, a new franchising code will be put to the House at a later date to facilitate the implementation of other key recommendations by Mr Wein.


These changes to the code will result in an estimated compliance saving of $8.6 million annually across the sector by removing red-tape imposts, which is particularly important for the small business sector. As the Productivity Commission noted, small businesses feel the burden of regulation more strongly than any other business due to a lack of staff, time and resources, presenting challenges in understanding and fulfilling compliance obligations, so it is important that an unnecessary regulation is removed. As I previously stated, disclosure is a key concern amongst stakeholders in the franchising industry and reform is needed to improve transparency between franchisors and franchisees.


The new code will respond to this concern by including a requirement for franchisors to remind franchisees of their entitlement to a current disclosure document when notifying them that they intend to renew the franchising agreement. It will also include a short, easy to understand information statement for prospective franchisees to increase due diligence, and it will extend to online trading activities so that franchisees can assess the viability of their business if they also have to compete with franchisors conducting online sales. The new code will also respond to the concerns surrounding dispute resolution to ensure franchisors cannot impose their costs of dispute resolution on franchisees or require them to resolve disputes in a state other than the state in which the franchisee's business is based. An overarching obligation for franchisors and franchisees to act in good faith will also be introduced. It will remove confusion in the industry about whether the concept of good faith, as applied in common law, also applies to all aspects of a franchise contract by including this obligation in the legislation.


Greater transparency with regard to marketing funds will also be introduced to ensure franchisees receive meaningful information about expenditure of marketing and other co-operative funds. There will also be a specification in the code that marketing funds can only be used for expenses such as legitimate marketing or advertising expenses. The new code will also address concerns regarding onerous contract terms, including a franchisor's ability to impose unforeseen capital expenses such as refurbishments to retail premises, and concerns relating to trade clauses in instances where a franchisor chooses not to offer a franchisee a renewal of their agreement.


I look forward to the government's new Franchising Code being introduced in this place to improve the ACCC's ability to regulate the industry. I commend the bill to the House.

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2014-08-28,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (11:12):  I rise today to speak on the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Industry Code Penalties) Bill 2014 which implements the coalition government's policy of strengthening effectiveness and improving compliance with the Franchising Code of Conduct. The object of the Competition and Consumer Act is to promote competition and fair trading and to provide for consumer protection. The code aims to strike a balance between mandating best practice in relation to disclosure and not unduly constraining the operation of the market. The franchising relationship is rarely balanced. The franchisor generally has greater power because they are better resourced; they own or control the intellectual property, including trademarks, relating to the franchise business; they prepare the franchise agreement, which may be offered to a potential franchisee on a take-it-or-leave-it basis; they have broad and detailed knowledge of the business and its prospects; and they may control the supply of materials and other inputs to the franchisee.


Despite the popularity of franchising in Australia, there have been significant and often very public complaints about the operation of the franchising sector. In particular there has been widespread criticism about the lack of enforceability of the code. My electorate of Ryan has a strong small business population—upwards of 1,200—and a number of constituents who are franchisees have met with me to discuss the problems they have with their franchisor. It is this ongoing level of complaint within an apparently popular business model that has given rise to a number of high-level reviews. Between 2006 and 2008, there were five inquiries at the Commonwealth and state levels into franchising which sought to address allegations of misuse of power by franchisors. The most significant of these inquiries was carried out by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. The report, entitled Opportunity not opportunism: improving conduct in Australian franchising, called for significant legislative amendments.


Amendments were made to the code in 2007 and 2010, following which the previous Labor government stated that it did not intend to conduct any further reviews before 2013.


In January 2013 the government appointed Mr Alan Wein to review the code with particular focus on the efficacy of the recommendations that had been made to the code in 2007 and 2010, and other matters such as good faith in franchising, the rights of franchisees at the end of the term of their franchise agreements—including recognition for any contribution they had made to the building of the franchise—and the operation of the provisions of the act as they relate to enforcement of the code.


Currently, it is the problem of information between franchisors and franchisees that is the basis of the concerns about disclosure. The importance of accurate and up-to-date disclosure cannot be overstated. Its purpose is to give to a prospective franchisee or an existing franchisee, who is proposing to enter into a new franchise agreement or renew or extend the scope of their franchise agreement, information from the franchisor that will allow that person to make a reasonable and informed decision, not the franchise. In addition, it concedes the fact that there are often difficulties for franchisees attempting to carry out due diligence before entering into a franchising agreement as would occur, say, with the purchase of an existing business.


As Jenny Buchan of the Australian School of Business explains:


If the franchise is owned by a public company, there will be very little information that is specific to the wholly owned franchisor subsidiary in the published annual returns of the public company. 


While it is not difficult to conduct a search of proprietary company, franchisors often operate different aspects of their businesses through more than one legal entity. 


The more entities there are, the more expensive and difficult it becomes to conduct a robust due diligence. 


If any of those entities, including the franchisor, is in a trust, it is not possible to objectively verify the identity of the beneficiaries from the public records.


The franchisee, faced with the high cost or the impossibility of conducting a thorough due diligence for itself, will decide to trust the franchisor information more or less on face value. Or walk away. 


The code is designed to ensure that franchisees are given information that is material to the running of the franchise business and provide access to a fast and relatively inexpensive way to resolve any disputes. Broadly, it achieves this by requiring the franchisors to disclose specific facts to franchisees and to follow set procedures in their dealings with franchisees. However, pecuniary penalties are not currently available for breaches of the code, nor is the ACCC currently empowered to issue infringement notices for a likely breach of the code. These are issues that this bill will remedy.


The Law Council of Australia summarise the cautious arguments in favour of imposing civil pecuniary penalties for a breach of the code as follows: 


Penalties would operate as an effective deterrent to breaching the code … Due to the cost of justice, franchisees do not possess the resources to pursue franchisors, ie the sector is characterised by an imbalance of power and therefore the state should intervene. 


It is inconsistent that penalties do not exist for a breach of the code, given that penalties exist for other breaches of the Competition and Consumer Act, including the Australian Consumer Law. The introduction of penalties would increase the confidence of investors and parties to a franchise agreement. 


According to the Wein report, the ACCC as the industry regulator has argued that it should be able to issue infringement notices in addition to being able to seek pecuniary penalties for a breach of the code. This would be an appropriate penalty in circumstances where a franchisee has received an inaccurate or incomplete disclosure document from a franchisor. In particular, the payment of infringement notices in such circumstances would make the matter public and act as a deterrent to other franchisors. The Franchisee's Association of Australia has urged the parliament to pass laws which result in both civil and criminal sanctions for a breach of the code. 


The franchise industry has been the subject of a number of inquiries at the state and Commonwealth level since 2006. This has led to amendments to the code in order to overcome many problems which have been reported by franchisees. In addition, there have been, since 2006, significant steps to update the Competition and Consumer Act, including the codification of the prohibition against unconscionable conduct. 


The Wein review canvassed many of the same issues that were the subject of those earlier inquiries. The move to impose civil penalties for a breach of the code has long been resisted. What cannot be forgotten is that all breaches of the code will be liable for such a penalty—that is, a penalty can be applied equally to a non-compliant franchisee as a franchisor. 


The challenge for this coalition government was to consider the Wein review recommendations afresh and to apply an even-handed response which does not unduly tip the balance of the franchise relationship too far in favour of the franchisees to the detriment of franchising generally. The coalition government, in particular, supported Mr Wein's recommendation to make enhanced and more flexible enforcement options available to the ACCC.


The minister for small business, the Hon. Bruce Billson, described Mr Wein's report as 'a terrific road map about areas of important reform in franchising'. I believe that this bill has risen to the challenge and met the delicate balance between the franchisor and the franchisee to ensure that the franchise sector is improved overall, and I commend this bill to the house.

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley—Minister for Small Business) (11:24):  Madam Deputy Speaker Andrews, it was a great pleasure to receive the call from you and congratulations on your appointment. Firstly, I would like to thank all colleagues from all sides of the parliament that have contributed to this debate—really good contributions, insightful contributions, from the member for Eden-Monaro, the member for Hughes, the member for Swan, the member for Ryan, the member for Herbert and the member for Lindsay. I would also like to acknowledge the member for Oxley's contribution, particularly the encouraging news that Labor will be supporting this package. It is a very positive sign of the collaborative work that has gone on to get us to the point where we are today. 


This is an important day. Franchising is very important and a crucial part of our vision of a diverse, vibrant, enterprising economy. And franchising is a big deal. The franchise industry is very important to our economy and the small business community. There are around 73,000 franchising units operating in our economy, employing over 400,000 Australians, and they are producing a sales turnover estimated to be in excess of $131 billion annually. This is a big deal. 


We are the franchise capital of the world here in Australia, and so much of our learnings and insights are exported. What I am pleased to bring to the parliament is another instalment, another step, in a regulatory regime that has supported the growth, strength and confidence of franchising that so many enterprising Australians are a part of. This is what this bill goes to the heart of. 


Alan Wein's report in 2013 was very good and useful. As was quoted, it was a report that the coalition welcomed as mapping out a road map for further franchise reform. The task that we have had is to translate Mr Wein's recommendations into a legislative instrument, and not only the bill before the parliament today but also the code that will follow once these enabling provisions are passed. That has been an enormous piece of work. 


I recall being briefed by Mr Wein on his report and I said: 'Some of your recommendations are written in a conversational style of English. They're great to read. The question that follows is: how would you implement that?' I was encouraged by his advice that that was my problem to actually translate those wise—and I think conversationally communicated—recommendations into the instruments that we need to give effect to. He was quite happy to point out that that was our role and provide all the advice and support that he could, and he has. That is what has got us to the point where we are today.


The Competition and Consumer Amendment Industry Code Penalties Bill 2014 is a key component of our election commitment to introduce a package of reforms to improve the effectiveness of regulation of the franchise sector. The new national franchising code of conduct will be introduced later this year as part of these reforms, and this bill enables those provisions to be enacted. Some of the reform measures that will be in the code are outside the scope of the current enabling law, and that is why we have this amendment before the parliament today. 


The bill amends the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 to allow regulations to be made that prescribe a pecuniary penalty not exceeding 300 penalty units for the breach of a civil penalty provision within that code. It allows the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to issue an infringement notice where it has reasonable grounds to believe a person has contravened a civil penalty provision of industry code.


These respond to some of the observations that colleagues have raised. Under the previous code, if something was inconsistent with the code, the access to remedies, the tool kit available to the ACCC, the opportunity to simply deal with that salvaged the relationship between a franchisor and franchisee and let everyone get back to business, those tools were not available. So you would have a potentially exhaustive process to use broader powers within the competition framework, or in some cases the inappropriate conduct might go unaccounted for because it was too difficult to seek some kind of remedy. A party to that franchising relationship had every ground to be aggrieved about the conduct and could point to examples where the code had not been complied with. Yet the tool kit was not there to deal with that breach in a timely and responsive way. That is what we are trying to fix. Where there is aberrant conduct that is inconsistent with the code you deal with it quickly. Let the commission issue an infringement notice. Present the evidence. Allow the party whose conduct was inconsistent with the code to simply pay the infringement notice—they know they have done the wrong thing—and everyone can get back to business. This is what we are trying to achieve.


The penalty and infringement notice regime to be implemented by this bill represents a relatively modest penalty amount but it is targeted so that its application is balanced—it is a lighter touch approach—and it will give the teeth to industry codes to which it applies while preserving their co-regulatory nature. The new Franchising Code will specify the provisions that attract a pecuniary penalty. The bill will enhance the enforcement tools available to the ACCC to allow appropriate action to be taken against breaches of the new code and to produce greater deterrence outcomes. And, as I mentioned earlier, timeliness matters. You need to be able to deal with these issues quickly so that the harm and the consequences can be negated and so that an appropriate penalty is recognised for noncompliance. That is a crucial part of the reforms that we are seeking to introduce. This will encourage a higher compliance level across the sector and may assist in reducing the number of disputes, which in turn may reduce pressure on dispute resolution services or the need for costly litigation. We all know that, when a small business finds itself in court, it is often already at a disadvantage before the matter is even heard because of the imbalance in resources and the positions the parties can take.


We are seeking to introduce a maximum civil pecuniary penalty of 300 penalty units—which is currently $51,000—for breaches of certain provisions of the new code. It would have to be a serious breach to attract the upper reaches of the pecuniary penalty. Those serious breaches are of a kind that would undermine in a fundamental way the operations of the franchising relationship and result in detriment to the parties. Beyond that, there are further avenues available which a court can exercise. It is proportionate. More modest action can be taken decisively by the ACCC, and as you move to a higher level of penalty for more egregious breaches, that is where the court process comes in to seek authorisation for those stiffer penalties. Infringement notices of 50 penalty units for a body corporate—that is currently $8½ thousand dollars—will allow the ACCC to quickly and efficiently respond to less serious breaches. To go above that figure, to activate stiffer penalties for more egregious breaches, the commission will need to engage in a court process.


The introduction of pecuniary penalties for breaches of the new Franchising Code has been the subject of comprehensive consultation with industry stakeholders and has won broad support from the franchising community. That consultation has been at the heart of how we operationalise the Wein report recommendations. I commend my team, the Treasury officials, the ACCC officials and the many stakeholders not only for their contribution but also for the goodwill that they have displayed in collaboratively translating Alan Wein's excellent recommendations into the kind of legislative and regulatory instruments that give people confidence and clarity about the nature of the reforms and give effect to the intention that was behind the Wein report recommendations.


This measure will help enhance the business environment for franchisees and franchisors alike and will promote confidence and growth in what is already a vibrant and very substantial franchising sector in Australia. Importantly, it will lay the foundations for the new Franchising Code. The existing code has been in need of renovation and reform and this government has taken up that challenge after many years of calls for action to be taken. It did not happen under the previous government but it will happen under the Abbott coalition government. I am pleased that it will be introduced through regulations later this year and I expect that it will commence on 1 January 2015. I am encouraged by the bipartisan support for that measure from those on the other side of the chamber. Not only will these reforms be of benefit to the sector more generally; they will deliver an estimated net compliance reduction to the sector of $8.6 million annually. We never lose sight of our red tape and compliance burden reduction imperative. That is embedded in this work, as we seek to do with all of our work. This will reduce the red tape burden on businesses across the franchising sector. I commend this bill the House. I hope it has swift passage through the Senate. It represents a very important step in reforming a crucial area of our small business economy—that is the franchising sector.

"Hendy, Peter, MP",LP,2014-08-28,"



Dr HENDY
 (Eden-Monaro) (10:11):  I rise to support the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Industry Code Penalties) Bill 2014. I do not intend to speak for very long because I just want to make a few points. This bill is a significant advancement on the existing laws regarding franchising. As the Minister for Small Business stated in his second reading speech introducing the bill, the purpose of this bill is to enable the government to include civil penalty provisions in a forthcoming new franchising code. He noted that a breach of civil penalty provisions will expose a franchisor or franchisee to an infringement notice issued by the ACCC or a pecuniary penalty imposed by the court.


As I have previously told the chamber, as a former chief executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, I know a bit about this topic and I am well aware of the difficult balancing act that government regulation—rightfully, I might add—has to play in the relationship between franchisors and franchisees. Indeed, further to that I was personally involved in the introduction of the Franchising Code of Conduct, which was introduced by the Howard government in 1998. In 1998 I was the Chief of Staff of the Minister for Small Business. I was involved in a lot of the negotiations and know how difficult this area can be.


The franchising sector has been the subject of eight reviews at either the federal or state level over recent years. The last was an independent review by Mr Alan Wein in 2013. As the Wein review summarises it:


The Code is a prescribed, mandatory industry code under Part IVB of the CCA—


The Competition and Consumer Act. The report states:


Broadly, the Code requires franchisors to disclose specific facts to franchisees and to follow set procedures in their dealings with franchisees. The Code also provides a cost effective dispute resolution scheme for franchisors and franchisees.


The coalition government recognises that the franchise industry is a significant and growing part of the small business sector. A recent Griffith University survey indicated that franchising contributed more than $130 billion to the national economy and employed over 400,000 Australians. There are over 70,000 franchise business arrangements in Australia today.


The difficulty in dealing with regulation in this area is highlighted by the fact that there have been those eight reviews. This has created a high level of review fatigue and in moving forward in light of the recent review we are very cognisant of that fact. Indeed, the coalition government is committed to generating certainty in the sector and strengthening the effectiveness of the franchising code.


Mr Wein's 2013 report stated, 'We have a good franchise industry model in Australia,' but nonetheless recommended some reforms. Thus Mr Wein made 18 substantive recommendations in relation to the code and the Competition and Consumer Act 2010, which is the renamed Trade Practices Act 1974. He also recommended about 24 technical amendments to improve and clarify the code rather than change the underlying policy. He was examining issues such as good faith in franchising, the rights of franchisees at the end of the term of their franchising agreement, and provisions for enforcement of the code. The government has been considering those recommendations in coming to its conclusions.


Importantly, the Wein review also concluded that there was widespread industry support for introducing pecuniary penalties to deter breaches of the Franchising Code. Of course, the question of pecuniary penalties for breaches of the code has been considered many times in the past. The government believes that this will promote better practice in franchising, which will in turn make the sector more attractive to investors, both locally and internationally. It is an example of the government's pragmatic and balanced approach to industry regulation.


It also highlights our abiding commitment to support small business. That is vital to my electorate of Eden-Monaro. Eden-Monaro is a predominantly rural seat and as such it is heavily dependent on small business for jobs. The provision of sustainable jobs is the No. 1 issue in my electorate, along with cost-of-living pressures. We believe that these reforms will support the creation of jobs and small business in regional and rural Australia.


The key part of this bill is to allow for the introduction of penalties to give teeth to the Franchising Code. Substantial penalties of up to $51,000 will apply. However, while the bill will allow the potential for penalties in other industry sectors, it will not apply to other industry codes unless separate policy and regulatory action is taken to specifically introduce penalties under those codes.


The minister has noted that this bill is the first step in a new era of regulation for the franchising sector. The bill is part of the government's comprehensive package of reforms to improve the way the franchising sector is regulated, and we will bring forward a new Franchising Code of Conduct to be progressed later this year, subsequent to the passage of the bill that we are discussing today. The new code will enhance and update the current code and will introduce an overarching obligation for parties to a franchising agreement to act in good faith in their dealings with each other. This is something that many of those in the franchising community have been calling for over many years. It will provide a mechanism to deal with the diversity of issues that often stem from the unique interdependent relationships in franchising.


As the minister stated, the term 'good faith' under the code will have the same meaning as in common law, but we will be providing some guidance for participants around what might be considered good faith. These measures go to the heart of strengthening business relationships and will underpin the wider reforms that we are making to the franchising regulation. It is expected that the new Franchising Code of Conduct will be finalised soon and will take effect from 1 January 2015.


I conclude by noting that, under the last Labor government, 519,000 jobs were lost in small business, while the number of employing small businesses declined by 3,000. When Labor came to government, small business employed some 53 per cent of the workforce. It is now just 43 per cent. That is a devastating blow to small business. Do not forget that most franchise businesses are small businesses. In the end, the story is very simple: we highly value the franchising industry. As a result we have been going through the issues in a purposeful and methodical manner. We will get it right and will provide for a sustainable and strong franchising sector. I commend this bill to the House.

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2014-08-28,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (10:18):  I rise to speak on the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Industry Code Penalties) Bill 2014. It is a great pleasure to follow the member for Eden-Monaro, who has such wide knowledge in this particular area. I would like to briefly talk about the franchising sector. There are currently 73,000 business units employing over 400,000 Australians, with estimated sales of $131 billion annually. It is an enormous section of our Australian economy. Here we are introducing a bill to improve that section.


How many speakers do we have from the opposition on this? A duck egg. Not one single member of the opposition here in this parliament today is prepared to speak on this bill about an important franchising sector. It is a sector of the economy that employs 400,000 people, and we cannot get one single speaker from the opposition. I think that says it all.


But we have seen this during the past six years. As the member for Eden-Monaro correctly said, we saw the small business sector in this country shed 518,000 jobs. I will say that again: 518,000 jobs. If you are at the MCG and you look up and there are 100,000 people there, you see enormous, vast crowds. To think that, under the previous Labor government, we could have filled that MCG five times over with the number of people from small business who lost their jobs and still have 18,000 people left over!


But, really, is it any wonder, when we look at what we were served up under the previous Labor government? There was a revolving door of small business ministers who did not have a clue about the subject that they were talking about. We had the good Dr Emerson, an economist and public servant. We had Mr Nick Sherry; his background was as a state secretary of an employees' union. Then of course there was Senator Arbib; his background was as the general secretary of the Australian Labor Party, and he was from the good old New South Wales Sussex Street branch. Then we had Mr O'Connor, whose background was as the assistant national secretary of the Australian Services Union. The current member for what used to be Prospect was an industrial officer for the Finance Sector Union and a ministerial adviser. And it goes on. Now we have the current opposition leader, who is now the spokesman for small business—though we hardly hear him mention the words—whose previous background was as the national secretary of the Australian Workers Union. So is it any wonder that, under the past six years of Labor government, those small business ministers seemed to think that their job was to make small business smaller? And they succeeded remarkably.


So now the coalition is proud to have, in Minister Bruce Billson, a minister for small business, in cabinet, actually getting on with the job and trying to get small business moving again. Just look at some of the things we have done in the short 12 months that we have been in office.


We have repealed the carbon tax, because the carbon tax was probably one of the things that hurt small business the most. That is gone. But we need to be ever-vigilant on that point, because we know that, should Labor ever come to power again, as sure as night follows day, that carbon tax will be coming back and they will be smashing small business with it; it will be the small business sector that will pay.


We have also established the $484 million Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Program which will provide practical support for businesses, including advice for people with relevant private-sector experience, and small co-contributions for re-engineering or regrowth opportunities for business.


We will provide an additional $304 million over four years to boost wage subsidies for mature-age job seekers, to get those mature-age workers with all that experience back in the workforce. I am sure that a lot of small businesses will be taking that up.


Most importantly, we have started the root and branch review of our competition act. That is an act that, under the previous six years of Labor government they said was—and they say now is—all fine, and that nothing needed or needs to be done. We need to look at that act seriously. We also know that the old section 46 of the Trade Practices Act on the misuse of market power is simply not working. We are seeing more and more concentration in industry, in almost every sector of the economy, squeezing out small business because of anticompetitive practices that are allowed here in Australia under our laws but would not be allowed to occur under the laws in other countries. And that is harming the most innovative, productive sector of the economy—the small business sector, which we need to provide those jobs in the future.


We have made changes to the tax thresholds, saving small business $56 million a year in red tape. We have also put money back into the ACCC so that they can actually run cases and look after the interests of small business. We saw the previous government basically let the ACCC's funding run out, because they had simply run out of money. Despite the difficult budgetary situation, we have put an extra $80 million into a funding boost to the ACCC so that they can actually get on and do their work.


Also important for small business is the export market development awards. It is most important to encourage small business to go out there and tackle that international economy. After all, over 98 per cent of the world's economy is beyond our shores. Small business has to look not only in Australia but also beyond our borders—especially to those growing areas of China, South-East Asia and India—to see what products we can sell to them. That is what we want to encourage our small business sector to do. We have also removed $48 million worth of red tape burden from small business by removing the burden on small business to have to be the pay clerk for the Paid Parental Leave Scheme.


Of course, with this bill, we are working to improve the franchising sector. The franchising sector does need some regulation because of the information imbalances—or information asymmetries, as they are often called—where the franchisee does not have the same information as the franchisor. Back in 1998, the previous coalition government brought in an industry code, and if you were setting up a franchise system you had to provide that code and certain disclosure documents to a potential franchisee. But one of the weaknesses of this code—and it has been developing and it will need further development as we go—is that if you broke the code there were no penalties involved.


This bill brings in a pecuniary penalty for breaches of the code. The penalty will be 300 penalty units, which is currently $51,000 maximum. I think this is a fair balance. People who want to use their money to go into a franchise system need to be sure that the person running that franchise is doing everything correctly, that they are acting in good faith and that, if they break the code, there is some mandated penalty. This should reinvigorate our franchising system throughout Australia and should give encouragement to people to actually take on a franchise and go into business and take those risks.


One of the big areas of concern for franchising, especially, in the retail sector, is the cost of retail rent in Australia. That is where a lot of disputes and business failures arise from. Fortunately, the Treasurer asked the Productivity Commission to undertake an inquiry into the relative costs of doing business in the retail sector in Australia. The Productivity Commission handed down an interim report, as at June 2013, which had some quite concerning information.


Firstly, the Productivity Commission did an international comparison of the costs of running a retail business in Australia. Why that is probably more than ever is that, in the past, we were almost like an island continent but today, with the internet, people can by fashion, books, clothing and many different products over the internet from overseas retailers. So like never before in our nation's history, our retail sector is actually competing with retailers overseas. We need to ensure that our retail sector and our Australian retailers—many of whom are in franchising—are internationally competitive. If they are not, they will lose business and the nation will lose business, lose employment and lose innovation.


The Productivity Commission's inquiry found a bit of good news. It found that the cost of rent for our supermarket sector is less than the cost of rent in the United Kingdom and the USA. That should be good news for consumers, but it still does not explain the reason that, when you go to a supermarket in Australia, you pay a higher price for a jar of Vegemite, which is made in Australia, than you would pay if you bought that same jar of Vegemite in the UK or in New Zealand. It does not explain why the price of Coca-Cola—probably the most basic supermarket staple in everyone's shopping trolley—is so much higher in Australia than it is elsewhere in the world. An excuse that has been given previously is that the cost to operate these supermarkets in Australia is much higher. But that excuse no longer holds up.


It is also concerning when we look at the comparison the Productivity Commission has done with respect to the clothing and fashion retailing sector. The Productivity Commission found that, on average, if you are a fashion retailer here in Australia, the cost of your rent is almost three times higher than it is for a retailer in the UK and the USA. That simply means that you have to have higher retail prices, which are paid for by the consumer. 


Although I am glad that the Treasurer got the Productivity Commission to go ahead and look at this, back in 2007, before I came to this place, I put together a paper along similar lines, called International retail rent comparisons: are Australian retailers at an international competitive disadvantage? In that paper in 2007, I detailed how occupancy costs and rents in Australia are three to four times higher than in comparative countries, whether we look at Europe, the USA, Canada or even Japan. This is something that we need to address. 


One of the great problems we have and the reason why this occurs is our local zoning laws. We have been trying to protect some of our large retailers from competition and shopping centres from our zoning laws. As when the government interferes in the market, when it puts those artificial restraints in, it distorts the market. The result is that our retail rents in Australia are three times higher than in the rest of the world. The ultimate victim of that? Yes, it is those small business people in the franchise sector. But the ultimate victim is the Australian consumer. If we do almost any international price comparison, the Australian consumer is paying far too high a price for the goods in retail shops in Australia.


This is a problem we must address, as I said previously. With the advent of the internet and the growing amount of online sales, we have to address this because we have to make our Australian retail sector competitive, and the way to do that is to allow the forces of the free market to operate. We simply cannot interfere to try and protect inefficient retail centres and retail shopping centres. We must allow people to set up new businesses, to establish new businesses, because that is the only way we can bring these retail rents back to the true market price. If we do an international comparison of office rents, our office rents are very similar to those in the rest of the world and in fact lower on a city-to-city comparison with the USA. But, when it comes to retail rents, we are out of step. That is harming our franchising sector. It is harming our consumers. These are some of the issues we have to address. I have great faith in our minister for small business, and these issues will be addressed, hopefully, in that root-and branch review of our competition policy.


The bill before us today, the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Industry Code Penalties) Bill, takes an important step towards strengthening our franchising sector. It will strengthen the relationship and the trust between the franchisor and the franchisee, introducing the provision that they both act in good faith and bringing in penalties for a breach of the code. This will strengthen the sector, it will strengthen small business, and I commend the bill to the House.

"Scott, Fiona, MP",LP,2014-08-28,"



Ms SCOTT
 (Lindsay) (10:33):  I rise in support of the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Industry Code Penalties) Bill 2014. This amendment bill introduces a new franchise code of conduct into the Australian business sector. The franchise industry is a critical pillar of the small business community, particularly within retail, and includes amazing brands that we all know and love. Battery World, Gloria Jean's, McDonald's, Hungry Jack's, Subway, Hairhouse Warehouse, Pie Face, OPSM, Total Tools, Boost Juice, Grill'd, Bakers Delight, Terry White Chemists and Laser Clinics are just some of the brands that all Australians know and use every day of the week. All too often, it is these brands that fill our urban shopping centres, our high streets or even Queen Street in St Marys, and are local icons within the retail and shopping sector in Australia.


According to the NSW Business Chamber, 90 per cent of franchise businesses are in fact Australian and most franchise businesses are small businesses. So many Australians dream of owning and running their own small business. Often, when you talk to them about this dream, it involves a franchised coffee shop or a franchised clothes shop—a franchise where they think they can have autonomy, running their own life and running their own business. 


My upbringing was no different to many other types of families. My family started their own business in 1936. 


When a large multinational business decided to come into our area, in fact, to directly challenge my father's business and the life of our family,— our family home was mortgaged against the business—my father went with 10 other local businesses across the Sydney basin and started his own franchise. This franchise grew from being just a Sydney basin to right across Australia and then, eventually, into New Zealand. The business he started was, of course, the Auto One business. My experience within the franchise sector is not unique. It was through the Auto One business that we were able to compete with Federal Mobil at the time, hold onto our business. The business still exists to this day as does the Auto One group, although we have now sold the business on.


This sector has such great capacity. It has great capacity of nurturing small businesses. It has great capacity of our entrepreneurial community binding together, working together, being competitive against some of the multinationals. Today the franchise businesses in Australia number some 73,000, and employ over 400,000 Australians producing a sales turnover in excess of $131 billion annually. In fact, Australia is one of the most heavily franchised countries per capita in the world.


Since its introduction in 1998 the franchising code of conduct has been reviewed many times—eight times in fact. When the Howard government introduced this important piece of legislation it was to regulate the conduct of participants in franchising towards other participants in franchising. As the Minister for Small Business identified upon introducing this legislation in July, the code is now 16 years old and in the minister's words is beginning to look its age. This is why the coalition government is introducing a new franchising code, one that simplifies and modernises the way franchising is legislated, one that fulfils our election commitments to refine the franchising code, to strengthen its effectiveness, improve its responsiveness to the sector's unique commercial characteristics and tensions and also to guard against additional state based regulation.


The new code of conduct aims to strike the balance between the needs of franchisors and franchisees while understanding the unique nature of the relationship between them. We want to promote growth in this sector, reduce red tape and make sure all participants in the industry follow best practice principles. The reforms will give the ACCC greater flexibility in how it enforces the franchising code to encourage increased compliance and reduce disputes within the sector. Further, they will result in an estimated compliance saving $8.6 million annually for the sector.


In 2013 Mr Alan Wein conducted the most recent review of the franchising code. This independent review involved comprehensive stakeholder consultations across the franchising community and found that there was widespread industry support for introducing pecuniary penalties to deter breaches of the franchising code. The coalition welcomed the Wein review and its recommendations and at the time stated that it was a useful roadmap to franchise reform. Building on the recommendations and the strong feedback from stakeholders, in April 2014, this government took swift action to develop and release exposure drafts of the bill and the new franchising code for public comment. Feedback on the proposed reforms was very positive and received widespread support across the sector.


The ability to include civil penalty provisions in the franchising code is a key component of the reform package. The Competition and Consumer Amendment (Industry Code Penalties) Bill 2014 will facilitate a change to the way the franchising code of conduct is enforced by amending the Competition and Consumer Act to, firstly, allow regulations to be made that prescribe a pecuniary penalty not exceeding 300 penalty point units for a breach of a civil penalty provision of an industry code and allow the industry regulator, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, to issue an infringement notice where it has reasonable grounds to believe a person has contravened a civil penalty provision of an industry code.


These measures will more effectively deter breaches of the code and enhance the enforcement tools available to the ACCC, by allowing it to take rapid action when breaches of the code do occur. This will facilitate greater compliance across the sector and may assist in reducing the number of protracted, costly disputes. This better  practice in franchising will in turn make the sector more attractive to investors both locally and internationally.


The bill sets the limit for pecuniary penalty for contravention of an industry code at 300 penalty units, currently $51,000. The amount of an infringement issued by the ACCC for the code breach is 50 penalty units, $8,500, for a body corporate and 10 penalty units, $1,700, in any other case. The new code will also: improve disclosure by including the introduction of a short, easy-to-understand information statement for prospective franchisees; cut red tape by clarifying and streamlining provisions; improve the transparency of marketing funds; make franchisors more accountable to franchisees and required to pay for significant capital expenditure; and, finally, offer protections to franchisees by limiting, in a fair and balanced way, the enforceability of restraint-of-trade clauses at the end of a franchise agreement in special circumstances.


I am very passionate about this legislation, not just because of my family business background but because I also have had the privilege of working for Westfield, at Westfield Penrith, which was a post-acquisition development and rebranding of a billion-dollar shopping centre, and I met pensioners, or people who had just retired, who had taken their entire super and dumped it into a franchise. These were people that invested their whole future in getting that Donut King or that Gloria Jean's up and running. These are the people we need to protect. We need to make sure that they have the best possible go. These provisions will help so many of these businesses. They will help these businesses to be so much more competitive. We need to protect small business in this country. We need to protect the employment that small business creates. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (10:42):  I have got some text I need to read first, and then I would like to make some comments, so bear with me, because the first bit is a bit dry. I rise to speak on the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Industry Code Penalties) Bill 2014. The amendments in this bill form part of the government's election commitment to refine the franchising code. The bill outlines the government's franchising policy reforms and builds on the 2013 Wein review, including: ensuring that franchisees and franchisors act in good faith—and that is the key term in these things and I will be speaking a little bit more about 'in good faith'—in their dealings with each other; introducing penalties for breach of certain provisions of the franchising code; improving the transparency of marketing funds; improving disclosure by including short-form, easy-to-understand information for prospective franchisees; and cutting red tape by clarifying and streamlining the Franchising Code of Conduct, reducing unnecessary and sometimes unclear provisions.


The coalition promises to reduce red tape for business. Tony Abbott's plan is to build a strong, prosperous economy. Small business owners told us that red tape was harming business across Australia. I see that in my electorate all the time. This government will ensure the franchise industry has the support it needs to flourish. That is why, before the election, we said we would refine the national franchising code. We want to promote the growth in the sector. We want to reduce red tape and we want to make sure all participants in the industry follow best practice principles. The government has also committed to guard against separate and additional state regulations.


We are the government helping small business, not hindering it. Just as an aside, I think that having a stand-alone Minister for Small Business in cabinet, under the Treasury portfolio, is a huge statement to the business community. I know there are a few complaints around the country about where our priorities lie in relation to portfolios, but I think it makes a massive statement to the people of small business that it is not just an adjunct to another portfolio. In my time in the parliament, we have had the one person in that portfolio. Bruce Billson takes this thing very seriously. When he speaks about the pillow talk of having to fill out the BAS and that sort of thing when he speaks to you in your electorate, you know that he has been there.


In relation to being a friend of small business: I think we have to get down to what we actually have done so far. We have axed the carbon tax and we have scrapped 50,000 pages of red tape, saving over $700 million this year. The government has committed to saving $1 billion each year. Josh Frydenberg, as the member for Kooyong and Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister in relation to red tape, is in charge of this repeal. We are having a second repeal day—it is coming up. The first one was a tidy-up of the books, if you like. What we are looking for a practical examples of where we can help business and get rid of that red tape, making sure that we are not ceding an area where a state government or a local authority can come in and crib some money back. So we are making sure that business will be protected on the way through.


We have implemented a dedicated small business support line, which has had over 100,000 calls in just eight months. Small business operators are now able to rely on advice from the Fair Work Ombudsman without fear of prosecution should the information provided by the Fair Work Ombudsman be incorrect. We have developed a 'Your First Employee' guide to help time-poor business to understand what to do when they hire their first employee.


The first franchising code was brought in by the Howard government in 1998 with the idea to regulate the conduct of participants in the franchising industry. Despite many reviews, the code is fraying at the edges and needs to be reviewed. The former government commissioned an independent review by Mr Alan Wein in 2013. The report found from evidence received that there was widespread industry support for allowing a court to impose a pecuniary penalty for some breaches of the code. But despite the then government supporting this and despite the then government asking for the report, Labor just failed to act. They failed to implement any policy before the last election. Labor once again left the work of the heavy lifting for the coalition.


Every speaker on this side has made the comment that under Labor 519,000 jobs were lost in small business. We faced the GFC and banks—everything like that—made it very hard for small businesses. But at the end of the day, it does not matter what the circumstances were: the facts speak for themselves—519,000 jobs lost. That is the challenge for us to get back.


The Abbott government supported Mr Wein's recommendations to make more flexible enforcement options available to the ACCC. Following the recommendations from the 2013 Wein review and ongoing consultations with the franchising sector, the government has committed to ensuring franchisees and franchisors act in good faith in their dealings with each other. We are use to the term 'in good faith' and we hope that the common law meaning of 'in good faith' is held as a central principle to these negotiations.


Currently, the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 does not allow pecuniary penalties to be imposed for a breach of the industry code. Nor does it allow the ACCC to issue an infringement notice in respect of a contravention of an industry code. The amendments will allow regulations to be made for a pecuniary penalty not exceeding 300 penalty points or $51,000 for a contravention of the industry code. The ACCC will be able to issue an infringement notice to the amount of 50 penalty points, or $8,500, if the person is a body corporate, and 10 points or $1,700 in any other case.


Franchising gives the public access to recognisable international and Australian brands. It is a great way for people—as the member for Lindsay was saying—who do not really have a business background to get a business model that works. That is the beauty of it. That is why you pay the fees to get into a franchise. It is not about starting something from scratch but taking someone else's business model which has been proven to work and you  try to make it work. That is the value of a franchise. So each party to a franchise agreement must act towards the other in good faith in respect of any matter arising under or in relation to the agreement of the franchising code.


A franchisor must provide a disclosure statement in the form set out in the franchising code to a franchisee or prospective franchisee and within the time frame set out in the clause.


A franchisor must provide a franchisee with an annual financial statement for marketing and for other cooperative funding, along with a disclosure document following a written request. A franchisor must give a franchisee reasonable notice where it proposes to terminate the franchisee agreement for breach and give the franchisee a reasonable time to remedy the breach. A franchisor must give a franchisee reasonable written notice where it proposes to terminate the franchise agreement and the reasons for the termination.


The hard part about all this is that a franchise agreement between a franchisee and a franchisor is pretty much like a marriage. There has got to be a lot of trust, and when there is trust between people who are not married to each other and there is money involved, there is a lot of tension there and this is where you need to get in—and I know the member for Hughes was jumping up and down about this as soon as he was elected in 2010, he has been speaking to me about franchising agreements.


The pressure to get the thing working and to start seeing an income leads people to try and reinvent the wheel. This is a two-way street: this is not just the franchisor cutting corners and getting the money and running; this can be the franchisee reinventing the wheel, moving away from that business model and not committing to the formula. We have to ensure that both parties act in good faith, that both parties understand the pressures that are involved here and work towards a great resolution.


There are 73,000 businesses employing over 400,000 people in Australia contributing in excess of $131 billion annually. The number of business franchisors has grown over the last four years, a period that spanned the peak of the global financial crisis. In contrast, the broader small business sector is recovering more slowly from the GFC.


When people are talking about banking to me, they say that getting money out of banks for small business is incredibly difficult. The banking regulations, the systems they use, the pressures they put on small business to perform and the interest rates they are charging for small business loans are very, very tough and onerous. There has been constant criticism in newspapers and journals in relation to the way the banking system has worked.


In my seat of Herbert in the City of Townsville, there are over 11,000 small businesses. Townsville has a very strong small business sector. We need to back small business and support the people who are willing to lose it all to get ahead. That is the thing: to go into business—I was never in my own business; I never had a ticker but I was also very, very aware of my strengths and weaknesses. I am a very good manager of somebody else's business, but I know my weaknesses when it would come to running my own business. I was never prepared to risk my house, my family's future and that sort of thing on that prospect. 


Townsville has a very small business sector, but we need to back small business and support the people who are willing to lose it all to get ahead. We have a diversified economy in Townsville, and that is under threat. Retail and franchising in particular is a major employer, and we need to make sure they have got that there.


These amendments will deter breaches of the code and enhance the work of the ACCC by allowing it to act, if a breach occurs. The government's changes strike the right balance between the needs of the franchisors and franchisees that reflect the unique nature of the franchise relationship. This will promote better franchise in business and will also make the sector more attractive to investors. The government must get out of the way of small business and get their hands out of their pockets.


Franchising is not easy. I have always said, with free trade agreements, that Minister Robb has been able to score. There are too many people in this world who think that with a free trade agreement, we just have to sit back once we have signed the agreement and the money will just keep rolling in. It is the same with a franchise: signing up for a franchise is the start of the hard work. It is not the end of the hard work. Deciding which franchise you want to be in is the beginning. After that comes a lot of hours, a lot of organisation and a lot of commitment. As the member for Lindsay was saying, people retiring from wage-earning businesses where they were not in business for themselves can find it a very, very rude shock of just how much work is required to run a franchise, a small business.


A friend of mine is an accountant and he does transitions when people get their superannuation. He says that, quite often, people will come and see him and say, 'We have got some money here and we want to invest in a business. We want to be able to work a couple of days a fortnight; be able to write our travel off to tax; and make $100,000 to $200,000 each on the way through.' Troy then leans across the table and says, 'If you think that business exists, do you really think that I would be here talking to you?' Those sorts of businesses do not exist.


All businesses require a lot of hard work to get them up and running. That is what the franchise arrangement is. The franchisor has to act in good faith to make sure that they are picking the right person to go into that business and that they are prepared for it. The franchisee has to understand that this is the start of the hard work and that putting the sign up over the front door is not a guarantee that people are going to come in. They must make sure that they stick to the business case—that they are doing everything right, that they are participating in the community, and that they are doing the extra things. You cannot cut corners when you own your own business; you must commit wholly. The one thing that you can go without when you are a small business owner is sleep. The business takes up a lot of your time and you must be prepared for that.


That is the whole thing about 'in good faith'. What the minister wants to do here is make sure that people on both sides of this arrangement understand their responsibilities. A franchisor cannot just sit there and say, 'Give me $50,000 and I will set you up in a business and that is all the work that has to be done.' I know the minister is a Richmond supporter, but Bruce Billson is a good man and he understands what people are going through in business. That is the thing: you do not have to have cancer to cure it. When you have been in a situation where you have seen a business struggle or you know how much work has to be done, that is when you really understand what needs to go into these negotiations. So when the minister is standing in front of these people and explaining what he wants, he is coming at it from the perspective that he knows how much work is involved. I like these amendments. I think they are common sense. I want all parties to understand that they are about working in good faith. I commend the government for this bill and I thank the House.

"Irons, Steve, MP",LP,2014-08-28,"



Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (10:57):  I am always pleased to follow the member for Herbert and listen to his experience in business. I rise to speak on the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Industry Code Penalties) Bill 2014. This bill will act as a first step in a series of much-needed amendments to Australia's franchising code. I have spoken previously in this place about the need to reform current codes of practice to ensure that the franchise industry is operating both fairly and ethically, particularly with regard to the conduct of franchisors towards franchisees. It has been obvious for a long time that reform is needed, but governments on both sides of the political divide have shied away from implementing the necessary amendments that will hold franchisors and, to a lesser extent, franchisees to account when unconscionable conduct takes place, such as nondisclosure. This is despite eight official reviews of the code taking place in the past eight years at the federal, state and territory levels.


As members in this place would know, franchises are predominantly small businesses. They are owned by families in each of our electorates, and these families quite often put their life savings into these businesses—believing that, by being part of a larger corporation, they will have the support they need to see their business thrive, rather than trying to develop their own business from the ground up. In the majority of cases this concept works well and Australia's franchising code provides the necessary mechanisms to facilitate contract agreements between franchisors and franchisees and sets out the procedures for dispute resolution when those instances arise. The national regulator for the code is the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, or ACCC.



As I have said before, one reason that people go into a franchise situation is that they do not have the necessary experience that they need to be able to run a business. They have the money—they might want to invest their superannuation or take a loan out against their house—and they rely on the franchisors to give them the experience and the necessary disciplines. But where there is churning or situations where they are in conflict, the franchisors always seem to have it over the franchisees, because they are the ones with the experience and the franchisees have gone to them in the first place. A number of these issues have been identified in the most recent review of the franchising code, by Mr Alan Wein—particularly in regard to the practical applications of the code, as I just said, unnecessary red tape impositions and concerns surrounding levels of disclosure in this unique business relationship.




Many of the issues outlined were not new to me, and I am sure they were not new to many of my Western Australian colleagues who, like me, have supported the plight of constituents in their electorates who were faced with severe financial distress and hardship as a direct result of franchisor conduct.


I acknowledge the member for Canning, Don Randall
,
 who has introduced two private member
'
s motions to this place calling for amendments to be made to the franchising code in relation to dispute resolution. Like Mr Randall, I have witnessed how the current franchise model and behaviour and 
the 
conduct of some franchisors ha
ve
 the ability to send franchisees into bankruptcy.





By way of background, in 2008 three Western Australian franchise owners came to my electorate office in a state of distress, as they were on the verge of financial ruin after purchasing and continuing to run a franchise business from a company called Michel's Patisserie.


I then proceeded to find out that this was not an individual case where the ability of the franchisees to run their business could potentially be questioned, but in fact five out of the 16 franchisees in Western Australia were in 
exactly 
the same position of distress
,
 along with at least another 10 in Queensland.


These middle-class, hardworking Australians placed their homes and financial lives at risk when they signed this franchise agreement based on 
the
 flawed business model where return on investment, without sufficient profits, was not forecast in the model provided.





As a result of this flawed model my constituent left the business and was left with a huge debt to the franchisor because the franchisor continued to trade with him when his business was clearly insolvent. When they did come to me they brought the necessary figures that were used to go to the bank in this situation and I looked and them and thought: I would never invest into a business on these figures
. T
hat 
is what their bank said as well
 when they went to the bank
:
 they said
, 'We won'
t invest on those figures.
'
 So they went back to the franchisor and said
, 'W
e 
can't
 get any finance,
'
 and 
the franchisor said, 'O
ur bank will finance it for you.
'
 That is the model that is actually flawed and this is what I am hoping this bill will help address.


The purpose of those franchisors clearly trading with the business while 
it was
 insolvent could only have been to drive him back into a position where he would have to sell the franchise back to the franchisor for a 'walk away' sum of money and then they could sell the franchise to another potential client—a concept, as I just mentioned before, known as 'churning'.





I have previously joined my Western Australian colleagues in calling for reforms to the Franchise Code to ensure there is greater accountability for unconscionable 
conduct, particularly in regard
 to nondisclosure, and to ensure the franchise industry is operating both fairly and ethically.


The coalition government has a strong record of supporting small business and we are progressively rolling out key policy measures such as the $484.2 million Entrepreneurs' Infrastructure Programme to provide practical support for businesses
, and
 $304.1 million over four years from 2014-15 to boost the wage subsidy for mature age job seekers
. W
e have started the root
-
and
-
bra
nch review of competition laws
 and have implemented a dedicated small business support line within Fair Work, to name a few of those new progra
m
s.





The government has implemented these key measures because we understand small business and the vital contribution this sector makes to our communities and the economy.
 I know from looking at our side of the House that there are many people with small business experience and other business experience—so the coalition gets it.





Franchises are a significant part of this small business sector, which the coalition government recognised in 1998 when the Howard government introduced the original franchising code.


However, as I have previously stated, reform is needed.


This view was endorsed by Mr Wein in his review of the code, and by industry following significant stakeholder consultation during the review process and when exposure drafts of the bill were released for public comment by the Minister for Small Business.




I am pleased the government has swiftly acted on Mr Wein's recommendation by introducing the bill before the House today
,
 which will directly respond to my call for greater accountability for unconscionable conduct.

The government will achieve this by giving the ACCC greater enforcement tools to appropriately regulate this industry and determine its conduct by allowing it to apply fines to businesses which breach prescribed industry codes.


The ACCC does need more teeth on this particular issue. When I went to them in the first instance with the people who came to my electorate they said, 'We can't really help in franchise situations when they are already in court.' I said, 'I've got five live cases that aren't in court. Let's go for it.' Unfortunately, the ACCC failed to act and these people ended up still in bankruptcy. Hopefully this legislation will improve that situation and allow the ACCC to act on a far quicker and far more efficient basis.


Currently, there are a range of possible consequences for a breach of the franchising code, which includes arbitration in court. The types of orders that a court can make in these instances are, however, limited to providing a remedy. During the review process, stakeholders indicated that these remedies do not suitably deter breaches of the code and that sanctions imposed do not appropriately compensate for the harm that has been suffered. As I noted when assisting my constituents in their plight against a franchisor, some franchisors have been experts in creating a history of evidence that supports their argument that the franchisee was not performing to their model and therefore the franchisee deserves no protection or compensation from the authorities or the legislation in its current format.


The implementation of Mr Wein's recommendation to introduce pecuniary penalties and infringement notices as remedies for contraventions of the franchising code, which this bill will facilitate, will directly respond to this ongoing issue in the franchising sector. This is not a new recommendation in reviews of this code; however, it has never been introduced despite it being a necessary measure to effectively deter ongoing misconduct in the industry. Although statistics relating to the number of disputes and enquiries to the ACCC support the belief that problems in the sector are moderate to low, that does not mean issues do not exist and that appropriate amendments do not need to be made to resolve these issues.


It is clear from the types of complaints and enquiries that have been received that greater enforcement tools are necessary to effectively regulate the franchise industry. In 2013, the ACCC received 595 complaints and 189 enquiries relating to franchising. The Office of the Franchising Mediation Adviser reported 504 enquiries from 1 July 2012 to 30 June 2013. The highest level of complaints and enquiries in these instances related to exit and misrepresentation or deception, followed by other key issues including moneys owed by the franchisor, termination or renewal, and inadequate support. The amendments before the House will provide the legislative framework to allow pecuniary penalties to be imposed by the courts and infringement notices to be issued by the ACCC for breaches of the new code. 


The bill sets the upper limit for a pecuniary penalty for a contravention of an industry code at 300 penalty units, which is currently $51,000. The amount of an infringement notice issued by the ACCC for a code breach is 50 penalty units, or $8,500 for a body corporate, and 10 penalty units, or $1,700, in any other case. Infringement notices provide a timely, cost-effective enforcement alternative to commencing court proceedings and give the recipient the option of paying the penalty amount to avoid further action by the ACCC in relation to the alleged contravention.


Seeing these key reform measures implemented is important to me, not just because of the plight of my constituents but because franchises make up a significant part of Australia's small business sector, with the most recent Griffith University survey indicating that franchising contributed more than $130 billion to the national economy in 2012 and employed over 400,000 Australians. In 2012 there were approximately 8,400 franchises operating in my home state of Western Australia alone. Although figures are not available on an electorate level for franchises, as of June 2013 there were 16,153 small businesses in Swan. As a former small business owner myself, and Swan being home to many franchises—particularly in the automotive, retail and manufacturing sectors—I take a very keen interest in ensuring that government policy is aimed at facilitating their future success.


Although the bill before the House today will amend the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 to introduce pecuniary penalties and infringement notices, which will commence on 1 January 2015, a new franchising code will be put to the House at a later date to facilitate the implementation of other key recommendations by Mr Wein.


These changes to the code will result in an estimated compliance saving of $8.6 million annually across the sector by removing red-tape imposts, which is particularly important for the small business sector. As the Productivity Commission noted, small businesses feel the burden of regulation more strongly than any other business due to a lack of staff, time and resources, presenting challenges in understanding and fulfilling compliance obligations, so it is important that an unnecessary regulation is removed. As I previously stated, disclosure is a key concern amongst stakeholders in the franchising industry and reform is needed to improve transparency between franchisors and franchisees.


The new code will respond to this concern by including a requirement for franchisors to remind franchisees of their entitlement to a current disclosure document when notifying them that they intend to renew the franchising agreement. It will also include a short, easy to understand information statement for prospective franchisees to increase due diligence, and it will extend to online trading activities so that franchisees can assess the viability of their business if they also have to compete with franchisors conducting online sales. The new code will also respond to the concerns surrounding dispute resolution to ensure franchisors cannot impose their costs of dispute resolution on franchisees or require them to resolve disputes in a state other than the state in which the franchisee's business is based. An overarching obligation for franchisors and franchisees to act in good faith will also be introduced. It will remove confusion in the industry about whether the concept of good faith, as applied in common law, also applies to all aspects of a franchise contract by including this obligation in the legislation.


Greater transparency with regard to marketing funds will also be introduced to ensure franchisees receive meaningful information about expenditure of marketing and other co-operative funds. There will also be a specification in the code that marketing funds can only be used for expenses such as legitimate marketing or advertising expenses. The new code will also address concerns regarding onerous contract terms, including a franchisor's ability to impose unforeseen capital expenses such as refurbishments to retail premises, and concerns relating to trade clauses in instances where a franchisor chooses not to offer a franchisee a renewal of their agreement.


I look forward to the government's new Franchising Code being introduced in this place to improve the ACCC's ability to regulate the industry. I commend the bill to the House.

"Prentice, Jane, MP",LP,2014-08-28,"



Mrs PRENTICE
 (Ryan) (11:12):  I rise today to speak on the Competition and Consumer Amendment (Industry Code Penalties) Bill 2014 which implements the coalition government's policy of strengthening effectiveness and improving compliance with the Franchising Code of Conduct. The object of the Competition and Consumer Act is to promote competition and fair trading and to provide for consumer protection. The code aims to strike a balance between mandating best practice in relation to disclosure and not unduly constraining the operation of the market. The franchising relationship is rarely balanced. The franchisor generally has greater power because they are better resourced; they own or control the intellectual property, including trademarks, relating to the franchise business; they prepare the franchise agreement, which may be offered to a potential franchisee on a take-it-or-leave-it basis; they have broad and detailed knowledge of the business and its prospects; and they may control the supply of materials and other inputs to the franchisee.


Despite the popularity of franchising in Australia, there have been significant and often very public complaints about the operation of the franchising sector. In particular there has been widespread criticism about the lack of enforceability of the code. My electorate of Ryan has a strong small business population—upwards of 1,200—and a number of constituents who are franchisees have met with me to discuss the problems they have with their franchisor. It is this ongoing level of complaint within an apparently popular business model that has given rise to a number of high-level reviews. Between 2006 and 2008, there were five inquiries at the Commonwealth and state levels into franchising which sought to address allegations of misuse of power by franchisors. The most significant of these inquiries was carried out by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. The report, entitled Opportunity not opportunism: improving conduct in Australian franchising, called for significant legislative amendments.


Amendments were made to the code in 2007 and 2010, following which the previous Labor government stated that it did not intend to conduct any further reviews before 2013.


In January 2013 the government appointed Mr Alan Wein to review the code with particular focus on the efficacy of the recommendations that had been made to the code in 2007 and 2010, and other matters such as good faith in franchising, the rights of franchisees at the end of the term of their franchise agreements—including recognition for any contribution they had made to the building of the franchise—and the operation of the provisions of the act as they relate to enforcement of the code.


Currently, it is the problem of information between franchisors and franchisees that is the basis of the concerns about disclosure. The importance of accurate and up-to-date disclosure cannot be overstated. Its purpose is to give to a prospective franchisee or an existing franchisee, who is proposing to enter into a new franchise agreement or renew or extend the scope of their franchise agreement, information from the franchisor that will allow that person to make a reasonable and informed decision, not the franchise. In addition, it concedes the fact that there are often difficulties for franchisees attempting to carry out due diligence before entering into a franchising agreement as would occur, say, with the purchase of an existing business.


As Jenny Buchan of the Australian School of Business explains:


If the franchise is owned by a public company, there will be very little information that is specific to the wholly owned franchisor subsidiary in the published annual returns of the public company. 


While it is not difficult to conduct a search of proprietary company, franchisors often operate different aspects of their businesses through more than one legal entity. 


The more entities there are, the more expensive and difficult it becomes to conduct a robust due diligence. 


If any of those entities, including the franchisor, is in a trust, it is not possible to objectively verify the identity of the beneficiaries from the public records.


The franchisee, faced with the high cost or the impossibility of conducting a thorough due diligence for itself, will decide to trust the franchisor information more or less on face value. Or walk away. 


The code is designed to ensure that franchisees are given information that is material to the running of the franchise business and provide access to a fast and relatively inexpensive way to resolve any disputes. Broadly, it achieves this by requiring the franchisors to disclose specific facts to franchisees and to follow set procedures in their dealings with franchisees. However, pecuniary penalties are not currently available for breaches of the code, nor is the ACCC currently empowered to issue infringement notices for a likely breach of the code. These are issues that this bill will remedy.


The Law Council of Australia summarise the cautious arguments in favour of imposing civil pecuniary penalties for a breach of the code as follows: 


Penalties would operate as an effective deterrent to breaching the code … Due to the cost of justice, franchisees do not possess the resources to pursue franchisors, ie the sector is characterised by an imbalance of power and therefore the state should intervene. 


It is inconsistent that penalties do not exist for a breach of the code, given that penalties exist for other breaches of the Competition and Consumer Act, including the Australian Consumer Law. The introduction of penalties would increase the confidence of investors and parties to a franchise agreement. 


According to the Wein report, the ACCC as the industry regulator has argued that it should be able to issue infringement notices in addition to being able to seek pecuniary penalties for a breach of the code. This would be an appropriate penalty in circumstances where a franchisee has received an inaccurate or incomplete disclosure document from a franchisor. In particular, the payment of infringement notices in such circumstances would make the matter public and act as a deterrent to other franchisors. The Franchisee's Association of Australia has urged the parliament to pass laws which result in both civil and criminal sanctions for a breach of the code. 


The franchise industry has been the subject of a number of inquiries at the state and Commonwealth level since 2006. This has led to amendments to the code in order to overcome many problems which have been reported by franchisees. In addition, there have been, since 2006, significant steps to update the Competition and Consumer Act, including the codification of the prohibition against unconscionable conduct. 


The Wein review canvassed many of the same issues that were the subject of those earlier inquiries. The move to impose civil penalties for a breach of the code has long been resisted. What cannot be forgotten is that all breaches of the code will be liable for such a penalty—that is, a penalty can be applied equally to a non-compliant franchisee as a franchisor. 


The challenge for this coalition government was to consider the Wein review recommendations afresh and to apply an even-handed response which does not unduly tip the balance of the franchise relationship too far in favour of the franchisees to the detriment of franchising generally. The coalition government, in particular, supported Mr Wein's recommendation to make enhanced and more flexible enforcement options available to the ACCC.


The minister for small business, the Hon. Bruce Billson, described Mr Wein's report as 'a terrific road map about areas of important reform in franchising'. I believe that this bill has risen to the challenge and met the delicate balance between the franchisor and the franchisee to ensure that the franchise sector is improved overall, and I commend this bill to the house.

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley—Minister for Small Business) (11:24):  Madam Deputy Speaker Andrews, it was a great pleasure to receive the call from you and congratulations on your appointment. Firstly, I would like to thank all colleagues from all sides of the parliament that have contributed to this debate—really good contributions, insightful contributions, from the member for Eden-Monaro, the member for Hughes, the member for Swan, the member for Ryan, the member for Herbert and the member for Lindsay. I would also like to acknowledge the member for Oxley's contribution, particularly the encouraging news that Labor will be supporting this package. It is a very positive sign of the collaborative work that has gone on to get us to the point where we are today. 


This is an important day. Franchising is very important and a crucial part of our vision of a diverse, vibrant, enterprising economy. And franchising is a big deal. The franchise industry is very important to our economy and the small business community. There are around 73,000 franchising units operating in our economy, employing over 400,000 Australians, and they are producing a sales turnover estimated to be in excess of $131 billion annually. This is a big deal. 


We are the franchise capital of the world here in Australia, and so much of our learnings and insights are exported. What I am pleased to bring to the parliament is another instalment, another step, in a regulatory regime that has supported the growth, strength and confidence of franchising that so many enterprising Australians are a part of. This is what this bill goes to the heart of. 


Alan Wein's report in 2013 was very good and useful. As was quoted, it was a report that the coalition welcomed as mapping out a road map for further franchise reform. The task that we have had is to translate Mr Wein's recommendations into a legislative instrument, and not only the bill before the parliament today but also the code that will follow once these enabling provisions are passed. That has been an enormous piece of work. 


I recall being briefed by Mr Wein on his report and I said: 'Some of your recommendations are written in a conversational style of English. They're great to read. The question that follows is: how would you implement that?' I was encouraged by his advice that that was my problem to actually translate those wise—and I think conversationally communicated—recommendations into the instruments that we need to give effect to. He was quite happy to point out that that was our role and provide all the advice and support that he could, and he has. That is what has got us to the point where we are today.


The Competition and Consumer Amendment Industry Code Penalties Bill 2014 is a key component of our election commitment to introduce a package of reforms to improve the effectiveness of regulation of the franchise sector. The new national franchising code of conduct will be introduced later this year as part of these reforms, and this bill enables those provisions to be enacted. Some of the reform measures that will be in the code are outside the scope of the current enabling law, and that is why we have this amendment before the parliament today. 


The bill amends the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 to allow regulations to be made that prescribe a pecuniary penalty not exceeding 300 penalty units for the breach of a civil penalty provision within that code. It allows the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to issue an infringement notice where it has reasonable grounds to believe a person has contravened a civil penalty provision of industry code.


These respond to some of the observations that colleagues have raised. Under the previous code, if something was inconsistent with the code, the access to remedies, the tool kit available to the ACCC, the opportunity to simply deal with that salvaged the relationship between a franchisor and franchisee and let everyone get back to business, those tools were not available. So you would have a potentially exhaustive process to use broader powers within the competition framework, or in some cases the inappropriate conduct might go unaccounted for because it was too difficult to seek some kind of remedy. A party to that franchising relationship had every ground to be aggrieved about the conduct and could point to examples where the code had not been complied with. Yet the tool kit was not there to deal with that breach in a timely and responsive way. That is what we are trying to fix. Where there is aberrant conduct that is inconsistent with the code you deal with it quickly. Let the commission issue an infringement notice. Present the evidence. Allow the party whose conduct was inconsistent with the code to simply pay the infringement notice—they know they have done the wrong thing—and everyone can get back to business. This is what we are trying to achieve.


The penalty and infringement notice regime to be implemented by this bill represents a relatively modest penalty amount but it is targeted so that its application is balanced—it is a lighter touch approach—and it will give the teeth to industry codes to which it applies while preserving their co-regulatory nature. The new Franchising Code will specify the provisions that attract a pecuniary penalty. The bill will enhance the enforcement tools available to the ACCC to allow appropriate action to be taken against breaches of the new code and to produce greater deterrence outcomes. And, as I mentioned earlier, timeliness matters. You need to be able to deal with these issues quickly so that the harm and the consequences can be negated and so that an appropriate penalty is recognised for noncompliance. That is a crucial part of the reforms that we are seeking to introduce. This will encourage a higher compliance level across the sector and may assist in reducing the number of disputes, which in turn may reduce pressure on dispute resolution services or the need for costly litigation. We all know that, when a small business finds itself in court, it is often already at a disadvantage before the matter is even heard because of the imbalance in resources and the positions the parties can take.


We are seeking to introduce a maximum civil pecuniary penalty of 300 penalty units—which is currently $51,000—for breaches of certain provisions of the new code. It would have to be a serious breach to attract the upper reaches of the pecuniary penalty. Those serious breaches are of a kind that would undermine in a fundamental way the operations of the franchising relationship and result in detriment to the parties. Beyond that, there are further avenues available which a court can exercise. It is proportionate. More modest action can be taken decisively by the ACCC, and as you move to a higher level of penalty for more egregious breaches, that is where the court process comes in to seek authorisation for those stiffer penalties. Infringement notices of 50 penalty units for a body corporate—that is currently $8½ thousand dollars—will allow the ACCC to quickly and efficiently respond to less serious breaches. To go above that figure, to activate stiffer penalties for more egregious breaches, the commission will need to engage in a court process.


The introduction of pecuniary penalties for breaches of the new Franchising Code has been the subject of comprehensive consultation with industry stakeholders and has won broad support from the franchising community. That consultation has been at the heart of how we operationalise the Wein report recommendations. I commend my team, the Treasury officials, the ACCC officials and the many stakeholders not only for their contribution but also for the goodwill that they have displayed in collaboratively translating Alan Wein's excellent recommendations into the kind of legislative and regulatory instruments that give people confidence and clarity about the nature of the reforms and give effect to the intention that was behind the Wein report recommendations.


This measure will help enhance the business environment for franchisees and franchisors alike and will promote confidence and growth in what is already a vibrant and very substantial franchising sector in Australia. Importantly, it will lay the foundations for the new Franchising Code. The existing code has been in need of renovation and reform and this government has taken up that challenge after many years of calls for action to be taken. It did not happen under the previous government but it will happen under the Abbott coalition government. I am pleased that it will be introduced through regulations later this year and I expect that it will commence on 1 January 2015. I am encouraged by the bipartisan support for that measure from those on the other side of the chamber. Not only will these reforms be of benefit to the sector more generally; they will deliver an estimated net compliance reduction to the sector of $8.6 million annually. We never lose sight of our red tape and compliance burden reduction imperative. That is embedded in this work, as we seek to do with all of our work. This will reduce the red tape burden on businesses across the franchising sector. I commend this bill the House. I hope it has swift passage through the Senate. It represents a very important step in reforming a crucial area of our small business economy—that is the franchising sector.

Ms VAMVAKINOU
 (Calwell) (12:30):  Nowhere is the dire need to create jobs for young people and to support trades training centres more evident than in my electorate. Youth unemployment is at a 15-year high in Victoria, with socially disadvantaged areas such as Hume being ranked ninth Australia wide as one of the most difficult areas to find work for young people between the ages of 15 and 24. The imminent closure of the Ford motor factory and Qantas continuing to lay off workers in recent times have further underscored the need to provide training and create job opportunities for our local young people.


I recently received correspondence from Mr Fernando Ianni, the Principal of Roxburgh College, the lead school in a trades training centre program which includes Craigieburn Secondary School, Gladstone Park Secondary College and Mount Ridley College, raising the school's grave concerns about the time it is taking to get the trades training centre up and running. It was only last year that Mr Ianni, I and others were overjoyed that the then Labor government had allocated $4.5 million to build a trades training centre at Roxburgh College. For my electorate it means that the much needed facility would provide essential educational programs for post-16-year-old students wanting to follow a vocational pathway. The trades training centre was aimed at addressing skill shortages in traditional trades and emerging industries by equipping the college with the industry-standard facilities it needed. It will deliver qualifications in automotive, electro-technology, engineering, furnishing and hospitality, and it will address skills shortages in cabinetmaking, cooking, motor mechanics, sheet metal trades and telecommunications.


The trades training centre is an absolute necessity in an area where students face interrupted learning, low levels of literacy and numeracy, as well as having to provide for the needs of many who come from non-English speaking backgrounds. It is to my dismay that I now learn that the trades training centre is in danger of toppling over because of the time that it is taking this government to deliver on the funding allocated in 2013-14 budget. I have already written to the federal Minister for Education and to the Assistant Minister for Education about this and await their response. It is astounding for a government that has talked so much about freeing the system from red tape—indeed, it has allocated days in parliamentary sitting weeks to abolish red tape—to overlook how the slow wheels of bureaucracy are hampering the educational future of my local young constituents. Politics is interfering in my constituents' future prospects and not in a positive way, I am afraid. In rebadging the trades training centre program as the trade skills centre project and announcing an independent review of what the government calls a Labor initiative, the government is playing politics with my young people's future.


Roxburgh College has already prepared a concept design and provided quantity surveyor estimates and it has met all documentation requirements. In fact, was left with the expectation that the building process was going to commence in 2014 and that the trades training centre would be open for the 2015 academic year. Instead, the principal informs me that they have not moved 'off the blocks' even though 'our spikes are on'. Mr Ianni says the schools have responded to several requests from the Department of Education to clarify some of the detail, but to date they are still unable to tender for the architect. This is an appointment which needs to happen so that the college can move into the schematic design stage to gain a more accurate bearing on the building and the finances for the project. Mr Ianni says that the delay is setting the project further behind. Again, it is the students, I am afraid, who are going to miss out. The college faces having to compromise its planning for the 2015 academic timetable as they are uncertain of the outcome. So this continued uncertainty has now caused the building cost to alter and will ultimately result in the college not achieving what they intended to do because of a shortage, potentially, of money. Mr Ianni says that, by the time they are finally at the stage of turning the sod, material and labour costs will be higher than they would have been if the building had commenced in 2013, as originally planned. They are also concerned that the school's contribution to the project now has to be paid up-front. Again, this is disappointing given that, if there is any cost saving, the contribution should be directed to improving and adding more to the scope of the new facility.
