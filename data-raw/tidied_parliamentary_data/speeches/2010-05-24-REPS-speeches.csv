"Smith, Stephen, MP",ALP,2010-05-24,"—Mr Speaker, on indulgence: on 25 February I advised the House of the suspected fraudulent use of a number of Australian passports in connection with the murder of senior Hamas figure Mahmoud Al-Mabhouh. I now advise the House of the government’s response to this matter. First it is worth recalling the circumstances in which this came to the government’s attention and our response to date. On 20 January, Mr Al-Mabhouh was found murdered in a hotel room in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. On 16 February, police in Dubai announced that falsified passports from the United Kingdom, Ireland, France and Germany had been used in connection with the murder. Late on 22 February, Dubai authorities approached Australian officials with an inquiry about two Australian passports. The following day, 23 February, Dubai authorities confirmed to Australian officials that they were investigating a number of Australian passports in connection with the murder. Since that time, Dubai authorities have announced that they are investigating four Australian passports in connection with the murder. Those four Australian passports are in the names of Mr Adam Korman, Mr Joshua Bruce, Ms Nicole McCabe and Mr Joshua Krycer. From the first contact on 22 February, Australian authorities have cooperated fully with Dubai investigators.
On 25 February, I expressed to the House my concern that these Australian passports had been used fraudulently. Both the Prime Minister and I condemned in the strongest possible terms this apparent misuse and abuse of Australian passports. On 25 February, I also announced that the Australian Federal Police, in conjunction with relevant agencies, had been asked to investigate the possible abuse of these passports. These agencies included the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO), the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) and the Australian Passport Office. On 9 April, I received the Australian Federal Police report. Upon a preliminary assessment of that report, it was clear that further work and advice was required from other agencies, in particular ASIO and ASIS. I made this known publicly on 11 April. This further work included a visit to Israel this month by the Director-General of ASIO. I received my final advice from agencies last week. I briefed the National Security Committee of the cabinet this morning and have taken steps to ensure that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and shadow minister for foreign affairs has been briefed.
This advice leads to the following key conclusions. Firstly, and very importantly, there is absolutely no evidence to suggest that those Australian passport holders identified by Dubai authorities were anything other than innocent victims of identity fraud; secondly, the passports in question were deliberately counterfeited and cloned for use. The high quality of these counterfeited passports points to the involvement of a state intelligence service. Thirdly, these investigations and advice have left the government in no doubt that Israel was responsible for the abuse and counterfeiting of these passports. I note that a similar conclusion was reached by the United Kingdom government in the course of their official investigations.
No government can tolerate the abuse of its passports, especially by a foreign government. This represents a clear affront to the security of our passport system. Nor can we tolerate the abuse by a foreign government of the personal details of the Australian nationals concerned. These are not the actions of a friend. I regret to advise the House that this is not the first occasion that Australian passports have been misused by Israeli authorities. The Dubai passports incident also constitutes a clear and direct breach of confidential understandings between Australia and Israel dating back some years. This is not what we expect from a nation with whom we have had such a close, friendly and supportive relationship.
After careful deliberation, the government has asked that a member of the Israeli Embassy in Canberra be withdrawn from Australia. I have asked that the withdrawal be effected within the week. Earlier this morning, at my request, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade called in the Israeli Charge d’Affaires. Israeli Ambassador Rotem, whom I called in on 25 February, is absent from Australia until 8 June. If Ambassador Rotem had been in Australia, I would have again spoken to him myself. The department conveyed the government’s deep disappointment over Israeli involvement in this affair. The department made it clear that Australia regarded the abuse of these passports as inconsistent with the friendship and support provided by successive Australian governments to Israel since its creation as a nation. Australia’s relationship with Israel has always been founded on a basis of mutual respect and trust. But Israel’s actions in this regard have undermined that respect and trust.
The government takes this step much more in sorrow than in anger or retaliation. It is a decision taken in our national security interests. The government has done so in accordance with the findings of the investigation and after a careful assessment of Australia’s national interests by relevant agencies. The government, through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, will continue to provide consular assistance on an as needs basis to those Australians whose identities were stolen and who were therefore adversely affected by Israel’s actions. We have already, on request, replaced the passports of a number of those involved.
I convey publicly a final point made to the Israeli Charge d’Affaires by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Insofar as the Australia-Israel bilateral relationship is concerned, our expectation is that our relationship with Israel can and will continue in a mutually productive and beneficial manner. Australia’s support for the State of Israel goes back to its creation. Australia’s support for the State of Israel has long enjoyed bipartisan support. We have always shared a relationship reflecting our joint commitment to freedom, security and democracy. Australia remains a firm friend of Israel. But, as I noted previously, our relationship must be conducted on the basis of mutual trust and respect. Genuine friendship runs both ways. We expect this government and future Israeli governments to ensure that this incident is not repeated. We now look forward to working to restore the highest standards of trust in our relationship with Israel. I thank the House.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>National Security</title>,Ministerial Statements,0,1,speech
"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2010-05-24,"—The Treasurer has delivered a budget which he characterised, perhaps ironically, as meeting the highest standards of responsible economic management. But I am afraid that this government does not understand accountability. It has not earned the people’s trust. The Prime Minister uses other ministers to announce bad news or cancellation of projects despite saying repeatedly that the buck stops with him. This is a Prime Minister who is the master of broken election promises, policy backflips and mismanagement.
The CPRS, the greatest moral, economic and social challenge of our time, has been ditched. The school drop-off childcare centres program in schools has been dropped. The pink batts program has been abandoned save for nearly $1 billion to try to repair the botched job already. The so-called Building the Education Revolution program is behind schedule and has blowouts. The computers in schools program is over budget and has under-delivered. In fact, only 220,000 of the promised one million school computers have been delivered. And to pay for all this the much-vaunted Henry tax review took two years, cost $20 million and, of 138 recommendations, 2½ were adopted.
This year’s budget continues this trail of deception. The budget is based on claimed efficiency dividends and stronger growth from tax reform, yet the government refuses to release the detailed modelling on all 138 recommendations in the Henry review. The projected surpluses in the final two years of the forward estimates are wafer thin with a budget of close to $400 billion in 2013-14, relying on surpluses of $1 billion and, the year after, $5 billion. That claim is risky and unreal. These anticipated surpluses are also based on projections rather than forecasts and, I might say, budget forecasts and projections are only as good as the underlying economic assumptions. These assumptions include forecasts and projections of population growth in Australia, economic growth offshore, economic growth in Australia, terms of trade, exchange rates, interest rates, and so on. So these assumptions on the economic parameters, naturally enough, can vary widely from year to year, let alone the government’s claim that you can rely on them in three years time.
For example, last year’s budget forecast the Australian economy would contract by 0.5 per cent in 2009-10. This year’s budget tells us the economy will grow by two per cent. This is a massive turnaround in the space of just 12 months. Last year’s budget said the unemployment rate would peak at 8½ per cent in 2010-11. This year’s budget tells us the unemployment rate has already peaked at less than six per cent and is now heading to a low of 4.75 per cent in 2011-12.
I want to stress that I am not criticising the public servants in Treasury who prepare these forecasts. Forecasting is as much an art as it is a science. It is a difficult task and the degree of uncertainty has been much increased over recent years. But these very significant changes to the underlying forecasts do illustrate that there is a large degree of imprecision in the budget numbers. This makes it even more ridiculous that the government should claim kudos from its projected tiny surpluses in the last two years of the forward estimates.
These tiny suggested surpluses are based on five key assumptions. First, economic growth in Australia will need to remain at around trend levels—three to 3½ per cent. Second, the global economy will also need to grow at or above trend. Third, prices for key Australian commodities will need to remain high. Fourth—and this is the most heroic assumption of all, Mr Speaker; you would appreciate this—Labor will need to not have any further cost blow-outs in its programs. And, fifth, Labor will need to commit to making no new unfunded spending promises for the next four years through two elections. Mr Speaker, I cannot make assumptions about what the chair might think about those things, but I am sure that any person with an ounce of savvy would know that it is heroic to assume that a government will make no new spending announcements for one year, let alone four years, which is the key assumption in the government having a surplus in three years time.
The deficit this year of $57.1 billion will still be the biggest deficit in Australia’s peacetime history. Next year, 2010-11, it will be the second biggest at a massive $40 billion. And there will still be a peak net debt of around the same size as that which was left to Australians by Paul Keating. There is something about the $90 billion mark that Labor is attracted to. Keating left a $90 billion debt for us to pay off; Mr Rudd, the Prime Minister, is leaving a $90 billion debt for the coalition to pay off; even Anna Bligh in Queensland has a $90 billion debt that someone is going to have to pay off.
The improvement to the budget bottom line which the budget reflects is entirely due to parameter changes: stronger economic growth in Australia, above-trend growth offshore and the terms of trade being at 60-year highs. It does not rely on responsible economic management; it is not the result of hard decisions to cut reckless and wasteful government spending. Last year, the Treasurer justified his big spending budget on the grounds that it was necessary to prevent a recession in the Australian economy—so he delivered the biggest spending budget in Australia’s peacetime history. This year he notes that the budget has moved from supporting the economy to a position now where Australia is recovering strongly. In that light, we might have expected a budget with much lower spending to suit the times. But what we find is an increase in spending from 2010-2011 to 2012-13, compared with last year’s budget, totalling $26 billion. So last year was the biggest spending budget in modern history, but, as if Labor had not done what it could do at that time, this year it has an extra $26 billion of spending in a similar framework.
Even then, the Treasurer has pulled some accounting tricks to improve his financial ratios. Cancellation of the CPRS is worth, roughly, a one per cent reduction in the ratio of spending to GDP in 2013-14 and somewhat lesser amounts in earlier years. This is a significant issue. There is this mantra that the Labor Party run out before each budget where they refer to ‘the big-spending Howard years’. The big-spending Howard years to 2007 amounted to 23 per cent of GDP. At no time do Labor get as low as 23 per cent of GDP. Most certainly, in their most ambitious year, which is four years hence, they do not get to 23 per cent of GDP. If the CPRS were in, it would be nearly one per cent more than what they are already projecting.
It is also the case—and this is a telling point that was picked up by Ross Gittins—that $1.8 billion of spending in infrastructure, water and local government has been brought forward to 2009-10 from 2010-11 and later years to ensure that the forward estimates look better. Even more curious, and we are yet to get to the bottom of this, is that there is a revenue item called ‘growth dividend’ totalling $600 million over the final two years of the forward estimates. This is the additional tax expected to flow from the stronger economic growth arising from the implementation of tax reforms associated with the resources tax. It is fortunate that this notional revenue occurs in the two years when the government is expecting to record very small surpluses. This is part of the government’s claim, I assume, that the more you tax an industry the greater it will grow—and, of course, they are banking the proceeds of that, which we will see over the next few weeks.
The Treasurer claims that every dollar in new policy has been offset across the forward estimates. Let’s have a look at that. Policy decisions since the 2009-10 budget have increased net spending by $5.9 billion. That figure includes new spending measures, new taxes and savings initiatives. So all the new taxes have been spent, all the savings initiatives have been spent and, on top of that, an additional $5.9 billion has been spent for good measure. I emphasise that not a cent of the new taxes has been saved to reduce the deficit—not a cent.
This government have a history of wasteful spending and have, true to form, continued it in this budget. The government have allocated another $536 million for new health bureaucracies as part of their health reform program. That happened after the Prime Minister promised the Australian people that, as a result of his new hospital and health reform program, there would not be any new bureaucrats. For example—bureaucrats are part of the theme—an additional $12 million has been provided to the Prime Minister’s own department, adding an extra 86 full-time staff to the 618 already there. That represents a 14 per cent increase in the staffing levels in his own department.
After all that, it is good to see that the Labor Party continue to look after their mates. A one-off grant of $10 million has been provided to the Trade Union Education Foundation for ‘the development and delivery of national workplace education programs’. I can only speculate on what those programs are. It is just a lazy $10 million! It is interesting that they have brought it forward to this financial year. So the cheque is in the mail; it has to be in the mail before 30 June.
The government has sold this budget as being friendly to small business, but nothing could be further from the truth. The single biggest difficulty for small business at present is the availability and cost of finance. This is hampering the ability of small businesses to invest and grow their businesses and provide jobs. One of the key steps government can take to help small business is to prevent its competing for the scarce capital that is out there, but this government will continue to soak up scarce capital for the next two years with cumulative borrowings of $54 billion. This will deprive small businesses of scarce funds. It will force up the cost of finance.
The government are now borrowing $100 million a day just to fund their expenditure, not to repay debt. That does not pay off debt; they are borrowing $100 million a day just to fund the spending of this year, next year and the year after. What an extraordinary amount of money. As part of this process, the government want to impose a huge new tax on business by increasing the superannuation guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent. The question is: will this be paid by business?
It is interesting that the Minister for Finance and Deregulation should bell the cat earlier this year—despite what Tony Jones suggested on Q&A—by alluding to the fact that an increase in the superannuation guarantee would in fact come out of the take-home salaries of workers. This nine to 12 per cent is either coming out of the bottom lines of businesses, which inevitably means that they going to employ fewer people, or quite simply coming out of the take-home pay of workers. It is one or the other, but what you do know is that it is not coming out of the budget bottom line.
The government say: ‘In order to compensate business for this, we’re going to cut company tax, particularly for small business; we will bring it forward and cut it from 30 per cent to 28 per cent.’ They say, ‘This is a great windfall for small business.’ The problem is that only one-third of small businesses in Australia are incorporated. Therefore the company tax cut means very little to a lot of small businesses, and I am prepared to bet that for most small businesses an increase in the cost of the superannuation guarantee from nine per cent to 12 per cent is going to far outweigh any benefit that might come in the form of a reduction in company taxes.
This budget will continue to provide fiscal stimulus to the domestic economy at a time when the government says it is no longer needed. The government’s own forecasts have the Australian economy at or above trend growth for the next four years. The Treasurer has suggested that the government no longer need to provide fiscal stimulus, yet it is the case that in 2012 the government are going to be spending half a billion dollars on school halls to address one quarter of negative growth in 2008. So they are saying, ‘The economy is growing at trend or above, but we’ll still be spending money on school halls in two years time to keep the economy going.’ It is stimulatory, and with that sort of stimulation still out there in the economy the government will continue to run deficits and the deficits will impact on interest rates. The deficits will push interest rates higher than they should be.
The Reserve Bank has now a lifted the cash rate six times in eight months, with a cumulative increase of 1.5 per cent. But the gap between what homeowners and small business pay and the cash rate of the Reserve Bank has grown, and the net impact is that the increases by the Reserve Bank have had a more profound impact than just the increases in themselves. The interest bill on an average mortgage of $300,000 has risen by least 4½ thousand dollars a year. So let’s be very clear: the more the government borrows, the more upward pressure is on interest rates; the more the government goes down the path of spending money that it has not received and needs to borrow, the greater the upward pressure on interest rates.
Around the world we are seeing what happens when government finances are unsustainable. Greece is struggling to finance its ongoing deficits in the market. This has prompted a trillion-dollar rescue package by the European Union and the IMF. Sovereign risk is now a very real fear in the financial markets. Debt levels in Japan, Europe, the UK and the USA are at the point where the governments will be struggling to stabilise and service their debts, let alone make any progress at all in repaying them. IMF data shows that six of the G7 nations will have gross debt-to-GDP ratios of 90 per cent or more by 2014.
I wish to stress that Australia is not in this position. It is not an accident, but it has occurred despite the best endeavours of the Labor Party. They actually did inherit a $20 billion surplus, $60 billion in the Future Fund and an economy with just four per cent unemployment. But what they have to understand is that you can ruin the opportunity, and preserving the faith and trust of the markets and communities requires ongoing strong and prudent management of the budget and the economy. The economic and fiscal forecasts of government have to be credible. The actions of government have to provide a stable and predictable investment environment.
This illustrates why the coalition has decided to take a stand. We believe in responsible fiscal management. Dare I say it, we are fiscal conservatives and not pretend fiscal conservatives. Last week I released the principles which will guide the coalition in setting and implementing its policies for underwriting the future prosperity of this great nation. At the core of that is a belief in free, fair and competitive markets. It is also the case that the rights and choices of individuals are paramount. Well-functioning markets and individuals rather than governments are usually best placed to make decisions that maximise community wellbeing. We believe in small government. That is why we made the hard decisions about the $47 billion of gross savings. We believe in efficient government; that is why we went program by program through the savings measures that we are going to implement. And we are most acutely aware that the money being spent by government is in fact other people’s money. That is why whatever we can do to improve the strength of the Australian economy is going to be enhanced by collecting less tax, not more.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2010-2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Dreyfus, Mark, MP",ALP,2010-05-24,"—We have just heard from the shadow Treasurer of Australia complete confirmation of the risk that would be posed to Australia if the shadow Treasurer or his leader were to get anywhere near the government of this country. They are a risk to jobs; they are a risk to working families; they are a risk to the infrastructure of this country; they are a risk to skills. Everything we have seen from the opposition since the budget was delivered in this House some two weeks ago has confirmed just what a risk to the people of Australia is posed by those presently occupying the opposition benches.
By contrast, through this budget the government has delivered and will continue to deliver responsible economic management. We have presented a credible pathway back to surplus in three years, and that time frame is half the time that it was expected to take when Australia first responded to the global economic crisis. This budget delivers tax cuts for working families and for small businesses. In addition, we are investing $23 billion over the next decade in a national health and hospitals network; we are investing in major national infrastructure to boost productivity and create jobs; we are investing in skills and training.
The first aim of this government was to keep our economy strong and to protect Australian jobs and Australian businesses through the worst crisis that the global economy has faced in almost 80 years. When faced with this crisis the government understood that to contain the damage and to protect Australian jobs and businesses from the meltdown in global financial markets we had to maintain confidence in our financial system, encourage households to maintain consumption and provide businesses with the certainty and confidence to continue investing. Because of the early and decisive action taken by the government, Australia has managed to avoid a recession through what was feared to be and what now clearly has been the worst global downturn in more than 75 years. Australia’s economy is the only advanced economy that expanded in the year to June 2009, the worst period of this crisis, and, according to the International Monetary Fund’s World economic outlook update, Australia’s economic growth was positive and Australia was the only advanced economy to achieve this.
In the 2009-10 budget economic growth was forecast to be negative 0.5 per cent; the estimate in this year’s budget is that it will have been two per cent. The budget forecast for 2010-11 has improved from 2.25 per cent to 3.25 per cent. No major Australian financial institution has collapsed, none required the government to take significant shareholdings in return for dealing with toxic debt and no financial institutions were nationalised. This can be contrasted with the situation in the United Kingdom, where the government has nationalised Northern Rock and taken significant shareholdings in Lloyds and the Royal Bank of Scotland. Most importantly, the government’s response to the global economic crisis has helped protect hundreds of thousands of Australian jobs. Unemployment peaked at 5.8 per cent last year, 2.5 per cent lower than it was estimated to peak at and certainly considerably lower than would have occurred without the stimulus.
It is quite clear that the government’s response has been the correct response. That has been the opinion expressed around the world. It has been the opinion expressed by the International Monetary Fund, by the OECD, by the World Bank, by governments of other countries and by finance ministers and prime ministers in the G20, all of whom have complimented the Rudd Labor government for the decisive and prompt action that was taken at the peak of the global crisis and that has ensured the financial and fiscal security that Australia is now enjoying. It needs to be borne in mind, when we listen to the muddled response—yet another muddled response—from the shadow Treasurer that the coalition, the Liberal Party and the National Party opposed economic stimulus. They would have adopted policies, had they still been in government in September, October and November 2008, which would have ensured that hundreds of thousands of Australians would now be out of work.
I would invite any member of the Liberal Party or the National Party, and in particular the Leader of the Opposition, to visit and talk to those workers who are working on Building the Education Revolution school projects throughout my electorate about how they feel the government’s programs have assisted the Australian economy and, in particular, assisted them to stay in work during this global economic downturn. Were they to do so, they would learn that it is the opinion of people, certainly throughout the construction industry, that the response of the national government, the Rudd Labor government, has been extraordinarily prompt and entirely appropriate because it has kept them in work—and that is before one even goes to the immense value that has been given to our local communities by the building of the new facilities in each and every primary school through the Building the Education Revolution program. I would also invite those opposite to visit my electorate to speak to retailers or people in the manufacturing industry, all of whom very directly attribute the continued health of their businesses and the continuation in many cases of their employment to the programs that have been adopted by our government.
With this budget, we have presented a credible pathway back to surplus. It is a pathway that will return the budget to surplus in three years. That is half the amount of time that was forecast in last year’s budget. Net debt is predicted to peak at just 6.1 per cent of GDP, which is half the level projected a year ago and less than one-tenth of the average across the major advanced economies. One thing that I noticed in the shadow Treasurer’s speech that we just heard is that at least he had the good grace to acknowledge that the average debt-to-GDP ratio in the Western economies is in the order of 90 to 100 per cent, and he acknowledged that the net debt we are going to peak at is nothing like that, but he did not go far enough. Of course he does not want to state the number, which is 6.1 per cent of GDP, because to state the number in the same context as saying that the average net debt in Western economies is 90 to 100 per cent of GDP is to show just how absurd it is for those opposite to be, even by implication, comparing the position of the Australian economy or comparing the policies adopted by the Rudd Labor government to any of the positions that those Western economies, particularly the European economies such as Spain and Portugal or the United Kingdom.
There is still a level of uncertainty faced in global financial markets. It is being highlighted right at this time by the difficulties that are being faced in Greece. Indeed, one could also point to Spain and Portugal, or indeed, by way of comparison, point not just to the net debt levels but also to the unemployment levels that have been reached in those Western economies and which are still regrettably being suffered in the United Kingdom or the United States. That puts in proper global context the success of the policies adopted by the Rudd Labor government.
This budget delivers tax cuts to working families. It delivers tax cuts to small business. And, even during this period of fiscal consolidation, there will be modest income tax cuts that will see taxpayers on average earnings keep $450 a year more. From 2011, we will provide a 50 per cent tax break for the first $1,000 of interest on savings. As I went around my electorate last week explaining the budget to different people, I went to Richfield retirement village in Aspendale Gardens. The news that there is to be a 50 per cent tax break on the first $1,000 interest on savings is particularly gratifying to people who use savings accounts as one very secure form of investment.
We will introduce simplified tax returns from 1 July 2012. The government will provide an optional standard deduction of $500 instead of having taxpayers list work related expenses individually, and it is a deduction that is going to increase to $1,000 from 1 July 2013. Every one of Australia’s small businesses will get a tax break under the Rudd government through this budget. Sole traders, partnerships and incorporated small businesses will be able to immediately deduct the cost of assets valued at up to $5,000, and those 2.4 million small businesses will also be able to pool assets costing more than $5,000, except buildings, and write them off at a single rate of 30 per cent a year. And for the 720,000 small-business companies there will be a head-start reduction in the company tax rate from 30 per cent to 28 per cent from 1 July 2012.
This budget also delivers a long hoped for increase in the superannuation guarantee, which will rise gradually over the next decade from nine per cent to 12 per cent, and this is another measure that is opposed by those opposite. This is an enormously important policy in guaranteeing the future incomes of working Australians and helps to prepare our nation and our national finances for the demographic shift that is already taking place.
The budget is filled with new investments, most notably the investment in the Health and Hospitals Network which is announced in this budget. The budget includes significant reforms to the health and hospitals system, which will be funded nationally and run locally. There is a total of $7.3 billion over five years for better hospitals, improved primary care and preventive health. It is a budget that allows access to more doctors, to an unprecedented level of support and training for our nurses, which is why nurses across Australia have welcomed the measures in this budget, and the introduction of personally controlled electronic health records for every Australian. And there is another measure, because one only has to go through the budget to find such measures, which the opposition opposes and would cut. The only intelligible response that one can glean from the muddled response of the opposition has been a list of worthwhile, valuable programs that the opposition says it would scrap—not, mind you, that the opposition is prepared to tie itself to any binding list of cuts, because while they say they wish to cut, for example, the introduction of personally controlled electronic health records of every Australian, they reserve to themselves the right to introduce new programs which might cost more, possibly even in the same area if one is to correctly understand the shadow finance minister, the member for Goldstein. So it is very difficult to work out just what it is the opposition has said in relation to this budget.
The budget contains very extensive measures in relation to infrastructure and in relation to skills and trade. Perhaps it is worth mentioning the record $37 billion investment in improving road, rail and port projects across Australia, all of which will boost national productivity and create jobs. The ongoing infrastructure fund of $5.6 billion will extend over a decade and is in response to the independent tax review—the Henry review. There will be annual contributions starting at $700 million from 2012-2013 to ensure that our nation-building project flourishes. There is funding for the Australian Rail Track Corporation and appropriate provision in the budget for the rollout of the National Broadband Network, another measure that this opposition of wreckers would scrap without indicating to the people of Australia in any way how it plans to take Australia further into the 21st century and further into the Information Age. There is something a bit striking about an opposition that wants to scrap not only a measure for personalised electronic health records but also the measures that the government is planning for a National Broadband Network.
The contrast with the opposition could not be greater. We have a budget that is responsible and that will return to surplus some three years earlier than planned. We have a budget that has appropriate measures for the economic circumstances in which Australia finds itself following on prompt and decisive action that has taken Australia to an economic position that is the envy of the developed world. We can be clear that the greatest risks to Australia’s economic security and the job security of thousands of Australian workers are the present opposition leader, the member for North Sydney—the shadow Treasurer—and the member for Goldstein. Everything about their response to this budget on behalf of the opposition has demonstrated that they cannot be trusted with the task of managing the Australian economy.
I do not think that the expectations of the community were very high to start off with, given the way in which the shadow Treasurer last year responded to the budget, which was to suggest that the forecasts and projections on which it was based were ‘grossly overoptimistic’—that is what he said. That, of course, proved to be wrong. He now wants to say about this budget that the estimates are wrong again, but I think the Australian people can judge who should best be trusted on matters like this. I would be far readier to trust forecasts that have been adopted by this government based on the steady work of the Treasury than to listen to a shadow Treasurer who said last year that the predictions of the Treasury were grossly optimistic.
There is no credibility left in this opposition on economic matters. The response last year, which criticised the forecasts, was that the opposition would stop the stimulus. That has been bettered—they have reached a new low for an opposition—with the shambolic response to the budget, with half-baked ideas and the handballed response that we saw last week. We saw in the budget reply by the Leader of the Opposition not, as one might have expected, a plan for the economy of Australia or a plan for the future of our nation with some clear responses to the measures in the budget and not, given that the opposition is very directly saying that it wishes to cut, any indication of what is to be cut or which programs are to be scrapped but, rather, the handball approach: saying that the shadow Treasurer would respond at the Press Club the following week—last Wednesday.
Then we had the response from the shadow Treasurer at the Press Club, which—as has been much commented on in the days since—did not include the list of cuts which were relied on by the opposition in its response. Instead, there was a further handball to the shadow finance minister at a press conference which was to follow. When finally it was possible to see the supposed savings which the shadow Treasurer has again referred to—at least he is now not referring to them simply as savings but trying to pretend to some accuracy in saying that it is $47 billion of gross savings—it was apparent that the ‘budget’—if one could call it that; perhaps it is better to leave it at ‘budget response’—just does not add up. The coalition’s proposed budget cuts do not add up. The $47 billion in cuts, which is what the opposition wanted to get its headline for—and did get it for—turns out to be a mishmash of cuts to capital expenditure combined with cuts to the current account or cuts to particular expenditures. It was really an attempt to mislead the Australian public with a larger headline figure. Most of the measures that have been identified by the opposition will not have any impact on the underlying balance. They are a threat to future economic growth, they are a threat to Australian families and they are a threat to the economy, and the Australian people will be able to see, from the shambolic response of the opposition to our budget measures, just what a risk would be posed if those opposite were to reach the government benches.

"Truss, Warren, MP",NATS,2010-05-24,"—Today, in this debate on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011 and cognate budget appropriation bills, Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2010-2011 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011, I want to talk about the third Swan budget—the budget for the 2010-11 financial year. I make that seemingly obvious point because, to date, the vast amount of commentary out of the Labor Party about this budget has been about what it thinks the budget will be in 2012-13. The government’s spin has all been about the possibility of a surplus two years hence rather than the outcome of this budget, which will of course be the second highest peacetime deficit this nation has ever seen, at $40.8 billion. That deficit will come straight after the highest peacetime deficit we have ever seen, $57.1 billion, which is expected this financial year. That will follow a deficit in the first Swan budget double any number our country has previously seen.
 (Ms AE Burke)—The Leader of the Nationals is aware he should use people’s appropriate titles.
—Given that none of the major forecasts from any of the first two of this Treasurer’s budgets has turned out to be correct, it is a very brave Australian who would bet on Labor expectations about his third budget. Who would believe that they are likely to be accurate? Heaven forbid he gets a fifth attempt at putting down a budget! For example, in his first budget, we were told Labor would run a $21.7 billion surplus, not due to any hard work by the Rudd government; that surplus was built on the back of the coalition’s strong economic management. Just 12 months later, in May last year, the Treasurer had cocked up things so badly that the surplus had turned into a severe deficit. Not that you would know—in his budget speech the cowardly Treasurer refused to even use the words ‘debt’ or ‘deficit’. Indeed, it took a week to get the Prime Minister or the Treasurer to use the words ‘debt’, ‘315’ and ‘dollars’ in the same sentence.
The same trick was used for budget speech No. 3. Rather than hearing about the $40.8 billion deficit, we heard promises of the budget returning to surplus three years early. Earlier than what, and on whose calculations? On, of course, the Labor Party’s calculations—on last year’s forecasts, which all turned out to be embarrassingly wrong. Why should you believe them this time—particularly when you look at the parameters of these forecasts? They rely on the best terms of trade that Australia has experienced for 60 years. The next three years are going to be better than our country has experienced for 60 years—once more, there is going to be above-trend growth offshore and low inflation in Australia! The reality is that this budget is a giant pea and thimble trick and the people being gulled are the Australian taxpayers.
The entire credibility of the Treasurer’s third budget hangs on numbers which, conveniently for the government, will not become clear or tested until after the next election. Those numbers rely on the national economy, and indeed the international economy, following a linear path. In just a fortnight since the Treasurer handed down his budget, share markets have fallen heavily and the Australian dollar has plummeted by more than 10 per cent against the US dollar. That is because of the government’s proposed great big new tax on the mining sector. Mining shares in particular have been pummelled by fear over Labor’s proposed profits tax on resources. The Australian share market fell $95 billion last week. In the first week, something like $15 billion was wiped off the savings of Australian superannuation funds and mum-and-dad Australians. And yet these are the parameters upon which the government are now asking us to believe that they could return the budget to surplus in three years time.
As a regional Australian, I guess I am used to being at the mercy of changing economic fortunes. For the seven million Australians who create much of our exports and our resulting prosperity, the ups and downs of the economy are very much a part of life. When the city feels higher interest rates, the country feels them much more. When jobs go, they often come from the regions first. Drought and natural disasters hit us harder too. The approach of the Nationals in coalition has always been to try and make life easier for those living in regional Australia—to reward them for their hard work and to give them a helping hand when times are tough—and to make sure that all Australians are able to share in our nation’s growth and prosperity. The federal budget has historically been a large part of that approach, but regional Australia have just seen the sort of budget that fails that very important test. The Treasurer used the word ‘regional’ only once in his budget-night address, and the word ‘agriculture’ did not appear at all. That says something about Labor’s priorities.
The massive debt, nearing $100 billion—and above $220 billion on gross levels—will overhang us all for years to come. The interest bill alone will rise from $4.6 billion this year, through $6.5 billion the following year, to $8 billion. That is enough to complete the Pacific Highway in one year. It is enough to build the hospitals we need. It is enough to build the inland rail twice every year. We will not have the money we want to spend on hospitals, roads and infrastructure because future generations will be paying off this Labor government’s debt—just as 12 years ago, when the coalition came to office, it had to spend the first half of its time, or probably more, paying off the debt of the previous Labor government.
This debt will have a significant impact on all Australians. The government will be out there borrowing $100 million every day to pay for the reckless spending that is being authorised in this budget—$100 million a day. The government will be out there competing with homeowners wanting to borrow for their first home and small business people who need some assistance to carry on their businesses. They will have to compete with a government that is out in the market for $100 million every day to pay for the expenditure in a budget which is clearly out of control.
The Treasurer’s third budget increased taxes and charges by $26 billion. But what is at the centrepiece of this budget? Why do we need to spend another $26 billion? The first part of the centrepiece of this budget is to spend $1 billion to undo Labor’s roof insulation debacle. There is another billion to manage the asylum seekers, who are coming into Australia as a result of Labor’s weakened border protection. There is another billion dollars on the school computer cost overruns. There is another $530 million in extra spending to build a new health bureaucracy, after the federal government backed down to the states on hospital reform and in reality decided to build a bureaucracy rather than to provide better services to the people of Australia. And, of course, there is additional expenditure in a whole range of other areas to patch up the broken promises, to patch up the failed programs of the government.
The budget provides no new money for road funding or regional development. Local government will actually get $1.21 billion less in 2010-11 because of the clawback of an advance payment and the termination of the Community Infrastructure Program. The clawback of the advance payment is because the government is trying to doctor the books to make it look as though they are actually moving towards a surplus when in fact all they have done is transferred expenditure from one year to another.
The budget cuts another $81 million from Caring for Our Country, including $10.9 million from Landcare, as Labor continues its assault on this iconic community based program. In every budget Labor has cut expenditure on Landcare. A party that claims it is interested in the environment, on coming to office abolished the National Heritage Trust and the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality and replaced them with Caring for our Country, but provided $1 billion less in funding. And it continues to take funding away from vital environmental programs.
The regional food producers program is being cut by $5.5 million. Once again, there is no new funding for quarantine—and 250 Customs staff are to be sacked. This is another example of Labor’s soft borders approach, which places the clean and green, disease-free status of our country at risk. Not only is Labor soft on our borders when it comes to defence and immigration; it is also soft on quarantine and soft on Customs.
The budget provides no new funding for the Export Market Development Grants scheme, leaving the fund at least $30 million short in 2009-10 and $80 million short in 2010-11. Once more, the government has halved the funding for TradeStart, the network of offices which are there to assist particularly new exporters to get established in difficult export markets. The government has decided that, in spite of its mounting trade deficit, we no longer need to support our exports, so the assistance they have been relying upon to open up new markets and to get some advice locally has been viciously slashed in this budget.
But, of course, that is not the end of it. The government has decided to spend another $10 billion on the bureaucracy. The Prime Minister’s own department is going to be increased by 32 per cent. But there is a 20 per cent increase in staff for the Australian Public Service Commission to assist agencies with downsizing. So the Public Service Commission needs more staff to tell other offices how to get smaller! In reality, the size of the bureaucracy is growing anyway. The facts are that this is a government that has no control over its expenditure and has been unable to deliver programs on time and within budget.
One of the other astonishing moments in the delivery of the budget was the realisation that the Treasurer had slapped a $1 billion new tax on LPG, hitting something like half a million motorists who have converted their vehicles to LPG. We discovered this fact on the night the budget was delivered, but it seems as though it was not until a day later that the Treasurer knew that he had actually imposed this new tax and was able to confirm to the LPG industry that they would now be a part of the excise regime. So the Treasurer comes into this place, delivers a budget but does not even know what is in the documents himself!
The big, other issue that overhangs this budget is the great big new tax on mining profits. Only a little while ago the government put on the couch in the back room its great big new tax—the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. That was a tax that would have destroyed Australian jobs, encouraged industry to locate offshore and increased the cost of living for all Australians. Now that scheme is dozing, Labor has invented another great big new tax on Australians. This is a tax that will also destroy Australian jobs, encourage industry to invest offshore and increase the cost of living for every Australian. This 40 per cent tax on mining profits will force the tax rate for the sector up to 57 per cent—yet the government claims that this big new super tax will actually increase investment in the mining sector! I have never heard of a tax yet that actually increased investment. The government is in fact putting a significant tax on cigarettes in this budget. They claim the reason for that is to reduce smoking. But when they put an increased tax on the mining sector, that is supposed to make them bigger and stronger. That is clearly a nonsense. It is all about Labor’s approach: spend big and tax even bigger. That is not a satisfactory way to run a country.
The government’s proposed mining tax is not fair. It not only penalises great big mining companies, as the government would lead you to believe, but small, battling mining operations as well. It is not a tax on super profits; it cuts in at the bond rate, five or six per cent—just over breakeven—and the government thinks that is a ‘super’ profit. It is a super tax, but not just on super profits. The reality is that it affects not just big mine operators but small operators as well. And, of course it affects the quarrying industry—the industry that delivers the gravel for your roads, the stones for the landscaping in your front yard, the clay for the bricks in your house. All of these operations are to be caught up in Labor’s great big new tax on the mining sector. They are also proposing, we are told, to justify this tax on the grounds that it will fund a $700 million Infrastructure Fund. That says a lot about the Labor government, which has actually drained dry the Infrastructure Fund that was left to them by the previous government. There is only $700 million left out of the $11 billion that was in place and heading to $40 billion. Labor did not just spend the interest, as was intended for those funds; it actually spent all the capital. So it spent all that money, with little to show for it, and now it wants a $700 million new Infrastructure Fund.
This is a tax on the mining sector. We are told the mining sector needs to deliver more to regional communities, but there is no commitment by the government that this $700 million will be spent in regional communities. There is no guarantee that any of it will go back to the communities that are directly affected by mining. It looks to me like yet another great big Labor slush fund that is likely to appear in marginal electorate promise sheets and that the funding will in fact be directed away from mining communities—the country towns and regional communities that are contributing to our nation’s growth and prosperity through the mining and the resource boom—and spent in capital city electorates where Labor is hanging on to a narrow margin. This is not an infrastructure fund at all. It is a Labor Party election slush fund, and you can count on it appearing regularly during the run-up to the election as Labor tries to hand out goodies to save its bacon in areas where it has clearly neglected the people. The Labor approach is to milk the cash cow until it is dry or burden the cow’s owner so much that he ships his cow overseas to a greener pasture, and it is only the Australian Labor Party that cannot see the folly of this policy.
Relative mining minor minnows like Papua New Guinea, Zambia and Mongolia have seen the error of their ways and dumped similar mining taxes. The Zambian tax lasted all of a year before President Rupiah Banda consigned it to history. He was blunt last year about the effect that the tax had upon his country: ‘We must ensure that we do not kill the goose that lays the golden egg. There is little point in taking a few million in tax if thousands of jobs are lost.’ What is obvious to the Zambian President is apparently not obvious to our Treasurer and the Labor government—or does the government think that the tax is going to work differently in Australia from how it worked in New Guinea, Zambia or Mongolia? Does the government still hold onto this quite ridiculous notion that somehow or other higher taxes mean more investment and a more prosperous country? The reality is that countries like the United States, Canada, Brazil and China are all looking forward to this tax because they know that it will result in industries being transferred to their country, to jobs being created there. Countries that have much lower tax regimes than Australia are certain to be the big winners from this foolishness on the Labor Party’s side.
In government, let me make it clear, we will be adopting a different approach. We will rein in Labor’s reckless spending, getting Australia back into surplus far quicker than Labor ever could. There is a question of trust and form. We have the form. We paid back Labor’s debt of $96 billion left to us in 1996. Labor has form too. It has never got out of debt once it started down that track—never in history. It took the Hawke-Keating governments just 13 years to rack up a $96 billion debt. It has taken the Rudd-Swan government just three years—three years for the same amount of debt. Under the coalition’s approach, we will take pressure off increased interest rates and the cost of living with savings of $46.7 billion that have already been identified. That is made up of $24.7 billion from recurrent spending and $22 billion in one-off capital savings. Our plan is there. It is in print and it is costed. In contrast, Labor in opposition could announce only $3 billion worth of savings ahead of the 2007 election, and then another $7 billion on the eve of election day.
A predecessor of the Treasurer once boasted the title ‘The world’s best Treasurer’—the unlamented Paul Keating. This current Treasurer, Wayne Swan, is the world’s worst Treasurer. He has been able to turn a record surplus into a record deficit in just a few months. He has been able to chalk up unprecedented debt at unprecedented speed, and he has been able to turn a prosperous country that pays its own way into a debtor nation that will be mortgaging the future of generations. That is his legacy. That is the legacy of this budget. He cannot be trusted with another one.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2010-2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"King, Catherine, MP",ALP,2010-05-24,"—I rise to support Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011 and cognate budget appropriation bills, Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2010-2011 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011. I cannot help but comment on the contribution of the previous speaker, the member for Wide Bay, in this place. I find it passing strange that the member for Wide Bay, in his speech, decided to criticise the government for not continuing with the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program, which was a one-off fund as part of the economic stimulus package which has put $1 billion into the hands of local government but which has now got even more money out of it as a result of the spend they have done on local communities. You cannot, on the one hand, claim that somehow that is a cut in the budget because a project fund that was about to finish has finished and, on the other, I remind the member for Wide Bay, vote against it. There would not have been any fund in existence at all had you been in government. It is a ridiculous proposition. It is also great to see the member for Wide Bay, once again, standing up for the powerful vested interests in the mining industry over those of ordinary working Australians.
I support these bills because they represent a responsible budget that strengthens our economy. It is important for us to consider this budget in the context of previous budgets. Back in May 2007, I stood up in this House and debated the Howard government’s 2007-08 budget bills. The greatest failing of that final budget of the Howard government was that it did not address capacity constraints in the Australian economy. It failed to invest in infrastructure, skills, education and health. It failed, across the board, to lay down the foundation of a nation’s future economic growth. The Howard government was happy to ride on the tails of the mining boom, but it was not happy to do the hard yards that were needed to invest in our economy’s future. For too long, the Howard government instead used budgets to buy individual votes to win elections for short-term gain and, although this proved successful for a long period of time for Howard and to some extent for the now Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, it did not prove successful for the future growth of the Australian economy and ultimately for the future prospects of the Australian people.
On coming to office, the Prime Minister and members of the Rudd government made a conscious decision to set up our nation for the future. We said to the Australian people that we wanted to work to invest in the longer term—not just the current election cycle but five, 10 or 20 years ahead. We spoke of the need for investment in infrastructure, skills, training and education. We committed to stop the buck-passing in health by reforming our nation’s health system.
In February 2009 I spoke in parliament in the face of a global financial crisis that was set to wreak havoc on local communities, local economies and economies across the globe. I find it extraordinary when, in talking and debating about the budget, members of the opposition seem to think that the global financial crisis just did not happen or that somehow, as a result of some strange fluke of fate, Australia has managed to survive the worst excesses of the global crisis and that that somehow has happened completely by accident.
The Rudd government and the Australian people were faced with tackling this global financial crisis head-on, and members of this side of the House acted decisively. At that point in time we had a choice: to deliver strong, unprecedented action to combat the nation’s worst global financial crisis in 70 years or not to act and to let the market pave the way. Let me make this point very clear: those members opposite did not want to act. They opposed our economic stimulus.
Members on our side decided to act by implementing a measured and well-targeted stimulus package. Instead of looking at the global financial crisis as an absolute negative, the Rudd government used it as a tool to invest in the long-term sustainability of our nation. We used it, on the one hand, to stimulate the economy by supporting jobs and, on the other hand, to invest in areas that the former Howard government had forgotten—areas like infrastructure, housing, education, road and rail and local community infrastructure. The result is that Australia has outperformed other advanced economies. While advanced economies collectively contracted by 3.2 per cent, the Australian economy grew by 1.4 per cent. While advanced economies were faced with rapid job losses, 225,000 Australian people found work. Without our stimulus, the Australian economy would have fallen into recession, with tens of thousands of jobs lost. Our national unemployment rate is the second lowest in comparison to other advanced economies. The results speak for themselves. These results reflect the hard work of the Australian people, the resilience of the Australian economy and the decisive action the government took in implementing its economic stimulus package. These results did not occur by accident.
The Liberals’ do-nothing approach would have been a disaster for this country. The Leader of the Opposition is quick to attempt to make light of our economic situation. At the time of the implementation of our stimulus measures, the coalition unleashed another of their scare campaigns. They failed to recognise that a global financial crisis was apparent, they failed to recognise the fall in tax receipts and its impact on the budget bottom line and they failed to support our direct action through stimulus measures. Without the stimulus, we would have lost thousands of jobs in this country. Without stimulus, we would have seen a contraction in our economy last year of 0.7 per cent, compared to the actual growth of 1.4 per cent. They are the facts. This message seems to fall on deaf ears with those opposite, who claim to be the extraordinary economic managers of our time. It falls on deaf ears because those opposite do not want to hear our nation’s good news story when it comes to how we have survived the global financial crisis.
The Rudd government has a proud story to tell when it comes to economic management. The 2010-11 budget continues this proud story. The budget reflects the success of our policy decisions over the last 18 months. The budget reflects the strong economic position we now find ourselves in, and it builds on these successes. The successes of the Australian economy through the global financial crisis mean that we now have a strong opportunity to tackle the nation’s long-term needs in skills, training, health, education and infrastructure. This budget delivers on those long-term objectives. The budget is building on hard work throughout the global financial crisis to deliver for the future. Through this budget, we will be back in the black in three years, three years ahead of schedule and ahead of every major advanced economy. Through this budget, we build on our hard work by delivering a stable budget that brings us back to surplus three years early.
This government is well aware of the impact of our ageing population combined with the current cost pressures for families in our health system. The government has put health and hospitals at the forefront of our agenda, and this budget delivers on that commitment to our national health reform. Through the budget, we have invested a further $2.2 billion into the health system, and this brings the total new investment in health from this government to $7.3 billion over five years. Our $2.2 billion package further delivers for our National Health and Hospitals Network. This government has worked hard to deliver that network.
Health reform is also a priority area for me personally, and I am very proud of what we are achieving in this field in the budget. Of this $2.2 billion in the health reform package, we have set aside some $417 million to improve after-hours access to GP and primary care services. Access to GPs is vital to Australian families and is something that has not been adequately addressed in the past. We have also invested a further $355 million to deliver 23 new GP superclinics and 425 GP and primary healthcare clinics across Australia.
Already, in my own electorate, the Ballan GP Super Clinic is up and running. It was opened back in September last year and it was the first in Australia. The clinic has proven vital to the flourishing community of Ballan; in fact, I think it will perhaps drive some of the population growth of Ballan as well. Over recent times, the local health system was struggling to meet demand, and this investment by the Rudd government has gone a long way to improve local health services. The clinic accommodates GPs—some of them new GPs who come into the area—practice nurses, visiting specialists and a range of allied health services. They include physiotherapy, dietetics, nutrition, podiatry, mental health services, pathology and chronic disease management services. There is also a psychologist who operates out of the facility. For the first time this local community has a dental service. The superclinic in Ballan is a great example of what we can do when we work with local communities in enhancing our health system and of what we seek to achieve with our $355 million investment to have a further 23 GP superclinics across the country. I know that members on this side of the House, who know the enormous benefits of these clinics in our communities, as I do, are all working pretty hard to try to get one of those clinics in their own electorates. It is a shame that members of the opposition wish to cut the program.
A further $523 million has been allocated to invest in training and support for nurses. These investments will see nurses better supported in GP clinics and there will be training and education incentive payments for nurses and personal care workers in aged care, and the first ever rural-local scheme for nurses.
The Rudd government plans to deliver on individual electronic health records. This $467 million reform to our health system will benefit patients and benefit our health system as a whole. I find it amazing that the Leader of the Opposition and former minister for health, who promoted electronic health records and who had it as part of his policy platform, said in his budget-in-reply speech that he will axe this important initiative. Coalition members have struggled to find support for cutting e-health initiatives among all of the major stakeholders across the country.
The government also announced an increase to the tobacco excise of 25 per cent. This came into effect on 30 April 2010. This excise increase provides not only an incentive for current smokers to quit but an effective measure to prevent young people from taking up smoking in the first place. This increase in the tobacco excise will be reinvested back into our health and hospital system—a total of $5 billion over five years.
While I am still on the topic of health and hospital reform, I would also like to put on the parliamentary record the Rudd government’s recent announcement to fund the new $55 million cancer centre for Ballarat in conjunction with the state Victorian Labor government. I spoke in parliament back in February this year about the importance of the cancer centre for Ballarat and the surrounding region. In April, it was my pleasure to announce—along with Minister Roxon and the state minister for health, Minister Andrews—that the Rudd government would fund the Ballarat regional integrated cancer centre. This announcement reflects the hard work of my local community and will allow for two linear accelerators, the relocation of one linear accelerator from St John of God Hospital, four radiotherapies bunkers, 16 chemotherapy chairs, a CT scanner and a wellness centre as well. This is yet another example of the government’s efforts to reform our health and hospital system.
Through this budget, we have also worked hard to alleviate the cost-of-living pressures that are facing many Australians. The announcement of tax cuts in this year’s budget was our third round of cuts in as many years. I am pleased to have seen the hard work of the Australian people, particularly in this last year, being reflected in the 2010-11 budget by these tax cuts. These tax cuts, which were an election promise, have been delivered despite the economic circumstances in which we have found ourselves. The Australian people and those across the electorate of Ballarat have worked hard to get through the global financial crisis. These tax cuts are welcome news to those families.
To give you a slight snapshot, the cuts mean that a person earning $20,000 will pay $750 less in income tax in 2010-11, a worker earning $50,000 will pay $1,750 less in income tax in 2010-11 and a worker earning $80,000 will pay $1,500 less over the next financial year. They are significant savings for families. Our tax cuts are also welcome news to low-income and part-time workers. We have lifted the low-income tax offset to $1,500 to provide an effective tax-free threshold of $16,000.
On top of the tax cuts, we are also working to make tax time simpler for families with our reforms to the tax system. From 1 July 2012, taxpayers will have the option to choose a standard deduction of $500 instead of claiming work related expenses. This will increase to $1,000 by 1 July 2013. This takes the hassle out of tax time for many families. Families will not have to go rummaging for receipts come tax time, hopefully saving some precious family time as well.
One of the things that I have often spoken about since being elected is the importance of investment in skills and infrastructure. This budget invests significantly in both of these. We have invested some $661 million to assist people enhance their qualifications by taking up one of the 40,000 additional training place and 22,500 new apprentices as part of our Apprentice Kickstart program. I have spoken to many of the young people across the electorate that have been involved in the Apprentice Kickstart program and it is great to see the investment by this government in young people’s skills through this program continuing.
The other day I was in Bacchus Marsh with Parliamentary Secretary Clare. We spoke with a number of apprentices at the Amber Hair Studio. The take-up of apprentices across the Moorabool Shire has increased by 45 per cent compared to the previous year, with 42 local apprentices getting started between December 2009 and February 2010. The apprentices and their employers who spoke to Parliamentary Secretary Clare and me are delighted by the program. There has been a boost in apprenticeship numbers across other areas of my electorate, with a 77 per cent increase across the City of Ballarat, and an in increase in Hepburn Shire from five apprentices a year to 20 apprentices in 2009-2010. This is an additional 15 young people, who would not have got the opportunity otherwise, who now have their pathway set for a future career.
Our announcement means that until 12 November businesses that employ fewer than 200 people can benefit from a $3,350 bonus payment in addition to the $1,500 commencement initiative if they take on a school leaver in a traditional trade apprenticeship. The Rudd government is absolutely determined to skill up people in my region, and that is great news for local communities.
In addition to our skills program, we have also worked hard to invest in our long-term economic growth through infrastructure investment. Project after project across my electorate is well underway to set up our local economy for the future. Through the Regional and Local Community Infrastructure Program local governments have rolled out many projects that are benefiting local communities. Projects under round 1 have all been delivered and round 2 projects are well underway. Our funding through the Blackspots Program and Roads to Recovery has also ensured that the local governments have had the funded needed to deliver on local road projects. Not only have we seen a vast improvement in local roads—especially in terms of safety—but this has also contributed to local jobs growth.
This budget further invests in nation-building projects in the Ballarat electorate. They include the Western Highway realignment of Anthonys Cutting, which the Prime Minister and I had the pleasure of visiting the other month for the sod turning; and the Western Highway duplication from Ballarat to Stawell, which the Victorian Premier, John Brumby, and I visited the other month also. Both nation-building projects are incredibly important to my district. They are both projects that are investing in the long-term growth of communities like Ballarat across Western Victoria.
Residents of the Ballarat electorate are already experiencing the benefits of the Deer Park bypass, which I lobbied tirelessly for. Once these two new projects have been completed, the western region of Victoria will have a first-rate highway that extends all the way from Melbourne through to the South Australian border. These projects are setting up Ballarat and the surrounding region for the future. They create jobs in the short term and provide safe and reliable road infrastructure in the longer term. The budget builds further on our infrastructure investment through the new $5.6 billion infrastructure fund. The fund will commence in 2012-13 and will place infrastructure funding at the forefront of Commonwealth spending. We are doing this because we know that investment in infrastructure is one of the most important elements of a productive economy.
I would also like to discuss one of the core challenges faced by not only Australia but other nations, and that is climate change. We are boosting, through this budget, our investment in a new Renewable Energy Future Fund. This reflects our strong commitment to increase the renewable energy target by 20 per cent by 2020. A $652 million investment over four years forms part of our $6.1 billion clean energy initiative. We are using this funding to increase the take-up by business and households of energy efficiency measures. Aside from our new investment through the Renewable Energy Future Fund, the Rudd government is committed to continue our efforts internationally to form agreement with other countries about future action on climate change and on what we do domestically.
There are a number of differences between the Rudd government and the coalition. First, the Rudd government decided to take decisive action to tackle the global financial crisis. Those opposite did not. Second, our appropriations since we were elected have recognised the strong need to invest in our long-term future—in the National Broadband Network; skills and training; local community infrastructure; roads and ports; education; and national health reform. Those opposite have opposed all of these measures. Third, in the wake of a prospective global recession, we made the most of an opportunity to invest in reducing our economy’s capacity constraints. Those opposite missed opportunities during the initial mining boom. Fourth, our 2010-11 budget continues our sound economic management and targeted investment. The alternative government reflects the worst economic management team in the history of the Liberal Party of Australia. Finally, our actions have been supported by key stakeholders—from Treasury to the Reserve Bank, business and community groups and international bodies—and admired by other countries. The alternative from those opposite has been supported by nobody.
I am proud of this government’s strong economic management. The budget reflects our direct action to support jobs and to bring us back to surplus early. The budget delivers a new Renewable Energy Future Fund; tax cuts and a reduction in red tape for small business; investment in health and hospitals; investment in skills, training and infrastructure; better superannuation, tax breaks on interest and a boost to national savings; a standard deduction to make tax time easier; more money to protect our troops and our borders; and a return to surplus in three years—three years ahead of schedule. The budget takes advantage of our strong economic position and sets up our nation for the future. I commend the bills to the House.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2010-2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Robb, Andrew, MP",LP,2010-05-24,"—I rise to comment on the budget brought down nearly two weeks ago in the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011 and related bills. The fact of the matter is that this government inherited perhaps the strongest economy in the Western World. It inherited an economy that had had 16 years of economic growth. It inherited an economy with zero government debt and close to $50 billion in reserve. It inherited an economy with unemployment at four per cent—almost a historic low. This provided the basis to deal with the unexpected global financial crisis. Every other country of any consequence—the developed countries, at least—went into the global financial crisis with significant government debt, no reserves and much higher unemployment. And we have seen the outcome. It is no different from the situation at a family level in the suburbs: if one individual and his family have no mortgage, $80,000 or $90,000 in the bank and a job, while their neighbour has a $450,000 mortgage and no money in the bank, who is going to get through a recession more satisfactorily, more effectively? It is common sense. The family that has no debt and has sufficient reserves will be able to position itself, with a prudent approach to budgeting and all the rest, to get comfortably through a downturn, while the neighbour may well end up selling their house at a fire-sale price and moving into rented accommodation and experiencing all the stress that goes with it.
It is exactly the same for the economy on a nationwide level. Our country was in exceptional shape to deal with what was a major recession, especially in the Northern Hemisphere. Yet this government, in the space of 2½ years, has fundamentally undermined the great resilience that characterised this economy. If there is a double-dip recession around the world, our economy will be far more vulnerable to what might happen in the weeks or months ahead. This budget has done absolutely nothing to correct this situation. There are no tough decisions in this budget. This is a coward’s budget. It is the budget of people who live by the politics of the day and have no long-term vision. Where will the Prime Minister take this economy over the next three to six years if given the opportunity? You cannot answer that question. You cannot answer it from what he has done. The only conclusion you can reach is that we will continue to go backwards as a country—in terms of the resilience of our economy, the great drivers of growth in our economy—because this Prime Minister, his Treasurer and other senior colleagues have taken no tough decisions. They have been all talk and no action. There have been hundreds of inquiries and there have been major expectations built up. This Prime Minister is no different from the handyman we all know who starts hundreds of jobs and finishes none of them. He has got no capacity to implement projects.
This government is characterised by some of the most wasteful and mismanaged projects in the country’s history. The pink batts program has wasted billions of dollars. The Building the Education Revolution, the school halls program, has wasted billions and billions of dollars. This government stands condemned for the way in which it has mishandled public moneys but more particularly for the way in which it has panicked and responded over the last 2½ years to the challenges that have been thrown up for this economy. It has overspent in a massive way and this budget does absolutely nothing to address that issue.
This third budget brought down by the Treasurer is a political document, make no mistake about that. It is a political document and is not a document designed to address the challenges and opportunities faced by this country. It is a budget which is not believable. It is a house of cards. It is based on a ‘trust me’ approach, heroic assumptions and great big new taxes. It makes no allowance for any eventuality that might occur overseas. It makes no allowance for the impact of some of these great big new taxes on the ability of some of our stronger sectors to respond, to keep growing and to contribute to the resilience that they have displayed over such a long period of time. Of course the thing that we do know about this budget, one of the few things of any certainty, is that the spending keeps going. It is reckless spending and an insatiable desire to keep spending money to solve problems. The only way in which this Prime Minister and his Treasurer feel that issues can be addressed is to throw more money at them. It is a tax-and-spend budget—tax, borrow and spend. That marks the sort of sorry history of this short-term government.
The government will give us four more years of deficit, all to combat one quarter of negative growth in 2008. The response to that one quarter of negative growth has been to borrow, borrow and borrow again and to spend, spend and spend; so much so that the economy now is not in balance. The reckless spending, which this budget continues, has been the reason we have now got the highest interest rates in the Western world. It is the reason so many families across this country are now finding it extraordinarily difficult to meet their cost of living expenses and are finding it difficult to pay their power bills. Power has gone up 18 to 22 per cent across the nation over the last 12 months, petrol prices have gone up over six per cent over the last 12 months, rates are going through the roof in many areas and fruit and vegetable costs have been above the CPI. Many, many areas of our everyday expenses have well exceeded the CPI, sometimes two, three and four times as high. Yet this government, which came to office making very strong and heartfelt promises about what they would do to the cost of living and how they would deal with the challenges people face every day to meet their budget so as to enable people to live within their means and have some peace of mind, have certainly not shown any of that sort of approach. By example, the government have not lived within their means and this budget does nothing to curtail the reckless spending to bring this government and their bureaucracy back onto course which would see our record debt paid off in due course.
The government will give us four years of deficit. The deficit this year of $57 billion will be the biggest deficit in Australia’s peacetime history. You heard very little mention of what had happened with the current year we are in. They did not want to refer to this $57 billion because it is the highest deficit in our history by a country mile. Also what they did not want to say was that much of that $57 billion, something well in excess of $7 billion, was spent and not programmed in last year’s budget. They have been spending like drunken sailors with the intent of burying that spending in the $57 billion deficit this year and taking some load off next year’s deficit. It is a political budget. They plan to spend and spend in some attempt to misrepresent the figures and their record of spending.
Next year, of course, we are told we will have the second biggest deficit in our history of $40.8 billion. We will believe that when we see it. It is in all likelihood, by the way in which this government are responding, to go higher and higher. We also have not only deficit record levels but a level of net debt of $93 billion, equal to that left by the Keating government. On top of that, of course, they have foreshadowed that they will be borrowing an extra $18 billion in the next four years to fund their national broadband project; the white elephant which will materialise in seven or eight years’ time and, at best, give a return of the bond rate. It is a white elephant that they then expect to sell to somebody with a return at the bond rate. This will be a case of nationalising telecommunications. No other country in the world is heading in the direction to renationalise telecommunications but, of course, this government will. It is something in the order of $110 billion in the next three or four years, then they will add another $8 billion to $15 billion of borrowing to complete that national broadband project.
This is a reckless government. This is a government that thinks you can borrow and spend and that someone else can fix up the problem. The government continues to borrow $100 million a day. It has done so for a year and it will do so for the next two years to meet the forecasts embodied within this budget. It will borrow $100 million a day for this reckless spending. That is every week. Every week, this government is borrowing the equivalent of a world-class new hospital. A world-class new hospital could be built each week with that borrowed money. This is what we are accumulating.
The improvement to the budget bottom line is entirely due to what the government term ‘parameter changes’: stronger economic growth in Australia, with predictions of very high sustained growth, and above-trend growth offshore. They are basing this budget over the next four years on the highest terms of trade in 60 years and they are basing it on $17 billion in new taxes. Of course, another of the accounting tricks is that they classify the revenue from new taxes as savings. It is all spin—it is a disingenuous way of presenting the nation’s books and accounts. It is based on unrealistic assumptions. People can have absolutely no confidence in the quality of the forecasts, in the nature of the outcome or in the suggestion that the government will at the end of three or four years produce a wafer-thin surplus.
This budget does not rely on responsible economic management. There is not a hard decision in this budget to cut the reckless and wasteful government spending. All the cuts in expenditure were targeted in specific areas such as pharmaceuticals, as opposed to broad based programs, with close to 80 per cent of the so-called savings being achieved between 2012-13 and 2013-14. All of this is back-ended and off to the never-never, with no prospect of this government demonstrating any discipline.
We might have expected a lower spending budget, as there is no longer a need for stimulus to counter the global financial crisis and because of the pick-up in commodity prices in China and other economies and the fact that countries are now in many cases streaming out of recession. But what do we find? Over and above what the government forecast last year in the budget for spending this coming year, the year after that and the year after that, we see $26 billion of excess spending. Indeed, there was no winding back of previously allocated stimulus spending despite the very different economic circumstances. Further delays will occur in the school halls program, which will mean that $500 million of stimulus will not be spent until 2011-12, at least three years after the global financial crisis.
This is where the increased spending is now starting to compete heavily with small business trying to access finance. It is starting to compete for all other forms of borrowing by big business, small business and mortgage holders. As a consequence, it is pushing up interest rates. We have now had six interest rate increases in a row. Some of the thousands of young couples who were encouraged last year to take out a mortgage, buy a home and get on with it are this year facing between $4,000 and $5,000 more in mortgage repayments than they expected last year. That is $5,000 they will have to find after tax—they will have to earn an extra $7,000 or $8,000 between them. Many of these young couples will be facing very severe financial problems at present.
This budget is full of accounting tricks. It is full of new taxes and more wasteful spending, including $1 billion to correct the policy failures with boat people, $1 billion to fix up the pink batts program and a $4 billion a year blow-out in government debt interest rates. The government has allocated $536 million, over half a billion dollars, for new health bureaucracies as part of its health reform. This government promised in its health reform not to have any increase in the bureaucracy, yet it has budgeted for an extra half a billion dollars for new health bureaucracies as part of its so-called reform.
At the last election the government promised 36 GP superclinics; of course, only two are fully operational. This is typical—all talk, no action. But, on top of that, this budget says the government will deliver another 23 superclinics, additional to the 36 of which only two have been delivered. How can anyone possibly have any confidence in the promises made by the government? The core beliefs and values of the government have evaporated over the last few months. Their support for things like the emissions trading scheme went out the window. This was a clever accounting trick to ensure that the $10 billion that would have gone to the expenditure line did not occur and therefore the ratio of expenditure to GDP was able to stay within the parameters that they had set. It is all artificially created. The government dumped the ETS so that they could create an artificial ratio of expenditure to GDP.
This is a political document; this is not a policy document. They are giving $10 million grants to the Trade Union Education Foundation. They are giving an additional $12 million to the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet—that is another 14 per cent increase. The government said they would take a meataxe to the Public Service and yet 20,000 new public servant positions have been created in the space of 2¾ years.
The budget surplus relies solely on a very big new tax on the growth engine of this economy. The sector that helped pull this country through the global financial crisis, the resources sector, will now face a massive retrospective tax which will see our resource sector with 58 per cent effective tax on its operations. By comparison, the nearest to Australia will be the United States at 40 per cent—an 18 per cent greater tax load. It will put in jeopardy, and it has already put in jeopardy and prevented, work to develop $310 billion of new projects. This budget is a political document. It is a confirmation of the tax-and-spend approach of this government. This government is not fit to govern. The only way to turn around our great debt and deficit is to change the government.

"Rishworth, Amanda, MP",ALP,2010-05-24,"—I am very pleased to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011 and cognate bills. The budget that the Treasurer presented to this House was a budget for its time. The budget before us is a responsible budget, a budget that is in the national interest. The government acknowledges that families still need help, but the budget puts a priority on strengthening the economy and securing sustainable growth into the future. This budget is indicative of the government’s response to the global financial crisis, a crisis that Australia avoided due to both the responsible, decisive fiscal policy of the Rudd Labor government and the determination of the Australian people who pulled together to keep people in jobs.
This budget builds on the strong foundation developed by the government in previous budgets. It converts Australia’s success during the global recession into a stronger, more secure economy for working families. It will halve peak debt, bringing the budget back into the black in three years. This is three years earlier than expected and ahead of every major advanced economy. One cannot and should not underestimate this achievement. Decisive action now, as also occurred during the global financial crisis, will ensure the future prosperity of Australia and secure the economy and the financial security of the Australian people, including many families in my electorate of Kingston. The strong position of the nation’s economy ensures that the people of the southern suburbs of Adelaide will be better positioned than people in many other places around the developed world to take advantage of the opportunities ahead. The Rudd Labor government believes in the fortitude and ability of the Australian people, and this budget represents its commitment to these people by ensuring responsible economic management, halving peak debt and securing future growth.
Those opposite have opposed the government’s action to support jobs during the global financial crisis, and there is no doubt that they will now oppose its actions to keep the government finances strong. But this budget does have significant things for the people in my electorate, and the historic health and hospital reform is especially significant to people in the southern suburbs of Adelaide. The residents of southern Adelaide deserve to live in a community where they are confident about the provision of health services to their loved ones. The Rudd government’s ongoing commitment to health will go a long way towards achieving this goal.
The government’s planned reform represents the most significant reform to Australia’s health and hospital system since the introduction of Medicare. The government is investing $7.3 billion over five years, and this is an enormous commitment to our health and hospital system. The 2010-11 budget delivers a $2.2 billion package investing in the National Health and Hospitals Network over four years. This funding will have a genuinely positive impact on health providers within my electorate. Hospitals such as Flinders Medical Centre and Noarlunga Hospital will be able to provide a better level of care for the people in our local area. This spending is vital to improving the healthcare system for all Australians and also vital to my local constituents.
This budget reflects the Rudd government’s commitment to health reform and its ongoing commitment to health within Australia. The $417 million Medicare Locals program is a commitment to ensure that it will be easier for people in Kingston and around the country to see a doctor at any time, day or night. This investment will improve after-hours access to GP and primary care services. This is a significant investment in the ongoing health and wellbeing of the elderly, parents and young people in my electorate, ensuring that all Australians have access to high-quality and affordable after-hours services. This builds on the Rudd government’s commitment to making sure that after-hours GP services are provided. In my electorate alone, a number of different grants have already been announced to ensure that GP services are available after hours. Services are already being made available in Morphettville, Huntfield Heights, Sheidow Park, Aldinga and Seaford. The further improvements to after-hours services will be widely welcomed in my local area, because people know that getting to see a GP can be difficult at the best of times.
The opposition—and, indeed, the opposition leader—have indicated that they do not believe that there is a problem out there in the provision of GP services. My message to the opposition leader is that in outer metropolitan Adelaide there is a problem with getting to see a GP. I hear regularly from my constituents that there is a shortage. They often wait up to three or four weeks just to get an appointment with a GP. It is disappointing that the opposition leader, who is a former Minister for Health and Ageing, refuses to acknowledge that there is a real crisis in accessing medical services and that the private sector has not filled all the gaps in outer metropolitan Adelaide.
The budget also outlines the government’s commitment to provide up to $950 million to increase the capacity of emergency departments and improve the time line for treatment. This has also been widely welcomed by my constituents in Kingston. The Rudd government is committed to a four-hour emergency department target. This will require patients to be admitted and then either referred or treated and discharged within four hours. This is an achievable goal, and we believe that Australians ought to be able to see a doctor wherever and whenever they need one. This will ensure that every Australian has access to the advice they deserve.
As the Minister for Health and Ageing has regularly noted, nurses are the cornerstone of any effective health system. The Rudd government acknowledges the vital role that these individuals play in the provision of health care to real working Australians and is therefore committed to investing $535 million for additional training and support to Australian nurses. Nurses play a critical role in our health system, and the Rudd government is dedicated to ongoing support of these individuals.
I draw the attention of the House to the controversial issue the opposition is opposing—that is, the issue of GP superclinics. GP superclinics are an effective and necessary addition to the health field within Australia. The government has dedicated $355 million over three years to building more of these clinics across the country. We are now seeing clinics being developed in my electorate of Kingston in the form of the Noarlunga GP Super Clinic, due to be completed this year. This will provide an important service by incorporating doctors and other allied health professionals in one location. Such clinics take the pressure off the hospital system, and we have seen this in evidence with the state government provided GP Plus services. Since becoming operational, the one in Aldinga in my electorate has seen a decrease of 13 per cent in presentations to the accident and emergency clinic, with residents in Aldinga instead presenting at the GP Plus centre.

Honourable members interjecting—
—Order! The House will come to order. Hopefully, a lot of people have got it out of their system before we even start. The Leader of the Opposition has the call.
—Following last week’s announcement by Fortescue Metals that it has placed two projects on hold worth $17½ billion in investment and up to 30,000 jobs, I refer the Prime Minister to today’s announcement by the head of Rio Tinto, Mr Tom Albanese, that all Rio Tinto’s Australian expansion plans have been put on hold, that capital would shift to other nations like Canada and that the Rudd government’s proposed great big new tax on mining was Rio Tinto’s top sovereign risk issue on a global basis. I ask the Prime Minister: how much damage will the Australian economy suffer before the Prime Minister backs down on his great big new tax on mining?",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Budget</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1,question
"Rudd, Kevin, MP",ALP,2010-05-24,"—I thank the Leader of the Opposition for his question and I draw his attention to the sort of debate which occurred in this place, and more broadly, when we brought in the petroleum rent resource tax in the mid-1980s. There were loud threats across the nation and from abroad about the impact on the Australian offshore mining industry at that time through the introduction of the tax. That tax was a tax on profits. The proposed RSPT is a tax on profits. Every economic analyst concludes that a tax on profits is a more efficient tax than a tax on volumes.
The second point that the Leader of the Opposition asked was about, I think, a reference to Fortescue Metals. Notice was given to the ASX by Fortescue last Wednesday noting that the projects in question had been placed on hold. I note the two paragraphs in the Australian newspaper on 20 May which said:
Mr Forrest’s move to delay the Solomon project was last night labelled a “political statement” more than a genuine setback to the company’s plans.
It went on to say:
Credit Suisse analyst Nathan Littlewood noted Fortescue had not abandoned its Solomon feasibility study due for completion later this year, by which time a federal election would have been held …
I also draw attention to recent statements which have been made by Mr Forrest concerning China and the response which has been forthcoming on that as well. As the Leader of the Opposition will know, there will be many, many statements by many, many companies, and all of them may have this in common: they do not want to pay more tax.
This government believes that the time has come for tax reform which delivers a fair return for all Australians, a fair return for those who depend on this tax for investing in our future infrastructure, a fair return from this tax to support super for working families and a fair return from this tax in order to bring down the taxation burden for Australian business. This reform, as the Leader of the Opposition knows full well, has been projected by independent modelling to bring about an overall increase in mining activity of 5.5 per cent as well as bringing about other deep reforms in the tax system, and incentives and global competitiveness to the Australian economy at large.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Budget</title>,Questions Without Notice,8,1,answer

"Rudd, Kevin, MP",ALP,2010-05-24,"—Once again, we have those opposite standing in defence of the existing taxation arrangements which apply to Australia’s mining industry. The member for North Sydney referred to a statement made by the Treasurer on Sunday in reference to a report that had been put out by the National Bureau of Economic Research. My advice is that is a credible research institute. Secondly, I draw attention to the fact that, when it comes to the combined incidence of both royalties and the company tax rate on mining companies, the government has seen a 50 per cent drop in the share of tax taken from mining company profits over the past 10 years even if you factor in both company tax and royalties. Resource profits were over $80 billion higher in 2008-09 than in 1999-2000. Governments have only collected an additional $9 billion in revenue. These figures speak for themselves. We stand for reforming the system; those opposite stand for the status quo.

"Swan, Wayne, MP",ALP,2010-05-24,"—by leave—The government’s plan for a stronger, simpler, fairer tax system was announced three weeks ago. Since that time, it has been the subject of robust debate around the country—particularly on the Resource Super Profits Tax. We welcome this debate about the future of our economy, and we hope it continues. It is important that debate remains constructive—contributing to increased public understanding and a robust design for the RSPT. Inaccurate information and scare campaigns risk getting in the way of this, undermining the important work we must do to strengthen our economy and secure higher living standards for working families.
We must not lose sight of the key aim of the policy—to ensure a fairer share of the proceeds of the resources boom are invested in a stronger economy for all Australians. We will do this by replacing royalties with a Resource Super Profits Tax and directing the proceeds to higher retirement savings for Australians, more roads, rail and ports, and less business tax and red tape, especially for small business.
The Australian people own 100 per cent of Australia’s natural resources and they deserve a fairer share of the superprofits mining companies make, particularly during this boom. As these profits have risen in recent years the Australian people’s share of those profits has fallen. Before the last boom, the country got $1 in every $3 of mining profits through royalties and resource charges, but at the end of that boom that was down to just $1 in $7. It is impossible to justify a system where Australians pay proportionately more tax as their income goes up, while mining companies pay proportionately less as their profits go up. The companies have been unable to justify this, and I cannot let the situation stand.
Profits were over $80 billion higher in 2008-09 than in 1999‑2000 yet governments only collected an additional $9 billion in revenue. The government simply wants to take the Australian people’s share of mining profits back to around where it was in the early 2000s. The Howard government was not overtaxing the resource sector then, and this government won’t either. In fact, we will get the same share with a more pro-investment tax structure.
The reforms will broaden and strengthen the economy, ensuring all sectors grow in a sustainable way that benefits all Australians. We must finally grapple with the policy failures of past mining booms by ensuring the resource and non-resource sectors grow together, not apart.
Of course, we have analysis to support this. Independent modelling by KPMG Econtech of the RSPT and the effective abolition of royalties says resource investment increases by 4.5 per cent, resource sector employment by seven per cent and resource sector output by 5.5 per cent. The modelling also shows that the tax reform package—including the RSPT and our cuts to company tax—will actually reduce the price of food and housing.
National conversation
In the last week I have travelled across most Australian states discussing the story of our budget, a story of our nation’s successful navigation of the global recession. I have also been discussing our economic plans for the future, including our important tax reforms.
I have met with big miners, and smaller miners. I have met with some of the people who will pay more tax given current high profits under our proposal. I have also met with many of the businesses who will pay less.
People have explained their concerns about how the last boom was handled, how capacity constraints and an infrastructure deficit choked growth. I have also spoken to South Australian and Victorian manufacturers, and Queensland tourism operators, who have outlined the challenges created for them when the dollar is high.
As a Queenslander, I recognise the particular importance of resources to my home state, but also to Western Australia. I have seen the problems of infrastructure deficits in cities and towns along the Queensland coast. My many visits to Western Australia have convinced me of the need to keep reinvesting in the resource-producing regions.
The government’s infrastructure fund is designed to do just this. It will provide a permanent structural source of funding for infrastructure, especially targeted at resource states and regions. It will start at $700 million in 2012-13, and grow over time, delivering more than $5.6 billion in additional funding over the next decade.
Countering the myths
I welcomed the opportunity over this past week to get out and engage directly with businesses, especially the mining sector. Now, I am the last person to stand here and tell this House that the miners are all thrilled with our plans. Those who will pay more tax are unhappy, and I will not whitewash that.
But you cannot make big reforms, and you cannot attempt to remedy the policy failures of past mining booms, while keeping everybody happy. It might be the job of those opposite to pretend you can, but government is a very different and a much harder business.
I used my time with miners this week to explain the core design features of our RSPT. I discussed with them that we were effectively abolishing royalties by refunding them against the RSPT. That the 40 per cent rate is fair because it gets us closer to where our tax take was in the past. It is also the rate of the existing resource rent tax that has been operating for 23 years.
Sometimes in these discussions I heard a few myths, and I want to deal with those now.
The first is that this tax threatens Australia’s economic prosperity.
Nobody disputes that the existing arbitrary and continually changing state royalty regimes result in less mining investment, fewer mining jobs and less mining production. Royalties tax production and ignore the costs involved in generating that output. Many of our mines shut down too early, while others can’t ever get off the ground. It also means we poorly manage our resources—we leave too many commercially viable resources in the ground, purely because royalties make them uneconomic.
Similarly, all reputable economists agree that resource rent taxes like the RSPT do not affect investment, jobs or production. I encourage members to read the article by Ben Smith from the Australian National University in today’s Canberra Times, or other pieces by Professor John Freebairn from the University of Melbourne and, of course, Professor Ross Garnaut.
Second, some have claimed the RSPT is a triple tax on mining.
The leader of the miners’ campaign, Clive Palmer, even talked about a 70 per cent tax. This is blatantly false and has never been substantiated. The RSPT will not be imposed on top of royalties and company tax. It will effectively replace royalties by providing firms with a refundable tax credit for royalties. Where royalty payments are higher than the RSPT liability, firms will get a cash refund for the difference.
The RSPT is also deductible against company tax. Regrettably, even some sophisticated commentators have talked about the theoretical maximum rate of 56.8 per cent as if every project will pay that rate. This is also incorrect for a number of different reasons.
One reason these estimates are wrong is that they ignore that the RSPT only taxes super profits, not all profits. If a project does not generate super profits it does not pay any RSPT. And it will benefit from a company tax cut to 28 per cent and the government refund on the royalties it pays.
Firms that have lower profit levels will have a lower effective tax rate—for example, on reasonable assumptions a project with a risk-free return of 15 per cent—still a very, very healthy return—might still have an effective tax rate of 45 per cent.
However, even this calculation is an overestimate, because it does not allow for the generous company tax concessions that mining companies already benefit from.
The effective company tax rate for mining companies is well below the statutory company tax rate. This is due to a range of concessions that benefit the mining industry, most particularly generous deduction concessions.
Independent research published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, and co-authored by Professor Douglas Shackelford and Kevin Markle, looked at company tax concessions across industries and countries. They found that domestic mining companies in Australia face an effective rate of 17 per cent and multinationals face an effective rate of 13 per cent. That is well below the statutory company tax rate of 30 per cent.
Perhaps the most pervasive myth is that every return over six per cent will pay resource super profits tax. I regret to say this is a calculated and deliberate misrepresentation. If you hear a mining executive saying it, they are either lying to you or they are ignorant—either way it should be of concern to their shareholders.
It deliberately ignores three offsetting elements of the tax design. Royalties are rebated; RSPT is deductible against company tax; and the company tax rate is being cut. Once you add the combined effect of these elements, a project earning six per cent in fact pays substantially less tax under our reforms.
So for those—especially those opposite—who say the uplift factor is somehow a tax on entrepreneurialism, I say this: compare the RSPT to current royalties, which tax every dollar of return you get. But they don’t stop there. Royalties also tax your wage costs, your operating costs, this on top of applying to your investment costs. Royalties tax you before you even make a profit.
Another myth is that the economic impact of taxes depends only on how much money they raise. Every serious economic commentator understands that different taxes have different impacts, depending on how they are structured. A core finding of the independent tax review is that raising a dollar of revenue through different taxes has different impacts on growth. Royalties are one of the worst taxes for growth; resource rent taxes are one of the best.
Shifting revenue from royalties to resource rent taxes increases growth, including in the resource sector. This is because it reduces the tax paid by the smaller, more marginal mines, and increases how much we charge for the use of the highly profitable mineral deposits. And, because they are highly profitable, production will continue regardless.
That is why these reforms will improve our economy. The government’s very strong view—and the Treasury’s view—is that our reforms will grow the mining industry and the broader economy in the longer term. Again this is supported by independent economic modelling.
Investing the proceeds
So let us talk about the benefits of the package as a whole for a minute or two. All revenues from the RSPT will be used to deliver a stronger economy for Australian families. About a third of the package will directly assist the resources sector. This will be delivered through the resource exploration rebate and the new ongoing infrastructure funding.
Our plan will also improve the competitiveness of the entire economy. It will deliver a company tax rate cut for all companies. The general company tax rate will be cut to 29 per cent from 2013-14, and to 28 per cent from 2014-15. Small business will get a head start, with the rate cut to 28 per cent from 2012-13. Small business will also have access to instant write-off of assets up to $5,000 and a single depreciation pool for most other assets. These changes promote growth across the entire economy, giving some of our other industries a better chance to compete on the world stage, even with the continued success of our resource industry.
We are also determined that Australia should have something lasting to show from the sale of our non-renewable resources. We cannot squander the next boom like those opposite squandered the last one. That is why the government will boost national savings. We will boost savings through an increased superannuation guarantee, phased over 10 years. We will also boost savings by making superannuation concessions fairer for low-income earners, and we will provide more generous contribution caps for the over 50s looking to make catch-up contributions to their superannuation. And we will introduce a 50 per cent tax discount on interest income, including on deposits held with any bank, building society or credit union, as well as bonds, debentures and annuity products.
Nature of the debate
Let me comment on how this debate has played out over the past few weeks. As I said earlier, I did not expect our reforms to be greeted with singing miners in the streets. Nor did I expect any support for strong economic reform from an opposition that showed last week it has completely lost what little grip it ever had on economic policy. If you really want to judge whether to believe the Liberals’ scare campaign, look at what they do, not what they say. In the very week they were saying the mining industry would totally collapse, one of their most senior frontbenchers was buying shares in BHP because he thought they offered good long-term value.
But let me talk about the reaction from the sector more generally. I welcome Ross Garnaut’s call for a rational and reasoned debate on the RSPT—this of course is a call that has been echoed by John Hewson. As Professor Garnaut has said, the campaign against the RSPT has been long on rhetoric and threats and very short on reasoned argument. John Hewson has said that a lot of posturing is going on, but in policy terms this tax is right. Ben Smith, one of Australia’s leading resource economists, wrote today that:
… the natural reaction is to think that the industry’s predictions about its impact may well be correct. In fact, they are entirely false.
He goes on to say:
In fact, the only danger to future exploration and mining activity is the possibility that suppliers of finance might believe the industry’s rhetoric.
And David Buckingham, a former head of the Minerals Council, has lifted the veil on the hysterical scare campaign that some miners are still waging.
Company reactions
I have a lot of respect for the leaders of our business community. I do value their constructive input to any number of political debates. I say this publicly and I say it privately to them when we regularly meet or talk on the phone. I do expect a healthy degree of argy-bargy and brinkmanship with some people in business who do not want to give up any of their super profits. I understand their position. But even the mining bosses in their heart would know that there is a rolled-gold case for a fairer way to tax the industry. Their own submission called for a profits based tax.
Unfortunately, we have had a relatively small number of large companies choosing to conduct a vocal and public campaign. It has also been very strategic: companies have taken turns issuing threats to investment, so as to create maximum publicity for minimum share price impact on their own companies. They have also been careful to put projects on hold, rather than cancel them, again to minimise share market impact. They can always be taken off hold later when needed—as most think they will. As Professor Garnaut says, any project that is profitable before RSPT is profitable after. The opportunities from the mining boom are simply too big to ignore, even if the super profits are a little lower.
The government will not be swayed by a political campaign from the miners. So I call on companies to engage properly in the consultation process. The RSPT is not going away, but generous transitional arrangements will be put in place, as we have said all along.
These last three weeks have seen a few very noisy companies, and many more very quiet ones. I have been impressed by the quiet, professional engagement of some companies with our Resource Tax Consultation Panel. I do not think those companies like our RSPT any more than the noisy ones, but they do accept the right of the government to govern, and they accept our offer of consultation as genuine, and they are engaged with us in getting the implementation right.
Since our announcement of the policy, we have had more than 80 companies engaging with the Treasury consultation process. This is a serious commitment of time and effort by government and business. We believe that it is important that all companies engage so that all views can be taken into account.
Stronger Economy
Every business in Australia and every working family in every corner of Australia has a stake in sustainable and broad economic growth. Our tax package is expected to grow the economy by 0.7 per cent in the long run, boost investment by 2.1 per cent and reduce prices by 1.1 per cent.
I invite the House to compare this with the opposition’s policy to lift the company tax rate by 1.7 per cent. Our modelling shows this policy will reduce GDP by 0.2 per cent, reduce investment by 0.55 per cent and increase consumer prices by 0.25 per cent.
Australia has many significant economic advantages that can provide the foundation for growth and prosperity into the future, provided we get the policy settings right. This side of the House has a pro-growth, pro-investment policy to leverage Australia’s strengths, but that side does not.
Our substantial natural resources, strong growth in demand for our exports from countries in our neighbourhood and the quality and resilience of our people—as demonstrated most recently during the global financial crisis—give us cause for confidence that Australia’s best days lie ahead.
We are also confident that our reforms will maximise Australia’s opportunities while also meeting the challenges posed by the ageing of our population and shifts in the global economy that will see the return of boom conditions in our mining sector.
We never expected this tax to be applauded by every company, domestic or foreign. But we do expect our reforms to build a broader, stronger economy for working families and that, after all, is why we are all here.

Question agreed to.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Economy</title>,Ministerial Statements,15,1,speech
"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2010-05-24,"—The Treasurer today put the government’s case for a great big new mining tax on Australians. He has locked the government in. He has emboldened the government’s case for the tax. So be it—the battlelines are drawn. The coalition believes that this is a bad tax. We will oppose it as an opposition and we will rescind it in government.
The government’s case for this new tax is built on an enduring untruth. The economic rationale behind it is that it is an inefficient royalty system that is being replaced with a more efficient resources rent tax. It is claimed this will lead to greater investment in the industry and stronger growth. This argument might make some sense if the total tax take from the mining industry was unchanged, but this is not the case. The government’s own projections suggest that the new tax will increase net tax revenue by $3 billion in 2012-13 and $9 billion in 2013-14. This is a huge additional impost on the resources sector.
The ATO tables which I sought to table today but which the Prime Minister refused to recognise—the actual tables that record the dollars received by the government from the mining industry—tell the truth about the state of the contribution of the mining industry more generally. ATO table 8 states that the mining industry paid $8.1 billion in company tax in the 2007-08 financial year. In that year they also paid $3.9 billion in state government royalties. While company tax can be expected to rise over the next few years as a result of higher commodity prices and higher mining company profits, the additional tax take of $9 billion a year net represents a very significant additional impost on these companies. It is something like a 100 per cent increase in the contribution of the mining companies to the federal government. This is the bottom line. This is where the debate is at. The government will mouth weasel words about all sorts of transitional arrangements, but understand this: the bottom line is the government collecting nearly 100 per cent more in revenue from the mining companies each year as a direct result of this tax.
I note the government does not have the agreement of the states to abolish royalties. Royalties will still exist. We have been advised that companies will need to maintain four sets of books. Even though royalties will be rebated in part, the inefficiencies will remain. The royalty rebate applies only to royalties in place or foreshadowed on 2 May 2010. There is absolutely nothing to stop the states from lifting royalties from current levels. The government has not committed to refunding any additional royalties. If it does not, then the mining companies will pay twice and pay more—a much forgotten piece of the policy debate at the moment.
There is much debate about rates and transitional arrangements. It is still the case, even by the Prime Minister’s own claims, that anything above the long-term government bond rate of around six per cent is deemed a superprofit. The fact of the matter is that the long-term bond rate is seen as a riskless investment by investors. It is AAA rated and a six per cent return is clearly insufficient. Investors I have spoken to in the United States and the United Kingdom about international benchmarks declare that in the US they are looking for a 15 per cent after-tax return on investments and outside the US it is about 20 per cent in returns.
Even the appearance of Australia Post before Senate estimates today was quite telling. My colleague Senator Cormann asked, ‘Does that put Australia Post in the category of earning superprofits?’ Australia Post replied, ‘I wouldn’t have thought so, Senator.’ Senator Cormann then asked, ‘So you don’t think a return on capital of 12.2 per cent is a superprofit?’ Australia Post responded, ‘I wouldn’t have thought so, Senator.’ Senator Cormann asked, ‘Why not?’ The reply was, ‘I think it is a reasonable return on equity.’ So it is okay for Australia Post to have a return on equity of 12 per cent, but for anyone involved in mining where of course there are significant risks, which I will allude to a little later, that is deemed to be a superprofit.
The government claims that increasing the total tax take from an industry will lift investment and growth. It seems difficult to believe that lifting the tax take will lift economic activity. If that were the case, it would seem to be a simple policy decision to increase Australia’s economic growth through the simple expedient of raising taxes. There would be few commentators, if any, who would agree with that proposition. Indeed, I refer to BHP Billiton’s notice to the Australian Stock Exchange that in the year to 30 June 2009 their effective tax rate, including company tax royalties and production taxes, was 43 per cent. The average between 2004 and 2009 was 42 per cent. The government would have us believe that it is somewhere between 13 and 17 per cent. CEOs of small, medium and large sized companies have an obligation under section 181 of the Corporations Act to act in good faith—to tell the truth, effectively—and their statements to the Stock Exchange, from the larger ones at Fortescue right through to the smaller players, are all warning of the real impact of the government’s tax on declared projects. We can also look at the experiences of other countries which have suffered loss of investment and growth in the face of regulatory uncertainty.
This would all appear to indicate that an increase in taxation will be negative for the mining industry. The government’s own rhetoric seems to contradict its claims that an increase in taxation is to the benefit of business. The Treasurer notes that the cuts to company income taxes:
… promote growth across the entire economy, giving some of our other industries a better chance to compete on the world stage.
The coalition would not disagree with that. However, reducing taxes leaves more money in the hands of business for them to invest and create jobs. Reducing taxes lowers the dead hand of government on business. It seems inconsistent for the government to claim that increasing the tax take from the mining industry will lift investment and growth at the same time they claim that they have got to lower company taxes to stimulate investment and growth.
The Treasurer says that in the last week he has travelled across Australia discussing the government’s changes to taxation. I have also travelled across Australia over the past week discussing the proposed new super mining tax and I have received a very negative reaction to the tax. This was not just from the mining companies but also from the industries which service this sector such as manufacturing and services, from the workers who are employed in mines and associated activities such as transport, and from local government and state government officials. They were all very concerned about the impact of this tax on investments and jobs. I noted the Premier of Western Australia being repeatedly and outrageously verballed by the Prime Minister during question time today in that regard.
All of these business people, from small business to large business, are very concerned about the impact of this tax. They do not accept that this great big new tax will be good for their businesses or for their employment. The new tax will apply to all mining activities. It is not just the big companies which mine minerals in strong demand from offshore, such as coal and iron ore; it will also apply to gravel, sand, clay for bricks and rock for aggregate—the base materials which feed directly into Australian industry. Increasing the taxes on companies involved in other areas will reduce their profits. This will either cause them to absorb it or increase their prices—a simple equation. The increased prices will feed into the costs of building homes and factories. They will impact on every Australian. Unquestionably, it will lift the price of building homes, factories and infrastructure.
The government claims the mining industry does not pay its fair share of taxes. Data provided by the mining industry and based on ATO data shows that the mining industry’s average corporate tax rate on income was 27.8 per cent. Including royalties, that was lifted to an effective tax rate of 41.3 per cent, the highest of all industry sectors. This compared with an average across all industry sectors of 27.18 per cent. I note that the finance and insurance services sector—basically the banks—paid 21.5 per cent. Therefore, if this is a tax that other industries think will only apply to mining under Labor, they should think again.
The Treasurer claims the intention of the changes to the tax system is ‘to build a broader, stronger economy’. We certainly support that objective. During our last term in government, the coalition doubled the size of the economy. We did that through real tax reform, with the introduction of a broad based consumption tax and the elimination of a raft of inefficient state taxes. Reducing the number of taxes is real reform. Labor is not reducing the number of taxes; it is increasing the number of taxes. The coalition also boosted economic growth by keeping taxes low, by running surpluses, by repaying Labor’s debt, by reducing the regulatory drag on business and by reform of the financial system. Most importantly, we maintained an environment which encouraged foreign investment in Australia.
Since the announcement of Labor’s resource tax, there has been considerable disquiet expressed from commentators offshore. Moody’s Investors Service said on 17 May that the government changes to the taxation of the mining industry ‘could reduce earnings for firms by nearly a third after it takes effect in mid 2010’. They went on to say:
Australia’s mineral resources will stay put, but global producers such as BHP, with half its assets in Australia, and Xstrata, with a third, can decide whether to extract the minerals or shift some operations to lower-cost countries to avoid the higher tax regime.
The government has cast this tax as a justified way of recouping income from foreign shareholders who are in some way—outrageously, according to our Prime Minister—taking something that belongs to Australians. On 4 May, the Prime Minister was quoted as saying:
These massively increased profits … built on Australian resources are mostly in fact going overseas.
That is what the Prime Minister, who is meant to be encouraging investment, said.
The Treasurer continued this assault on the miners with his comments today that mining executives were either ‘lying’ or ‘ignorant’. I do not think this is the right way to treat someone from whom we want investment or dollars. The greatest bone the government is throwing to people it wants to invest in Australia is, ‘If you lose $100, we will give you $40 back.’ Anyone who has been on a roadshow, as I have, knows that, when you ask someone for $100, you want to give them more than $100 back. It is in fact no incentive at all to give someone the line: ‘Good news, guys! If you lose your money, you’ll get 40 per cent of it back.’ That is not a sell job. That is not something you can say to international investors, nor to Australian investors for that matter.
What the government forgets is that Australia is critically dependent on foreign capital. Australia has never had sufficient savings to finance the investment we need to build the country, to build business. Australia is currently importing $17 billion of capital every quarter from overseas investors. It is critically important that Australia do everything it can to preserve faith in Australia as a safe and dependable place to invest and do business.
We the coalition believe that you do not win a game by hampering your best-performing player. The mining sector is hugely important to our prosperity. It is an industry where Australia has an international comparative advantage. Mining accounts for nearly two-thirds of the value of Australia’s exports of goods and half of Australia’s total exports of goods and services. Mining directly employs 172,000 Australians. Most of these are in regional areas. In 2008-09, mining accounted for fully one-third of all business investment. The crucial importance of this for the Australian economy overall has been recognised by the RBA. In its May statement, it said:
… mining investment has been at record levels as a share of GDP and further increases are expected, with very large projects in the LNG, iron ore and coal sectors. This pick-up in investment will support growth in the Australian economy at a time when the boost from the earlier expansionary policy settings is diminishing.
Beyond these direct advantages of mining, there are huge economic benefits for associated industries such as manufacturing and various mining services. This new tax does not just hurt overseas shareholders—it hurts Australians. If you use a conservative industry price-earnings ratio of 10 to one, taking $9 billion a year from the industry’s earnings will reduce the net worth of companies which comprise the industry by around 10 times that number or $90 billion. This reduces the value of shares held by Australians.
The new tax regime also carries significant fiscal risk. The revenue gained from the resources industry will vary according to the cycles in demand and prices for commodities. The industry is currently riding a period of strong demand and high prices, but it is not always so. It was only 10 years ago, at the beginning of the 2000s the Treasurer referred to, that demand was weak and prices were low. The government has tied this new tax to a regime of spending which will inevitably rise over time. This is the point I made at the Press Club. This mismatch between ever-rising spending and cycles in resource revenue is building a structural imbalance into the budget. This is not responsible nor sensible fiscal management. In this respect, I note that the Treasurer said in his address today that he:
… wants to take the Australian people’s share of mining profits back to around where it was in the early 2000s.
That was a time when the mining industry was in the depths of one of its regular cyclical lows and there were plenty of mining engineers and geologists driving cabs around Perth. The industry has advised that this was a time when it was barely recovering the costs of its investment capital. This period is hardly a rational benchmark for determining an appropriate share of profits. We do not agree that entrenching that state of affairs would be good for the resources industry or for the nation.
There is another aspect to this new tax regime which increases the risk to Australian taxpayers—the proposal for the government to share in the losses as well as the profits from resource operations. The reason why we are reluctant at this stage to get into a debate about modelling is that the government keeps talking up transitional arrangements, which adds to the uncertainty for investors and leaves everyone wondering whether the government truly knows what it is doing. The best illustration of that is its commitment to pay for 40 per cent of the losses. The government will refund accumulated RSPT losses at the 40 per cent RSPT rate when projects are closed.
In the 2008-09 financial year, one major company closed an unsuccessful project with a write-off of US$3.6 billion. Under the Treasurer’s plan, this would have rendered the Australian taxpayers liable for up to US$1.6 billion of that loss. Note that in the parliament the week before last I asked the Treasurer exactly how much money is budgeted for to allow the government to write out cheques to those businesses that fail. The Treasurer refused to answer the question. The fundamental question is: is this Treasurer being honest with the Australian people? We know he is not, because a motion was passed by the Senate:
That there be laid on the table by the Minister representing the Treasurer, no later than noon on Thursday, 13 May 2010, all modelling, costings, consultancy statements and other relevant documents used by the Government to inform its response to the ‘Henry Review’ (Australia’s Future Tax System report).
The government has not done that. So the government is happy to provide us with a model without any inputs. It is happy to claim that it has modelled our taxes, but it will not release any modelling of what it wants to do to the Australian people. This illustrates that the government has failed to think through this scheme. The government has failed to think through the impact of this new tax on Australian jobs or on foreign investment. It is one thing to talk about economic modelling, which might appeal to all the tax boffins, but the fundamental issue is whether people have confidence to invest in the mining sector in Australia as a result of this government’s tax. Emphatically, the people who actually run the companies, the people who employ people, are saying ‘Not with this tax’ and the coalition joins them in that charge.",REPS,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Economy</title>,Ministerial Statements,15,1,speech
"Rishworth, Amanda, MP",ALP,2010-05-24,"—Before question time, in the debate on the appropriation bills, I was talking about the importance of the GP superclinics and, in particular, the positive impacts that similar clinics—the GP Plus Health Care Centres—have had in South Australia. That impact has seen, as I mentioned before, a decrease of presentations to A&E by 13 per cent from the postcodes in which the GP Plus Health Care Centres are operating. This is a particularly important initiative and I know that people in my electorate are very much looking forward to the opening of the Noarlunga GP superclinic, which is being built as we speak. However, it is not surprising to see, when we look at the opposition’s response to the budget, money once again being ripped out of the health area. The Rudd government is committed to health. That is why we have a national health and hospitals plan and why we are committed to delivering good quality health care to people around the country.
The Rudd government is also committed to the provision of quality childcare services. It is an important and very rewarding investment for the future. I regularly visit a lot of childcare centres throughout my electorate of Kingston. It is evident that childcare centres, parents and staff all want to ensure that children are receiving the best quality care in their important formative years. The budget provides over $273 million over four years to raise the quality of early childhood education and care across Australia. This funding will mean that parents within my electorate can be assured that their child will be receiving quality care by trained staff. Where needed, centres will receive capital upgrades to help services to meet the national quality standards. Families within southern Adelaide who have access to the Hackham West community JET creche can expect additional federal support for the provision of their much needed services. This is a key message of the government that families can rely on getting quality services through improved amounts of federal funding.
Access to justice is also a right of all Australians. In a further display of the government’s commitment to the people in my electorate and right around Australia, the government is to invest an additional $145 million over four years in legal assistance programs. An amount of $83,700 is to be provided to the southern Community Legal Centre for the Family Relationship Centre pilot to ensure they continue to deliver legal advice and assistance for separating families. This is a particularly important provision for any family going through a time of separation. It is extremely hard and very distressing and it is imperative that these people continue to receive quality legal assistance.
The government acknowledges the importance of providing a dignified and secure retirement income. As part of the budget commitment, from 1 July 2013, the superannuation guarantee will be increased from nine per cent to 12 per cent. This is an extremely important step that will significantly improve the retirement income and, indeed, the quality of life for many people when they retire. Even someone who is now 50 years of age will be approximately $22,000 better off at retirement, indicating just how important this measure is. Compulsory superannuation has been one of the great legacies of previous Labor governments. I am very proud that the Rudd Labor government is building on the previous legacy to ensure that when people do reach retirement they can establish, through superannuation, a better quality of life for their future.
Further to these improvements in superannuation, the government has also offered generous tax breaks to older Australians who have low super balances to help them boost their superannuation savings. Workers over 50 years of age with a total superannuation below $500,000 will be able to make concessional superannuation contributions up to $50,000. An additional $500 will be provided to workers on incomes up to $37,000 effectively refunding the tax that they already had to pay on super. This will have a positive impact on countless moderate income earners right around Australia and also in my electorate in the southern suburbs of Adelaide. The Rudd government remains committed to ensuring that all Australians are able to enjoy a secure retirement.
Right around the country the Rudd government has provided pensioners with greater flexibility in how they receive their payments. As part of the budget, from 1 July 2010, pensioners will be able to choose to receive their pension supplement quarterly rather than fortnightly. This provides pensioners with greater flexibility and choice in how they receive their payments. It also builds on, I think, the significant contributions that this government made in the last budget, the substantial reforms to pensions where, since coming to office, the age pension has been increased by more than $100 a fortnight for singles. This equals a real change in the quality of life for pensioners in my electorate of Kingston.
Australia does need more electricians, carpenters, chefs and welders—just to name a few. We need more apprenticeship training. That is one of the matters that comes up regularly as I visit communities. Young people tell me that they want to upskill themselves and to make sure that they are preparing themselves and getting the best opportunity to enter the workforce in skilled employment. One of the particular things that has been widely welcomed in my electorate was the Apprentice Kickstart program initiative announced as one of the responses in the global financial crisis to try and ensure that companies, despite having difficulty during the global recession, still continue to take on new apprentices. That is why the Rudd government is investing almost $80 million to extend the very successful Kickstart initiative. As mentioned this initiative has already boosted the traditional apprentice numbers above the pre-global recession numbers in just one year.
There were 24,400 young Australians who began an apprenticeship in the traditional trades last summer. I think this is a particularly important initiative. I note that in my electorate in southern Adelaide the Kickstart program has helped 92 local apprentices to get a start in their chosen field, and that is really important. I was speaking to one of the local building companies in my electorate that is undertaking a number of constructions with the Building the Education Revolution. They told me is that, because of the work that the Building the Education Revolution has provided, they too have been able to take on apprentices in the traditional trades to upskill them. The government is really committed to this measure and upskilling our nation was a particular focus in the budget. We invested over $660 million in the budget to ensure that our training system is responsive to the skills needed in our economy.
This is in stark contrast to the opposition, who have shown a complete disinterest in how we might tackle the skills shortage. It is very disappointing not just to me but to many in my local community that the opposition have announced that they will scrap the trades training centres in schools. This is really threatening an opportunity for young people in my electorate in the southern suburbs of Adelaide and right across the country to gain the skills they need for the future. I know how really important it is because I have heard firsthand from young people about how they want to take a different vocational path—maybe not year 12 and then to university to get a degree. They want to study a trade and get skills but they also want to finish year 12. Scrapping the trades training centres in schools threatens the opportunity for young people to continue on with their year 12 and also perhaps to get a certificate.
The coalition’s announcement has threatened trade centres that have been planned in my electorate: Willunga high, Hallett Cove R to 12 school, Reynella East high, Wirreanda high and Seaford. They all enthusiastically took up the program of trades training centres in schools because they want to deliver good training. It has been needed in our community. Young people want it. It is very disappointing that the coalition have indicated that they will axe this program and perhaps put at risk those trades training centres in the suburbs I have mentioned.
Turning now to the budget measures for small business. We all know that small business is the engine room of the Australian economy. Over 9,000 small businesses in my electorate will benefit significantly from the budget. The budget will provide for every one of those over 9,000 small businesses to instantly deduct the costs of assets valued at up to $5,000—an increase from the current $1,000 limit. These are real savings for small business owners and will make a big difference.
The other thing I have said many times in this place before is just how important the National Broadband Network is going to be for small businesses in my electorate. Despite the rhetoric we hear from the opposition, small businesses in my electorate have nominated lack of access to broadband as their No. 1 impediment to growing business and taking advantage of economic growth around the world. The plan to scrap the NBN as proposed by the opposition is of serious concern to many small businesses in my electorate. This is their No. 1 issue. I urge the opposition to rethink their proposal to scrap the National Broadband Network. It is critical to improving productivity for small businesses in my electorate. As I said, it has been nominated as the No. 1 issue for small business in the southern suburbs of Adelaide.
I would like to finish by saying that this budget the Rudd Labor government have put forward is a very economically responsible budget. It is one that really delivers on some of the successes we have had following the global financial crisis and will ensure that we continue to have a strong and prosperous future. (Time expired)
",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2010-2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Ley, Sussan, MP",LP,2010-05-24,"—The government has just handed down its third budget. I remind the House that since coming to power, and under cover of the global financial crisis, the government has taken us from $22 billion in surplus to a deficit this year, 2009-10, of $57.1 billion. In the process, it has spent 60 per cent of the capital in three savings funds that were created by the previous government for national investment: the building fund, the health fund and the education fund.
I was in the coalition government party room when then Treasurer Peter Costello announced that these funds would not be spent, that they would be used for investment and that the interest from these funds would be available as and when required. It is devastating to imagine that 60 per cent has already been spent. Next year the deficit is tipped to be $40.8 billion and the budget is expected to return to surplus in 2012-13. We do not believe that it will.
The opposition’s response to the budget finds two overarching problems. The first is that the two arms of policy, fiscal and monetary, are moving in opposite directions. Lazy and unrestrained fiscal policy means that monetary policy alone is controlling the economy. This budget reveals that stimulus spending will continue until 2014, four years after the end of the global financial crisis. That is what I mean by lazy fiscal policy. But, meanwhile, on monetary policy, there have been six interest rate rises in a row. That is the first problem with this budget and this government’s economic management.
The second problem is its resource superprofits tax, which we find so abhorrent that we have centred our budget response around our determination to do all we can to make sure that this tax does not see the light of day. The government has described Australia as simultaneously suffering from the fallout of the global financial crisis—why else would we be continuing to spend the stimulus dollars, 40 per cent of which remained unspent only three months ago?—and being in the midst of a resources boom courtesy of our most globally competitive industry, mining. It is a boom that is apparently so problematic that it requires a superprofits tax to bring it back to earth.
What is the government’s response to this apparent inconsistency? They have talked about our two-speed economy due to the demand from China for our mineral resources from Western Australia, Queensland and offshore. I have actually never accepted this two-speed economy argument. I was pleased to see a paper by Deloitte released last week titled Clouds in the silver lining? The two speed economy and Dutch disease, which provides the analysis to debunk this argument. It is recommended reading and it states:
Australia does not have a ‘two-speed economy’; it has thousands of industries operating at different speeds, with price and resource adjustments taking place constantly.
If states like New South Wales where the drivers of economic growth are the commercial property market and South Australia where the drivers of growth are public infrastructure projects and defence shipbuilding are falling behind, why is it the fault of states like Western Australia and Queensland where industries are booming? It is just not that simple.
Take my electorate in the Murray Valley of New South Wales, where a town called Deniliquin is struggling with low water allocations, a savage drought and a declining in many of the activities which have made that town strong. In Deniliquin there is a small airline which is chartered regularly to Roxby Downs in South Australia, taking individuals who work in mining. The effect on Deniliquin is quite substantial. It is reasonable to say that the income from that fly-in fly-out charter is keeping some parts of the town of Deniliquin stronger than they otherwise would be. That is an example of why this is just not a straightforward exercise about an economy in one state performing in one way and an economy in another state performing in another.
The government is running some crazy lines. They go like this: ‘Resources are more of a curse than a blessing; manufacturing and the services industries are falling behind; it’s not the fault of debt-laden state governments who have failed to re-invest in their infrastructure; it must be the fault of the mining industry. How dare it pull so far ahead of the rest of us!’
Mr Swan was in Adelaide last week talking about—in the new jargon—‘mining boom mark II’ and remarked that, ‘The revenues from the resources superprofits tax will be invested in growing the economy—ensuring Australians benefit from the exploitation of non-renewable resources long into the future.’ As an aside it appears we are being re-educated to replace the term ‘mining’ with ‘exploitation of non-renewable resources’. The real problem I have with this statement is that it is the private sector, not governments, who should be making decisions about investment. For Mr Swan to talk about investments from the resources superprofits tax somehow growing the economy better than the private sector would is just plain ridiculous.
I also note the Treasurer said that, ‘A high degree of flexibility within the workforce here in SA has helped avoid massive lay-offs and skills destruction.’ I remind the Treasurer that there is one year to go before Julia Gillard’s new workplace laws come fully into operation. I wonder if the same flexibility, which the Treasurer was remarking on and praising in Adelaide, will exist then?
In the context of the resources boom, the Treasurer and other government ministers like to mention Dutch disease and raise the spectre of us having fallen victim to it. The Dutch disease theory is this: an increase in revenues from natural resources will de-industrialise a nation’s economy by raising the exchange rate, which makes the manufacturing sector less competitive. It gets its name from the decline in the manufacturing sector in the Netherlands after the discovery of a large natural gas field. In fact it is difficult to prove the relationship between an increase in natural resource revenues, the real exchange rate and a decline in another sector of the economy that is lagging—that is right; it is very difficult to prove. There are a number of different things that could be causing the appreciation of the exchange rate. There are so many factors at play and every economy is different.
So in the Netherlands, which gave Dutch disease its name, economists have since argued that the decline in the Dutch manufacturing industry sector was actually caused by unsustainable spending on social services. Nigeria is also often quoted as a victim of Dutch disease. In fact the abundance of natural resources in that country gave rise to governments that were less accountable to the people, had little incentive for institution building and failed to implement growth-enhancing reforms, and so higher corruption, more rent-seeking activity and greater civil conflict resulted.
As economists have studied Dutch disease, they have found that to the extent it really exists at all, the manufacturing sectors with the highest capital intensity are less affected by windfall shocks and a diverse manufacturing sector is the key to being cushioned from resource shocks. We do have a high level of capital investment, the policy responses about a diverse manufacturing sector are there and this government has no right not to be acting on them.
The present government used to lecture us about house prices going up and how that showed we were mismanaging the economy. I used to think it’s not a bad problem to have if you own the house. It’s a lot better than the house price going down. The mining boom is a good problem to have, but every boom is followed by a bust. Our previous 150 years of history tell us exactly this. I cannot believe that our Prime Minister really thinks China will sustain a never-ending commodity boom—and he has, in fact, pocketed the proceeds already.
You cannot escape the fact that to levy a tax at 40 per cent and then make miners pay 28 per cent is a double tax whammy which singles this industry out for punishment like no other. The effective tax rate post supertax would be 58 per cent and if companies had a heavier level of debt, for which there is no compensation as the tax is currently designed, their effective tax rate could be as high as 70 per cent. I am taking into account the credits along the way and the fact that the supertax would be a deduction for company tax. Our tax system contains many complicated mechanisms to avoid the same income being taxed twice—dividend imputation, credits for withholding tax, separation of superannuation balances and so on. What really offends me about the resource superprofits tax is the double taxation aspect.
The government claims that the tax will result in a 4.5 per cent increase in investment, a seven per cent increase in employment and a 5.5 per cent increase in output from the sector in the long term. They will not show us the modelling but we know it was based on the assumption that resources are location specific and therefore investment will continue to flow. This is illogical, as we all know that capital transfers freely around the globe. There are no shortages of resources around the world and capital can just as easily leave our shores. So much of the government’s answers to our questions on this new mining tax centre around economic modelling. When has a Treasury model ever realistically demonstrated what will happen in the real world? It gives indications, it gives input and it gives suggestions, but for a government to rely on an economic computer based model to determine a policy as wide-ranging as this is an insult. I can recall when the Murray-Darling Basin Commission developed a model for environmental flows in the River Murray. It was sung from the rooftops by environmentalists at the time as demonstrating that, ‘We have to return flows to the Murray. It is absolutely essential.’ From there the Living Murray Initiative kicked off and unfortunately for those who believe, as I do, that too much water is being allocated to the environment, there have been devastating effects on communities.
I raise that, important though it is to my electorate, to mention that the model upon which the original analysis was based was inexact, because there was not enough scientific data about what happened with water flows, stream health and catchment health. There were 23 indicators of catchment health. They were not all built into the model. They built an assumption into the model that the river health would improve if you added more water, so of course there are no prizes for guessing what the model then predicted. If this model in Treasury is so good then the government should release the modelling. If they are basing their policy upon it too, if it is the rationale, then they should release the modelling.
Madam Deputy Speaker Moylan, I do not have it with me, but I could show you a table—and I will ask listeners to imagine this table—showing the top 15 countries in the world ranked by the volume of their reserves. Australia is one of the 15. Russia has more reserves of iron ore than we do, Guinea has more bauxite, Chile has more copper, China has more zinc, South Africa has more gold and Canada has more potash. We have the most nickel. Another table that I could show you would show the top 20 richest nations ranked by the value of their resources. South Africa and Russia are first and second, respectively. Australia is third. Then there are Canada, Brazil, China, Chile, USA, Ukraine and Peru, followed by 10 more. So as you can see, most metals have a very good geographic spread. If capital is taxed too heavily in Australia, it will move elsewhere.
I was insulted by the government’s dismissal of mining companies as repatriating profits overseas. They are an easy target, according to the government, because they are not really Australian. I was insulted. It is true that investment in Australian mining has more than doubled in the past decade. Approximately $150 billion of offshore funds have been invested to help extract Australian natural resources, much more than our own government has invested over this period. We do of course have a simple choice: either we use the savings of Australians or we use the savings of foreigners, and the savings of Australians are not there to the extent required for this investment.
The town of Broken Hill in the west of my electorate has a fly-in fly-out operation to Olympic Dam. We have heard reports that that project is on hold. The investment required there alone would be $20 billion. Clearly, we need investment from overseas in order to realise these projects. That is a good thing and not something that our Prime Minister should be whispering about behind his hand as something that we should be ashamed of. The Prime Minister should not be suggesting that our mining industry is tainted by its overseas ownership. That is outrageous.
At the very moment that he was doing this, my opposite number, Assistant Treasurer Nick Sherry, was in the Middle East selling Australia as a global financial hub for Islamic finance products! He has been spruiking changes to the managed investment trust regime in Australia to make Australia a more attractive destination for offshore funds, because of the stability of our financial services industry. I agree with all of that, but isn’t it a little bit hypocritical of the Prime Minister, at the same time, to be rubbishing those who would seek to put overseas dollars in investments in Australia?
It is generally estimated that over 75 per cent of all cash generated by mining companies is invested back ‘in country’. Shareholders have received 25 per cent of the company’s cash through dividends. So 75 per cent is reinvested back into projects or other projects, and 25 per cent is in dividends. That is what should be regarded as a fair share.
According to Philip Lowe, Assistant Governor of the Reserve Bank in Australia, the main task is to expand the supply side of the economy so that demand can grow solidly without causing inflation to rise. It is a much better problem to have than the other way around. The key to improving the supply side of the economy is investment and productivity growth. We have become a high-investment country in recent times because of the resources sector, which has quickened the increase in our capital stock. Investment in Australia is high because of high returns on capital, particularly in the resources sector.
This is not going to continue if Mr Rudd’s super tax gets up. Mr Rudd believes that revenue from the resources boom is needed to invest in the nation’s long-term human capital. With respect, this is a meaningless statement. As economists know, capital is the material means of production, and labour is labour. What raises living standards is sustained economic growth, a rise in the ratio of capital to labour. When that ratio improves, the value of labour’s marginal product and therefore wage rates increase. That creates the prosperity that the government says it wants to secure and that we say is under threat from the resources tax. Remember, a dollar of tax is a dollar not invested.
The real problem that we should all have with the proposed mining tax is the way that the issue has been handled. The mining companies put their submissions into the Henry review process and were not consulted further. The government allowed some strategic leaks so that everyone sort of knew it was coming. The announcement on 3 May followed, but not the detail. A consultation panel has been formed so that affected mining companies can tell the government and Treasury officials how to make their tax actually work.
You can imagine the opening line of the consultation process going like this, ‘We want to tax you so that we get $9 billion a year. We want the rate to be 40 per cent and everything above a six per cent cost of capital to be called a super profit. You tell us how to do it.’ I am not surprised at the response from the mining companies. And it was all so unnecessary. All Treasury officials and government ministers had to do was to pick up the phone during the period of the Henry review process and talk. But, because the Henry review was so politicised, it took two years. It arrived with the government at Christmas time last year and was sat on for four months—so that we now have the problem that we do. Just think of what would have happened had the review being released at Christmas. People could have talked about it. Mining companies could have stepped forward and said, ‘Before the budget, when you make these announcements, we have got some ideas for you.’ But no—the Prime Minister, so intent on micromanaging every stage of the process, had to be just a little bit too cute, and the problems that he now faces are entirely of his own making.
Meanwhile, a multibillion dollar industry is supposed to enter a holding pattern and wait and see. From opposition there is one certainty we can offer the resources sector: we will vote against the tax in opposition and we will rescind it in government. I do not accept that the government believes its own lines on the resources tax. It is imposing the tax because it needs the cash.
In the budget announcement, Wayne Swan referred to the lowering of personal income tax rates on 1 July. These were the tax reductions they voted against while in opposition and finally, through gritted teeth, agreed to just before the last election. The Treasurer is now spruiking these tax cuts as contributing to 85,000 more jobs. I do not necessarily disagree, but remember the Treasurer’s statement that the resources tax will contribute to a seven per cent increase in employment. So the question is: if a tax cut is good for the economy, why is a tax increase such as the resources tax just as good for the economy?
As policymakers what we should be doing is reducing the infrastructure bottlenecks to encourage more investment in our mining sector. The government’s response? A new infrastructure fund, initially paying $700 million to the states. This is not a savings fund; this is a slush fund. I have covered the opposition’s two main issues with the government’s budget. We urge them to rethink the mining tax. The shadow Treasurer has proposed $46.7 billion in opposition cuts in response. (Time expired)
",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2010-2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2010-05-24,"—I join with many members on this side of the House in fully supporting Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011 and cognate bills. It would be remiss of me if I did not start my contribution to the debate on the legislation by saying that it is a responsible effort by the government to bring the economy back into surplus as quickly as possible. I know that in their scaremongering some time back those opposite were declaring that it was likely that the economy would be in deficit for a decade or more. But one of the responsible aspects of this particular budget is that we have designed it to bring the economy back into surplus in three years. I know there are others around who want to dispute that. The shadow minister at the table, Mr Robb, is already on record expressing a number of views about that. But I urge them to go to the document itself and see what plans and proposals are there, see what the government are doing to bring the economy back into surplus. I think it is evident to all those out there listening to this debate that we should put aside the scaremongering that is taking place here, put aside the politicking that is taking place here. Those who are serious about building the community will see that this is a responsible budget.
I must stress that bringing the economy back into surplus in three years time is in excess of three years earlier than what was planned 12 months ago. Clearly, a number of things have happened over that period of time. Do not forget that our last couple of budgets were framed around a situation where we were planning our way through the worst economic crisis that had confronted the world in 75 years. That fact seems to have disappeared from this debate altogether. It certainly will not be raised on that side of the chamber. They will not raise the fact that Australia was one of the only OECD economies that did not go into recession.
The opposition finance spokesman is sitting at the table. The member for Goldstein criticised the government widely in his contribution to this debate. But, when he got down to talking about the world’s worst recession in 75 years, he categorised that as being simply one quarter of negative growth. I think they were his words. In his view, the stimulus package was all about addressing one quarter of negative growth. I do not think there would be a person out there—and certainly no-one at school who has read the papers a little—who does not understand that this was a very serious world economic crisis. It required attention. We are not going to point the finger at those opposite and say that we inherited office from a government that caused that crisis, because we know that is not true. But the thing is that we did not predict it either. We did not predict that there would be a crisis. We had to work towards addressing the situation, to overcome our position and to ensure that Australia’s economy stayed in strong hands.
It was only last week that the Secretary-General of the OECD commented on this. It did not take me by surprise that one of the things that he had to say was that Australia’s response to the global economic crisis was an exemplar to many of the mainstream economies. The fact that we went out and specifically targeted our stimulus package was something that was praised by the leaders of the OECD. That is what kept our economy from going into a recession—not one quarter of negative growth, as it is being portrayed now.
It was not all that far back that we were all shocked—and clearly the Americans were shocked—when Lehman Brothers became insolvent. The American government did not propose bailing that bank out. It was just going to be treated as a commercial reaction to the market. However, when that situation became more commonplace, the Bush administration found itself moving in to prop up America’s banks. In the land of the free they were moving in to nationalise some of their banks to make sure that they kept them afloat. Look at the world’s largest bank, the Bank of Scotland. It almost got renationalised. The British government, the British taxpayer, bought into 80 per cent of its shareholdings to keep that bank afloat.
We are not talking here about one period of negative growth, a blip on the horizon when everything was hunky-dory. This was a very significant period in Australia’s economic history, one that had not occurred in some 75 years and one that required an immediate and targeted response. For what it is worth, I was proud to be part of a government that took up the challenge to do that, to make that response, even when those opposite tried to vote down at each and every opportunity our proposals to spend stimulus money. Whether it was education, infrastructure development or community infrastructure projects, they were all opposed by those opposite.
We went on to guarantee bank deposits to keep our banks afloat. This did require a concerted effort, but it was left to one side of this place to put that effort in, to do the heavier lifting. We now reap from that the criticism of those opposite because there was a debt. Of course there was a debt. But, as opposed to what was being said 12 months ago, that there would be debt for the next generation, we are now paying that debt in three years.
Without apology, this is not a pre-election spendathon. This is not the traditional election budget we had over the 12 years of the Howard government, where people were hooked on middle-income welfare—where people with household income of over $1 million still had welfare payments going to those households. This is not one of those budgets. This is in stark contrast to what we saw during those 12 years. This is moving to do something with this economy by returning it to surplus and then allowing market forces to be stimulated as a consequence.
As an aside, Madam Deputy Speaker, last week I heard a comment that a former opposition finance spokesman, Barnaby Joyce, made on ABC radio. We are pretty thick skinned on this side of the place, we are used to a bit of criticism, but Senator Joyce wanted to criticise the government for not introducing the promised dental scheme.
—Ha!
—My colleague the member for Wakefield laughs. But the laugh is this: that bill has been held up in the Senate and been opposed by Senator Joyce, and now he goes on radio and say it is a disgrace that the scheme has not been introduced. There is one way he can help that to be introduced, and that is to change his vote. This is the hypocrisy we have got to learn to live with, I guess.
We hear the Liberal Party talk tough about cutting government spending by blocking and opposing measures, but look at what they have been doing. What they want to achieve would only make the deficit worse. Last week the shadow treasurer during his speech to the Press Club indicated that the opposition wanted to cut basic services to Australians, basic services that Australians actually rely on. They plan to cut funding for education and health. Why should we be surprised about that? The current Leader of the Opposition was health minister and he knows full well that he and his government took a billion dollars out of health. I know a lot has been said about it, but the facts remain. Look at the bottom line: a billion dollars came out of health. And that is not to wallpaper over the money that was taken out of education, particularly vocational education. All those things that have contributed to our skills and trades deficit over the time of the Howard government can be traced back to when they decided to rip money out of the education budget.
I know a lot of crocodile tears are being shed at the moment for the mining companies, but it was not all that long ago that the mining companies were lobbying here because they wanted those skills. One of my boys was working in the mining industry for some time. They get paid quite well, I grant you that. That is probably why you could not get a power point put on in Sydney or Launceston or in the member for Wakefield’s area in South Australia. The young fellows were out there working in the mining sector because, going back a number of years, it was booming then. But there are ebbs and flows in the mining industry, and, like many others, my son got laid off and he is doing other things now. Now the boom is moving back into gear and we are seeing a two-speed economy developing. We do need to address that. We also need to look out for the interests of other businesses, particularly businesses that rely on the same basic skill sets that are used in the mining industry, particularly those mainstream trade areas which are in demand in the mining community but also in demand in a community that is still trying to recover from the worst economic crisis in living memory.
Simply gutting education and health cannot be the way to go if we are clear about building a community for the future. I know the real differences being made so far in the south-west of Sydney. I see what we have been able to do there only through our funding of $16 billion in the BER. I do not know about the member for Wakefield but I have not had people knocking on my door in Werriwa and complaining about investing in their schools—not a one. I would challenge people opposite not to cower and oppose it when all your colleagues are around but to stand up when those photos are being taken at schools as we are opening these halls and new classrooms and commercial cooking facilities and say, ‘We actually really oppose it.’ I do not get much opportunity to talk to principals who say, ‘We don’t want this investment.’ As a matter of fact, I do not get any of that. That is one of the things that have been particularly successful. I know that out of 9,500 projects there will always be something that will require attention and, to her credit, the Deputy Prime Minister is looking at addressing those issues.
—$8 billion.
—But like the member for Goldstein I have not got people complaining to me about schools. They would like more investment in the schools and they would like to see a greater role for the Commonwealth, although there will be budget limits to that. What we are doing, apart from putting money out there that is generating jobs, is producing those skills for the future.
I do not want to have to do a roll call through the family but I also have a son—not the son working in the mines—who is a builder. For the last 12 months or so all he has been doing, in a succession of schools, is going out there and constructing school buildings. All the young fellows I know who come to our house and eat us out of house and home are also working on these packages. From the Hayes household, I know what the stimulus package is doing. It means that these young people are in work. They are utilising their skills. I see more apprentices out there. This was the intention of the stimulus package. It is not what the other side I know want to hear. They are nitpicking, going through whether the projects should have been six metres this side or that side of the fence or whether somebody’s sunlight has been blocked off. This was about generating jobs and generating jobs now to stimulate work in our community. All those employees getting work through these stimulus based projects are generating our local economies.
I would have thought that concept was something that we should be applauded for. I know it is a bit hard for those on the other side to applaud because they voted against it and every other measure of the stimulus package, but they are things that really do need to be looked at in the cold light of day and acknowledged for what they are, apart from an investment in education. Bear in mind that every dollar you put into education will over the next 10 to 12 years actually have an economic dividend in a productivity increase and will generate people through tertiary education or into the trades et cetera. What it does is generate employment for us here and now. I see it firsthand, as does everyone else, but those opposite are too afraid to admit it.
The other big thing that is clearly on the way back, if you listen to what is being said, is a return to Work Choices. Perhaps that is not the word that will be used, but we are now being lectured about there being room to have individual statutory employment contracts out there in the workplace. Mr Deputy Speaker, as you are aware, I was very involved in talking about ‘Your rights at work’ when we were in opposition because I genuinely believe in it. I represent a working community. I see the mums and dads out there struggling with their mortgages. Most households in my electorate are supported by two incomes. I know how important this issue was. I also had—and I tried to table on many occasions for Prime Minister Howard—work statements from people who were getting paid less than the award. For the first time in living memory, it became legally possible to employ people and to change their conditions to below the award. I—and no doubt many other people too—have had people turn up in my office, or I have seen them in the street when I have been doing mobile offices, who have become physically and emotionally upset. I saw the real effect of that.
I cannot point the finger just at those companies. When I spoke to the directors of one of the companies—it is on the record; I will not name the company again but it is a major pharmaceutical company—they checked through the law and they came out and said, ‘Yes, we are doing that.’ I asked them for the reason they were doing it. I said: ‘I can see your profit line and I can see all the other stuff. Why are you doing this to people in my local community?’ Regrettably, and with some degree of embarrassment, they said, ‘Because we can.’ The previous government made laws that allowed people to pay individuals below the award rate of pay. I saw the effect of that in electorates such as mine. Those in the previous government should hold their heads in shame. I understand why they would not want to go back to calling it Work Choices, but they must be reeling from the fact that their leader has now indicated that there is room for individual contracts in the workplace.
Despite all the joviality about Tony Abbott’s contribution to the 7.30 Report on Monday a week ago, if we have to get to the point where, unless it is scripted, unless you get it from me in writing, you cannot believe it, this is going to be an extremely low ebb in politics. We all know what the cut and thrust of politics is like. It is a very combative business that we are in. It is a hard business. We are out there to compete for the hearts and minds of people based on our ideals. We are trying to sell the ideals to people in this competitive world that we support one over the other. That is the basis of democracy. But, when we have the Leader of the Opposition coming out and saying, ‘You cannot necessarily trust everything I say unless you get it in writing,’ it really demeans our whole concept of Australian democracy. I know he probably was not put up to that, and it is probably a rare display of honesty, one which will not go away, but if a backbencher said that I am sure the whips would take them aside and explain to them the error of their ways. But, when the Leader of the Opposition says it, you wonder whether that is now going to become opposition policy.
One of the things I wanted to get across was community building. What we have tried to do throughout the course of our response to the world’s worst economic crisis is to continue to build our community. Build it now and build it into the future is what this budget continues to do. (Time expired)

"Hartsuyker, Luke, MP",NATS,2010-05-24,"—I rise to speak on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011 and cognate bills. I listened with interest to the words of the member for Werriwa when he talked about truth in this place. It is interesting to note that yesterday we had the Treasurer and the Deputy Prime Minister of this country trying to tell us that the corporate tax rate paid by Australian mining companies was 13 per cent. Where did the Treasurer get that figure from? One would think that a reasonable Treasurer would rely on the advice of the Australian Taxation Office as the appropriate thing to do. The Australian Taxation Office says that the rate of tax paid by resources companies is 41.34 per cent. So when we ask about truth and integrity, which the member for Werriwa has raised in this place, the question is: why did the Treasurer of this country falsely claim—a political fraud—that resources companies are only paying 13 per cent? Why did he do that? The member for Werriwa is silent, and he is now slinking out the side door and even giving me a wave. But how could any Treasurer of this country misrepresent such an important figure? For what reason would he do that? When the Australian Taxation Office is telling you that resources companies are paying 41.34 per cent, why would you say the tax rate is only 13? Was he having a bad hair day? What was the reason?
It was a gross misrepresentation made by an important public figure purely for the purposes of political spin. That is what this government is all about. That is what this Prime Minister is all about. That is what this Deputy Prime Minister is all about, because she also participated in this sport of misleading the Australian people, making the same false claims, going on with the same tripe. The people of Australia will judge them for that. You would never have seen Peter Costello get figures so drastically wrong as we saw our Treasurer and our Deputy Prime Minister do just yesterday. For what reason were they misleading the Australian people? Purely because the Hawker Britton book said: ‘We’ve got to have a diversion, we’ve got to have one of those weapons of mass distraction. We’ll create some figures. Where can we get them from? We can’t find them from the Taxation Office because those figures don’t support the claim, so what we’ll do is find a US student who produces figures that aren’t even for Australia, they’re for Australia and New Zealand, but that’ll do. There are some published numbers out there on the internet, we’ll bring them in and we’ll try and spin a yarn.’ Well, they have been caught out pretty badly using figures from a student, not from the Australian tax office, that were not even solely for Australia—and the members opposite try and talk about truth and honesty. What sort of ridiculous argument is that? Thirteen per cent? That’s not far out! I guess that is Swan-onomics.
—It’s a rounding error for Labor!
—Yes, Swan-onomics. Thirteen per cent is pretty close to 41.34 per cent—it’s not far out! They needed a distraction, they needed to bag the mining companies, so they just invented some numbers. What does that say about the credibility of the Treasurer? He keeps trying to justify it. I have to say that the Australian people will not wear that.
In the same vein, the Australian people should rightly be concerned about Wayne Swan’s budget. If he cannot quote figures accurately, if he cannot act with integrity, if he cannot properly reflect the taxation regime that applies to resources companies in this country, how can he be trusted with a $400 billion budget? He claims the most slender surplus in 2012-13 of $1 billion, but everything has got to go right for that to happen. We have to have low inflation at a time when we are having very strong growth and the most favourable terms of trade for 60 years, yet he is going to promise us a billion dollar surplus. Well, if he does not know the difference between 41.34 per cent and 13 per cent, if he cannot get that right, how can we trust him to get the budget right?
Seldom in recent years have there been issues in this debate that are so clear. In recent years there have been arguments about whether the government has struck the right balance between different policy areas: health, education, the environment, agriculture, infrastructure and social security. Every government has to make choices. The arguments have reflected differing priorities amongst members of this House and, of course, differing political opinions. The arguments have been about what we as politicians do to shape this country and our society. But this year it is very different. I would go as far as to say that there is only one issue related to this budget that is really the central focus, and that is economic credibility. We saw, just yesterday, the Treasurer of this country shred his credibility by trying to pull the wool over the eyes of the Australian people by quoting false figures in the media, as did the Deputy Prime Minister.
This is a Deputy Prime Minister who cannot manage the Building the Education Revolution, who has presided over a massive cost blow-out in that program and in the computers in schools program. Where on earth would you find, in commercial practice, jobs being let for 10 times the proper rate? The worst thing is that these problems have been highlighted since last year. The Deputy Prime Minister has been warned that the government is paying too much for projects, that the government is being ripped off by state bureaucracies and that there is gross profiteering occurring in the program. Does she spring into action to save the public purse? No. What does she do? She sits on her hands, in a state of denial, trying to mislead the Australian people that all is well. She started off by saying, ‘It’s only an isolated incident—this is not what is happening across the board.’ But we now know it is happening everywhere. It is happening in New South Wales and in Victoria; it is happening right around the country. Taxpayers are being ripped off, and this minister, the heir apparent to Kevin Rudd’s throne, is sitting on her hands waiting to glide into the position of Prime Minister, but she is not acting on this. She has appointed a task force. First she said, ‘There’s an audit going on, so I don’t have to worry.’ What was the result of that audit? It simply compared one grossly overpriced project with another. It was not comparing the price of a building delivered in the private sector with the price of a building delivered under the BER program; it was comparing one grossly overinflated BER project with another BER project. It was an audit that was actually planned to fail. It was an audit that was planned to conceal the waste and mismanagement that this minister knew, or ought to have known, was part and parcel of this program. It is an absolute outrage, just as the Deputy Prime Minister’s statement yesterday claiming that the rate of tax on resources companies was only 13 per cent is a blatant lie, a blatant untruth, which does nothing for her credibility as a potential future Prime Minister, I might say.
What is really important with this budget is what has not been included. A very important item has not been included in this budget—that is, an increase in expenditure on the Pacific Highway. We saw over the weekend yet another tragic accident on this road. Far too many of my constituents have been killed or injured as a result of the poor state of the Pacific Highway, yet in this budget we do not see one additional dollar for the most important infrastructure project in this country.
Freight levels are massively increasing and heavy vehicle traffic is massively increasing and yet we still have on the Pacific Highway B-doubles driving through the main streets of small towns and villages and B-doubles struggling to pass on very narrow bridges that were designed and built in the 1930s that are not up to modern traffic levels and are not up to the weights that are going across them. It will be only a matter of time before we have more serious accidents. Everybody knows that; the government knows that. Despite this fact, in this budget there was not one extra dollar for the Pacific Highway. Tragedies happen all too often.
On the weekend I attended the 50th anniversary of the Halfway Creek Rural Fire Service. It was a great celebration of the great work they do. They said that most of the work they do now is not to do with fires; tragically, the most common call-out they have is to attend traffic accidents, mainly on the Pacific Highway. It is a national tragedy that deaths are still occurring that could be avoided. More resources need to be put into the Pacific Highway.
Labor has form on poor budgeting. The Hawke-Keating government left us with $96 billion in debt. When the coalition came into power what did we find? We found a $10 billion budget black hole. The Labor government of that time was fudging the figures and concealing from the Australian people and the then opposition the exact state of the nation’s finances.
We have seen in just one term this government totally turn around Australia’s fortune. We have seen this government turn a surplus into a situation of debt and deficit. The Australian people are rightly concerned. When I go down the street people say to me, ‘I’m worried that my kids and my grandkids will still be paying for Labor’s debt.’ That is precisely the situation.
We have the promise of a convenient, wafer-thin surplus in 2012-13. That surplus is unlikely to be realised and it depends on a range of assumptions. The massive new mining tax is going to have to come into effect to balance the budget in the future. We have a dependence on future profits in the mining industry, which can be a very cyclical industry. The settings that this government is putting in place leave us absolutely unprepared for a potential downturn.
When it comes to economic credibility and the resources tax, what are those in the industry saying? They are saying they do not trust this government. They are saying they do not trust this government with the prospect of paying back 40 per cent of future losses. They are saying they do not trust the government at all. If there are major mining losses, rather than mining companies being able to send a cheque to the government for $400 million or $500 million, the government will simply change the law at the time and avoid its responsibilities. So, rather than it being some form of safety net for junior miners, the industry sees it as nothing more than another hollow promise from this government. This government is all about underdelivery.
We had the pink batts program. It was going to be a great environmental program. What happened? The taxpayer has been left with the bill for Labor’s gross mismanagement and gross incompetence. I have many people concerned about the insulation that was put in their roof. We have got spot checks with the pink batts program. If the insulation put in your roof was faulty and your house burned down, it would be of little consolation to know that you were not randomly selected for a spot check. You suffer the same fate: your house is destroyed—destroyed largely because of the poor administration of this program.
I have schools in my electorate complaining about the mismanagement under the Building the Education Revolution program, which I touched on earlier. We have had problems right across the electorate. Where there is a public school, there has been a problem with the BER program. At Eungai and Stuarts Point there are concerns. There are concerns about cost overruns at Scotts Head. And there are concerns about not getting what was required at Willawarrin and Corindi Beach. Where there is a project there is a problem and a cost overrun. It is just not good enough.
The people of Australia have a right to expect that public moneys are expended in an appropriate way, that there is a proper focus on value for money, that there is a proper focus on due process and that their taxpayer dollars are not being wasted. Everywhere you turn this government has underdelivered. Everywhere you turn not only is their economic management suspect; their program management is suspect. People are getting very sick of it. As I go round my electorate the call comes out time after time: ‘Get rid of this lot before they drive us deeper into debt. Get rid of this lot before they make the country broke.’ People are really concerned.
Spin only gets you so far. On the weekend we saw the Deputy Prime Minister and the Treasurer trying to spin the resources tax fraud that has been perpetrated on the Australian people with false claims about 13 per cent or 17 per cent. The truthful figures were available, but they were ignored conveniently by those two parliamentarians.
This is a budget that raises more questions than it answers. It is a budget that leaves Australia in debt. It is a budget that is unlikely to achieve the projections that are in it. It is a budget that should be of concern to the Australian people. I certainly would not commend this budget to the House.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2010-2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Champion, Nick, MP",ALP,2010-05-24,"—This budget has to be seen as all the previous budgets have been seen in this era in the context of the global financial crisis. We are still not out of that crisis yet and we only have to look at the events in Greece and the Eurozone economies to know that. We only have to look that far to see the IMF bailout and the problems in market confidence in terms of Greece to know that the effects of the global financial crisis are still very much with us. We only have to look to the United States, where they have just passed a major financial industries reform bill, to know that the consequences of that crisis are still with us as well.
If we look internationally at the No. 1 international economic problem, it is this global imbalance between the low savings rates of the developed world and the high savings rates of the developing world, most notably China. On top of that is the recycling of petrodollars where economic windfalls flow into OPEC countries and other oil producing countries, mainly out of the pockets of Western consumers. These are then reinvested in these established economies, often seeking relatively low rates of return. This has led to a flood of cheap credit over the last decade or so in developed economies. It is that cheap credit which has helped to fuel irresponsible lending in the United States and, in general, consumer indebtedness. That is something that we should all be concerned about.
It is said by a number of economists that what has to happen now is for the developing world to start consuming and for the developed world to start saving again. We need this to happen because the combination of economic factors that existed prior to the global financial crisis produced a very large asset bubble. That bubble and the bursting of it produced the greatest threat to the financial system since the 1930s, since the Great Depression. We are lucky in many ways that we had the action around the world from different governments. I think Gordon Brown, the previous Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, while not electorally successful and having many detractors domestically, will go down in history as having saved the British financial system and probably, along with Ben Bernanke, the world financial system. Because of their actions, a crisis which could have been far worse was averted. That is not to say there has not been massive economic cost, particularly to working people who typically have to pay the price as a result of unemployment, budget cuts and wage cuts—the sort of restructuring we see in Greece today. It is in that context that we have to see this budget.
Australia was spared from many of the problems experienced by the United Kingdom and the United States, because of the government’s actions and the nation’s economic strength. The economic historians will probably be the true arbiters of this, but I think they will look back at this time and see the decisive action that was taken by the government—investing in schools, investing in infrastructure, investing in the economy, keeping consumer confidence at appropriate levels which helped to maintain economic growth, and backing the banks. The banks were well regulated and well capitalised—to give the pervious government its due—but the banks had to be supported by the government in terms of their wholesale lending guarantees nonetheless.
Despite all of that, we have to note that Australia has a low savings rate. We have that in common with the rest of the developed world. If you take the superannuation system out, we have a savings rate which is the same as that of America—that is, it is probably in negative territory. The previous crisis just highlights the absolute importance of our superannuation system to our national economic buoyancy, to our national economic growth. I think that is the most important thing about this budget. It increases our national savings through the increases in the superannuation guarantee. This is something that has been very close to my heart all my working life. It is something that I have always believed in.
It is something that I believed in the entire time I was with the Shop Assistants’ Union. That union has a membership which is predominantly young and female—people who were up until Labor’s historic superannuation changes in the Hawke and Keating governments excluded from superannuation. Previously workers like those in retail and hospitality were excluded from occupational superannuation and had no retirement savings. They were reliant on the pension. I have seen the consequences of that in my own electorate while I have been doorknocking pensioners who live week to week. I have seen the consequences of it and I have represented the workers who have the most to benefit from an increase in the system. We know that it has an important effect for individuals and for the nation overall. So the increases from nine to 12 per cent and the increments of 0.25 per cent in 2013-14and 2014-15—followed by 0.5 per cent increments until it reaches 12 per cent—allow employers and employees to factor them into their wage bargaining arrangement, and we hope that they go further in many instances. We hope that they make additional provision for superannuation. It is a good way of providing non-inflationary wage benefits to people because generally it does not get spent, it gets saved.
These very important reforms add $85 billion to our national superannuation savings over the next 10 years. That helps set us up as a financial hub, it helps economic growth, it helps increase our national savings and it helps increase the amount of capital in the country. It is a tremendously important thing for the nation overall and it provides a cushion of national savings for any future economic shocks, which cannot necessarily be ruled out. We look at the events in the Eurozone and we know that the prospect of future economic shocks cannot be ruled out. That is one of the reasons why the stimulus, although it is tapering downwards, must continue. We cannot be sure that economic growth worldwide will necessarily continue.
I think we must have a weather eye for what could happen. We have economists like Paul Krugman talking about a lost decade in the United States because of the withdrawal of stimulus too quickly. He speculates they may suffer the problem that the Japanese economy suffered in the nineties, where they had a terrible economic collapse and they had zombie banks roaming around the place not really functioning properly. They lost a decade of economic growth. That is a prospect that must be countenanced when we look at world economic growth.
These superannuation savings are also terribly important to individuals. An 18-year-old will be $200,000 better off in retirement. A 30-year-old will be $108,000 better off. A 40-year-old will be $57,000 better off. Those figures highlight not just that individuals will benefit but that the earlier we get people to start saving for their retirement the better off they are and the more they end up with. The nature of retirement is that, when you are 18, you just do not think about it. When you get a bit closer to 40 you start thinking about it and when you are 50 you really start thinking about it. One of the key parts of this strategy for the nation’s savings is that it gets individuals to start saving when it is not necessarily their highest priority.
It is interesting that the Investment and Financial Services Association, which is headed by Mr John Brogden, called the government’s superannuation increases a stunning win for Australians and strongly supported their introduction. Mr Brogden was quoted as saying:
I congratulate the Government on today’s announcement. Every Australian will benefit from increased savings. Australians will face retirement with greater security and confidence.
Mr Brogden is of course a former opposition leader in New South Wales and not necessarily an ideological supporter of the government. So his support for the government’s changes is notable.
The changes are in the long-term national interest. They should receive bipartisan support. It is a great pity that they are not receiving bipartisan support. The opposition know that this is the right thing to do. They have always known that it is the right thing to do. Even when the previous government shelved the Keating government’s plan, they knew it was the right thing to do. Many of them will acknowledge it to you privately. Ultimately, they will not dismantle any increases that we put in place if they return to government because they know that it meets a vital national economic need—that is, to increase our rate of national savings. Australia’s long-term economic vulnerability has been that we have always had to draw in capital from overseas to fund productive investment in this country. It is in the vital national interest that we start to address that long-term vulnerability.
We have also heard all about the problems of a two-speed economy. This is a common problem for resource-rich economies. High resources prices force up the currency value, which squeezes the nation’s exporters—agriculture and manufacturing. I have seen this locally in Wakefield. I have seen hay exporters complain to me about the high currency. I have seen the pressure it puts on wineries. I have seen firsthand the pressure it puts on our car industry. I represent an electorate that relies on exports in nearly all of its major industries and a rising currency caused by a resource-rich economy places severe competitive pressures on the nation’s exporters.
There is also a tendency in a resource-rich economy for capital and labour to move to that expanding resources industry. Inevitably, this places pressure on the nation’s non-resource based exporters to compete, both for finance and for skilled labour, and this tends to increase the cost of both for these companies. A boom in the sale of non-renewable resources can severely affect the economic viability of the long-term wealth creators in manufacturing and agriculture. We do have to have an eye for when these non-renewable resources are sold. We have to have an eye for the long-term future of this country. We want a manufacturing industry and we want a viable agricultural industry to be there when the resources eventually, as they must, run out.
The government’s budget changes deal with this phenomenon by firstly ensuring that all Australians receive a fair share of the non-renewable resource revenue that is exported from this country. Secondly, they lower company tax rates to assist the nation’s companies to develop, despite the challenges of a two-speed economy. The government’s package lowers the company tax rate from 30 per cent to 28 per cent by 2014-15 and small business gets a head start on this reduction, receiving it in 2012. That is a very important reduction. In the ranking of competitiveness, it takes us from the 22nd most competitive country to the 17th on current advice. Sole traders, those in partnerships and incorporated small businesses will be able to deduct assets up to the value of $5,000 in one year. They will be able to pool assets costing more than $5,000 and write them down at a single rate of 30 per cent. So businesses across the nation will benefit from these changes and, most importantly, they assist exporters who are at our economic front line.
It is worth noting the opposition’s approach to company tax—to these exporters, to the car manufacturers, to the wineries and the hay exporters who are confronting the difficulties of the world post the global financial crisis and who are facing the challenges of a two-speed economy. Their approach is to add to the company tax burden, to add 1.7 per cent to the current 30 per cent rate. They do this to fund their rather lavish parental leave scheme, a parental leave scheme that seemed to come out of the middle of nowhere. One minute we had Mr Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, saying that he was against taxes. The next minute we had him saying that he was going to add 1.7 per cent to the company tax rate to fund a parental leave scheme that can only be described as upper-middle-class welfare, benefiting those who are very wealthy the most and slugging the nation’s exporters to do it. By 2014-15, the difference between the Rudd government’s company tax rate and a potential Abbott government’s tax rate will be 3.7 per cent if you take into account the government’s proposed reductions and the opposition’s proposed increases.
Essentially, the opposition say that miners should be let off the hook and we should let other exporters shoulder the full burden of the emerging two-speed economy. Essentially, they propose that an additional 1.7 per cent company tax burden should be put on the backs of our nation’s exporters, at a time when they are struggling, to fund maternity leave proposals that reek of indulgent middle-class welfare. It is a massive impost to place on hay exporters, on wine exporters and on car exporters. It is a massive impost which will slug companies in my electorate in order, on the one hand, to kowtow to the big end of town—those who are making extraordinary profits out of the mineral wealth of this country—and, on the other, to lavish middle-class welfare on those who can afford to go without it.
I think the Treasurer and Prime Minister should be applauded for their economic stewardship through the global financial crisis. In future, as I said, economic historians will debate this period in time. I sense that Australia will be held up as a country which had all the right policy prescriptions for what was a very serious crisis—and it could still be an uncertain economic future unless the world makes some pretty difficult decisions and embarks on appropriate global regulation to deal with these sorts of crises. This budget marks the beginning of a return to surplus in 2012-13 and a pathway out of the global financial crisis. Most importantly, it deals with the long-term international and national economic challenges, and I commend it the House.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2010-2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Bishop, Julie, MP",LP,2010-05-24,"—When the Treasurer rose to his feet on budget night, for a moment or two I thought we had been transported back in time. But no, he was taking us forward in time to 2012 or 2013. The Treasurer spent most of his speech talking about what will happen three years from now. There was very little about what will happen during the next 12 months. It was bordering on the surreal. The Treasurer was supposed to be handing down a budget for the 2010-11 financial year, but all he talked about were events that may occur years from now. I believe there is a good reason for that. The Treasurer is highly embarrassed about his budget. For the second year in a row, the Treasurer is so embarrassed about the state of his budget that he finds it difficult to talk about it in detail. Do you remember last year when the Treasurer could not bring himself to say the word ‘deficit’ within his budget speech? It reached such comical levels of absurdity that the Treasurer was avoiding saying the word ‘deficit’ and the Prime Minister was avoiding saying that the projected government debt was $200 billion. They found themselves physically unable to say the words ‘deficit’ or ‘$200 billion’.
Again this year the Treasurer finds it difficult to talk about what is going to occur in 2010-11. That is because the Rudd government’s spendathon continues unabated. The Treasurer is too embarrassed to admit that the headlong rush into massive debt continues. He is too embarrassed to admit that this government will be borrowing $700 million every week for the next financial year. This government’s reckless spending and borrowing means that the interest bill alone on government debt in 2010-11 will be $4.6 billion. The budget reveals that the interest payments will be $6.5 billion by 2012-13. This is money that has to be found to pay the interest on the government debt. It is money that could and should have been invested in schools, hospitals and other important services for the Australian people.
So how should the Australian people judge the Rudd government? The truth is that the Rudd government inherited the strongest set of national accounts since Federation when they took office in 2007. The Rudd government took over from the Howard government a budget that was more than $20 billion in surplus. There was zero net government debt and there were tens of billions of dollars in investment funds for the long-term future of this country. Members will recall the Higher Education Endowment Fund, the $6 billion fund for universities. There were funds for healthcare research and more. Yet this Treasurer has now presided over the biggest turnaround in the national finances in Australia’s history. This reckless government has spent money like water and plunged the budget deeply into deficit. Government debt will reach nearly $94 billion, and this is a debt that will be repaid by cutting government services or by the Australian people through their taxes. It will not be repaid by this failed Labor Treasurer or this failed Labor Prime Minister. It will be repaid by the Australian people. The government has raided many of the savings and spent, spent, spent.
What does Australia have to show for it? We have witnessed a disaster unfolding in the school building program, which has been rorted to an unbelievable extent. It is a school building program that has fundamentally failed every test of good governance and every test of competent ministerial oversight. We have also witnessed the tragic home insulation program unfold where four young Australians lost their lives and thousands of people are living in homes with unsafe roofs. There have also been dozens of house fires. The program will cost almost as much to fix as it took to roll out in the first place.
We have witnessed the litany of broken promises from the Rudd government. There was the failure to build the promised 260 childcare centres and the failure to build the promised 2,650 trade training centres with only 12 currently operational. The computers in schools program has delivered only a quarter of what the Rudd government promised for double the cost. The backflips and broken promises came so thick and fast in the weeks before the budget that it was impossible to keep track of them all.
Let me turn to one of the Rudd government’s most important policies. The Prime Minister called it the greatest moral challenge of our age. He claimed that climate change was so important, and that it was so necessary for his emissions trading scheme to be enacted before last year’s Copenhagen conference, that to do otherwise would be absolute political cowardice. He said it would be an absolute failure of leadership. Yet the Prime Minister has walked away from what he described as the greatest moral challenge of our age. What kind of Prime Minister would say that climate change was the greatest moral challenge of our age, tell the Australian people he had a policy to deal with it and then walk away from that policy? That is, by the Prime Minister’s own standards, an act of absolute political cowardice and an absolute failure of leadership. It is beyond belief that this Prime Minister can continue to expect the Australian people to believe any future commitment that he makes.
The Treasurer’s entire budget framework is based on a house of cards held up by a great big mining supertax. This tax strikes at the heart of Australia’s future prosperity. We know that the Prime Minister would love for this debate to be about Kevin Rudd versus the big, greedy, foreign mining companies. He would love to portray this as foreign companies taking their profits overseas and ripping off Australians. But the truth is that this is a tax that will impact most severely on the 500,000 people who are employed directly or indirectly by the mining sector. Amongst that group there will be young families struggling to pay off a mortgage and raise a family. There will be thousands of small business owners who have sunk their life savings into ventures that support the mining sector. These are the people who will be casualties of the Prime Minister’s supertax grab. It will not be the mining executives that this government is personally denigrating. It will not be BHP and Rio Tinto for, of course, they have options. They have obligations to their shareholders to operate in the most cost-effective environment to get the best returns on the investment. That is no longer Australia. They have options in other countries overseas, including Canada, whose effective tax rate will be less than half than that of Australia if this supertax is imposed on our mining sector.
One can only wonder what message this government is trying to send to international investors. Surely this government is not intending to send a message that, if you come to Australia, invest billions of dollars in this country and employ thousands of Australians, you can then expect to be subjected to retrospective taxation on your investments and your mining executives can be subjected to vicious, personal attacks from the Prime Minister, no less. The Rudd government has sent a clear message to the international investment community that Australia is now a more risky investment environment. It is hard to believe that the words ‘Australia’ and ‘high sovereign risk’ are being used in the same sentence by the global capital markets. Every Australian government for decades has worked tirelessly to promote Australia as a safe and stable investment destination. This reputation has been trashed by the Prime Minister for the purposes of domestic political gain. To make matters much worse the Prime Minister continues to misrepresent key facts about the impact of this mining supertax.
Question time today was quite a farce as the Prime Minister falsely claimed the status of a document, which he wished to rely upon to support the extraordinary claim of the Deputy Prime Minister and the Treasurer yesterday, that multinational companies in Australia pay 13 per cent tax and other companies pay 17 per cent tax. That claim was made in support of the government’s imposition of this tax. It is just not true. Worse still the document upon which the Treasurer and the Deputy Prime Minister relied was in fact a draft paper written by a student from the university of Carolina. It was not Treasury modelling; it was not a Treasury analysis; it was a paper done for a PhD student’s thesis.
We have to be deeply concerned when the Prime Minister is unable to describe what constitutes a superprofit. The Prime Minister said:
Well, a super profit is calculated in this way. If you have for example, in a mining company, a normal profit is made up of revenues minus expenses. What’s a super profit? Revenues minus expenses minus what we call an ordinary return on investment. How do we define an ordinary return on investment? If you took your investment capital and, for example, invested it at the long term government bond rate, that runs at about six per cent.
That was the Prime Minister’s description of a superprofit. Profits in excess of that he defines as super for profit. The Prime Minister went on to say:
… what we do is say that those companies running those super profits can keep 60 per cent of that but 40 per cent of it, we believe, should come back to the Australian people in investment in better super for working families.
This was another misrepresentation. The government has deliberately sought to mislead and misrepresent every aspect of this new tax. But that is the hallmark of the government. The government has misrepresented the total tax and royalties paid by the mining industry. The Prime Minister and his ministers have claimed the sector has only paid an additional $9 billion in revenue, when in reality it has contributed $80 billion over the period claimed. The government has been caught out using the statistics from the United States graduate student rather than the official published statistics of the Australian Taxation Office to attack the amount of tax paid by the minerals sector. Rarely have we seen an act of such utter desperation from a government rapidly losing control of its agenda. Rather than the 13 to 17 per cent quoted by the Treasurer and the Deputy Prime Minister from the paper by the US student, the government should use the Australian tax office figures which show the effective corporate tax rate paid by the mining sector is 27.81 per cent and when royalties are added the effective rate increases to 41.3 per cent.
In fact, BHP went so far today as to issue a notice to the stock exchange to point out that its effective tax rate for the year 2009 was 43 per cent. The chairman of BHP Billiton, Mr Jack Nasser, sent a letter to shareholders of BHP on 17 May 2010 pointing out that the effective tax rate paid by BHP was 43 per cent and that if this supertax were added to the tax rate, BHP would be paying about a 57 per cent effective tax rate, which would make it the highest taxed mining and resource sector in the world. I asked the Prime Minister in question time today whether he accepted as a fact the statement by the chairman of BHP Billiton that BHP’s effective tax rate was 43 per cent. The Prime Minister pointedly refused to answer.
There has been the very damaging campaign by the Prime Minister in concert with the unions to portray global mining companies as foreign carpetbaggers taking profits overseas. This is simply not true. For example, Xstrata has claimed that it generated $44 billion in revenue and has reinvested a total of $45 billion in Australia —in other words, Xstrata has invested more in Australia than it generated.
The Prime Minister has also sought to compare the mining supertax with the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax, which was introduced in the 1980s. It is important to note that the North West Shelf, a major petroleum project, was exempted from the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax. The government is not able to point to any development that occurred in the 20 years between the introduction of the tax and when the Gorgon project was announced last year. The fact is further development in the oil and gas sector was severely retarded after the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax was introduced. In fact, it is only in recent years, more than 20 years later, that development has begun as the long-term demand for energy appears to be very strong. The Gorgon project, in other words, has taken 20 years to come on-stream. This contrasts with the government’s claim that the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax has made the oil and gas sector prosper as a result of its introduction.
The head of Woodside, Don Voelte, has said that the Pluto project would not have got off the ground had the government’s proposed supertax regime been in place. And we have had a number of mining executives state publicly and to the stock exchange that projects will be put on hold as a result of the government’s mining supertax. It is beyond belief that the government can claim that whacking a 40 per cent tax on the mining sector is somehow good for the mining sector. If it were so good for the mining sector, why aren’t other sectors in the Australian economy lining up and begging the government to impose an additional 40 per cent on their operations? It just beggars belief.
Over the last few weeks we have seen a very damaging campaign by this government to give the impression to the Australian people that the mining sector is not paying its way and that somehow the Australian people are being ripped off. This is causing considerable consternation around the world, particularly in global capital markets and international investment circles. It is strange, because when Kevin Rudd was in opposition he used to speak very highly of the mining sector. Indeed in one of his first overseas trips as Prime Minister he went to Beijing, and in Beijing he said:
Australia is an open market when it comes to foreign investment. And if you look at Australia, we have had a history of relying upon internationally sourced capital to fund the country’s long-term development. In the great state of Western Australia, it’s like that.
I mean, you have a relatively small population, a huge land mass and therefore foreign investment has been necessary.
That is a statement that stands in stark contrast with what the government is now proposing to do. His extraordinary attack on mining companies as foreign owned and having massively increased their profits and denied the Australian people their fair share just does not ring true when you think how effusive the Prime Minister was about the mining sector and its contribution to ensuring that Australia could weather the storm surrounding the global financial crisis.
As the Prime Minister drags Australia’s international reputation through the mud for his own domestic political purposes, we in the opposition will stand firm. We believe that this supertax is bad for the Australian economy. It will cost jobs and drive mining activity and mining investment offshore. It will hurt small business owners. It will harm Australian consumers as the cost of living will rise as a result of the imposition of an additional 40 per cent tax. Housing costs, electricity costs and an increased cost of living will all go through the Australian economy. (Time expired)
",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2010-2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2010-05-24,"—In the budget this year, Tasmania has continued to fare very well. The 2010-11 federal budget is about securing Australia’s long-term economic future. With what we were facing in Australia 12 months ago, the original forecast for the budget for 2009-10 was for a fall in the GDP of 0.5 per cent and unemployment to be at 8.25 per cent, with a deficit of about $58 billion. Things have been turned around quite well by the budget which has been brought down, with the opportunity for growth for 2010-11 being stated at about 3.25 per cent and unemployment to remain around five per cent, or I think even a little less, with a deficit of about $41 billion. So it is a bit of a different picture from last year.
We should commend the Treasurer for bringing that budget together. It reflects a commitment to strong financial management and the budget returning to surplus in 2012-13. This is responsible management which will mean that the government will halve peak debt and get the budget back into the black three years early. This was clearly a budget for the years ahead and for securing Australia’s future. It helps working families. I am particularly pleased about the commitments to health care, including GP services, superclinics and addressing the shortage of nurses. In the Lyons electorate, this has been a major question and I have been lobbying for many years now to ensure that we have the appropriate mix of health staff available to try to take pressure off the city hospitals.
I welcome the funding for skills training in renewable energy. In my electorate I have a major wind farm proposed for the Lake Echo area. I certainly hope that comes together in future. It is in the Central Highlands and only a couple of kilometres from the distribution hub for Hydro Tasmania. Concerning infrastructure and rail networks, I look forward to projects already underway in the electorate of Lyons and across Tasmania coming together. Other projects can be supported and some are already being funded. Here I think about Rhyndaston and the area of the old train route between Hobart and Launceston, built in 1880 with horse and cart, being renewed and many of the more rigorous curves of the rail being removed. It will be straightened considerably, which will mean less wear and tear on the train traffic using it in the future.
During the period this government has been in Canberra, there have been some great changes in emphasis in communities across the Lyons electorate, assisted by federal government funding. This has encouraged hard work and persistence from community members to come up with the projects which have been funded. Let us have a look at some of those projects, with a focus on the many good things happening in the communities around the Lyons electorate.
I keep reading in the national press about some problems with the Building the Education Revolution. I saw people today on the other side trying to promote politics around these projects, but every time I visit a school or attend an opening in the Lyons electorate I find very grateful and enthusiastic school communities who are delighted to have these funds spent in their area and on their schools. In some places they tell me that this is the first major upgrade of their facilities in 30 or 40 years. So, of course, they are very pleased to have these upgrades to take their schools forward over the next 20 years. Without funding of this sort, these communities would have found it very hard to achieve through fundraising the large amounts of money needed to build and equip any new facilities. These projects in small communities will benefit the whole community, not just the education community. In many of those small communities the school is a real community school, playing a very important role over and above its educational role.
They tell me that the new technology that has been provided, along with the upgrade of the infrastructure, has enabled children in more isolated areas to link into mainstream education programs and talk between schools. Both teachers and students are learning to use the IT together. Some teachers are finding the large whiteboards difficult, and the kids are teaching them as they go. It also helps the school to again become the focus of the community. I recently opened a new multipurpose building in Wilmot, costing about $250,000, which was funded through Building the Education Revolution. This funding allowed the online access centre to function more efficiently. It provided a great area for the local playgroup to meet and also for the whole school community to meet as one body. The online centres not only give people the chance to learn new skills and participate in e-learning activities but, in the case of small communities, also provide a place for people to come together and share experiences and ideas. The local playgroup will now have a new area in which to meet, giving local kids a chance to become familiar with the school atmosphere before starting school in the future. The learning programs across Lyons are a major success, and having an area big enough for those programs to come into play is a major opportunity for young people.
Another project was the refurbishment of the Carrington Mill at Oatlands in Central Tasmania. This was done just after the last election as part of the Rural Infrastructure Program. When you drive past Oatlands you cannot miss the Carrington Mill. It is a great landmark and tourist attraction in the Midlands of Tasmania. Many people do not know about this mill but it is playing a central role in the reinvigoration of the whole town of Oatlands. Over the past few years, Carrington Mill has received $1.2 million in federal funding, with matching funding from the state. The work is well underway. The long-term goal is to see the mill up and running again as a working venture. This will not only be a tourist attraction but will have a huge ongoing economic benefit for the whole area. Already, we have seen one new business open—a bakery specialising in baking bread using traditional methods. The bakery is now also holding courses in breadmaking. The overall plan is to turn Oatlands into a tourist precinct with many opportunities to experience within the area. It is also only a short distance from the highland lakes. The plans include the growing and harvesting of spelt wheat, a heritage variety of wheat, which is used in the grinding process at the mill. Existing attractions such as the Oatlands Spring Festival and local businesses and accommodation will all benefit from these major plans. This has been a long process that started many years ago with a vision to turn Oatlands from a quaint but fading country town into a tourist destination. It has taken much work and dedication from many community members, volunteers and the local council to make this dream a reality.
This is what these injections of funds into small communities are all about. They not only stimulate the economy but, in the process, can also motivate a whole region or two. Many of the success stories around Lyons owe everything to groups and committees of hardworking volunteers who persist in the face of many problems to achieve their goals. Recently, we have seen a new childcare centre called Little Penguin open at Bicheno. Over 10 years ago a group of parents saw a need for child care in the Bicheno and Freycinet communities. Since then, with a few changes in the committee over the years, the group has worked tirelessly to see its dream become a reality. This culminated with the opening of the centre, which is sponsored by the Northern Children’s Network, in May, and it was a wonderful event. This stimulated other investments in the local community—in particular, the upgrading of the primary school, which was opened just last week. The Beaconsfield childcare centre and early learning centre is another vital project that is being funded as part of the rollout of childcare centres in disadvantaged districts, and it is now well on the way to providing a good service to the parents of Beaconsfield and the upper Tamar Valley.
On the mainland there have been stories about pink batts. I can tell you that this program went down very well in the Lyons electorate. It was delivered mostly by local companies, and I guess that was the key to there not being many complaints. The only complaints generated were in more populated areas outside the Lyons electorate, where fly-by-night companies took advantage of gullible consumers who trusted them to do the right thing. I believe this was a good program. It has allowed many people to at least have some insulation in their homes, and I am sure that contributes to bringing down their fuel bills.
I believe we have again been responsible in this budget. We have moved to strengthen the economy to help Australian families where they really need assistance and to secure growth for the future. Our decisive action has kept the economy strong and protected jobs during the global financial crisis. We must now take decisive action to return the budget to surplus and keep our finances strong.
In Tasmania we are going through a major period of restructuring of our primary industries. We have been addressing the question of climate change in our agricultural industries and there have been some assistance packages to help with the delivery of water to drought-proof individual properties.
Now we turn to look at forestry. Despite the Greens attempts to derail any initiatives taken by the industry, there is general agreement that the restructuring of the industry needs to occur to retain a very important side of our economy. Federal capital already put into road and rail infrastructure will assist part of this and I know that there are close negotiations going on between the state and federal spheres and industry players to build a new and more sustainable industry.
We have the rollout of the National Broadband Network which is already underway in Tasmania. This will mean businesses and industries in Tasmania will be able to compete on an equal basis with those overseas as they access markets and opportunities. Without a fast and reliable internet service, this has been impossible to achieve before. Many people coming to Tasmania find a valley or a glen where they would love to live, but they are not able to get proper internet service so they have had to leave again.
Tourism is another area where Tasmania has an active interest as we have some of the most sought after tourist venues in Australia. I know our east coast has been featured as one of the most popular and heralded tourist destinations. Tourism is a $1 billion industry for the Tasmanian economy, and it is an industry that employs 14,000 people—some 16 per cent of all jobs. The federal government has recognised the importance of this and has launched a program called There’s nothing like Australia on a website in which individuals, states and businesses can interact with the marketing program to ensure that the places people visit and which they enjoyed most can be documented and spread to the whole world. So it will certainly help Tasmania to attract more visitors and thus create more jobs.
There are tax cuts in this budget as well, and a more simplified tax system that will allow automatic deductions from 1 July 2012. There will be modest income tax cuts for every Australian taxpayer from 1 July this year. Small business will also be given a tax break from 1 July 2012.
The new investments in the Launceston General Hospital, the rehabilitation work and the opportunities that will go on there are major investments in the health of Tasmanians. There are opportunities from the $417 million investment to improve after-hours access to GPs and primary health care. This is a major way of keeping people out of hospitals. There are the superclinics, and one is close to getting started in the electorate of Lyons. They are a wonderful opportunity to deliver primary health care. And, of course, electronic health records for every Australian who wants one from 1 July 2012 will be a major initiative, something which the other side failed to deliver to the Australian health system.
The money being put into mental health through this budget will also assist enormously, especially the 3,500 young people aged between 16 and 25 years who can benefit from early treatment support. This is a major opportunity as we know that early assistance and treatment in the area of mental health is of major benefit.
There are 39,000 training places for the Skills for Recovery program, with the Apprentice Kickstart initiative to support around 22,500 apprentices. This is targeted to small to medium businesses in areas where we, as a nation, need to improve those skill bases. There will be 140,000 Australians building core foundation skills such as language, literacy and numeracy. It is a tremendous program which will assist many apprentices getting started.
I mentioned infrastructure in the electorate of Lyons. There is the National Broadband Network being rolled out in parts of the Lyons electorate and other parts of Tasmania. The Australian Rail Track Corporation received about $1 billion in this budget. This will help to enhance rail and track throughout Australia.
So this budget is a very responsible one. It allows us to build on the programs before us, making sure that we are well placed in the global economy to deal with the changes that are continuing to face us. (Time expired)
",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2010-2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Baldwin, Robert, MP",LP,2010-05-24,"—I rise today to address the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011. This bill represents everything that is wrong with the Rudd Labor government: reckless spending, broken promises, waste, new taxes and gross mismanagement. This is a big-spending, big-taxing budget. But what else can we expect from a Labor government? Just like Whitlam and Keating before him, Prime Minister Rudd has taken a huge surplus and driven it into massive debt. This is a case of deja vu.
Prime Minister Rudd would have you believe that his spending was necessary because we were part of a global financial crisis. In fact, Prime Minister Rudd has tried to take credit for the performance of the Australian economy during the global financial crisis. The facts are that Australia was buffeted from the economic tempest with a $23 billion surplus left by the coalition, a mining industry boom and a well-regulated and secure financial industry. At no point during the crisis did our banks require bailouts like those in the USA and the UK. Mr Rudd would have my constituents believe that he spent their money wisely to avoid an economic tsunami. Yet, when we actually got hit, it was nothing worse than a king tide.
Allow me to compare the economic management of Labor and the coalition. During the Keating years the cash interest rate reached 10.5 per cent and stayed there for almost two years. During the Howard years the cash rate fell to less than six per cent and stayed there for 6½ years. During the Labor Hawke-Keating years, unemployment peaked at 10.9 per cent and remained in double figures for more than two years. It took John Howard just three years in government to bring this to below seven per cent, and for the next 8½ years unemployment consistently fell, bottoming out at four per cent in March 2008. Labor is now celebrating a figure of 5.4 per cent as at April 2010.
Why is it that the Labor Party is so bad at managing a budget? It is because the Labor Party consists of people who have no real experience in business. Before becoming Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd studied Mandarin, worked in foreign affairs in Sweden and China and worked as a consultant. Before becoming Deputy Prime Minister, Julia Gillard studied arts and law, worked as a lawyer and was a secretary of the Socialist Forum. Clearly these are people who know absolutely nothing about making tough decisions in order to make ends meet and keep small business afloat.
I know what it is like struggling to manage a business and keep workers in a job while providing for a family. Prior to entering politics I owned a scuba-diving business, Scuba Industries of Australia. I also had a construction business called Central Coast Carpenters and Builders. A great majority of my coalition colleagues have also worked as farmers or in small business, including Warren Truss, Judith Adams, Cory Bernardi, Bruce Billson and Steve Ciobo, to name but a few. The people of Australia can trust the coalition with their household budgets because we have been out there employing them, listening to them and providing for them. We know what it is like to have our own money on the line, to be risking our future and that of our children with good business and good money management. That is why we can be trusted with the finances of this great country.
Having personally managed my own businesses and dealt with budget issues on a daily basis, I cannot describe the anger, dismay and helplessness I have felt watching Labor waste billions of dollars of taxpayers’ money. These bills reveal the extent of Labor’s waste, including $1 billion which will now have to be spent to fix the bungled and tragic Home Insulation Program. The bills also include $1 billion to be spent on dealing with the influx of illegal boat arrivals that have occurred since Prime Minister Rudd weakened our border protection policies. This is all money that could have been saved if the Rudd Labor government had not rushed into things without proper consultation. Australia never had to go into this massive debt, which will now have to be repaid by every man, woman and child. This Labor government only knows how to throw money at its problems. Now it has no money left to throw.
I want to speak in particular about four of Labor’s biggest failures because I simply do not have time to list them all. Firstly, we had the Home Insulation Scheme, where Labor did everything wrong. Firstly, Labor handed out rebates that were too high because it did not properly consult with the experts, and, when the coalition convinced Prime Minister Rudd that the taxpayers were being ripped off, $200 million had already been wasted. Secondly, Labor did not monitor its program or the people who were delivering it. Dangerous work was done and four people lost their lives in tragic circumstances. Thirdly, rogue installers did dodgy work and ruined the reputation of professional, trustworthy insulation businesses. Fourthly, Labor promised to review and then reinstate the scheme but then changed its mind, resulting in businesses which had bought tonnes of insulation material being left with costly storage bills, with many being forced to dump their insulation because they simply could not afford to store it. Fifthly, insulation businesses claimed for their government rebates, but Labor was so slow in paying them that some businesses almost went bankrupt. For example, Insulmaster, in my electorate of Paterson, was owed hundreds of thousands of dollars and had to let go of staff.
I would also like to talk about Labor’s so-called Building the Education Revolution, which is more like a taxpayer rip-off. I would like to make it clear that I wholeheartedly support investment in local schools and in the education of our children. But what taxpayers need is value for money—and they simply did not get it in this program. The BER saw some prefabricated classrooms costing more per square metre than a luxury home. For example, Booral Public School in my electorate got a double pre-fabricated classroom for the same price that Black Hill Public School got three classrooms, a basketball court and a rainwater tank. The difference? The latter achieved such a great result because the school managed the project itself. The Booral Public School project was managed by the state Labor government.
We have seen a massive increase in illegal boat arrivals as a result of Prime Minister Rudd weakening our border protection policies. The coalition had this problem under control and between July 2002 and June 2008 there were just 18 boats. Since Prime Minister Rudd took over, we have had 128 boats in less than three years. That is a rate of about three boats a week under Labor, compared with three boats a year under the coalition. Labor now needs to spend $1 billion fixing this problem. This would not have been necessary if Labor had simply made the tough decisions and stopped the boats, like the coalition did.
Finally, I would like to talk about the great big new tax on mining that Labor wants to inflict on the Australian economy. This ‘supertax’ has hit mining companies hard on the stock market while cutting huge amounts from ordinary Australians’ superannuation accounts. This ‘supertax’ will hit hard on the profits of the Hunter’s mining companies, which will likely have to cut jobs and shift allowances in order to cope. If their products become more expensive, it will lead to big increases in power bills. It will also force overseas consumers to go elsewhere in search of competitively priced coal, therefore sending our jobs offshore. This tax is not just on big mining companies; it is also on small quarries and will impact on the cost of sand, gravel and cement. At a time when the property market is already struggling because of rising interest rates, this is a cost we simply cannot bear. As the Hunter struggles with a huge shortfall in rental vacancy, we should be encouraging people to buy new homes, not making them more expensive and out of reach. Furthermore, this tax is not just a hit on mining companies. Like Labor’s postponed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, this is a tax on everything and everyone and will flow on to every sector of the economy and hit families where it hurts—in the pocket.
According to Labor, this reckless tax is the best way to pull Australia out of the huge debt the Prime Minister has created, but the Rudd Labor government clearly does not understand that the Australian economy will suffer enormous damage as a result of this tax and the effects will be far reaching. The Labor government has failed to explain to the Australian people that the surplus forecast in its appropriation bills relies on the continued mining boom. A slight change to this boom would mean that the supposed surplus becomes nonexistent. Prime Minister Rudd would have you believe that I am a doomsayer for questioning the continuing mining boom, but he himself said in 2007:
The future I see for Australia is one in which our current mining boom does not last forever, and rather than simply being the lucky country—instead of a country which makes its own luck—we will have to make our own luck.
He said:
… our current economic circumstances are propped up by the mining boom which this year alone will bring in some $55 billion to the national economy.
But working families legitimately fear this. ‘What happens, Mr Howard, when the mining boom is over?’
Prime Minister Rudd criticised John Howard for the mining boom, claiming that the coalition did not have a plan to safeguard our economy when it ended, yet now that he has spent all the money and wasted the surplus Mr Howard worked so hard to achieve Mr Rudd wants to hinge Australia’s entire economic recovery on the mining boom. Clearly the Prime Minister cannot be trusted when it comes to the economy or to keep his word.
The money wasted on these four mistakes alone could have paid for vital projects across the country, including life-changing improvements for the people in my electorate of Paterson. My constituents need urgent upgrades in order to watch television and access the internet. My constituents need urgent road upgrades to the Pacific Highway, the New England Highway, Bucketts Way and the Nelson Bay Road to erase black spots and save lives. They need a Fingal Bay bypass and quicker action to build the F3 link road, not to mention action on Dungog roads. My constituents need more aged-care beds, more mental health facilities, more doctor’s surgeries and another local hospital. My constituents need more childcare places and they need a high school in Medowie.
Of course, Labor could not deliver money for any of these projects in this year’s budget because it has no money left. Labor could not deliver any of these projects, even though the $1 billion it wasted on the Home Insulation Program alone would have paid for many of these projects and a whole lot more. Sadly, monumental mistakes define the Rudd Labor government. Broken promises have also featured heavily over the past three years and have caused disappointment after disappointment for the people of Paterson.
Prime Minister Rudd has repeatedly declared that climate change is ‘the greatest moral challenge of our time’. Likewise, his deputy, Julia Gillard, said in January this year that ‘delay is the same as denial’. But now, just a couple of months later, Mr Rudd and Ms Gillard have delayed their ETS. This cowardly backdown is clearly designed to win votes because, as this bill confirms, Mr Rudd intends to reintroduce the ETS if he wins the election. The Independent Pricing and Regulatory Tribunal has made it clear that the ETS would result in a 64 per cent rise in electricity bills in New South Wales. In addition, Labor’s own report, commissioned through Access Economics, shows that the ETS would place 17,000 jobs in the Hunter at risk, and that is without the impact of the great big new tax on mining proposed by this government.
This is bad legislation which will cost jobs and threaten household budgets. It is no wonder that the Prime Minister wants voters to forget about it in the lead-up to the next election, but if we cannot trust a Prime Minister to deliver action on what he believes to be ‘the greatest moral challenge of our time’ how can we trust him to deliver anything else, including a budget surplus? After all, he would not even consider the coalition’s direct action plan on climate change, even though it would deliver the same emissions reductions as his ETS. This is a Prime Minister who is all about playing politics, not about hard decisions.
I now come to my portfolio area of defence science and personnel and, more broadly, the defence budget. This budget has again shown that the Rudd Labor government cannot be trusted even on matters as important as the defence of our nation. For instance, the Rudd Labor government’s much maligned 2009 defence white paper promised 12 new submarines, which were to be built in Australia. At the time, the Prime Minister even said that the next generation of submarines would be ‘Australia’s largest ever single defence project’. Given such an assessment, you would expect the 2010-11 budget to have provided some level of initial funding for this highly complex project, but again the budget has revealed the Prime Minister is all doorstop and no delivery. If this government were at all serious about the submarines, the budget should have allocated at least $70 million to $100 million on the design and development phase. Instead, all it has managed to do is transfer the risk of the project to future governments, which is hardly the act of a responsible Prime Minister.
This budget also revealed an overall decrease of $2.42 billion in defence expenditure over the next three years, despite numerous commitments from the Rudd Labor government to a three per cent real increase to the defence budget until 2017-18. By way of comparison, the 2009-10 budget stated that total government funding for defence between the years 2010-11 and 2012-13 would be $77.48 billion. Yet, in the 2010-11 budget, total government funding over the same period for defence totalled $75.06 billion, an overall decrease of $2.42 billion in defence expenditure and another broken promise. Unlike the Rudd government, the Howard government not only quarantined the defence budget from cuts but also increased it from $10.6 billion to $22 billion and rebuilt the hollow structures left by years of Labor neglect.
What this budget has succeeded in doing is to increase the level of concern in the defence industry sector, and it is easy to see why. In 2009-10 there was $631.5 million earmarked for the unapproved major capital equipment program, yet the 2010-11 budget only shows $277.9 million spread over 45 major projects. This is a massive drop in expenditure that has the whole of the defence industry sector worried and is putting numerous defence jobs at risk.
This budget has also successfully managed to increase the number of Defence bureaucrats—by some 1,500 over the next 12 months. This came as a particular shock, as before the 2007 election Kevin Rudd attacked what he considered to be a bloated federal bureaucracy. He has since added nearly 20,000 more public servants during his time in office. And, if all of that was not hard enough to swallow, the government has also reduced the number of uniformed soldiers by 501. The large increase in bureaucrats is coming at a time when Defence is supposed to be saving $20 billion over 10 years, and will simply result in the diversion of resources away from major acquisition programs and Australia’s front line troops.
Without reducing the importance of the support provided by those who serve behind a desk, there is nothing more important than those who serve on the front line. This must be the first time in history that a government has increased the number of public servants in order to save money! Again more spin, smoke and mirrors from a government that has turned fiscal belt tightening into a growth industry. The audacity of this government and its spin machine knows no bounds. When the Minister for Defence Materiel and Science, Greg Combet, proudly announced that the Defence Science and Technology Organisation would receive a funding increase of $138 million, he failed to articulate over how many years this funding would be spread. But that is not the worst part. The reality is that, while the Rudd Labor government may claim to be investing $138 million in the DSTO, it had already ripped out $108 million soon after forming government. The real devil, as they say, is in the detail—and, in this case, that detail was purposely omitted.
Before concluding, I would like to make mention of one last item contained within the budget—one that I am sure will disappoint many Australians—and that is the government’s decision to further reduce the number of available places on the highly successful ADF gap year program. This is a program that was introduced by the coalition government in 2007 in order to give school leavers the opportunity to taste ADF life. It is a program that has proven to be both highly successful and cost effective. In 2008-09, 465 people transferred from the gap year program into either the permanent or Reserve forces. That equates to roughly three-quarters of all participants.
The Rudd Labor government’s decision to halve the ADF gap year program is not only short-sighted but also economically irresponsible. The ADF spends tens of millions of dollars every year on recruiting and marketing campaigns, yet the Rudd government, inexplicably, has chosen to cut back a proven and cost-effective recruitment and retention initiative. It seems only those in the Rudd Labor government know why such action was taken, and it seems those same people are the only ones that consider the current boom in defence recruitment and retention as everlasting. The hard truth is that defence will again face the prospect of personnel shortages and recruitment challenges in the near future, particularly as personnel are once again lured back to the lucrative mining sector—which is one of the reasons why successful programs such as the ADF gap year should be maintained, not cut back.
The Rudd Labor government’s short-sighted approach to policy making is going to cost the economy more money than it is trying to save. That is what this Labor budget is—it is a big taxing, big spending budget that will cost all Australians more than it purports to save. A government that failed to manage a home insulation scheme cannot be trusted to manage the nation’s fiscal policy, let alone its defence forces. A government that says climate change is the greatest moral challenge of our time, only to scrap its ETS, cannot be trusted. Australia’s coalition governments fixed interest rates, they fixed unemployment and they paid off the multi-billion dollar debts that each and every Labor government left them with. It will take another coalition government to get the job done this time as well. (Time expired)
",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2010-2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Campbell, Jodie, MP",ALP,2010-05-24,"—I rise today to talk about a budget which will further strengthen our economy and secure future growth as we emerge from the global financial crisis in a position stronger than we had anticipated. I am delighted to be part of a government that takes responsibility for the nation’s future, and this is a budget that will see us move towards a more stable and secure economy for Australia’s families and the generations to come. The actions we took as a government in the face of the economic crisis helped to lessen its effects and we are now working to return the budget to surplus much sooner than we thought was possible. It was HG Wells who said that human history is, in essence, a history of ideas. Ideas inform policy which in turn informs the lives of everyday Australians. If you care about people then you care about policy; if you care about policy then you care about ideas. It is the combination of great ideas and the pragmatic approach of the Rudd government that has carried us as a nation through the global financial crisis and will continue to carry us forward. It is such ideas that shape this budget.
This budget supports what I believe are some of the most important areas for our country. The health of our families and communities has been at the forefront of this government’s investment, and this year’s budget builds on that. For the first time, the federal government will take primary funding responsibility for our health system in order to ensure that our health system and hospitals meet our needs in the years to come. Over the next five years $2.2 billion dollars is being invested to create the National Health and Hospitals Network, which will be funded nationally and run locally.
I have heard first-hand about the problems with our health system and one issue that has often been raised with me by my constituents in Bass is the availability of GPs. The budget measures to improve after-hours GP access as well as training more GPs and nurses will build on previous investments and go a long way towards helping make our health system a top quality one for the future. The government is introducing a new four-hour emergency department target and guaranteeing elective surgery waiting times with a new national target that 95 per cent of Australians receive elective surgery within clinically recommended times by 2015, as well as delivering 1,300 new hospital beds. We are also building another 23 new GP superclinics and upgrading over 400 GP clinics and primary care services across the country to provide improved health services to the community.
While I strongly support the Rudd government’s tremendous investment in health, I do wish tonight to bring to the attention of the House the matter of the planned removal of access to Medicare rebates to mental health trained social workers and occupational therapists under the Better Access to Mental Health scheme as announced in the budget. There has been an outcry nationwide against this measure by those mental health workers, the doctors who refer to them and their clients, and I thank Minister Roxon for agreeing to delay the changes and to consult further. I would like to acknowledge in the chamber this evening the National CEO of the Australian Association of Social Workers, Kandie Allen-Kelly, together with Dr Maxine Manifold, a local GP in Launceston who felt so strongly about the removal of the Medicare rebate that she took charge and initiated a local petition. In just five days she managed, together with a team of passionate and committed health professionals, to obtain 1,860 signatures, which I will table in the chamber at a later date. I would also like to thank the many constituents who took the time to email or write to me in relation to this very important matter.
People in Bass are concerned, and concerned they should be. I note in the minister’s press release of 19 May the plan to move the services of these highly trained and experienced clinicians to the provision of packages of care for those in our community with severe mental illness. But clinicians in my electorate tell me that the use of packages will not substitute for the present system of Medicare rebates. The rebate system allows people to visit their clinician and seek assistance for what might be a transitory illness, like a reactive depression or suicidal thoughts after the loss of a relationship. This system has assisted many people in our community to restore quality of life and get back to work and family. Anxiety, depression, mania and neurosis can be debilitating illnesses, and we must encourage people to seek assistance by treating them as if they were the same as any other illness. Imagine if you were to visit your doctor for a flu shot, only to be told that before he or she could treat you that you would have to apply for a package of care. What if you went your clinician and said, ‘I have diabetes and depression.’ He or she would reply, ‘I can treat you for your diabetes, but for your depression you’ll have to apply for a package of care.’
The minister’s press release says that the packages will support people with severe mental illness, but this should not replace a system where people are assisted by clinicians so that they do not develop a severe mental illness. Packages of care should not replace the current system of Medicare rebates. The hardest thing for a person to do when in a state of psychological distress is to bravely come to the doctor and spill the beans, so to speak—that is, to tell their story. Imagine the anxiety they would suffer to have tell that story over and over to a psychologist, then to a social worker, then to an occupational therapist and perhaps to a mental health nurse, to each of the team members administering the package of care. Effective care is coordinated care, but this proposal will leave us fragmented care, not coordinated care. The current system where GPs can refer patients to mental health social workers and occupational therapists in the community just works so well and has been hugely beneficial to thousands of Australians. Because the system is built into Medicare, it is easy to access by those people who represent the most marginalised in our community. No doubt there is a place for packages of care for people with a severe mental illness, but it should not be at the cost of the present system of Medicare rebates for people who are experiencing an episode of mental illness from which they will recover if treated.
A doctor in my electorate presented the following scenario to me. A 35-year-old woman living with three young children in a caravan on a bush block with a physically and financially abusive partner is hardly likely to want to be referred for a package of care with its associated paperwork, telephone calls and so on, which might alert a potentially violent partner to her cry for help. Under the current arrangement, when she comes to the GP with panic attacks and needing an exit strategy from her situation, this woman can get a Medicare rebate of $70.45, paying only a small gap, or even be bulk-billed by a caring local mental health social worker who agrees to see her quickly and discreetly after a phone call from her doctor. Under the proposed changes, this woman will no longer be able to pay the full fee to see a mental health social worker and will likely go without appropriate help. By contrast, however, a woman of the same age who wishes to fly to Paris with her company director husband, but who is prevented from doing so because of a phobia of flying, will still be able to access a rebate of $117.65 for seeing a clinical psychologist for the treatment of her phobia. Where is the justice in this?
I would also like to take this opportunity to acknowledge ‘Deb’ and ‘Geoff’, who had the strength and courage to attend my electorate office and to share their individual stories and experiences of being patients in the mental health system. It was a system, they tell me, that left them feeling extremely confused and vulnerable until the door was opened for them, and they came into contact with a mental health social worker. They both emphasised to me the importance of continuity of care. ‘Deb’ and ‘Geoff’ have exhausted their sick leave and advised me that, if the Medicare rebate were not available to them, they simply would not be able to afford any care or treatment at all. As a society, we cannot allow this to happen to people who are vulnerable and at risk. It simply is not good enough.
I have also spoken to David Hunnerup, a mental health social worker from the Blue Door counselling practice in Launceston. The Blue Door was a collaboration between two mental health social workers and one psychologist. Over a five-year period it was developed specifically to meet the needs of disadvantaged clients whose needs were not being met elsewhere. The business was built without government assistance and built, I might add, on a confidence that the government’s commitment to Medicare’s better access program would be stable. As David advised me, if this reversal goes ahead it will put practices like the Blue Door in jeopardy and could therefore put mental health social workers under considerable disadvantage, let alone the clients who walk through their door. So, again, I sincerely thank Minister Roxon for agreeing to delay these changes until April 2011 and to consult further. This is a good decision, and on behalf of the people I represent in Bass, I urge the minister not to remove Medicare rebates for social workers and occupational therapists who treat people with mental illness in our community under referral from their GPs. The current system works well and there are many doctors, therapists and most importantly ordinary Australians who are grateful for it.
As Australia is facing an ageing population, we have to make provisions for aged-care workers to have access to better training to improve their skills in the workforce. This investment benefits not only older Australians but also those who are looking for career opportunities in aged care as the funding will also go towards scholarships. The funding from this year’s budget will allow aged-care service providers to train and retain a level of expertise amongst workers. This will mean that Australians will receive the best aged care possible from trained and caring staff. From 1 January 2011, eligible parents—including full-time, part-time, seasonal, casual and self-employed workers—will have the financial assistance and security of the national minimum wage, currently $543.78 a week before tax.
Our first ever Paid Parental Leave scheme has been waited for with anticipation for some time by parents. The assistance with the balance of work and family responsibilities will take financial pressure off families and give them time to spend with their new child in those first impressionable weeks. Parents of children born or adopted on or after 1 January 2011 can claim leave of up to 18 weeks if their individual annual income is $150,000 or less. Our government is making its families and the future of Australia a priority whilst helping businesses maintain the skills of their employees for when they return to work. Parents will be able to stay connected to their place of work through Keeping in Touch provisions, which will help to retain jobs and skills.
This year’s budget provides relief for working Australians through a 50 per cent tax break for the first $1,000 of interest on savings and tax cuts for the third year in a row. From 1 July, individuals will be able to earn up to $16,000 without paying income tax due to increases in the low-income tax offset. This is just another way we are providing support for low-income earners trying to make ends meet. The compulsory employer contribution to employees’ superannuation will also be increased from nine per cent to 12 per cent by 2020, providing added financial security for people in retirement.
Further to this, from July 2012 it will be easier for individuals to lodge their tax returns with the new standard deduction option. When I talk to people in the Bass community about tax, what they want to see is a less complicated system in which everybody pays their fair share. This is a really important step towards a tick-and-flick system—a prefilled tax return—an idea that has been very popular with the residents of Bass. Soon you will be able to forget about the hassle of having shoeboxes full of receipts and the costs of getting your taxes done at the end of each year. These reforms will make a real difference for the people I represent. From 1 July 2012, the government will give people the option of choosing a standard deduction of $500 instead of claiming work related expenses. This standard deduction will be increased to $1,000 from 1 July 2013.
I am proud to be a member of a government that is determined to make lasting reforms in tax that make the system fairer and simpler while building a stronger economy for the Bass community. Small businesses will also benefit, being able to instantly deduct the cost of assets up to $5,000. I know this is welcome news for the 7,863 small businesses in my electorate of Bass, many of which will also benefit from a reduction in the company tax rate. It is great to see the important role of small business in our economy recognised, as these businesses kept many people in work during the global recession.
Measures in this year’s budget will invest in the skills we need for our future economy, taking action to increase training place apprenticeships: $243 million over the next four years is going towards the transformation of our vocational education and training system This is part of the $660 million Skills for Sustainable Growth package. The measures that make up this package will improve access to training opportunities, giving more Australians the opportunity to undertake training, including high-level qualifications to advance their careers. We are also working with the states and territories to improve the performance of our largest VET providers, providing performance based funding in order to better the outcomes of our students.
We will also be introducing the National Entitlement to a Quality Training Place, which will guarantee an entitlement to a place for all Australians under 25 in any training course above their current highest qualifications and for which they meet the prerequisites. In addition, the Commonwealth is investing $53.6 million over four years to expand VET FEE-HELP, providing greater access to these loans, meaning that more than 477,000 people will be able to access a loan to help support them with their studies. This new package builds on the government’s previous initiatives to support the VET sector and brings the overall spending on VET for the government’s first four years in office to $15.8 billion from 2008-12, in contrast to the $9.5 billion in the past four years of the previous government.
This government is committed to making sure that all Australians have access to quality education and training opportunities so that they are able to build their skills and improve their employment outcomes. Apprenticeship training is also important to building a stronger economy, and the budget has seen a further investment of almost $80 million to extend the Apprentice Kickstart initiative. This initiative, which more than triples the commencement bonus for employers of traditional trades apprentices in the first year from $1,500 to $4,850, has been a resounding success. Apprentice Kickstart boosted the numbers of traditional trade apprenticeships above pre-global recession levels in just one year. Last summer in Bass, we helped 124 apprentices get started in a new career. This new funding will be targeted to help small and medium sized businesses to put on more apprentices and will support around another 22,500 apprenticeship places across the country in traditional trades that are experiencing skills shortages.
The economic downturn was damaging to apprenticeships but, thanks to the Apprentice Kickstart initiative and the support of employers and young people, we have seen a boost in the number of apprenticeships. I have received many emails of gratitude from constituents in Bass for the government’s budget commitment to increasing Australia’s Official Development Assistance to 0.5 per cent of gross national income by 2015-16. There is both wide support for the government’s position in Bass and confusion and disappointment with the opposition’s proposing a $300 million cut to foreign aid.
The Rudd government is committed to giving our youth opportunities to express their concerns for the poor and to act responsibly as a global citizen. I have recently been involved with young local activists in Bass who are raising awareness of the Millennium Development Goals. One such young lady is Laura Sykes, who is a student at Launceston College and has been heavily involved with the recent Make Poverty History road trip, organising concerts and petitioning the Launceston Council to become fair trade certified. Young Australians in Bass understand global poverty and have clear ideas about what should be done and what can be done. The Rudd government is harnessing this energy and enthusiasm and building on it for the future.
The people of Bass are pleased to hear that Australia is investing, over four years, $303.7 million in education programs and $173.4 million to improve health services for the poor in developing countries. The Bass electorate confirms its support for Australia being an active and responsible citizen in our global community. There is broad and enthusiastic support for the government to continue its commitment to reduce carbon pollution and tackle climate change. For this to occur, Australia must be wise and resolute in transitioning to a low-pollution economy prior to the commencement of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme.
The government will invest $652.5 million dollars to establish a Renewable Energy Future Fund to support renewable energy projects such as solar, wind, geothermal and wave energy. The fund will also help households save on power bills through energy efficiency measures.
The Local Sporting Champions fund has doubled, with an increase in the 2010-11 budget to $3.17 million, which means that budding sports stars in Bass will have double the chance of receiving funding. Up to $25,000 is available for younger athletes wanting to compete in state and national events. In Bass this means that 26 individuals and four teams will now receive the grant. The program has been popular for young athletes in Bass since it was launched in 2008. We need to invest in our sporting champions; some of our kids in Bass could be our next Olympians, Paralympians, tennis stars, football or netball professionals.
It is the best ideas that are producing the best outcomes for Australia’s future. These ideas are informing policy which is building our future. This is an economically responsible budget, which targets investment where it is needed—in family budgets around the country, by reducing tax, boosting superannuation and simplifying tax returns. The Rudd government is optimistic about Australia’s future. Our nation has led the world in getting through the global recession and we are preparing Australia for the challenges of the future. The strong position of the nation’s economy means that the people of Bass will be better positioned for the opportunities of the future. I commend the bills to the House.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2010-2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2010-05-24,"—In speaking on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011 and related bills this evening I declare that this budget is based on a wing and a prayer. It is a budget designed to wreck Australia’s outstanding resources sector. The Rudd government is relying on a $9 billion tax on the resources sector to put the budget into the black, even if only by a whisker. It is a tax grab that risks sending half a million Australian jobs, foreign and local investment offshore. And it is a tax on the so-called working families.
Labor’s economic credentials are historically dubious. The facts speak for themselves. They are currently borrowing $700 million a week—or, in other words, $100 million a day—to cove their reckless spending. This is because of a $1 billion blow-out on fixing a quarter of a million dodgy roofs from the tragic pink batts fiasco and $1 billion to manage the illegal immigration influx. They are spending to fix policy failures and learners’ mistakes, all completely of their own doing.
Next financial year interest on net government debt will be $4.6 billion and by 2012-13 the government will be spending $6.5 billion a year on interest payments alone. In just three short years Labor have proven what this country has always known to be true about Labor governments: they are big taxing and big spending. They have spent and sent ordinary Australians into a $93 billion debt. It took a decade of tough decisions and sound economic management by the coalition government to pay off Labor’s $96 billion debt. Mr Rudd has put Australia back there again in record time. In other words, after 13 years of Labor there was a $96 billion debt and Mr Rudd has taken two years to send us into that same $90 billion figure.
This election is now a referendum on the mining industry.
—What a load of rubbish!
 (Mr AJ Schultz)—Order!
—Labor want to penalise the one sector that kept this country out of recession. They want to steal from the coffers of companies—
—Steal from the coffers of companies? Get a brain!
—Order! The member for Canning has the call and the minister will remain silent.
—that are creating jobs, supporting local towns and bringing huge investment into Australia. The flow-on effects are endless. After keeping the country waiting with bated breath to see the Henry review, the government has all but done away with its 138 recommendations, accepting only 2½ of them, rejecting 27 and shelving the rest. There was no 40 per cent resources tax proposed in the Henry review. What Ken Henry proposed was to make the tax system simpler. Instead of wading through the current raft of almost 100 taxes to consolidate and eliminate them, the government has just added another massive one on a massive industry.
As a proud Western Australian I see firsthand every day the benefits the mining and resources sector has on the entire state. Every job in mining and resources supports at least four others in other industries like hospitality, aviation, accounting and many more. If we are honest, it is clear that the Prime Minister has given up on Western Australia. Why wouldn’t he? Electorally there is little for Labor to gain in WA and by introducing this massive tax the Prime Minister is sending a clear message that Western Australia is just not worth it. He is happy to take but not give back—take Western Australian money, strip jobs and take security away from Western Australian workers. There are thousands of fly-in fly-out workers in Canning, not to mention those working locally for Alcoa, Boddington Gold and Worsley Alumina. In March 2007, 29,000 people were registered on AWAs in Canning, the second-highest number in the country. Conservatively, you can estimate that the resource industry supports more than 10,000 Canning workers and their families.
More than 500 mining and petroleum projects in WA will be affected by this resources tax. Let us not forget that Labor have already made such a grab. In their first budget the Rudd government hit Western Australia with a massive $2.5 billion additional tax on our North West Shelf gas project as part of a $20 billion increase in federal taxes and charges. The Wall Street Journal summed up the lack of logic behind super tax when it said, ‘This economic thinking runs counter to everything that made Australia rich.’
This tax risks upwards of $100 billion in planned minerals projects. Minerals production is a competitive business, with Australia only contributing to 10 per cent of global exports. If it becomes too expensive to do business here, investors will take their money offshore. The impact is not short-term; it would damage the Australian economy for decades. Gina Rinehart has said ‘Australia does not have a monopoly on minerals and must compete for funds to develop its projects.’ It is a no-brainer. Australia has only about three per cent of the world’s natural gas reserves, but our advantage is that the industry is established, infrastructure is in place and the investment has been there to back it. We need to make the most of it before countries like Russia and those in the Middle East, which have around half of the world’s reserves, come on stream to be really competitive. Iron ore production accounts for 44 per cent of the world’s minerals and petroleum output and is increasing by up to 15 per cent a year. Western Australia alone accounts for almost 20 per cent of global output and 97 per cent of Australia’s, which comes from the Pilbara. It is a huge industry, supporting 25,000-plus jobs, that this tax could see become stagnant.
Over the last decade mining companies have paid $80 billion in royalties and company tax, making up a solid eight per cent of the economy. The industry pays its fair share of tax—18 per cent of the nation’s tax revenue. Mr Rudd wants to make the Australian resources industry the highest taxed in the world at approximately 58 per cent. Estimates today show that some companies could be paying anywhere from 50 to 75 per cent.
To put this in perspective, these rates apply in other countries with big mining operations. For example, this graph shows quite clearly that the US currently taxes at 40 per cent; Brazil taxes at the same rate as Australia does presently, at 38 per cent, and we know that we compete with Brazil to sell iron ore to Asia, particularly China; in South Africa it is 38 per cent; Peru, 32 per cent; China, 30 per cent; and Chile, 26 per cent. Of course the Canadians are absolutely rapt, because their tax on the mining sector is only 23 per cent. To make it clear, I have been fortunate enough to be in Chile, where BHP has the largest copper mine in the world, Escondida. Chile’s resource tax is 26 per cent, and BHP CEO Marius Kloppers said, about the risk:
If you pay twice the tax in one country that you pay in another for the same product, then relatively speaking that other country will become more attractive.
It is very simple. I doubt anyone would argue with that.
Together with my Western Australian colleagues I have met industry leaders, and key principles have been proposed as to how to make mineral resources tax reform fair. Let me make the point that we are willing to sit down and listen. There was certainly no industry consultation prior to the tax announcement, and now they still do not want to talk about it. The richest man in the country, Fortescue’s Andrew Forrest, cannot even get the Prime Minister or the Treasurer to return his phone calls, when previously they were all over him like a rash. Industry is willing to negotiate. It suggests a tax should apply to new investments only, with a focus on keeping the sector competitive on a global scale, not retrospective, as proposed now. The tax rate should vary according to the mineral, because the profit margins differ, and it should also apply to the mineral itself and not other activities that are already subject to company tax.
These are crucial issues. For example, we have seen the Labor minister out there peddling the spin that projects like Gorgon, which is home to 40 trillion cubic feet of natural gas, is at roughly the same tax rate as it would be with the super tax—the petroleum rent resources tax. As Paul Murray, a journalist in the West Australian, rightly pointed out in the newspaper, this is just a blatant lie. Gorgon partners will pay an extra five per cent in tax because the petroleum rent resources tax only kicks in when profits reach the government bond rate plus five per cent. When we are talking about a $40 billion investment, five per cent is a massive amount of money.
So what have been the effects to date? There is complete market uncertainty—the share market fell to a nine-month low last week. Fortescue Metals have shelved the $17.8 billion expansion of their Pilbara operation, potentially costing upwards of 30,000 jobs. Consumer confidence has fallen by seven per cent in the last month. The real estate agency Satterley has warned that the tax will add an extra $20,000 to the cost of building a new home, pushing first home buyers out of the market, because, as you know, anything quarried or mined will become dearer. It has risked the sale of Griffin Coal in Western Australia. It has risked the $20 billion expansion of Olympic Dam. Mineralogy’s Clive Palmer has slashed exploration in South Australia and put his Pilbara iron ore project on hold. It has risked Santos’s investment and 5,000 jobs at the Gladstone LNG project, and Xstrata Copper’s $30 billion exploration program in North Queensland has been suspended. But you will not hear any criticism or critical analysis in the West Australian newspaper from the left-wing economics commentator and journalist Shane Wright. At least I am standing up for Western Australia, Shane.
The ramifications do not stop there. Superannuants who were hit by the bank guarantee are now bleeding money, with most super funds investing in the resources sector. Almost 10 per cent of Australian superannuation is invested in minerals and mining stocks. Funds are taking a massive hit because of shares prices losing $6 billion following this announcement. The Prime Minister’s veiled attempt to link the great big new resource tax with Labor’s three per cent increase in superannuation from nine to 12 per cent—against the recommendations of the Henry review—is just spin, because we know that businesses pay superannuation, not governments. In fact, small businesses in particular will be paying the nine to 12 per cent increase and it will not click in for years, whereas this tax comes immediately and small business just cannot afford it. So to say that government is doing this to pay superannuation, particularly on the eastern seaboard, is just a blatant untruth. Essentially, the government has just passed on another cost to Australia businesses at a time when they are doing it tough with rising interest rates and low consumer confidence.
In another anti Western Australian move, Labor will short-change the state on GST revenue. In the GST carve-up, Western Australia will collect only 68c of every dollar spent on the GST compared to Victoria’s 93c and New South Wales’s 95c. Despite being home to 10.3 per cent of Australia’s population and producing more than 13 per cent of gross domestic product, WA will collect only 7.1 per cent of GST. The reduction will cost $443 million in revenue—in other words, $200 for every Western Australian man, woman and child. If WA received GST per capita, it would be $1.5 billion better off.
WA’s share of the GST revenue has continually declined in recent years, despite the state being credited with keeping Australia out of the worst of the global financial crisis. You might have noticed, Mr Deputy Speaker Sidebottom, that last week the Western Australian state budget had a surplus of $280 million. I suspect it is the only state government in Australia with a surplus. That has a lot to do with the resources sector and the fact that it is managed in a proper way in Western Australia. Yet this is what Labor would do to that industry in our state.
We hear that oft-quoted, xenophobic line that these foreign companies are taking all this money overseas. Xstrata explained recently that, as a totally international company, since they have been in Australia they have earned $44 billion yet they have spent $45 billion. In other words, everything stayed in Australia and more went on exploration. We hear about minerals belonging to all Australians. Sorry, but you pay royalties to a state government because they are state owned resources. So they belong to each particular state.
When the GST came into effect on 1 July 2000, Western Australia received 9.7 per cent. It only gets 7.1 per cent now. Throughout that time we heard state Labor crying foul at the Howard government about not getting its fair share of the GST. You wonder where that candidate who was running against me is now. That candidate was saying, ‘We’re not getting our fair share from Canberra.’ Now, under federal Labor, Western Australia is getting far less than it did before. The position is getting worse. As I said, all Western Australians know about the tax grab by Canberra.
The truth is that during the coalition’s time in government WA’s share of GST rose as high as 10.3 per cent in 2004-05. For the 2006-07 financial year, just before Mr Rudd was elected, Western Australia was receiving 10 per cent. So the bottom line is that since federal Labor was elected Western Australia’s share of the GST has fallen by almost three per cent to 7.1 per cent. One has to wonder if it has anything to do with the fact that we now have a Liberal state government in Western Australia, with Premier Barnett sitting at the COAG table.
We know that the government makes monetary policy on the run, which costs valuable projects and programs. My attention has been drawn to the funding arrangements for the 2009-10 round of the Grants to Voluntary Environment and Heritage Organisations. These grants help fund real, on-the-ground outcomes. But because the Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts is reviewing guidelines—or, more likely, busy rectifying the pink batt and solar panel fiascos—the minister is simply going to award funding under the program for 2009-10 based on the grant payments for the 2008-09 financial year. Is this really fair?
Canning residents are getting ripped off in more ways than one. The distribution of funds under the government’s area consultative committees replacement, Regional Development Australia, indicates more discrimination against WA. Western Australia has nine RDA committees, one of which is in Peel, in my electorate. Over the 2.3 years to 30 June 2012, those nine committees will share in $3.8 million, or an average of $278, 649 per committee each year. Peel will receive $208,000 each year until 2012, which not only is below the average but represents a fall of 20 per cent.
Thousands of Canning residents are still waiting for their promised high-speed fibre-to-the-node broadband. The NBN is just a pipedream. In this budget the government has committed $16 million—which it cut from the Australian Broadband Guarantee, by the way—to advertising a scheme that does not exist, while Canning families remain reliant on slow, dial-up connections that are no longer capable of meeting the household’s needs.
I speak often in this chamber about Canning’s priorities. To put these in perspective, the $1 billion wasted on the pink batts, split evenly across every electorate in the country, would offer many communities the chance to get some real outcomes on the map. For example, in Mandurah, under its city strategy for 2010-14, that money could have provided for the major upgrade of Pinjarra Road to dual carriageway, estimated to cost $9 million. It could have funded the Sutton Street upgrade, worth $2.5 million, and built the sporting oval at Ocean Road Primary School for $700,000. It could have put $13 million towards a new pool and leisure area at the Mandurah aquatic facility and constructed joint community facilities at the Mandurah Bowling Club for $8 million. The population of the city has doubled in the last 15 years and is expected to grow by three per cent each year over the next four years.
In Armadale, investment is sought for the world-class White Water Park at Champion Lakes, which is being championed by Colin Thorpe and his associates in Canoeing WA. Investment is also needed in the upgrading of Armadale Road to dual carriageway, extending the Tonkin Highway to the growing communities of Byford and Mundijong, and building more community facilities like playgrounds and halls in the growing suburbs of Harrisdale and Piara Waters. The Pinjarra Bypass remains a priority, as do upgrades to the Pinjarra Bowling Club and construction of a community hall in Preston Beach. The area always needs more environmental funding to manage waterways and to implement the Landcare projects around Waroona and the Peel Harvey Estuary. The Rudd government has stripped away the funding for the Peel Harvey Catchment Council, which is an absolute disgrace and puts in tatters its green credentials.
A coalition government that has a proven record in sound economic management is far better placed to deliver. Governments that rack up huge debts leave communities going without—or those communities end up paying those debts for generations. What Mr Rudd is doing to this country is racking up intergenerational debt. If you believe that he is going to pay it off within three years, you would have to say you believe in the tooth fairy. The previous Labor government, for the whole of their existence, could never bring in a balanced budget. They could never, ever pay off their government debt. As was stated previously, it took a coalition government’s prudent and wise management to pay off the debt. Then we put money into the Future Fund, to save it for future generations, and into an education endowment fund and had a surplus.
What has happened? The incoming Rudd Labor government have raided all those, bar the Future Fund. Mind you, they have said that that would be an ideal place from which to take $46 billion for the NBN rollout. That was going to be delivered within the term of this government. We have not seen it delivered at all. In fact, they still have not selected anyone to do the job. There is a bit of work being done in Deputy Speaker Sidebottom’s state. Tasmania seems to always have a special place in the rollout of these things. Remember Senator Harradine and the leverage that he seemed to have.
The Labor government’s misjudged priorities in economic management risk the prosperity of our nation and its people for generations. I will be very interested to hear the member for Hasluck standing up for WA when she delivers her speech on this issue shortly. This is not a bill that we can be proud of, because it puts us into debt. It is a referendum on our resources industry, particularly on its effect on Western Australia.
 (Mr S Sidebottom)—Thank you for your contribution and your very kind words about Tasmania.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2010-2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Jackson, Sharryn, MP",ALP,2010-05-24,"—I am pleased to be able to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011 and cognate bills tonight. I would like to commence by congratulating the Treasurer on this budget, which I believe will further strengthen and secure our economy. It is clear that, with responsible management, the government will halve peak debt and get the budget back in the black in three years, which is three years early. As I said, this is a responsible budget. It helps families and it helps to secure future growth. I think that it is appropriate to credit our ministers for the way in which they took decisive action to keep the economy strong and protect jobs during the global financial crisis. Now we see that same decisive action in place, bringing our economy back into surplus.
I wanted to talk tonight about some of the issues in these appropriation bills that are specific to Western Australia and to my own seat of Hasluck. In particular I note the substantial contribution in the budget towards national health and hospitals reform, something that I think is long overdue in this country. It is a very significant package of measures to ensure that there is national funding and local management of our national health and hospital system. To that extent, I urge the Western Australian government and the Premier in particular to continue to be involved in discussions with the Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, and the Prime Minister to try and ensure that Western Australia’s health system also receives the benefit of the national health and hospitals reform.
I feel this very personally in my electorate because in the last budget the federal government made a substantial commitment, $180.1 million, towards the new Midland Health Campus in my electorate, a replacement hospital for the Swan Districts Hospital which is already operating beyond capacity. It was identified in the Reid review, a local review, that this hospital was urgently required. That review was undertaken in 2007, and initially commitments were made, including by the current Western Australian state Liberal government, that construction of the new Midland Health Campus would be completed by November 2013. I am sad to say that, as I speak, following the Western Australian budget last week, there is little money from the state government committed in the forward estimates towards the project, and we have been advised that the earliest the hospital might be completed is mid-2015 and more likely mid-2016. So we have a substantial area in my electorate in Perth which has already been found by appropriate experts to be desperately in need of new and upgraded health facilities; but, sadly, that project has now been further delayed by some three years. I take this opportunity to urge the Western Australian government to get real on the question of health and hospital funding and also to stop ignoring the health needs of my community, particularly in the Swan region.
While I am on health, can I congratulate the federal government on its decision to increase funding for GP superclinics and perhaps put the minister on notice of my intention to seek funding for the southern end of my electorate. The City of Gosnells is an area where there is a substantial amount of unmet need in terms of GP services, and I know that the establishment of a GP superclinic in that part of my electorate would be gratefully received. I can assure my constituents that I will be knocking on the minister’s door with that very proposal.
I also congratulate the government on the new national men’s health strategy. I was incredibly pleased to see this strategy released. Can I say how pleased I was with the additional funding that was announced as part of that policy for the funding of the Australian Men’s Shed Association. As I talk on this point, I am grateful to Eddy from the Kalamunda Men’s Shed, who has brought it to my attention. It is something that has been gratefully received in that area and I can only commend the minister for these wonderful initiatives. In the area of social networking and support for men, particularly in retirement, the Men’s Shed has been an outstanding success. I look forward to joining with the members of the Kalamunda Men’s Shed in July to celebrate their first year of operation.
I also acknowledge the Richmond Fellowship in my electorate of Hasluck, which received a boost of some $1.29 million to help local families with mental illnesses and particularly to continue their intensive one-on-one support services in the Midland-Guildford area of my electorate. This funding was part of the extensions to the Personal Helpers and Mentors Program. I know the Richmond Fellowship of WA provide a very good service and I am delighted that they have been the recipients of that additional funding.
In the area of education, I was pleased last week to meet with a number of my local P&C associations. I was keen to get their feedback on their Building the Education Revolution funding and on other education reforms, including the establishment of the My School website. I have to say that, generally speaking, the funding and the reforms have been greeted with much applause by parents and in many cases they are enjoying new facilities and buildings in their schools. I would note, given the comments of the member for Canning—about the small surplus that the Western Australian state government have managed to achieve in their budget—that as part of their funding announcements for education capital works they skilfully included some $425 million of Commonwealth funding that they currently hold for final BER projects. I would urge the state government to hurry up and ensure that those final rounds of project funds are released so that those schools that receive funding in the second and third rounds can proceed with their projects.
I also congratulate the government on the boost to skills training in my electorate and throughout the whole of Australia. It is particularly relevant in a state like mine where there has been significant skills shortage in the recent past. The impact of the almost $80 million that they have invested to extend the Apprentice Kickstart initiative will be to triple the commencement bonus for employers of traditional trade apprentices. It means that in my electorate we will see a substantial number of new apprentices. We are hoping to see some 306 local apprentices get a start this coming year. I look forward to that. I can say that, from the last round, we saw some 235 apprentices commence in Hasluck and I am pleased to see this additional funding going in that direction.
Today in question time some members may have heard me ask a question of the Minister for Housing regarding the rollout of housing programs in my state of Western Australia. I could not resist raising them again because the government’s programs have been an outstanding success in my state. Minister Plibersek should be congratulated for the management and rollout of those projects. In Western Australia alone some 28,800 first home buyers received the benefit of the first home owner boost. In addition, something like 170 new homes have been contributed to in my electorate, 20 homes built in the first two rounds of the National Rental Affordability Scheme in places like Gosnells and Midland and 53 homes built through the new stimulus package. Right now there are some 47 sites right across Western Australia with more than 1,100 new homes for Western Australians under way. In my seat alone, we have seen some 243 new rental homes. I was delighted when the minister met with me in Hasluck to visit the site of a project for 16 new affordable housing units for seniors in the city of Gosnells. We were hosted by Gold Style Homes Pty Ltd, a local building company that had been successful in picking up that particular contract. I look forward to the minister visiting again when those new units are available for seniors to move in to. The city of Gosnells has also received over $1 million from the Housing Affordability Fund and 100 homebuyers will receive a discount of around $11,000 each on their homes. That is, as the minister indicated, a massive investment in housing in Western Australia and I thank her very much for that.
I also acknowledge the increases that have been proposed in the budget to the Local Sporting Champions program. I am very pleased to see an almost doubling of the number of grants to individuals and teams available in my electorate. This has been a valuable initiative. I am sure, Mr Deputy Speaker Sidebottom, you would be familiar with this: the number of requests for funding assistance far outweighs the funding that is available. We all try to do our best to support our local sporting champions. I was also very pleased with how the Australian Sporting Commission’s program has been going in my electorate—the Active After-school Communities program. I was very pleased to visit the Southern River Hockey Club during the last school holidays to participate in their local program, and to see literally a hundred kids of varying ages between five and 12 running around the hockey field was a great thing. While I am on my local sporting clubs, I could not possibly let the time go by without referring to the Gosnells footy club centenary. I hope to be a very active participant in their celebrations this year. I say to all involved with the club: congratulations on your hard work and I hope the centenary celebrations go well. Go Gozzy Hawks for this year’s football competition.
In the time I have left I would like to touch on infrastructure programs within my electorate. I am pleased to say that finally we have seen the funding approved for the upgrade of the Great Eastern Highway-Roe Highway interchange. This is an amazingly busy interchange of two very important highways—the Great Eastern Highway being the main arterial road to everything east and Roe Highway joins the Great Northern Highway being the major arterial road to the north. This is one of the busiest intersections in Western Australia with 168,000 vehicle movements. The upgrade of this intersection is well overdue. I am pleased to see that money has finally been set aside in both state and federal government budgets to ensure that this project proceeds. Having said that, I reassure those businesses in the Midvale industrial area that I have not forgotten or overlooked your concerns about access to the industrial area and I can assure you that we are certainly lobbying both state and local governments—the Shire of Mundaring—to see if we cannot overcome those issues.
On road funding, I note there has been an increase in the allocation to local councils for Roads to Recovery and for the Black Spot Program. I place on the record that I will be knocking on the door of the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government, Mr Albanese, to say that I hope some of these funds get spent on Kalamunda Road, which is in urgent need of an upgrade. It is often overlooked, despite its proximity to Perth airport and its proximity to the brickworks that were established on Perth airport land by the previous government. Traffic continues to be a major issue in that area and I hope that funding will be directed towards that particular problem.
I am delighted and can inform the House that construction has started on the Kalamunda Community Cultural Centre. It is a project that was funded under the Regional Community Local Infrastructure Program and work also continues on the Swan Regional Riverside Park, also a beneficiary of that particular program.
It is important to acknowledge that the budget also included the third round of tax cuts that were promised by the Rudd government on its election. I am pleased that will tackle, at least in part, some of the pressure households are feeling with cost of living adjustments. I was most concerned—and I have previously raised this in the parliament—that Western Australians were being slugged on household fees and charges following last year’s budget and I am sad to say that again this year the Liberal state government have chosen to slug households. Electricity went up by around 23 to 25 per cent last year and is going up by a further 17 per cent this year, which is some $194 for each household. Water is up by 17 per cent, an additional $122.50. Public transport has been put up. Car licence fees have been put up. The emergency services levy has been put up. The price of gas has been put up. A conservative figure—and I say ‘conservative’ because this is what the Liberal state government itself estimates—for the impact on most households is around $367.60 per year. I make the point that, in contrast, Colin Barnett seems to have been incredibly passionate in defending big miners in the state of Western Australia. As an article in the West comments: ‘If only he had shown the same passion for protecting Western Australian families.’ To be fair to the West, I think that is a quote of the opposition leader, Eric Ripper. But I am grateful to see those tax cuts included in this year’s budget and I am sure that will make a difference to some households.
While we are talking about tax cuts, it is appropriate to acknowledge the improvements for small business. The company tax cut is for both big and large business but, in addition to that, there is the tax break for small business where sole traders, partnerships and incorporated small businesses will be able to instantly deduct the cost of assets valued at up to $5,000 in the year of their purchase. I think this is a terrific initiative. It will mean less red tape as they will no longer need to apply different depreciation schedules to assets. Every one of the 7,245 small businesses in Hasluck will get a tax break under the Rudd government’s proposal.
Time will not permit me today to talk at length about the resource super profits tax, but I could not possibly let the comments of the member for Canning pass without making some comment in reply. The package as a whole that has been put forward by the Rudd government will be judged ultimately by Western Australians on its merits and not on the basis of claims that have been made by some in their fear campaigns. The package as a whole includes refundable tax credits for royalties paid, staged reductions in company tax and the resource exploration rebate, which will benefit small to medium explorers and mining companies. I acknowledge that companies take into account a range of matters in determining where they make their investments. Tax is one part of an investment decision. So is, for example, political stability and good economic circumstances—measures on which I believe Australia leads the world. And, notwithstanding these proposed tax changes, Western Australia remains a very attractive place for capital investment.
As people have said, profit based taxes are not new in the Australian context and we already have a similar tax that applies to the petroleum resources industry—a tax that I acknowledge has a different impact level, but one that at 40 per cent has not seen a downturn in that industry. On the contrary, some of the biggest projects in Australian history have commenced under that regime, which has been in place for 20 years. It is also fair to say that not all Western Australians had an equal share in the last mining boom. I am pleased to see the benefits of this new taxing regime will actually see significant investment in infrastructure in Western Australia—infrastructure necessary to support the resource industry.

",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 1) 2010-2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Briggs, Jamie, MP",LP,2010-05-24,"—I rise to speak this evening on the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011 in conjunction with the other appropriation bills before this place. In doing so I make the point that this budget highlights that you just cannot trust Labor with the nation’s finances. It quite clearly is the third consecutive budget where the Rudd government has failed to deliver a well thought through budget that will help set Australia up for the future. Instead, we see another big deficit to follow the previous one, which was a record deficit in our history. This year we have an even bigger budget based on tax increases and featuring the introduction of a great big new tax on mining, which the previous speaker, the member for Hasluck, unfortunately did not have enough time to continue making remarks on. I am sure she would have enjoyed spending another 20 minutes or so talking about the benefits to Western Australia of this great big new tax on mining, as so many other Western Australians on this side of the House have already highlighted!
Labor’s major political claim in this Rudd budget is that it will deliver a surplus in three years time. Labor has not delivered a surplus since it has been in government, but it expects us to believe that in three years time, with no additional spending programs and with no additional programs blowing out, it will deliver a $1 billion surplus. That is a rounding error, as far as the federal budget is concerned. Coincidentally, $1 billion is the figure for the blow-out in the computers in schools program and is equal to the blow-out in the insulation program, so those on the other side tend to like that $1 billion figure.
You cannot believe Labor or trust Labor when they say they will deliver a surplus in three years time because, if you look at what they have done since they have been in government, everything points in the opposite direction. The claim is based on very optimistic assumptions in the budget, including a compounding 20 per cent growth in the industry on which they have decided to whack a great big new tax of 40 per cent. That will, of course, reduce investment. But in Labor’s books, if you tax it more, they will come. On the one hand, if you tax the cigarette industry more, that will reduce the number of people taking up smoking; on the other hand, if you tax the mining industry more, people will be rushing to invest. That does not make sense, nor do Labor’s optimistic budget assumptions.
This government has spent Australia into massive debt. We will have net debt of nearly $100 billion by 2013, which is around the same level of debt we found in 1996 when we took government and around the same level of debt we will have to face if we are successfully elected to government, which I believe we will be in three or so months time. This financial year will deliver the biggest budget deficit in Australia’s history and the next will not be far short of it. This will reduce the ability of the government to fund worthy programs into the future. It will put additional pressure on interest rates, and we are already seeing that in the Australian economy today.
You just cannot trust the Rudd Labor government with the economy and you certainly cannot trust them to implement a program. Let us have a look at the litany of waste and mismanagement of this government. Today we saw in the galleries around us workers from the insulation industry who are now out of work. These small business people some months ago had an opportunity and a future. Their dreams were destroyed by those on the other side. I know that the member for Longman is distraught at the prospect that these insulation small businesses face. It is going to cost the Commonwealth $1 billion to clean up the mess it created when spending around $500 million in that program. That is quite an extraordinary feat, even for those on the other side.
We saw another $1 billion blow-out in the computers in schools program. Again there was a complete failure in implementing the government’s policy. We have seen a $39 billion blow-out in the initial promise on the NBN, a program I suspect will never see the light of day. It was a good political promise, and that was all it was ever intended to be in 2007. We have seen over $600 million in consultancy fees. Of course, we have the mother of all blow-outs—the Building the Education Revolution or, as the member for Sturt unkindly puts it, the memorial school hall program.
In the electorate of Mayo we have seen some very clear and good examples—sad examples, unfortunately—of BER mismanagement. We raised the first one in parliament with the Deputy Prime Minister last year. Of course she just brushes these off—there are no problems at all; there is no waste and mismanagement in the system; everything is going swimmingly. The first one was on Kangaroo Island. Some $100,000 was spent on architectural fees for a drawing that already existed.
I notice that the Deputy Prime Minister has been busily working with her colleagues in recent days. She was so keen to deny she had any interest in the leadership last week that she was in the media by 9.30 in the morning making sure there was lots of camera footage of her denying that she was interested in the leadership. In the same week she popped up on the Sunday program. When interviewed by Laurie Oakes she also denied she was interested in the leadership.
I raised with her last year the Eastern Fleurieu School, which has been treated terribly by both the federal Labor government and the state Labor government. The state government said it is a multicampus school. When the schools were first combined in the late 1990s the state government gave them an assurance they would be treated as single schools; however, when it came to this program they were treated as one school, so they missed out on about $2 million. That is a very good example of the inability of this government to implement a program properly and, therefore, fairly.
We saw issues with water tanks at the Yankalilla Area School, the Macclesfield school, the Basket Range Primary School, the Stirling East Primary School and the Eden Hills Primary School, which is just out of my electorate. This is the greatest example of state government cost-shifting we have seen—something the Deputy Prime Minister and the Prime Minister both said very clearly could not happen under this program and would not be accepted under this program. The Deputy Prime Minister said they would crack down on it and there would be severe penalties. She said she would not allow state governments to cost-shift. Yet she was strangely quiet when contacted about this issue.
It seems in this case it is okay for the state government to cost-shift. The Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission last year recommended that schools have appropriate levels of bushfire protection. Everyone supports that. My electorate of Mayo, which is in the Adelaide Hills and on the Fleurieu Peninsula, is a high-risk bushfire zone; therefore, most of the schools are caught up in that respect. The state government wants these schools to have bushfire water tanks. The problem here is that that is a state government requirement and they are forcing BER funding to be used for this and therefore reducing quite significantly—up to $100,000 in most cases—the amount they have for their school buildings.
The Deputy Prime Minister promised she would say to her state colleagues—Jay Weatherill is the new SA education minister: ‘This is not good enough. I said this could not happen. We told you when we first announced this program that you were not to cost-shift and were not to take what should be state government spending and put it on this federal program.’ Instead, she has let her Labor mates get away with ripping off these schools and taking away their entitlements.
We will hear much more about this because there are angry mums and we all know what dealing with angry mums is like. Five mums are the chairpersons of these schools and they are extremely angry. They will continue to give both this federal Labor government and their state Labor colleagues in South Australia a hard time about this. I am sure the Minister for Early Childhood Education, Childcare and Youth and Minister for Sport, who is at the table, would understand the difficulty of dealing with angry mums when it comes to these sorts of issues. This issue is a very good example of how this program has been so badly implemented by this government.
This litany of waste and mismanagement will cost the Australian people for future generations. When the stimulus package was first put to this parliament we said it was too big and too fast. There ended up being a quarter of negative growth, which we hit with $100 billion of debt, which will dog generations to come. It was too much too soon and that is why we at the time opposed it—and we were right to do so. The Rudd Labor government have a record of waste and mismanagement and misunderstanding the economy. They ask us to believe them when they say that sometime in 2013 they are going to deliver a surplus budget. It is simply unbelievable. You just cannot trust the government to deliver on their promises. We will see that yet again with these rubbery budget figures.
In dealing with this government and its budget promises, a particular issue has been glossed over a little in the last few weeks with the avalanche of backdowns on policy issues. It was hard to keep up. You had the greatest moral challenge of our time junked, you had the insulation program junked, and who could forget the childcare centre promise—that key election promise from last year? I am sure the Minister for Early Childhood Education, Childcare and Youth tossed and turned at night in working out the language she would have to use to junk that program—another key election promise that they just crab-crawled away from.
Another one that I think highlights very much the superficial, fraudulent nature of this government was the advertising promise that it made in no uncertain terms before the last election. Thankfully, I have some of the remarks that the Prime Minister made about government advertising prior to the last election. Mr Deputy Speaker, you may remember the key promise of the then Rudd opposition was to have the Auditor-General vet all government advertising so none of it could go to air without the Auditor-General giving his tick off. That was the promise. In fact, some of the rhetoric that the now Prime Minister used to describe government advertising was as ‘a long-term cancer on our democracy’. ‘I believe this is a sick cancer within our system; it is a cancer on democracy,’ he told The 7.30 Report on 9 October 2007. In 2008, when he was elected, he implemented a role for the Auditor-General in looking at government advertising. The Auditor-General did not have vetting power but he had the ability to report that an advertising campaign complied or did not comply with the guidelines that had been laid down. We expressed concern at the time about the position the Auditor-General was being placed in. On the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit we have had many discussions with the Auditor-General about how this role has been fulfilled. However, unbeknownst to most members of this place, the government implemented a reasonably secret and quiet report headed by Dr Allan Hawke, a former chief of staff to former Prime Minister Paul Keating.
So in late March, a month before this budget was due, what do you know—this report recommended that the Auditor-General’s role should be removed. The Labor Prime Minister, the opposition leader at the time, had sung from every rooftop he could possibly find that he would fix this problem. On 19 November 2007, in a doorstop interview with two Labor candidates—a gentleman named Rodney Cox, although I am not sure which seat he was running for, and Mike Symon, who is now the member for Deakin—he said:
Well, I am dead serious in returning decency to public administration. What’s the machinery that we have outlined for doing this?
This is government advertising. He said:
That is for the Auditor General to make a determination about the content of television advertising campaigns on behalf of the government.
His promise was about the content of advertising campaigns and that got junked in late March, a month before the budget, a budget which, Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be very surprised to learn contains $126 million to be spent in 15 months on the government’s election priorities—climate change, health and tax reform, to name three of the five. In fact, it gets worse for the Prime Minister with his own words. On 10 October 2007, the Prime Minister said:
Why not have a system whereby three months prior to when an election is due—
about now—
for there to be a ban on publicly-funded advertising unless explicitly agreed between the leader of the government and the leader of the Opposition … That is an absolute undertaking from us. I believe this is a sick cancer within our system; it is a cancer on our democracy.
An absolute undertaking. Sure, it is not the greatest moral challenge of our time, I accept that, but it is an absolute undertaking. Again, you just cannot trust what this Prime Minister says. You cannot trust the Rudd Labor government to deliver, to implement, any of their promises because what they say before an election they will not be held to account for after an election, and this is the greatest of all examples. I think it is even bigger than the greatest moral challenge of our time because it gets to the absolute political opportunist, the hollow man himself, and the way that this Prime Minister governs our country. It is a wrong thing that he has done. He gave an absolute undertaking that he would implement this measure as part of the Auditor-General’s role.
The Auditor-General has not gone quietly, it must be said. He wrote a letter to the Special Minister of State on 29 March, two days after he had been told he had been cut from the government advertising process. He made some very interesting comments. In particular, in the second paragraph of this letter—this is in a report he released last Friday and which we discussed with him this morning in the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit—he said that the decision to remove the Auditor-General from the process was a marked contrast to the arrangements for the implementation of government policy platform ‘following the 2007 election when our view was sought on the proposed approach and the draft guidelines to apply. At the time the government was keen for my office to be directly involved in the review of advertising campaigns consistent with the various statements by Mr Rudd and the shadow minister leading up to the election’.
In other words, when it suited the Labor Party to use the Auditor-General for political purposes they did. When they wanted to get him out of the road so they could run out the political government funded advertising campaigns, they did that too. That is what we saw on the weekend with the first of the public information campaigns on the health issue which are some of the most political ads you are ever likely to see. They are actually really bad ads but, putting that aside, they are the most political, blatant use of government money we have seen. So those on the other side are complete hypocrites. They cannot justify this. They will not even try to. I bet their response will be, ‘Look at what the former Howard government did.’ That will be their response instantly because they have no defence for the complete hypocrisy of their Prime Minister on this issue.
This budget fails to deliver. It is a true Labor budget—big spending and big taxing. We have seen reports today of the impact of their great big tax on mining on 18 workers in a regional centre of my electorate, not BHP or Rio Tinto workers, with a salt mine most likely shutting if this tax goes ahead. What we have said and what the Leader of the Opposition has said very clearly is that people will have a choice at the next election in this respect. They can either vote for a Liberal government that will stop this great big new tax on mining, or they can vote for a Rudd Labor government or a Gillard Labor government, whichever it is by election day, that will implement this great big new tax on mining.
I am sure the member for Longman will be happy to go out and sing to his electorate in Queensland about the benefits of a great big new tax on mining. I look forward to seeing his campaign literature with the great big new tax on mining all over it. I just have a sneaking suspicion that his internal polling will tell him not to say anything about it. We have a very clear position on this. We will not have a great big new tax on mining. We will cut the budget. We will bring it back into surplus. We will deliver what we did for 11½ years in government—strong economic management, contributing more jobs to the economy and giving people hope and a chance at a future, not cutting into their future dreams.

"Sullivan, Jon, MP",ALP,2010-05-24,"—Twelve months ago, the shadow Treasurer stood in this chamber and scoffed. Labor could not achieve its budgeted outcomes he said. Well, events have proven him wrong, so very wrong, but there was no mea culpa forthcoming from the shadow Treasurer. Instead, the shadow Treasurer again stood in this chamber and sought to cast doubts on the capacity of this year’s budget to deliver on its forecasts, ably supported of course by a conga line of Hanrahans, each of them prepared to declare that we’ll all be rooned within the year.
The truth is as plain as it is painful for the opposition. Action by the Rudd Labor government, on the advice of Treasury, the IMF and the World Bank, averted the havoc that was wrought upon the rest of the world by the global financial crisis. Clearly this will never be acknowledged by those opposite, who hold the deep conviction that only they are entitled to govern Australia, only they are capable of steering our economy. Our success, they say, was all due to them. We inherited an economy that was in a position of strength—that is true. Did it help that there were cash reserves? Of course it did. Did it help that our banks are well regulated? Of course it did. All of which, however, would have counted for nothing without a stimulus.
I want to quote a Queensland statistician, Scott Steel, a writer for the online news organisation, Crikey, who ran the ruler over the effects of the various international stimulus spends:
According to IMF data and the consistency and significance of the stimulus/forecast error relationship, a stimulus package in Australia around the 2.2% of GDP would have given us zero growth—anything less than that would have delivered us negative growth.
When the Coalition says the stimulus package should have been smaller—they need to be asked how much smaller. Every drop in GDP causes an increase in size of unemployment. How many more people would they have been willing to throw on the scrap heap of unemployment in their pursuit of a smaller package?
Every time the Coalition complains about debt, they need to be asked how much smaller they believe the stimulus package should have been and how many more people would they have been willing to throw on the scrap heap of unemployment in their pursuit of a smaller debt load.
Debt was the cost of growth—growth was and always is the provider of jobs. Pretending that less debt could have provided the same jobs is fairy floss economics. A dollar is a dollar is a dollar.
The size of stimulus packages mattered—the international evidence is in.
The Coalition needs to be questioned about its economic viewpoints—viewpoints which are far from mainstream economics, existing on the very fringes of economic debate and which are completely at odds, completely and utterly at odds, with the international empirical evidence.
You know what an argument without evidence is called?
‘Making it up’ was not Mr Steel’s answer, but it was something quite similar to that. Of course, the Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott, has publicly indicated via the ABC’s The 7.30 Report that that is exactly what he does—makes it up to suit the moment.
It is clear that Australia’s economy is still strong. On every measure we are in a superior position to similar economies worldwide. Despite the shadow Treasurer’s derision 12 months ago, we are in a position to achieve the unthinkable—returning to budget surplus in three years, a full three years ahead of expectation just 12 month ago, and halving the peak debt. That will be a great achievement. But the shadow Treasurer is nothing if not a trier. Last year as part of his scoffing he declared budget forecasts and projections to be optimistic. Last week, as if to explain away the remarkable 2009-10 outcome, he declared them to be pessimistic. Today he cast doubt on this year’s projections and forecasts as again being optimistic. As shadow Treasurer, the member for North Sydney is a one-trick pony.
I want to turn to some of the measures in the budget. The budget provides funding for the national broadcaster, the ABC, including additional money to purchase equipment to enable it to switch over to digital broadcasting. Coincidentally, today the Senate Environment, Communications and the Arts Legislation Committee questioned ABC representatives as part of the estimates processes. Again they were forced to listen to assertions from Senator Abetz that the ABC has a bias towards Labor.
The good senator might like to consider another isolated example when levelling bias charges at the ABC. Around about 1.30 pm on 11 February this year, the environment minister rose in this place to make a ministerial statement in relation to the Home Insulation Program. In a clearly worded statement the minister dealt with each occurrence that had been characterised as a warning, whether it was a report, a letter or other communication or incident. The minister spelt out what action had been taken in each instance and which department officials, which industry associations, which safety organisations or which unions had been involved. He advised the parliament of the decisions made and the actions taken. That evening, as I travelled back to my accommodation, the local ABC radio station led its 10 pm news bulletin with an item beginning with words, ‘Peter Garrett had 13 warnings on home insulation program but did nothing.’ If it was not those exact words, it was words very similar. That sounded to me then to be very much like the mantra that was being chanted by the opposition at the time. Eight and a half hours after the minister stood to refute those claims, our national broadcaster, broadcasting from the national capital, continued to repeat parrot-fashion the opposition’s line. That does not sound to me like the actions of an organisation biased towards the Labor government.

"Thomson, Craig, MP",ALP,2010-05-24,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Economics, I present the committee’s report entitled Inquiry into raising the productivity growth rate in the Australian economy, together with the minutes of proceedings.
Order that the report be made a parliamentary paper.
—Over the past decade Australia’s productivity growth has slowed considerably Average annual labour productivity growth fell from 2.1 per cent in the 1990s to around 1.4 per cent in the 2000s. And even though Australia’s average annual productivity growth has performed relatively well in OECD comparisons since 1985 approximating the OECD average—and ranking 12th, one below the US—the productivity growth rate has, however, been in decline since the 2003-04 productivity cycle with growth rates averaging negative 0.2 per cent per year. Put simply this is not good enough for an ageing population like ours in Australia.
An increased productivity growth rate would mean a larger economy, higher living standards and a reduction of the fiscal pressure created from ageing. If we were to boost productivity growth from an average of 1.6 per cent to two per cent per year and sustain this over 40 years real GDP per person would be around 15 per cent higher. That is equivalent to raising living standards by $16,000 a year in today’s dollars by 2050 for every man, woman and child in Australia. This is an exciting prospect, especially when put in the perspective of how healthy productivity growth helped us previously. Productivity growth was responsible for 80 per cent of the increase in our incomes over the last 40 years.
In tabling the report today of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, I look at some of the reasons why boosting productivity is the key to economic recovery and growth. As the Intergenerational report told us earlier this year, Australia faces a complex mix of long-term challenges of an ageing and growing population, escalating pressures on the health system and an environment vulnerable to climate change. These challenges will place substantial pressures on Australia’s economy, living standards and government finances over the next 40 years. These are challenges affecting not just us but developed countries around the world.
Productivity enhancing reforms particularly through nation-building infrastructure and improving the skills base will grow the economy, improve living standards and partly offset the fiscal pressures of ageing. By growing the economy, we increase our capacity to meet the fiscal costs of ageing without increasing the overall tax burden on working Australians. The best way to grow the economy is to maintain our focus on productivity and on investing in skills and infrastructure such as nation building, the education revolution and regulatory and tax reform to underpin productivity growth in the decades to come. Building productivity, of course, is not just a challenge for government. Ultimately, it is Australian workers and businesses that will deliver the higher productivity by skilling themselves up, tooling up and working smarter.
This report provides a high-level overview of the recent status of productivity growth in Australia and probable mechanisms that could be used to improve the current flagging growth rate. During the course of the inquiry the committee received evidence on a range of issues including measurement of productivity, productivity growth trends in Australia, challenges associated with raising the rate of productivity growth and how governments can promote productivity growth in the economy.
The committee has recommended: the government introduce a national aggregate productivity growth target for the medium term to 2030; a national productivity forum including governments, business, unions and non-government organisations be convened; the Council of Australian Governments adopt a specific national productivity agenda; the Productivity Commission undertake modelling on the effect of human capital investment on Australian productivity growth; the Australian Bureau of Statistics investigate alternate ways of measuring multifactor productivity in the services sector; cost-benefit analysis be mandatory for all policies aimed at increasing aggregate productivity growth and any national productivity agenda should include public sector service provision.
In conclusion, it is fair to say that Australia is without doubt off the pace when it comes to growth and productivity. We have been that way for some time now. Allowing such a slowdown in productivity growth, and even negative productivity growth, for much longer will cause our nation’s standard of living to decline. We need to increase productivity growth to the levels that will bring Australia back to sustained economic growth. We need all levels of government and the community to work to achieve this.
On behalf of the committee, I would like to thank all of the organisations and individuals that participated in this inquiry, particularly those who made written submissions or gave evidence to the public hearing. I would also like to thank the secretary and the staff. Without their help this report would not have been able to be made. (Time expired)

"Briggs, Jamie, MP",LP,2010-05-24,"—I rise in part to support the member for Dobell, the chair of the Standing Committee on Economics, who did a good job in managing this inquiry, as did Stephen Boyd and his assistants in the committee secretariat—Sharon Bryant, Chris Kane and Renee Burton—who helped enormously with what some might describe as a rather dry subject but a very important one nonetheless. It was a good inquiry and we had high-quality submissions. We took evidence from interesting and intelligent sources and quite a good report has been prepared by the committee. The report is entitled Inquiry into raising the productivity growth rate in the Australian economy.

Those on the coalition side of this committee largely agreed with the report’s recommendations. There were a couple of areas of dispute, but we were able to manage those reasonably amicably towards the end. We were concerned that the government was trying to create more talkfests. We wanted to see some more push for action out of the report, which contains some high-quality recommendations. We were concerned particularly with recommendation 3—that the government, as it has been known to do in its term, not create another talkfest and review in lieu of taking real action. But, in the end, for the purposes of getting the report done and tabled, we succumbed to the pressure of the chair.
When the report was released some weeks ago, we made a point of highlighting recommendation 6, which talks about an evidence based approach to policy, which we absolutely agree with. We are surprised that the government have not taken their own advice. There was no productivity report associated with the Building the Education Revolution—the memorial school halls program, as some people call it—the laptops in schools program, which has unfortunately had a billion dollar blow-out, or indeed the cash splash. There has been no productivity benefit analysis of the National Broadband Network and they are planning to spend $43 billion there. We are disappointed that recommendation 6 has not been taken up by the government. Hopefully it will be taken up in the future. I am sure a future Abbott-led coalition government will be keen to ensure that we have an evidence based policy regime rather than the cash splash, big spending approach of this government.
The shadow Treasurer made a very good and detailed speech about the economic challenges facing Australia and identified productivity as the No. 1 issue from the coalition’s perceptive. He highlighted several areas where we need to particularly focus, and I think they are worthwhile noting in conjunction with this report. He made the point that we should ensure that community infrastructure, both privately and publicly owned, is adequate and efficient—roads, rail, ports, utilities, telecommunications, the legal system and so on. Government investment in infrastructure should be subject to cost benefit analysis—the same point as the report makes.
The second way governments can improve productivity is to lower the cost of capital and maximise the availability of capital for private business. Governments should not be competing with the private sector for scarce capital, especially once businesses have returned to the market. This is the issue of crowding out—government borrowing too much money. The third step is to minimise drag from the government—government regulations and taxation. We know about government regulations in this area. Competitive markets is the fourth area. The fifth area is concerned with skilling the workforce. The sixth area concerns encouraging innovation, which of course is very important and is dealt with in the report.
I think the report adds very much to the economic debate in this country. It contains a great deal of very important and relevant information from a range of sources that appeared before the committee to give evidence. Submissions to the committee contain good suggestions and are well worthwhile. I commend the report to the House and recommend members read it from cover to cover. I am sure they will be a lot wiser for it.

"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2010-05-24,"—I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the People’s Republic of China and Hong Kong in November 2009 and seek leave to make a statement in connection with the report.
Leave granted.
—During the first two weeks of November 2009, I was pleased to be the deputy leader of an Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the People’s Republic of China and Hong Kong. We travelled as guests of the National People’s Congress to mainland China, where we visited the cities of Beijing, Shanghai and Chengdu, and also Lhasa in the Tibet Autonomous Region. This was the first official visit to Tibet by an Australian parliamentary delegation since the Human Rights Delegation visit in July 1991. We also travelled to Hong Kong.
At the outset I would like to acknowledge and thank my fellow delegates for their contribution to the trip. The delegation was led by the President of the Senate, Senator John Hogg, and also included my colleagues the member for Chisholm, the member for Isaacs, the member for Braddon, the member for Moore and Senator Scott Ludlam. The delegation was accompanied by Ms Meredith Home, adviser to the President of the Senate, and Dr Jacqueline Dewar, the delegation secretary from the Department of the Senate.
I would like to record the delegation’s appreciation of the hospitality and courtesy extended to us by the People’s Republic of China during our visit. In particular, I note thanks to the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress in Beijing; the Standing Committee of the Shanghai Municipal People’s Congress; the Standing Committee of the Sichuan Provincial People’s Congress; and the Standing Committee of Tibet Autonomous Region’s People’s Congress.
I also note the valuable contributions made by Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade staff, both in Australia and in China and Hong Kong, and the support provided by the Parliamentary Relations Office and the Parliamentary Library.
Australia’s relationship with China is a very important one, and accordingly we welcomed the opportunity to participate in this delegation. The objectives of the delegation were to renew links with the National People’s Congress; to gain an appreciation of contemporary political, economic and social issues in China; to gain an insight into China’s progress in addressing energy and environmental issues; to obtain an understanding of China’s perspective on regional and international issues; to explore prospects for further enhancing bilateral economic relations; to gain an appreciation of the effectiveness of Australia’s development assistance program and visit an AusAID assisted project; and to discuss cooperation within the multilateral system.
Delegation members met with a range of very senior members of the National People’s Congress in all the cities that we visited, which greatly assisted us in fulfilling our first objective. Our visit to mainland China provided us with a very worthwhile opportunity to renew and strengthen person-to-person contacts and parliament-to-parliament links. The busy program that was put in place for us also allowed us to pursue some of our other objectives, although there were some key issues—including the state of the Chinese energy and transport sectors, responses to the global financial crisis, trends in sustainable development and human rights—about which the delegation would have appreciated the opportunity to learn more.
In Hong Kong we met with a wide cross-section of Hong Kong’s policymakers, legislators, business leaders and community representatives. In particular, we were pleased to engage in discussions about the range of commercial opportunities for Australian business in Hong Kong.
In a two-week visit there were many highlights. One of the most memorable was the visit to the Expo 2010 site in Shanghai, where we saw the spectacular Australian pavilion, with a very distinctive Australian rust look, designed by a Melbourne architect. We also visited the site of the earthquake in Sichuan province. We were able to attend, in Hong Kong, a lecture by Stephen Roach on the impact of the financial crisis in Asia.
I would like to thank Ambassador Geoff Raby in Beijing, Consul-General Tom Connor in Shanghai and Consul-General Les Luck in Hong Kong, all of whom opened up their homes to us and enabled us to meet Australian expatriates who were working in China and Hong Kong. I would also like to thank Graeme Meehan and Christopher Lim, who travelled with the delegation and who, with their impressive command of Mandarin and their enormous knowledge of China, really helped to make sure that the delegation got the most out of the visit. Overall, the delegation provided a valuable insight into the state of the relationship between Australia and China and, hopefully, has helped to lay the groundwork for some more substantive future visits.",REPS,<title>DELEGATION REPORTS</title>,<title>Australian Parliamentary Delegation to People’s Republic of China and Hong Kong in November 2009</title>,Delegation Reports,18,1,speech

That the House:
congratulates the Rudd Government on reaching its historic COAG agreement on health and hospital reform;
acknowledges the massive investment by the Government in training more doctors and health professionals, cutting waiting lists, improving services in emergency departments and providing cancer care and services throughout Australia; and
notes that the Leader of the Opposition, when Health Minister, reduced funding for public hospitals by $1 billion.
It gives me great pleasure to move the motion tonight to thank and congratulate the Prime Minister, the Minister for Health and Ageing and the executive for reaching a historic COAG agreement to deliver better health care and better hospitals for Australian working families. The Rudd government’s National Health and Hospitals Network reform plan gives a commitment to permanently fund 60 per cent of public health costs, 60 per cent of capital projects and 60 per cent of the teaching and research in our public hospitals. The Australian government will also deliver $7.3 billion in additional funding over the next five years to provide 1,300 new subacute hospital beds and an additional 2,500 aged-care beds. The government is also committed to elective surgery being delivered on time for 95 per cent of Australians; a historic agreement to reshape mental health services and help 20,000 extra young people get access to mental health services; more coordinated care in general practice for patients with diabetes; a Commonwealth takeover of primary care; and a Commonwealth takeover of aged care.
The government will invest $1.2 billion in training and supporting more doctors, nurses and allied health professionals as part of Building a Health and Hospitals Network for Australia’s Future. This includes an additional $520 million investment in Australia’s nurses. In total, the government’s investments will train almost 5,500 GPs and 680 specialist doctors and expand and improve support for more than 4,600 full-time equivalent nurses working in general practice, as well as other nurses working and training in aged care and rural areas. It will support 800 allied health professionals working and training in rural areas over the next four years, which is significant to the people in my electorate of Solomon.
Hardworking doctors and nurses in our emergency departments do a great job, but they need more support to deliver working families the timely services they need. The most recent figures show that, currently, almost one in three patients—almost 600,000 people each year—wait longer than eight hours in an emergency department before they are admitted to hospital. Almost one in three patients wait longer than is clinically recommended. The new national four-hour target for emergency department access in public hospitals will be established under the new National Health and Hospitals Network. The government will provide $150 million from 1 July this year in upfront payments to help states and territories with the costs of moving towards the four-hour target. This investment will help provide the additional capacity, equipment and planning that is needed to deliver improvements in emergency departments and lift hospitals to the new high standards required under the National Health and Hospitals Network. A further $350 million will be available in reward funding for meeting or beating the target.
This investment will mean that families can be confident that when they or a loved one need urgent care in an emergency department they will no longer have to spend all night sitting in waiting rooms or waiting for a bed. The new National Health and Hospitals Network will also mean that doctors and nurses will have more say in the way their local hospital is run, through local hospital networks and new primary healthcare organisations. This fundamental reform and the government’s investments will ensure that our health workforce meets the needs of Australians today and the growing demand for health services into the future.
Without central reform, spiralling health costs could have consumed entire revenues raised by states and territories. The agreement delivers that reform, putting health funding onto a sustainable footing and delivering better health and better hospitals for working families across Australia. For more than a decade, Australia suffered as public hospital emergency departments struggled to cope with two million extra presentations and reduced funding from the former government. We know that the states and territories did suffer under the previous government, when Mr Abbott was the Minister for Health and Ageing and ripped a billion dollars out of the hospital system.
In my electorate of Solomon, the efforts of the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Ageing have been significant. On Friday I did some filming of some government funded sites, such as the GP superclinic in Palmerston, which is nearing completion, and the new medical school, which will be under threat if the former government is returned to office. The oncology unit is now operational—
—Campaign ads, were they?
—I will take that interjection from the member for Gippsland. It will not be called the Tony Abbott Cancer Centre. In fact, it is the Alan Walker Cancer Care Centre, after Dr Alan Walker. That is operational now, with a $28.6 million investment from the Rudd Labor government to make it happen on the ground. I am very thankful to the Prime Minister for his initiative and his vision in going into the hospital system and making sure that we have reforms and changes for the future. I also acknowledge, as I said, the health minister’s tireless work in this area. I thank the House. (Time expired)

"Chester, Darren, MP",NATS,2010-05-24,"—I am pleased to join the debate on the motion before the House. I do admire the member for Solomon’s enthusiasm. There has been an orgy of self-congratulation regarding health reform among some Labor MPs, and it is probably time for a cold shower. There is a lot of work still to be done on health reform and actually delivering the services that Australians expect, particularly those families that live in rural, regional and remote locations.
The motion before the House congratulates the Rudd government on reaching its historic COAG agreement on health and hospital reform. It overlooks the simple fact that the Western Australian government has not even signed up to this historic COAG agreement as put by the mover of the motion. That does not, however, stop the spin from going into overdrive when it comes to the Rudd Labor government. It does not stop the taxpayer funded advertising propaganda campaign. We have already seen the rollout of $10 million worth of advertising. It has already hit the airwaves. But what happened to the promises about the Auditor-General having oversight of government advertising? I sincerely hope, for the benefit of the member for Solomon, that the government has not paid too much for the ads, because they are an appalling representation of government policy. It is like ‘Noodle Nation’ revisited, so I hope you have not paid too much for it on behalf of the Australian taxpayers. This issue of Auditor-General oversight has gone the way of being another Labor government broken promise.
We suggest to the minister and to the Prime Minister that they should stop paying for spin doctors and use the money to pay for real doctors. That $10 million could have employed 30 doctors in the course of one financial year. That is the problem with this government, and the member for Solomon himself knows it. There are so many broken promises that no-one is listening to the spin anymore. You can just keep on spinning, keep on spinning, but no-one is actually listening anymore. The good doctor Rudd is actually poison on the ground in the electorate of Gippsland, as in so many other parts of regional Australia. We have had the home insulation disasters, the rorting of the school halls program, the failure to deliver on the promised childcare services and the backflip on the emissions trading scheme.
This motion asks the House to congratulate the Rudd government on reaching its historic COAG agreement on health and hospital reform, and I would be happy to congratulate the government if it actually managed to deliver any program on time and on budget. Just deliver one program on time and on budget and I would be happy to join in congratulations with the member for Solomon. I do not want to sound churlish. Quite recently, the Gippsland Cancer Care Centre was promised $22 million. It is a positive announcement and I freely acknowledge the positive announcement. But, given the Rudd Labor government’s record of broken promises and failure to deliver on the projects that are promised, Gippslanders have every reason to be sceptical and wary, and the overall sentiment remains that the people of Gippsland will believe it when they actually see it.
Even the Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Children’s Services had to sneak into Gippsland to make the announcement, with not even the courtesy of a phone call. That is the way they do business in this government. I must admit I expected a little bit more from the member for Maribyrnong. Perhaps I was misguided. I do not expect much from some of his colleagues but I thought the member for Maribyrnong had a bit more class than that.
The motion before the House also refers to the government’s investment in training more doctors and health professionals, cutting waiting lists, improving services in emergency departments and providing these cancer care services. The four-hour target the member for Solomon refers to regarding emergency department waiting times is just another target, another promise from the Rudd Labor government. He talks about it as if it has already happened, as if he is meeting this target of a four-hour waiting time. I suggest to the member for Solomon that the reward money he talked about is very safe in the Treasury’s coffers. I do not think the four-hour target will be met. I do not trust this government and its capacity to deliver health services to my constituents, particularly in rural and regional communities. I would have thought that, with this government’s track record of continually overpromising and underdelivering, it would be better off keeping the corks in the champagne bottles until it actually get some runs on the board.
The Rural Doctors Association of Australia naturally takes a very close interest in this debate and these matters relating to health and hospital reform. Dr Nola Maxfield, the president of the association, put out a statement on 11 May in relation to the budget and health reform package under the headline ‘With a severe lack of rural workforce measures, this budget really needs a doctor’. Dr Maxfield said:
“When it comes to real measures to improve access to health care in the bush and entice more doctors and other health professionals to rural and remote Australia, this budget is in serious need of a doctor … literally”
She went on to say:
“Instead of trying to paper over poor access to after-hours medical care with the Medicare Local national health telephone service, why not put in place real measures to get more Doctor Locals into the bush? After all, if there is no doctor in a rural town anyway, where is Medicare Local going to direct those after-hours patients needing serious care … Sydney, Melbourne or Perth?
There is still a great deal of uncertainty in my electorate about how the health and hospital reform proposed by this government will actually affect those living in regional areas. I have met with the providers in my electorate in recent weeks and they are passionate about ensuring that local decision-making capacity remains in the future.
In future, before we debate motions congratulating the government, I call on the government to actually get some results in terms of improved health services throughout regional Australia. (Time expired)

"Thomson, Craig, MP",ALP,2010-05-24,"—What an extraordinary contribution from the member for Gippsland. He tried as much as he could to speak about anything other than health—‘Let’s not mention health, let’s not even talk about it’—because we know that on your side the record on health is absolutely abysmal, ripping a billion dollars out of the health system, putting a cap on GP places so there are not enough doctors, doing nothing about the shortage of nurses, doing nothing about allied health professionals—and the shortages that were there for years. What we saw under the previous government was a decline in the contribution the federal government made to the health budget. We saw it drop below 40 per cent. That is what you did when you were in government. You should hang your heads in shame in relation to what you did when you had the treasury bench and were looking after health.
You ask for some concrete things that this government has done in health. Well, talk to the tens of thousands of people who got treatment more quickly because of the money we put into elective surgery. Talk to those tens of thousands of Australians who came off those waiting lists because of the money in last year’s budget—real action on health affecting people’s lives, making sure that they are seen as quickly as possible. That is real change. That is actually doing something positive for health, rather than ripping money out of it. This government has increased by 50 per cent the amount of money that went into the COAG agreement. That is real money going to fix the system, making sure that people get better services in our public hospitals.
We have promised over $7.3 billion in relation to helping health. That means 1,300 extra beds. What is the member for Gippsland’s position in relation to that? He is not even going to talk about health; he does not even care about what happens in health. He is just a bit worried about which photo he can get into next. It does not matter what he believes as long as he can get into a photo. That is the motto of the member for Gippsland. If there is a camera out there anywhere, he will be rushing out to jump into the frame. You can bet your bottom dollar that if there is an opportunity for a photo in relation to our health reform the member for Gippsland will be the first one lining up to get there and, surrounded by doctors, saying what a wonderful thing this is. But when he comes to Canberra it is very different. He talks one game back in his electorate, happy to take the glory for the reforms that this government is making. He comes to Canberra and talks a totally different game. He tries to walk both sides of the fence by having a different argument here in Canberra from the one he takes back to his electorate.
This government is about real reform. Look at some of the real reform that is being proposed in my electorate, for example. We have the view that our hospital networks should be run locally. The biggest concern on the Central Coast is that our area health services either are run out of North Sydney, as they are at the moment, or could be run out of the Hunter. We have over 300,000 people on the Central Coast and we want to have our health system run locally. That is what this reform does. It proposes that we run our health system locally rather than the way it has been done in the past. That means that we are able to get local clinicians, local doctors and local nurses involved in the decisions that affect people on the Central Coast. If that was the only reform that was being done, then that would be a fantastic reform and a major reform for the Central Coast, but we have already started to make other reforms on the Central Coast as well. We have a temporary super GP clinic here. We know from those opposite they do not believe in super GP clinics.

Mr Chester interjecting—
—We have more than two because I have a temporary one which is seeing over 2,000 patients a month.

Mr Chester interjecting—
 (Mr S Georganas)—Order! The member for Gippsland was heard in silence. I expect the same for other members.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker. Those opposite get agitated when they hear about health. They do not like to hear about what we are doing in health. They do not like to hear about how super GP clinics are taking pressure off public hospitals. Wyong Hospital, which is in my electorate, has the fifth busiest emergency department in the state. We are building a super GP clinic which will employ over 106 staff and will be less than a kilometre away. It will have extended hours and bulk-billing and will take the pressure off a public hospital, which is one of the things the member of the Gippsland said we should be doing. Yet, on his side, what did we hear in the budget reply? ‘We are doing away with super GP clinics. We do not want to have any more.’ Quite clearly, the opposition have no idea when it comes to health reform and no idea about putting in additional services. The opposition are about ripping the guts out of the health system. We know they did it before; we know they will do it again. They cannot be trusted in health. (Time expired)

"Briggs, Jamie, MP",LP,2010-05-24,"—I understand completely why the member for Dobell would want to get New South Wales Labor out of the health system. I understand why he, as a New South Wales member, would want New South Wales Labor as far away as possible at the next federal election in a few months time because anything the New South Wales Labor Party has touched in recent times does not turn out to be all that good. So I can understand his desperate desire to talk about getting rid of the New South Wales government’s role in the health system.
But, unfortunately, the so-called plan of the Prime Minister does not do that; it does not do much at all. It is a health policy for an election, not for the future, which is just so typical of this Prime Minister. Unfortunately, as much as it pains me to do it, I have to disagree with the three points in the motion of the member for Solomon on health and hospitals. There are only three points in it. I disagree with each of them and it is very rare for me to disagree with the member for Solomon. I cannot congratulate this government for yet another spin job. I cannot acknowledge an investment which does not exist. I cannot accept the third point, which just continues to outline a complete fib that those on the other side have been told to push around by the hollow men up there in the Prime Minister’s office about the so-called record of the Leader of the Opposition, who was a very good minister when he was the Minister for Health and Ageing.
When it comes to this Prime Minister, this is his record on health. He promised to fix hospitals by mid-2009 and he has failed. He promised to take them over and he has not. He promised to deliver 36 GP superclinics—not super GP clinics but GP superclinics—but only three are open. We have just heard about the temporary one in the electorate of Dobell, which is alongside the temporary deficit. He promised to recruit 7,500 hospital nurses, but only 1,000 were recruited in 2008 and just 617 recruited in the last two years. He promised to recruit 1,000 nurses for aged care but only 139 were recruited. He has now dumped the Bringing Nurses Back into the Workforce scheme. He promised to deliver 12 defence health clinics but not one has opened. Finally, he promised to cut elective surgery waiting lists, but they are longer than they have ever been.
You cannot trust Rudd Labor when it comes to health, like you cannot trust them on the economy and you cannot trust them to implement any sort of program. When they cannot implement a pink batts program, how can you trust them with the $100 billion health system?

Mr Craig Thomson interjecting—
—Don’t worry, Member for Dobell, I will be on health; there is no doubt about that. It is the easiest story to pick apart that you could imagine. So desperate was the Prime Minister to try and have something to take to the election that he had to junk his commitment to give the Auditor-General a role in government advertising at the end of March so that he could have an advertising program on—guess which subject—health. It is an advertising program that no longer has to go through the Auditor-General. It is an advertising program he promised he would never do when he was in opposition.
The Prime Minister, when he was in opposition, said, ‘Why don’t we have a system whereby a ban is placed on publicly funded government advertising unless agreed between the leader of the government and the Leader of the Opposition for three months prior to an election?’ It is now three months before an election and what did we see on the weekend? The most political government advertising we have seen in this place in a generation. It is the most outrageous abuse of government money, and it was all done after they cut the Auditor-General out of the process. The government stood on their high horse before the last election and now just before this election they dump the promise. It is just so typical of this government. You cannot trust what they say before an election because it will all change after the election. Whether it is the greatest moral challenge of our time or an absolute commitment on government advertising, you cannot trust them. You cannot trust them when it comes to health.
You would not put these blokes in charge of the $100 billion health system after you have seen what they did with the memorial school halls program and the pink batts insulation program. They cannot implement a program. You would not trust them with the $100 billion health system because they do not have the ability to implement a program. What they do have is an ability to run an election campaign, and that is all this is about. The health policy is a cover for an election campaign policy. It is one of those things that will be dumped after the election, like ‘the greatest moral challenge of all time’ was dumped after the last election, like the government advertising fraudulent claim was dumped just before this budget so that they could run ad after ad after ad leading to this election.

"Gibbons, Steve, MP",ALP,2010-05-24,"—On July 16, 1910, John Robertson Duigan flew an aircraft—it was a seven-metre hop—at his family’s property, Spring Plains, at Mia-Mia, near Kyneton in Victoria. That Australian flight occurred in my electorate of Bendigo and is acknowledged as the first-ever powered, controlled flight of an all-Australian designed and built aeroplane and it occurred less than seven years after the Wright brothers’ Flyer lifted off at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina, in the USA. In the five countries where powered flights were achieved, considerable technical resources were available, which made Duigan’s effort in Australia all the more remarkable because he accomplished the flight with little outside help, other than several texts, the magazine Aero and the engineering skills of his younger brother, Reginald Charles Duigan.
The reason I raise this tonight is because, on 8 May 2010, two Bendigo pilots, Ken Evers and Tim Pryce, in the spirit of John Duigan, took off from Bendigo aerodrome in an attempt to be the first Australian pilots ever to fly around the world in an Australian commercially manufactured aircraft—and I am delighted to say that that adventure is progressing well. After successfully crossing the Pacific Ocean via Norfolk Island, Samoa, Christmas Island and Hawaii, they landed safely at Mojave in California earlier this week. They then progressed to McNeal in Arizona and then to New Orleans, and landed safely in Jamaica around 10 am this morning, Australian time.
What makes this trip remarkable is that they are flying a single-engine eight-seat Australian designed and Gippsland Aeronautics manufactured Airvan. This aircraft has been described as a ‘flying ute’, or the four-wheel drive of Australian aviation. The company has manufactured and sold around 260 of these aircraft around the world and it is a great testament to Australian manufacturing and, in particular, Australian aircraft manufacturing.
I would like to place on the public record our thanks to the major sponsors of this event—first and foremost, Gippsland Aeronautics and their parent company, India’s Mahindra Corporation. I express our appreciation to this company for having the confidence to invest in Australian aircraft manufacturing, which is most welcome, and to all the other sponsors who have shown confidence in and support for this event. For the technically minded, the Airvan is manufactured by Gippsland Aeronautics in Morwell, Victoria. It is powered by a Lycoming TIO-540-AH1A turbo charged, fuel injected engine. The GA8-TC Airvan has a cruise speed of 140 knots at 10,000 feet with 75 per cent power.
As well as showing the great Australian spirit of adventure—remember, no other Australian has ever attempted a mission like this, and our pioneering long-distance aviators like Sir Charles Kingsford Smith helped establish Australian aviation so it could become what it is today—the two aviators from Bendigo will carry that tradition into the future by becoming the first Australians to circumnavigate the globe in an Australian designed and manufactured aircraft.
While the spirit of adventure is well established in both pilots, there is also a deep commitment pulsing in both of them to benefit their fellow human beings. This world record achievement is also about raising awareness of one of the world’s most devastating disease—malaria. This is a disease which takes almost three million lives each year, most in Third World nations and mostly infants and children. Tim and Ken are hoping to raise $1 million towards this very worthy cause. I know all of Bendigo is extremely proud of them and all Australians should be equally proud of their quest to create history and to raise awareness of and work towards their goal of eradicating this tragic disease, which is one of the Millennium Development Goals. I know all members of this House will join with me in wishing Ken and Tim all the best in this magnificent cause.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Australian Aviation Record</title>,Adjournment,20,1,speech
"Gash, Joanna, MP",LP,2010-05-24,"—For some years I have been strongly advocating, on behalf of the residents of Gilmore, for more funds to be provided to upgrade the Princes Highway, recognising that it is the only highway running north to south in my electorate; a highway on which all traffic to the Victorian border relies totally as the railway line stops at Bomaderry. It has been a frustrating experience. The reason I have taken such a strident position is the appalling record of deaths and the irritating lack of responsibility and compassion on the part of the New South Wales Labor government and now the federal Labor government. The New South Wales government, who has statutory responsibility for the highway, has not provided any additional funding despite two coroner’s reports since 2006 on the record of road fatalities along that stretch. Although one report described the highway as unforgiving, the New South Wales government contemptuously and irresponsibly continued to attempt to flick pass responsibility to the Commonwealth, even though the federal shadow minister at the time reinforced that the road was the responsibility of New South Wales.
To this day no additional funding has been provided by the New South Wales Labor government. In fact, in the last budget the New South Wales government cut the annual allocation even further. This year, following another series of horrific accidents in which five people were killed, we again asked the New South Wales government to respond and again, as per the usual modus operandi, they refused.
So I wrote to the Prime Minister asking for a $20 million grant to help make the highway safer around the site where a petrol tanker collided with a sedan, incinerating both the driver and three members of a family in the other car. The mother has survived with horrific burns and the legacy of a lost family. That was not enough to touch the heart of this Prime Minister. Within weeks another fatal accident compelled me to write again, pleading for federal money. By this time I had given up on the New South Wales Labor government as a hopeless cause. I reminded the Prime Minister that there was a precedent and that he should at least match the coalition’s special grant of $20 million given during their term of government and the over $48 million for other sectors. The response was yet another dismissal, but this time by the Leader of the House. By this time the local newspaper had decided to enter the debate, but there was a twist. It is to their discredit that instead of trying to work together they opted to say that because I had not bothered to apply for black spot funding personally they would take up the crusade.
After I saw the article I rang the editor and challenged him. His response, although through a subordinate, was that they had spoken to the office of the Leader of the House. This is what they reported was told to them:
Federal transport and infrastructure minister Anthony Albanese said he wrote back to Mrs Gash saying that she should apply under the black spot funding program, but no application was ever made.
When I challenged them, to their credit, they called back the minister’s office and were told:
Mr Albanese’s office considered claims its response urged Mrs Gash to apply for funds under the black spot program were incorrect, as the letter did not spell out the invitation.
This type of deliberate misrepresentation is not only deceptive but also a misuse of the office of parliament for political advantage and nothing else. Whoever sought to deceive by misinforming the media has to be sacked. I do not play with people’s lives for the sake of political expediency. It is unforgivable that the office of a minister of the Crown is allowed to get away with consciously telling a deliberate falsehood.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Gilmore Electorate: Princes Highway</title>,Statements by Members,22,1,speech
"Kelly, Mike, MP",ALP,2010-05-24,"—The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the Hon. Tony Burke MP, has asked me to make a statement on his behalf outlining the reason why debate on this bill was deferred. Following the introduction into the House of Representatives of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill 2009 on 22 June 2009 by the Hon. Tony Burke MP, European Commission regulation No. 607/2009 came into effect on 1 August 2009. The regulation outlined detailed rules regarding protected designations of origin and geographical indications—that is, regional names, traditional terms, labelling and presentation of certain wine sector products.
The Australian government and the Australian wine industry were both concerned that this regulation had the potential to diminish the benefits under the Australia-European Community Agreement on Trade in Wine—the agreement for Australian winemakers—which this bill implements. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry wrote to the EC Commissioner for Agriculture and Rural Development last year, expressing concern that the EC regulation imposed more restrictive conditions on Australian wines than existed at the date of the signing of the agreement. Minister Burke indicated that Australia wanted to resolve these concerns before proceeding to ratify the agreement. The main Australian concerns related to the access that Australian wine producers would have to grape variety names in the description and presentation of their wines. Australia’s interpretation of the EC regulation was that a number of common grape variety names, including sangiovese and nebbiolo would not be able to be used in the EC market by Australian producers. Such restrictions on use would have been detrimental to the Australian wine industry, especially given the increasing importance and popularity of these new and niche varieties in Australia’s domestic and overseas markets.
Australia and EC officials have discussed the Australian concerns and agreed that derogation from the regulation allowing certain EU wines with a geographical indication, or ‘GI’, to have alcohol content as low as 4.5 per cent continue to be extended to Australian wines with a GI. This means Australian producers of low-alcohol wine will continue to be able to market their product as ‘wine’ in the EC market, providing that the wine has an alcohol volume of at least 4.5 per cent. The least trade restrictive provisions in the regulation and agreement will apply to Australian wine, particularly with regard to wines without a GI claiming vintage and variety. This means Australian producers who choose to label their wine without a GI will be able to present the vintage year and variety name on the wine label when selling the product in the EC market. The agreement provides that the two per cent limit on partial de-alcoholisation of wine does not apply to Australian wine. This means Australian producers who choose to remove more than two per cent of a wine’s alcohol content will be able to sell the wine in the EC market, providing they do not reduce the total alcohol content to less than 4.5 per cent.
Finally, it was agreed that the EC amend the regulation which restricted the use of the name of a number of grape varieties in the EC currently used by Australia—including common Italian vine variety names such as sangiovese, on the basis that they contain or evoke GIs—to confirm access in the EC to the relevant grape varieties for Australian winemakers. This means that Australian producers of wines who use these common Italian variety names will be able to sell these wines in the EC market. Agreement to the outcomes was finalised on 23 March 2010. The wine industry has indicated that their concerns have been addressed and industry supports the passage of this legislation and ratification of the agreement.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN WINE AND BRANDY CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Cobb, John, MP",NATS,2010-05-24,"—I rise to speak on the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill 2009 not only as the shadow minister for agriculture, fisheries, forestry and food security but also as the member for Calare, an electorate which, if I say so myself, produces some excellent wines. I recommend to the Deputy Speaker that any time she is in the area she should try them. This is a bill which rectifies changes made through the Australia-European Community Agreement on Trade in Wine. It will ensure that Australian wines from the Hunter, the Barossa, the Yarra, Margaret River and my region sit on tables side by side with some of Europe’s most distinguished and long-serving wine regions.
The bill also means that the regions of France, Portugal, Spain and Germany, in particular, will continue to provide direct competition with Australia’s vineyards and our hugely important export market. With this competition comes increased pressure on Australian winemakers and Australian wineries to be able not only to match the style and quality of wine from Europe but to differentiate and create their own unique style that sets our Australian wine apart. Creating such a style and reputation has been testing in recent years. As has been mentioned both here and in the House, regional Australia is hopefully coming towards the end of the worst drought on record. The wine industry has had to deal with drought, which perhaps has been good for quality but terrible for quantity. At the same time, there has been a world glut of wine and winemakers have had to deal with that to a large extent right around Australia. It is essential that, with the signing of this agreement, we as a parliament provide the assistance needed to encourage the highest standards amongst Australian wine producers and in Australian wine.
Our wine has a reputation world wide. The Christmas before last, on holiday in New York, I found Australian wine very well accepted everywhere you went, whether it was in the deep south of America or in New York itself. Wherever it is, we must all work hand in hand to protect our brand, protect our reputation and expand on the foot in the door that Australian producers currently have. The export area is where it has got toughest. The domestic market is always the best market, but obviously far and away the bulk of Australian wine is exported. It has got very tough, particularly with competition from South America.
I mentioned earlier the need for our wines to develop their own reputation. There is no more perfect example of a geographical area having dominance over a market than the Champagne region of France. It is synonymous with what we in Australia now call sparkling wine—we have it in the title. Everyone knows Champagne for its bubbly, and the French economy and the French producers reap the benefits. I do not doubt for a second that our own sparkling is just as good as the French champagne, if not better. They do have one obvious advantage, and that is the dominant reputation that we need to encourage our own producers to develop in the future. This bill provides protection for the 112 registered Australian geographical indications. It is an opportunity for us to build our own geographical indicators and build on the value and respect of their brand.
The second part of the bill concerns the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation’s Label Integrity Program. The program is a key step forward in protecting the reputation of our own product. I am sure all would agree the information provided on a label has to sell the product to those browsing the aisles, but it also has to be honest and accurate.
Basically, this bill is about protecting a huge export market. It is all very much about the EU product and our own. Some two years ago we exported almost 400 million litres, for a return to Australia of $1.3 billion. On the other hand, we imported from the EU only 18 million litres, at a value of about $220 million. So it is quite obvious that change had to happen. We had to recognise the Europeans’ own name brands and we have to ensure that the reputation of our wine is encased around its own geographical indicators. The industry is very much behind this amendment to the act. As I said, it is about protecting and enhancing the $1 billion value of 400 million litres of wine two years ago. The main benefits include the Europeans recognising an additional 16 Australian winemaking techniques, simpler arrangements for approving winemaking techniques that may be developed in the future and simplified labelling requirements. The EU protects two and a half thousand registered indicators and 12 sensitive European geographical indicators. Those two and a half thousand European GIs include all those that have come into being in the last 16 years. We support the bill and the industry supports the bill; so it will be in everybody’s interest for it to be passed.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN WINE AND BRANDY CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Champion, Nick, MP",ALP,2010-05-24,"—I rise to support the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill 2009 also. It is nice to have a bit of bipartisanship in the chamber. I spent my youth in Kapunda, which is a small town on the edge of the Barossa Valley. I still have school friends who work in the wineries as winemakers and in the packaging industry, so I am well aware of the importance it has to regional economies and to employment. Over the last decade or so we have seen the industry transform itself into an absolute champion exporter of Australian produce. We have to appreciate the effort and skill that goes into the production of some of those prestigious wines. With that experience in the back of my mind, I am happy to commend this bill to the House and to support it.
Any of the wine consumers present or listening to this speech will acknowledge that the Clare Valley, the Barossa Valley and the Adelaide Plains, all within my Wakefield electorate, are regions with well-deserved reputations for producing some of Australia’s finest wines. The Clare Valley is home to 50 wineries, produces only two per cent of Australia’s grape crush and yet wins 20 per cent of the wine awards available to Australian wineries every year. The Barossa Valley, which is home to 150 wineries, is listed as one of the world’s top 10 wine destinations. It is a wonderful place to go, not just for wines but for great food, scenery, fellowship and company. It is one of those terrific places to live or to visit. The Adelaide Plains are not quite as famous, but I have been out there many times and visited some of the wineries. A different type of wine is produced there, but there have been terrific achievements nonetheless.
It is the longevity of these achievements and many others that the bill before the House seeks to maintain. One of the objectives of the bill is to preserve the reputations of geographical indicators, such as those I mentioned as well as many others throughout Australia, from becoming targets of misuse, either domestically or from foreign export markets. The bill achieves this by allowing the Australian-European Community Agreement on Trade in Wine to come into full effect. Furthermore, the EC agreement certifies Australia’s reputation as a producer of wines of quality and integrity and expands access to our largest export market. The second objective of the bill is to strengthen the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation’s Label Integrity Program, the LIP. This program seeks to protect all stakeholders within the Australian wine industry by ensuring that the Australian wine labels are truthful and accurate with regard to their origin and their characteristics.
The bill introduces accountability within the Australian wine industry, which is fundamental to ensuring the longevity of its world-class reputation. Accountability will ultimately also help us move up the value chain, which is one of the most important things for us to do.
This bill is receiving widespread support from the Australian wine industry, and it has the support of stakeholders and the opposition. As I said, it is wonderful to speak on a bill which has bipartisan support. It is something of a rarity these days, and we hope that there is no change of mind between now and its passage to the other place. Bipartisanship is important to the Australian wine industry at this time.
This bill also allows Australian winemakers to enjoy better access to European markets, and that access is a terribly important thing. The bill includes European recognition of an additional 16 Australian winemaking techniques, simplifies labelling requirements for Australian wine sold in European markets and provides protection within Europe for Australia’s 112 registered geographical indicators, including—most importantly to me—the Barossa Valley, the Adelaide Plains and the Clare Valley.
—You’re not claiming the Barossa Valley, are you?
—I am indeed claiming the Barossa Valley—the best bits of it, anyway! I acknowledge the member for Barker’s strong support. He perhaps has proprietary over the Barossa Valley, but I will claim it for myself in this instance.
This bill clearly demonstrates the Labor government’s concern for and cooperation with this important rural industry. It also highlights the government’s ability to effectively utilise policymaking in a manner that not only supports and encourages economic growth through favourable terms of trade but at the same time protects the interests of Australian businesses—in particular, in this case, Australian small businesses. Through the process of listening to industry stakeholders, taking into account their concerns and having the European Community’s concerns registered through bilateral negotiations, the government has successfully preserved Australian wine and winemaking techniques within the agreement with our largest export partner.
This achievement has been suitably recognised by the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation, the Winemakers Federation and a legislation review committee, all of whom have formally expressed to the minister their support for the bill. The minister is to be commended for his work not just in this area but in a lot of other areas. He has a very good reputation for being a hard worker and someone who is prepared to listen to the primary industries of this country.
I remind the House that Australia is the fourth-largest wine exporter in the world, and we want that to continue. By giving effect to this agreement—the Australia-European Community Agreement on Trade in Wine—this bill clearly seeks to promote and protect in the best sense of the word Australia’s hugely successful wine industry. We boast some of the oldest grapevines in the world. In the Barossa Valley, there are the shiraz vines that were brought all the way from Europe and are the only survivors of a disease that wiped out many of the established European vineyards. Our viticulturalists have developed new vine-management techniques which are now in application throughout the world. All these achievements—and the many others—of the wine industry underpin the necessity of this bill.
In closing I say that this is not the easiest time for the Australian wine industry. There are really difficult economic conditions in many of our export markets. The United Kingdom and the United States have suffered very severe downturns, and this has obviously impacted on our export growth. Slow economic growth across European markets coupled with the appreciation of the Australian dollar provide challenges to any exporter, particularly the wine industry. On top of that, the wine industry has an oversupply of grapes and emerging competition from countries like Chile, Argentina and South Africa.
This bill helps to meet those challenges in part. We know that there is some pretty difficult restructuring to go on and we know that we must move up the value chain if we are to be successful in the future. This bill is particularly important and perhaps marks a bit of a start on that journey. I am glad it protects some of Australia’s most distinguished wine regions, particularly those in my electorate—or adjacent to my electorate, as no doubt the member for Barker will correct me. It is with a great sense of pride in these industries that I commend this bill to the House.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN WINE AND BRANDY CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Secker, Patrick, MP",LP,2010-05-24,"—The grape industry is an area of great interest to me and has been of great interest to me all my life. I can remember picking our own grapes. We had 220 acres of grapes at Happy Valley, where I grew up. I remember picking them for thruppence a bucket, when the buckets were four to the hundredweight and of course 20 hundredweight to the tonne. An average picker could pick 80 buckets in a day and the top guns could pick 100 buckets a day. That is how far back my own history with the grape industry goes.
One of the great pleasures of being the member for Barker has been representing Australia’s grape-growing industry—at one stage, about 43 per cent of it. It is a very important part of my electorate. And, yes, there is a small part of the Barossa in the member for Wakefield’s seat. It is that little bit outside the Barossa council region, just over the Para River, and they do grow some good grapes there. But the majority of the Barossa is in my electorate.
I also represent the Riverland, which is a huge producer in itself. At one stage, 25 per cent of Australia’s grapes came from the Riverland area in South Australia. That has changed a bit. I do not have the latest figures but, with the drought and the lack of irrigation due to the reduced allocations, I am sure that percentage has reduced a bit. There is no doubt that the Riverland in South Australia still represents, by itself, a very large part of Australia’s grape production.
I also have the pleasure of representing other great grape-growing and winemaking areas. The Coonawarra is one of my favourites. Of course, in this job, you cannot pick a favourite because other regions will say, ‘Well, what about us?’ The Coonawarra are very well recognised worldwide for their cabernets and their shiraz, and their chardonnays are coming into high esteem all around the world. I have other great areas in my electorate such as Padthaway, the Mount Benson area down by Robe, and an up-and-coming area called the Wrattonbully. Wrattonbully is producing some sensational wines. Anyone who is interested in wine should be looking favourably on anything—in the reds especially but also in the whites—coming out of the Wrattonbully area. The area is about halfway between Padthaway and the Coonawarra, so you can get a feel of its climatic conditions. It has some very good soils. I am known by some of my colleagues as the ‘member for wine’ because of these great wine areas, and I am often asked my opinion on certain wines. Can I say I am quite happy to give it at any time! It is certainly one of the great pleasures of life to represent the seat.
We should also recognize our forebears, who went to the trouble of planting vines. A lot of that in the Barossa, for example, is due to the area’s German and Lutheran heritage. I think 90 per cent of Lutherans in Australia are in South Australia, and about 90 per cent of them are in my seat of Barker, which means I am not only the member for wine but also the member for Lutherans, in many ways. That is not a coincidence because the two go hand in hand. For probably 160 years they have been very important to our history in the grape industry in South Australia, and they have been a very strong part of making Australia the success it is in producing wine.
The Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill 2009 amends the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980. On our side we have quite a bit of goodwill towards this legislation. It does the right things and I suspect we would have done exactly the same if we were in government. It has wholehearted support across the chamber. As I said, it is of great interest to me and my electorate. Certainly all of the wonderful regions are world-renowned: the Barossa, Coonawarra, Padthaway and all the other areas are recognised worldwide. Unfortunately, as the member for Wakefield said, the wine industry is currently experiencing tough conditions, with the drought causing ongoing issues with low water allocations, and that means lower production levels.
Growers are facing much uncertainty about their future. That is a shame because it is a great industry. There are a lot of hard workers in it and they provide a lot of our wealth. They have increased exports enormously. Twenty years ago we were exporting about one per cent of our production; we are now exporting something like 63 per cent of our production. Unfortunately, the level of the Australian dollar has made that a bit tougher and, of course, we have competition from other good winemaking countries such as South Africa, which has a very low rand so it is quite competitive. I recognise that countries like Chile and Brazil make some pretty reasonable wines and they are always going to be competitive on price and quality, although I will always say that our wines are better and are certainly value for money.

Dr Jensen interjecting—
—There is nothing wrong with the Margaret River wines. I just think they are overpriced compared to some of the others—certainly the wines that come from my electorate. Many jobs and livelihoods are being compromised. Growers are having to sell up and move on or are struggling to hang on by the skin of their teeth, knowing that each season may have to be their last. That is a real shame. Oversupply is a huge problem, but I can tell you from my personal history that the wine industry, the grape industry, had a downturn in every decade bar the 1990s. What has always happened is that grape prices go up, people start planting and it takes four or five years before you get some decent production out of a block, and by that time all the extra vines have oversupplied the industry. But in the 1990s the wine industry went for export. That has been very successful for close to 20 years. We now have the downturn that was missed in the nineties because of the push for exports.
There is no doubt that we have too many vines on the land. It is not for the government to say who pulls vines out. In fact, I do not support a vine-pull system funded by the government. We had that in the eighties when we had a downturn. We stopped it because we were pulling out some of the great old shiraz vines on the basis of it. We were getting some money for it, so we did it. We got some pain out of that decision.
But we do have a problem: MIS—managed investment schemes—legislation is still allowing for the planting of vines. There are quite large plantings still happening in the Barossa, for example. It is not for me, you or anyone else to say that they are wrong in doing that, because they might be right. When those vines start producing in four years time there might be a change in that oversupply, but I am not sure that it is a wise decision. I certainly would not be investing in the planting of grapes right now. By and large, as I said, the wine industry has survived with the high levels of wine being exported. It prides itself on the excellent quality of wine. We have maintained high levels of trade and that is paramount in keeping the industry alive in Australia.
I think it is very interesting, when you look at how we have progressed in Australia. It certainly could not have been achieved without mechanical harvesting, because we just would not have had the pickers out there to pick the huge increase in the planting of grapes. We have certainly perfected the science of winemaking. In fact, people from even countries like France are coming to Australia now to try and get some of the expertise from Australia.
The purpose of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill 2009 has three parts. The first is to allow the Australia-European Community Agreement on Trade in Wine 2008 to come into play; it is very important that we do so. The second is to strengthen the AWBC’s Label Integrity Program. I think consumer information is always important, so we should do that. We have to ensure truth in labelling and enhance consumer confidence in label claims. The third is to correct a number of weaknesses in the compliance provisions of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980. There is no blame going on here. Things move on, and we have to make these amendments to improve the act.
The first purpose of the bill is to bring into force the Australia-European Community Agreement on Trade in Wine 2008, and it is about ensuring winemakers have continued access to Australia’s largest export market, Europe. I do not know how long it will stay as the largest export market; it is certainly way ahead of the others. But I think we have huge potential in Asia—in Japan—as well as in the United States and Canada to actually improve our exports in that area. Presently I am working with our officials in Guangzhou, the old Canton province in China, to help promote Australian wines at their expo. I think it is in October this year. It is important that I get as many of the wine producers in my electorate to the expo to jump on the growing demand for quality wine in China, because China’s state brand, to put it bluntly, is not great wine—it never has been and never professes to be great wine. It brings to mind raspberry cordial as an equivalent in quality.
The give you an idea of the proportions of the European market, during the 2007-08 period Australia exported 397 million litres of wine to the European community, and that was worth $1.3 billion. That is a pretty large amount for any industry. The European community accounted for just over half of our wine exports during that time. It is important that we keep this level up and even, if we possibly can, increase our percentage there whilst at the same time trying to increase our share of other markets around the world. If we go by quality and price, I think we can compete very well. During that period, Australia imported 18 million litres from Europe. That is 18 million litres versus 397 million exported, so we actually have a very positive balance of trade there, but it was valued at $212 million. So obviously, if you look at those figures, we have been importing quite expensive wine, probably on a connoisseur level compared to some of the wine that we sell. I think that is one of the problems for Australian wine: we need to see if we can get the price point at which we are exporting higher.
This agreement on trade has many benefits to Australian producers, one of which is the European recognition of an additional 16 Australian winemaking techniques. I raise one of these techniques in particular, and that is the use of oak chips in the fermentation process, which can deliver in a matter of weeks an intensity of oak character that would take one to two years to achieve in oak barrels. If anyone understands anything about wine they will know what I am talking about when I talk about the oak characteristic. A former colleague of mine, a former member for Wentworth, explained to me that when he was in the United States he was getting a lot of information that Europe was actually trying to stop Australia using that technique as a form of non-tariff trade barrier. I am very pleased that we have been able to get over that sort of proposed non-tariff barrier, that we have outstared them and that we will still be able to use that technique.
If anyone looks at the wine industry, they will see that more and more of our wine is produced not for the connoisseur but for someone who is going to buy it and consume it within 48 hours. It is often said that 90 per cent of wine in Australia is consumed within 48 hours of purchase. This is a matter of convenience, and a lot of people do not have the facilities to store wine properly and are not interested in storing a whole lot of wine for the future. I have been buying wine for many years, and I do store wine quite often for 10 years or more. It is an important part of the mystique of the wine industry, and it is something we have to continue to encourage.
Other techniques which I know will be recognised include spinning cone technology and reverse osmosis. Both techniques are used in the de-alcoholising process, to lower the alcohol content of wine. I was recently in the Riverland and spent some time at a property where they are using world class technology to irrigate their vines and measure soil quality. That is an important part of producing good wine—you have to make sure you get the quantity and the quality right. If you overproduce it is going to be hard to produce the quality, but having the right soil and the right climate plays a large part in producing high quality wine.
Unfortunately, those same growers who are using this world class technology are really struggling. Although the technology has improved their practices immensely, the drought is taking its toll on production levels and unfortunately their future is at stake. We need to ensure that we continue to encourage these people to take up the best possible techniques. We need to be protecting growers and providing programs that help them to continue exporting and keep productivity at sufficient levels to meet new demand. Certainly we can do that through our export grants and other measures.
The government’s Henry tax review proposed a disastrous switch to a volumetric tax system. We know that Ken Henry has always wanted a volumetric tax, and on the face of it you would say that was the fairest thing. But it would be an absolute disaster for the wine industry if we changed to a volumetric tax system. It would have pushed many growers to their limit, and many of them would have been pushed out of the industry altogether. They simply would not have survived under that sort of change. Thankfully the government shelved the recommendation, and I was certainly ready to make a whole lot of speeches had they accepted it. We do need to protect the value of the produce we are exporting, maintaining a high standard that reflects Australian wine of the utmost quality.
The second and third parts of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill 2009 strengthen the AWBC’s label integrity program and correct some of the weaknesses in the compliance process. It was introduced to ensure an industry wide system of record keeping to substantiate label claims in respect of vintage, variety and region of origin—very important things when it comes to producing wine. The AWBC 2007-08 annual report states that the corporation’s auditors monitor the industry for compliance with the label integrity program provisions of the AWBC Act and checks that the origin of the wine can be traced from the grapevine through the dispatch of an export consignment or to a domestic retailer’s shelf. A total of 133 LIP audits were conducted throughout Australia in 2007-08, with 76 wineries visited in South Australia, 19 in Victoria, 19 in New South Wales and seven in Tasmania. That is only a reflection of the fact that South Australia produces over half of Australia’s wine.
The annual report also states that wine compliance continues to be very high, and that is very pleasing to hear. Nevertheless, the export licences of two wine producers were suspended during the year due to non-compliance with LIP provisions. So we are acting to continue to uphold this high compliance. This bill seeks to require all those involved in the production, distribution and sale of wine and grapes used to make wine to record the specified information to ensure a traceable trail throughout the wine production process. I certainly support measures that streamline and improve production, and encourage the wine industry to keep doing what it does best: making wine that can be enjoyed the whole world over, and especially in Australia.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN WINE AND BRANDY CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Raguse, Brett, MP",ALP,2010-05-24,"—I rise tonight to speak in support of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill 2009. This is a bill of significant interest certainly to my electorate of Forde, which contains nearly a dozen Gold Coast hinterland wineries that produce a variety of table wines, including fortifieds and spirits. I commend the previous speaker, the member for Barker, for his presentation. He is a South Australian, and we always hear South Australians are well versed on the wine industry, and certainly it is a big part of their culture. With many experts, when they talk about wine, there is always a lot of levity. Even in this chamber tonight there has been levity when talking about wine, because it certainly does represent for Australians part of our recreation and our entertainment. But certainly the quality of the wine this country produces is very important.
As I said, I commend the member for Barker, and also the member for Tangney, who is also here, for talking about South Australian wines versus Western Australian wines. But the member for Bowman, who sits across the chamber, and I, being from Queensland, are rightfully proud of what the Queensland industry has been able to achieve, certainly in the past 20 to 30 years. I often watch wine shows when they are on TV, but I often wonder about the South Australians and the Western Australians. They drink their wine and then they spit it out. We do not do that in Queensland, we drink the whole lot. A little bit of humour, but the reality is that the wine industry and its growth has been very important for all of us. There is a famous actor who once said that a day without wine is like a day without sunshine. The reality is that it is a supplement or a complement to our gastronomical delights and our eating.
The Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation, or the AWBC, dates back to 1981 when it replaced the Australian Wine Board, itself a label introduced back in 1936. The AWBC continues to play an important role today in Australian wine industry promotion, coordination and research. In his second reading speech, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry outlined the three objectives: allowing the recent Australia European Community, or EC, agreement on trade to come into force; improve the label integrity program; and update compliance provisions from the act. I will review each of these objectives separately.
The first wine agreement between Australia and the European Community came into life under the Keating government in 1994. Since this time it has become apparent that revisions were needed to resolve issues faced by both sides of the agreement. Signed on 1 December 2008 in Brussels by our Minister for Foreign Affairs, Stephen Smith, and the European commissioner for agriculture, Mariann Fischer Boel, the new agreement has been carefully negotiated over an incredible 14 years. The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry notes the following benefits of the new agreement for Australia:
European recognition of an additional 16 Australian winemaking techniques…
Simpler arrangements for the approval of winemaking techniques that may be developed in the future
Simplified labelling requirements …
Protection within Europe for Australia’s 112 registered geographical indicators—
or GIs, and that wholesalers will have five years to sell stock labelled with an EC GI, and retailers will be able to sell all of their stock. There will also be a defined use of a number of quality terms in the presentation and description of wine.
The Winemakers Federation of Australia has also supported the new agreement, particularly noting the recognition of winemaking techniques and the simplified procedures for approving new winemaking techniques. The first schedule of this bill contains provisions to bring this agreement into force. Among many significant changes, the bill protects the unique identity of Australian geographical indications, or GIs, which indicate particular winemaking locations; provides rules for translation of foreign country GIs and traditional expressions; resolves a series of issues relating to false, misleading and deceptive GI practices; modifies the Trade Marks Act 1995 to ensure consistency with the AWBC Act; clarifies situations where common English words may be used to describe GIs; and places responsibility for determining GIs with a new, independent geographical indications committee, or GIC.
This agreement will bring about even closer ties with countries that are already among our biggest export markets. By value, during the 2008-09 financial year, 43.2 per cent of Australia’s wine exports went to Europe. That represented up to 14 countries in the European community who are very much in love with Australian wines. Australian wine has a good reputation for clear, consistent labelling. Schedule 2 of this bill has the objective of further strengthening our processes in this area so that people can be certain that our wine labels are truthful and accurate. At the moment the Label Integrity Program applies to wine manufacturers but not to other parties in the wine supply chain. Record-keeping requirements are to be extended beyond wine manufacturers to those involved in the distribution and sale of wine and grapes. In most cases, existing documentation will suffice in complying with these legislative changes. Retailers and other endpoint sellers only have to keep records of total quantity and vintage, not individual sales. Once in place, the AWBC will make it possible to verify wine label claims via the records kept by all participants in the wine supply chain. The trail will be auditable from the point where the grapes are harvested to the point of the sale of the wine. Furthermore, a new offence is proposed for a person to make a claim about a vintage variety of GI of a wine product when this claim is not supported by their records.
The third and final section of the bill strengthens the powers of the AWBC to deal with people taking actions that may be contrary to the AWBC Act. As noted by the Minister for Agricultural, Fisheries and Forestry in his second reading speech, the bill proposes that the AWBC be able to apply for an injunction to stop or direct a person who is acting in a way that is contrary to the Label Integrity Program, the provisions relating to the protection of geographical indications and other terms, the export control offence provision or the regulations made for the purposes of these provisions. The bill also modernises the applications of penalties by referring to penalty units rather than fixed dollar amounts. These changes will ensure that not only do we have a modern internationally recognised system in place but also that we can enforce it when needed.
The Queensland government has had an encouraging and increasing interest in winemaking and recognises the importance of the growing of the wine grape within Queensland. In 2004 Margaret Keech, one of my local state members, was appointed Minister for Tourism, Fair Trading and Wine Industry Development and Minister for Women. As minister, Margaret Keech oversaw the formation of the Queensland Wine Industry Development Strategy and many other actions to support that industry. Within my electorate, I am fortunate to have areas of the Gold Coast hinterland, which is a relatively recent but now established wine region within southern Queensland. This region is the glorious Tamborine Mountain. Over the last 20 years Tamborine Mountain has become an increasingly popular tourist attraction, with the wineries being one of the main attractions. It is no surprise, seeing the rapid local expansion, to see that the 2025 Australian target of 4.5 billion in annual wine sector sales was actually surpassed in 2005. This target was set in 1996 and was achieved in under one-third the expected time frame.
The wine industry’s connection with our entertainment and leisure industries within Australia not only makes it very much a local product but also an export market that we so enjoy. I see the South Australian member over there, the member for Mayo—who is certainly well aware of the wine industry in his own region and would certainly understand the development of wine in Queensland—talking about, with some hilarity, how we grow wine and consume wine in Queensland. This is an industry that grew in a region that had no history—when you look at South Australia and its long, long history, we have done exceptionally well. Many years ago, when travelling to places within South-East Queensland, in Stanthorpe, and just as there is hilarity across the chamber right now, if you talked about a Stanthorpe wine people would laugh. People would say Queensland wines do not really stack up to much. The reality is, if you go back 30 years in that region, they decided that it was an area that grew grapes, but of the table grape variety. They really did not have the knowledge or ability to grow grapes or to make wine. About 25 years ago, a local winemaker in Stanthorpe, who had come from the Hunter region, decided to set up Old Caves Winery. That was very much the starting point for the industry, in a mainstream way, to convince the local growers to grow not only table grape but also grape for wine production. And the rest is history.
In fact, if you look at the region now, in South-East Queensland, including in my electorate, there are a dozen wineries that have developed over the last 20 years. We have the Aussie Vineyards, the Tatra Winery with its cafe-restaurant and the Cedar Creek Estate Vineyard and Winery—owned by a fellow called John Penglis, who is not only a good friend but also a great vintner and businessman, and someone who has been able to establish a core to the industry in South-East Queensland. While we do enjoy a lot of cellar-door product, the wine making is still developing within our region. We also have the Mount Tamborine Winery and Homestead, Heritage Wines, Tamborine Mountain Distillery—which is essentially putting together fortified wines—and the Witches Falls Winery. We have some wonderful brands that have been developed and that have won many awards. There are the Albert River Wines, the Thumm Estate and Sarabah Estate Vineyard and Winery. All these are new businesses to the region and are responsible for some of the agricultural growth within our region.
One of those wineries is owned by the O’Reilly family, who many people know about from the history of the Stinson crash and from their involvement in a very traditional area of our region. The member for Dobell beside me knows well that I have talked on many occasions about Duck Creek Road, and Duck Creek Road leads its way up to the O’Reillys and the O’Reilly homestead. The O’Reillys also established a winery some years ago and, back in about 2005, they won a San Francisco International Wine Competition award for one of the best shirazes. That is out of an area that over the last 30 years has developed into something now unique for our region.
We do it reasonably tough in Queensland in terms of the growing traditions, but we have been able to work through that and grow the varieties of grapes that really do bring excellence to our region. I am sure that any South Australian members or the member for Kingston, who is also here tonight, who represents well her winegrowing district, would be proud of what we have been able to establish as a Queensland industry.
I spoke about Duck Creek Road in connection with the O’Reillys, and I have spoken about it on many occasions in this house. The reality is that these are families who have banded together as an industry to produce some very good wines. I say to South Australian members that, while their industry is well recognised and accepted and their branding and labelling are very well known overseas, Queensland wines are making their way to the tables of many people in different parts of the world. It is probably better at times that we compete in the production of wine than in AFL or the national league. The reality is that we now have another area of competitiveness, and Queensland’s wine industry is growing at a phenomenal rate. The development of our wine industry along with this amendment legislation will allow the geographical regions that are represented within my electorate to make their mark.
In conclusion, the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill 2009 will further advance our wine industry exports and our opportunities in Europe. Our wine labels will be clearer, internationally consistent and enforceable. This is a bill that supports one of the great Australian success stories of the last two decades, including that of South-East Queensland. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN WINE AND BRANDY CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Briggs, Jamie, MP",LP,2010-05-24,"—The old saying that you learn something new every day is certainly true in this place. I learnt today that Queensland produces wine. I did not know that Queensland produced wine. I knew that they stole our water to do lots of things but I did not know wine was one of the things that they did with it.

Mr Hale interjecting—
—Member for Solomon, I do not think they produce wine in Darwin but they certainly drink a lot of it; there is no doubt about that. They drink some very high quality Adelaide Hills wine in Darwin—the sav blanc suits those sorts of climatic conditions perfectly. I imagine the member for Solomon would enjoy that before his pints of beer.
I rise to speak this evening in support of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill 2009 and its passage through this place. Of course, the member for Kingston will agree that the wine industry is extremely important to South Australia. It is not without its challenges at this time, whether it be in the Adelaide Hills, in Langhorne Creek, in Fleurieu or indeed in McLaren Vale. It is a hugely important industry to our economy and to Australia’s economy as well and is driven very much from South Australia through the Barossa Valley and the other regions—including Coonawarra, of course, in the seat of the member for Barker. It employs many South Australians. It has many small family businesses. Many larger businesses are involved in the industry as well.
In my electorate there are about 450 of South Australia’s wine-producing establishments, with a rough value to our economy of about $300 million per annum. We have about 16 per cent of South Australia’s wine industry, which in 2007-08 was worth about $1.8 billion to the South Australian economy. In anyone’s language, that is a very important industry to our state, so if there is good legislation before the parliament we will support it to ensure that the industry is stronger than it was before.
We support this bill as it provides for a much-needed amendment to the current legislation. It will bring the Australia-European Community Agreement on Trade in Wine into force. This agreement was signed in Brussels on 1 December 2008 by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. The amendments are strongly supported by the industry, including the Winemakers Federation of Australia. I have spoken to Stephen Strachan about this issue; in fact, he appeared before the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties when this issue was before that committee and gave it his strong endorsement. He is a very strong representative of the wine industry in Australia and in particular in South Australia. He has a very large soft spot for the wine industry in South Australia and is a great supporter.
The agreement ensures that winemakers have ongoing access to Australia’s largest export market. During 2007-08 Australia exported to European countries 397 million litres of wine worth $1.3 billion, accounting for just over half of Australia’s wine exports that year. The amendments will give Australian wine producers European recognition of an additional 16 Australian winemaking techniques and simpler arrangements for approving such techniques that may develop in the future.
The bill provides simplified label requirements and protection for Australia’s 112 registered geographic indicators. Secondly, it further strengthens the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act by protecting Australia’s reputation as a quality wine producer through the Label Integrity Program. The program was originally established to increase consumer confidence in labelling. Finally, the bill provides for tough offence provisions and proposed penalties, which include imprisonment, for breaches. These will enhance and improve industry compliance. In that respect, we support the bill.
I will use this occasion to make some remarks about the challenges that the industry faces in my electorate and more broadly in South Australia. They are significant challenges. The first, of course, is the ongoing challenge with water and access to water in South Australia, which is all tied to how much we get across the border—how much is allowed to flow down through Queensland and New South Wales and how much is taken out in Victoria. We have an ongoing and major interest in the activities of those states, and we are of course continually disappointed by the failure of this government to have a truly national system which can regulate the use of and access to water by those eastern states, which do tend to take more than their fair share, in our view. That has flow-on effects for industries like mine in Langhorne Creek, which is right next to the Lower Lakes, in South Australia, and we are therefore continually interested. That is why I was very pleased that the Leader of the Opposition announced some time ago that when we are elected to government, if we cannot get the state premiers to agree to hand over their powers in relation to the management of Australia’s water, we will hold a referendum to ensure that that will be the case. That is a major ongoing challenge.
The more immediate challenge for the wine industry is the glut, which is going to affect many producers throughout the state. The Riverland is facing the double whammy of the glut and the restrictions on irrigation. This is also affecting other regions, but probably not so much. There were reports over the weekend that the Barossa and other regions, including Langhorne Creek and McLaren Vale, are looking at pulling out up to 20 per cent of their vines. That will have a real effect on many of the workers, on the industry and on small businesses. While consumers will benefit over the next few years from lower prices for very high-quality South Australian wine, we will have to go through a very difficult period where many people will face some very challenging economic circumstances. It is important that governments both state and federal are aware of this and ready to assist those people if necessary. I know that Steven Strachan and the Winemakers Federation are working very hard with government to ensure that the industry is managed properly so that we do not have communities destroyed by the situation relating to the glut. It is something we need to continue to watch and face up to. I went to the Langhorne Creek winemakers’ lunch on 30 April this year. It is always a very enjoyable day. Winemakers expressed concern about the industry and the impact of the glut. Added to that are the water challenges that South Australia faces. The winemakers are very conscious of the impact that that is having on an extremely important industry in South Australia. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN WINE AND BRANDY CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Rishworth, Amanda, MP",ALP,2010-05-24,"—I rise to speak in favour of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill 2009. This bill is very important to many of my constituents in the seat of Kingston. As I have mentioned many times before, the electorate of Kingston contains the regions of McLaren Vale and Willunga. I have introduced many members of the House to McLaren Vale wine, and McLaren Vale is one of the premium wine-producing regions in this country. The changes to the laws in front of us today with regard to the wine trade are of particular significance and will be welcomed by grape growers, winemakers and wine lovers everywhere.
As the previous speaker mentioned, the wine industry in South Australia is facing some significant challenges, including water, the grape glut and the value of the Australian dollar, which is affecting exports. I commend the growers and winemakers of McLaren Vale because they have really risen to the challenge. While a lot of other winemaking regions around Australia continue to discuss how they might meet the challenges of a lack of water, the winemakers and grape growers of McLaren Vale got active and worked with other companies, the local council, the state government and the federal government to get recycled water to the vineyards. I will not use the term that has often been bandied about in media releases, but it is about turning ‘something’ into shiraz. It is about turning effluent into water for the grapes of McLaren Vale. This is an example of the growers and winemakers of McLaren Vale being at the forefront of looking at what they can do to secure their future.
As I said, things are difficult at the moment, but I have great confidence in the industry. I was very pleased to recently attend the launch of the sustainability program that McLaren Vale is looking at. They are looking at becoming certified as sustainable so that vineyards and winemakers will be able to label their products as ‘certified sustainable’. That is really important and I know they are really working on that. I just wanted to do a bit of a plug for McLaren Vale because it is a wonderful region. I would encourage all members to visit, and I am happy to give you a guided tour at any time. It is a wonderful place.
In all seriousness, I come back to some specific elements of this bill in terms of Australia’s agreement with the European Community on the trade in wine. This is a significant agreement and I must congratulate the minister for securing the negotiations. The minister has done a lot of work, including signing agreements with Hong Kong and China to ensure access to those markets for Australian wine. Agreements like these make a real difference to growers and winemakers in Kingston. I thank the minister also for visiting the McLaren Vale region and speaking with growers and winemakers on many occasions. He has certainly shown a very active interest in my local area.
The Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill includes a whole raft of measures for the industry. These benefits flow both ways in our wine trade. Some will be felt here at home by consumers of Australian and European wines. Any measures that make it easier for someone in Europe to identify and buy a McLaren Vale shiraz must be a good thing.
The first key change provided for in this bill is the European recognition of an additional 16 Australian winemaking techniques and the institutionalisation of a process for future approval of winemaking techniques as they evolve. For a country with a cutting-edge industry this agreement is particularly important so that our evolving and world-best winemaking practice is both recognised and enjoyed by European consumers.
The agreement includes a provision for simplified labelling of geographical indications. Most consumers of wine will know that geographical indications—the GIs—are very important in the labelling of wine, and guide a whole lot of decisions in the purchase of wines. This bill simplifies the labelling requirements of Australian wine in Europe and accords protection to Australia’s existing 112 registered geographical indications. These amendments will ensure the protection of Australia’s GIs in Europe and see that the translation of GIs from Europe meets Australia’s international obligations under the World Trade Organization Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of International Property Rights. The amendments provide rules for the protection of European GIs and the translation of European GIs from their source country language. The amendments also provide rules to cover the traditional expressions used by European winemakers in their labelling.
Finally, the bill also introduces provisions for determining GIs. All of these changes are very important when you consider the significance of GIs that have already been given, such as champagne. One practice that will be stamped out by this bill is the misleading and deceptive use of GIs in some of the European wine labelling. I know that many consumers get confused. Confusion is not used often by European winemakers in their labelling practices but it does happen and these amendments resolve issues around the meaning of false, misleading and deceptive practices, traditional expressions and protected terms, including providing exceptions for common English words in the false and misleading provisions relating to the sale, export or import of wine. This should prevent European winemakers using technicalities to label their wine as coming from a region when it does not, and should reduce the confusion for Australian wine consumers.
A technical amendment relating to the European community agreement is the replacement of the previous register for protected names with a new register of protected geographical indications and other terms. This change is important to bring into practice everything I have been discussing and will ensure the protection of GIs, traditional expressions, wine quality terms and additional terms, so that the Australian consumer is not duped by misleading labelling. I have to say that this bill has been welcomed. I know that some people want to get better at wine tasting and start to learn what all the experts are talking about when they use words like ‘peppery’. Certainly, I think that clearer labelling of the types of wine that people are drinking can only enhance the experience for consumers.
Before I conclude, I want to briefly mention the non-agreement related amendments introduced by this bill. The first is the strengthening of the Label Integrity Program for a system that will allow the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation to trace a batch of wine from the retailer to the vineyard and confirm that the details that appear on the label are consistent at each point of the supply chain. These amendments will be important in maintaining the positive perception of Australian wine both domestically and internationally. An extension of the Label Integrity Program will mean that Australian and European wine consumers can be confident of the accuracy of claims regarding vintage, variety or region of origin.
In addition to these changes, the bill provides for a broader range of injunction powers for the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation so that it can deal with anyone engaging in conduct that compromises the integrity of the Australian wine industry. We do know that the Australian wine industry has a very good reputation overseas as well as here in Australia. This measure is important to make sure that that reputation is not compromised.
In conclusion, the Australian wine industry includes over 2,200 winemakers supported by 8,000 grape growers in 112 distinct geographical wine regions. These winemakers and grape growers and Australian consumers will welcome this bill. The bill will ensure that the integrity the Australian wine industry enjoys will be maintained both here in Australia and, importantly, in the export market in Europe. It will also ensure that consumers here in Australia can be confident that wine coming from Europe is exactly what the label says it is. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN WINE AND BRANDY CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Oakeshott, Rob, MP",IND,2010-05-24,"—I also rise to support the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill 2009 and put on the record some thoughts from a boutique winegrowing region. It still surprises me that, apart from connoisseurs, people do not know that there is a very active, emerging, organised winegrowing community on the mid-North Coast of New South Wales. I am probably the only member here not laying claim to representing the premier region amongst the battle of the valleys—you have all done it! But I put on the record that there are some new locations snapping at the heels of many of those valleys throughout Australia and the more recognised premier brands. The mid-North Coast of New South Wales is certainly in that category. We have a desire to grow. I am pleased the growers themselves are now organised. That spirit of working together will enable the region itself to grow and emerge. With beaches, rivers and a wonderful lifestyle to throw in with your bottle of red or white, the mid-North Coast brand is an attractive option for a growing number of people to try.
The bill is important for many of my boutique wines because some are involved in the export market and are incredibly sensitive to two things that public policy can deliver for them. One is export marketing and the work done by various agencies such as Austrade and any other overseas entities of the Australian government that can help gain access to or grow markets such as the European Community. The second is tax. It is an ongoing issue for boutique wineries and, I might add, boutique breweries that how government sets its policy agenda is sometimes targeted towards the bigger players—the big winemaking regions or the big producers—and quite often public policy is driven by those large volumes.
However, I ask for consideration in matters of taxation of small-scale farming and the role that small-scale farming plays in the growth of the Australian economy and in the growth and diversity of branding in things such as wine exporting and agreements with international areas such as the one we have before us tonight. This bill is, I hope, beyond partisan in its support throughout this chamber. The changes it represents are sensible, and hopefully they will continue to grow the Australian wine industry story.
I was first elected to a state parliament in 1996, and the wine industry went through the roof, so I lay claim to everyone’s dancing with joy at my state election and having a nice bottle of red. I also noticed that when I first got into the federal parliament, in 2008, the wine industry bounced back from some tough years. So I am pleased to do my bit to contribute to the growth of the industry, and hopefully we will continue to see that trend rise and the Australian brand continue, not only domestically but internationally, to show itself off as a brand of value and quality and one that we can all be proud of whether we are wine drinkers or not.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN WINE AND BRANDY CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2010-05-24,"—It is also a pleasure for me to speak on the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill 2009. It has wide support across the parliament and also across the industry and the sector. It has that support because it is a sensible bill that brings into line a number of agreements between Australia and the European Community on our trade in wine, which has been a long time in development. While in 2008 and 2004 there were particular agreements, this bill in 2010 brings into line some gaps in those previous bills. The amendments in this bill are good and provide some clarity on definitions, particularly, as we have heard from other speakers on this bill—and I will not traipse over the same territory—in terms of geographic indicators of where wine originates, countries of origin and so forth.
There are a number of important points to make. Traditional thinking in this country would probably tell people that it was the Europeans rather than Australia who were trying to protect their wine brands, their labels and their geographical indicators. But I am more than happy to say that I think that balance sheet is truly now pointing more in our favour. Australia now wants to protect its geographical indicators, brands and labelling and provide that confidence and security so that when people overseas buy Australian wine it is exactly what it says it is—it is labelled correctly, there is the assurance of quality and there are all of those things that Australia is very famous for.
People may be surprised to realise that 60 per cent of Australia’s production of wine is exported and that Australia’s exports to the European Community represent 397 million litres of wine with a value of about $1.3 billion, which is quite substantial. In comparison, we only import approximately 17 million litres of wine with a value of about $197 million. That is probably not what people traditionally think of as the balance of trade in wine between our countries. I fully accept the principle that places like Champagne in France want to protect that particular name and that particular product and what it represents as much as we in Australia want to protect brands such as Penfolds, Henschke or others—Three Rivers, for example, which is probably not that well known to many people even in Australia but is one of our most famous Australian labels—in different areas.
We have heard a number of people speak about the importance of this bill in amending the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act. It has gone through a proper review process and, as I said, it is well supported. In fact, there are a number of letters to the minister congratulating the minister and supporting this bill. It does the right things for not only our trade with the European community but also Australian wine. It also meets all of our international obligations under the World Trade Organisation—obligations that Australia is doing very well in keeping in order. The bill is also, as I said before, quite important in preventing the misuse of Australian labels.
It is also important to note the significant advantages that this legislation brings to Australian wine producers, not only in the wine itself but also in the technology that we export overseas. It may surprise a number of people, but countries like France and others are regular users of Australian winemaking technology, and have been for a number of years. We bring to the table expertise in manufacturing processes, in consistent quality and in procedures. We have for quite a number of years been exporting our technology, which is reimported to Australia through the product.
We heard before a number of comments from the member for Kingston, who has a very famous winemaking region in her electorate in South Australia, and from the member for Forde, who spoke about Queensland wines. I too am from Queensland, and the quality and level of winemaking that we have in Queensland is probably not well-known even in that state. It is not famous for it today, but I think sometime in the future Queensland wine will be known for its quality. I recently did a wine tour with a group of branch members just up the road, in the electorate of Forde. We went to the Tamborine Mountain winery area. I was actually quite surprised at the level of quality at the cellar doors, not just in the white wines, which tend to be traditionally better than the reds, but also in the reds. What I found there was a thriving industry, creating local tourism, and a real bonus to the area. I have to be honest—I had not expected the quality of wine that I found; it is something that can be promoted right across Australia and even overseas.
We have other wine success stories much closer to my electorate in Ipswich. Warrego Wines and others for a number of years have been working on wine technology, consistency and quality. They are using mixed grapes from a variety of regions and crushing on site grapes that they grow locally. Again, these boutique wines may not be well known across Australia but they are certainly very good quality. Wines that we export overseas are probably more famous internationally than they are in their own home state.
All in all, we have a thriving wine and grape industry in Australia. It is great for us locally in terms of tourism and great for Australian produce. Due to the sheer numbers and volume that we export internationally, the industry needs to be properly administered and protected, and that is what this bill does. As I said earlier, it is supported across the House, it is bipartisan and it was done in consultation with the sector. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN WINE AND BRANDY CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2010-05-24,"—I rise to speak on the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill 2009, which contains three schedules to align the penalties in the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980 regarding offence provisions and the use of penalty units as a replacement for fixed dollar amounts.
The purpose of the first schedule of the amendments contained in this bill is to make the necessary changes to the Australian legislation to bring the Australia-European Community Agreement on Trade in Wine into force. This schedule amends the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980 and the Trade Marks Act 1995 and will ensure winemakers have continued access to Australia’s largest export market. This will come as a benefit to all Australian wine producers, as it will give them European recognition of an additional 16 Australian winemaking techniques. It will also simplify arrangements for approving winemaking techniques that may be developed in the future.
The purpose of the second schedule of amendments to the AWBC Act is to further protect Australia’s reputation for the production of wines of quality and integrity. This is the key to our future in exporting wines. This will be achieved by strengthening the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation’s Label Integrity Program. This schedule will simplify labelling requirements and create protection within Europe for Australia’s 112 registered geographical indicators. Under this amendment, wholesalers will have five years to sell stock labelled with EC GI and retailers will be able to sell all of their stock.
The third schedule corrects a number of weaknesses with the compliance provisions of the AWBC Act that have been identified. The changes to the compliance provision will strengthen the AWBC’s ability to stop people from engaging in ways that are contrary to the act and enable the AWBC to pass on information to others who could enforce the laws relating to wine and health.
The coalition is supportive of this legislation, but there are a number of factors currently facing the wine industry that I and the coalition also believe need to be acknowledged and addressed by the government. The wine industry in my electorate of Forrest is a very compact but very high-quality unit-value contributor to the national wine industry, with the Margaret River region recognised internationally as a producer of premium and ultra-premium wines.
During 2008 the estimated value of grape production in the south-west region was $67.8 million. The Margaret River wine region accounts for most of the viticulture production in the south-west of WA with 67.1 per cent of the total tonnage coming from the area. The south-west viticulture industry produces both white and red grape varieties with 26,259 tonnes and 24,000-plus tonnes crushed respectively in 2008. But the wine industry stretches right throughout the south-west from Harvey to Ferguson Valley and all the areas in between.
I recently conducted a survey of the wine industry in parts of my electorate that are currently facing some challenges and one of the major findings from the survey was the concerns and negative impact the new wine industry award is having on all of the wineries in my electorate. One winery owner stated:
The penalty rates in the modern award are a financial impost.
Our cellar business is in ‘wine tourism’—public holidays and weekends are the busiest and we will be unable to afford to pay the loadings required. THIS WILL COST JOBS!
Another winery owner stated that the new award is:
… confusing and very unworkable for both employers and employees in the industry.
On the issue of award modernisation processes I would also like to refer the minister to Tassell Park Wines in my electorate, which has been unable to receive clarification as to whether their winery business is covered under the new wine industry award or not. Tassell Park Wines, a family trust which has a corporate company as the trustee, has been in contact with both the Fair Work Ombudsman and the Chamber of Commerce in Western Australia seeking clarification on whether their business is covered under the new wine industry award. On both occasions, which concerned me greatly, they were advised to seek legal advice—that neither of these bodies could give them the definitive advice that they needed—and this would be at their expense. I call on the government to give Tassell Park Wines a simple answer as to whether or not they are covered by the new national award system.
Another issue consistently raised in my survey was the overwhelming supply within the market, also known as the wine glut. An article in the weekend edition of the Financial Review in May stated:
No longer able to sustain plunging prices for their fruit—or unable to sell it at all—an increasing number of grape growers will this winter begin ripping up vineyards as a persistent wine glut, high Australian dollar, a deluge of New Zealand wine imports and increased dominance by the supermarket chains conspire to erode profitability.
The article also quotes Wine Grape Growers Association executive director, Mark McKenzie, stating that he expects a further 3,000 to 5,000 hectares of wine grapes to be pulled out in areas including a part of the south-west in WA and central and western New South Wales. In another article also in the Financial Review, Mr McKenzie said that of Australia’s 165,000 hectares of wine grapes about 40,000 hectares should be pulled out.
A majority of the growers who have responded to my survey believe that the current wine glut is one of the major constraints to profitability. One winery owner summed up his situation by stating:
There will be on-going financial hardship until some kind of balance is restored—the industry is currently unviable.
The wine industry in my electorate of Forrest is suffering as a result of the current state of and pressures on the wine industry. A number of vineyards and wineries have been sold recently or are on the market and some smaller operators have not been able to lock in long-term fruit contracts. The cheap imports from New Zealand have led local growers in my electorate to launch a marketing campaign called Summer with the Locals to promote their wine and the local industry. I understand that 19 WA producers have contributed more than $100,000 towards the campaign. Campaign instigator, Jeff Burch from Howard Park Winery, was quoted in an article in the West Australian:
I got sick of seeing advertisements using the principle of banding whereby a good and respected quality WA wine was being offered with a cheap import …
We are not asking people to buy wine—
from WA—
out of a sense of parochialism but because we produce such a superior product …
As a result of cheap overseas wine imports, some wineries have been forced to reduce the price that they charge for what is a quality product. The Australian Financial Review reported on 30 January this year that Western Australian wines were selling from between $17 to $22 three years ago and are now advertised for $12.99 or lower. As you can see, Mr Deputy Speaker, there are significant issues that need to be researched and acted on to ensure the sustainability of the Australian wine industry.
In my electorate a five-point plan has been developed to assist the sustainability of the wine industry in the south-west region. The plan targets five key areas: strengthening of the domestic markets; expansion of export markets; building on the strategy of the overall Australian wine industry that combines a rigorous business- and return-driven approach, with quality and innovation; gaining a strong high-end position by cooperating with wine industry associations and national bodies; and developing partnerships with all levels of government to ensure that the south-west wine region is supported through liquor licensing trade facilitation and market access planning, environmental and business regulation, and taxation. This five-point plan aims at assisting south-west wine producers through the present and emergent issues currently facing the industry and facing the industry in the future. As we know, the main export markets for WA wines are the UK and the USA. Smaller niche markets established in Asian countries also contribute quite significantly to the local industry—even China.
While I am here, I briefly want to acknowledge the Dardanup Art Spectacular Trail and Exhibition that combined two very interesting factors: wine and art. This was a program in the Ferguson Valley where you could pick up a brochure and follow the art and the wine together, right throughout the Ferguson Valley. There was some wonderful entertainment at a sundowner, including a jazz band. It was a great way of promoting not only the south-west and our quality wines but also the great art and the experience of being in the south-west.
I support this legislation as a positive step for the industry, bringing the Australia-EC Agreement on Trade in Wine into force and protecting Australia’s reputation, particularly that of my electorate of Forrest, in producing wines of quality and integrity.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN WINE AND BRANDY CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Hale, Damian, MP",ALP,2010-05-24,"—I stand today to make my contribution to the government’s Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill 2009 which will amend the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980 to allow the Australia-European Community Agreement on Trade in Wine to come into force. In addition to this it will further protect Australia’s reputation for the production of wines of quality and integrity by strengthening the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation’s Label Integrity Program and correct, via updates and modernisation of the previous legislation, numerous weaknesses within the compliance provisions of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Act 1980.
On 1 December 2000 the Australia-European Community Agreement on Trade in Wine was signed by Stephen Smith, the Minister for Foreign Affairs. For many this date will be forever remembered for a simple stroke of a pen that concluded the long and drawn out negotiations. The signing of the agreement represents the culmination of protracted negotiations spanning some 14 years, since the signing of the original agreement in 1994—an agreement which left much to be desired. The new agreement finalises negotiations on numerous issues from the initial agreement that were never of a satisfactory standard. This includes issues such as geographical indications and traditional expressions. Fortunately, after 14 long years in which extensive consultations were conducted with the Australian wine industry, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Attorney-General’s office, IP Australia and the Australian Government Solicitor, these issues have been resolved.
The agreement represents a solution to every problem and loophole found in the agreement signed in 1994. Effectively, it fixes the problems that the previous agreement did not, taking a very positive step in supporting and strengthening not only the Australian wine industry but also the ties it has with its European counterpart and the large, lucrative European market. As the Winemakers Federation of Australia noted, this agreement ushers in a new era of cooperation with the European Union, which will not just bring mutual benefits for our respective wine industries but also help cement wider relations.
As the Winemakers Federation of Australia has said, the agreement represents a positive step in building stronger relationships with the European Union, but it is important to remember that this is not the only positive to come out of the negotiations and the final agreement. There are also many other benefits that have come as a result, benefits that the winemakers of Australia are keen to realise. The numerous key benefits to Australia’s wine producers are the European recognition of an additional 16 Australian winemaking techniques, simpler arrangements for approving winemaking techniques that may be developed into the future, simplified labelling requirements, European protection of 112 Australian registered geographical indications, labelling requirements for Australian wines sold in European markets and an effective dispute resolution system for trade related disputes.
The method by which the agreement has brought about these benefits is through the clarification of the intention of the original agreement by redefining, expanding and strengthening a number of provisions, the most important being the assurance of the preservation of Australia’s reputation as a producer of wines of quality and integrity. This also allows the promotion and enhancement of Australian winemakers’ assets in the large and valuable European market, which was worth over $1.3 billion in exports in 2007-08 alone, representing over half of Australia’s wine exports for that year.
In summary, this agreement basically allows producers to make fewer changes and concessions to sell their wines in the European Community. As a result of this easing of trade barriers, Australian winemakers’ techniques will be accepted and the requirements for everything from labelling and blending rules to alcohol levels will be much simpler. It effectively means the European Community implicitly recognises the provenance and prestige of Australian wines. For the winemakers of Australia this means that they can now market themselves independently. No longer will they need to hide behind European names. They can stand freely and be recognised. For wineries in Australia this is perhaps one of the most positive outcomes of this agreement. It will allow them to stand alone as a representation of their own independence and quality in the valuable European market.
However, despite all the benefits that this agreement will provide to winemakers in Australia, amendments must be made to our domestic legislation to bring them into effect, amendments that are presented in this bill. This fact alone demonstrates how important the bill is to winemakers. It represents an excellent opportunity for winemakers here in Australia to capitalise on the potential of the agreement. The first of these amendments is purely to ensure that the protection of geographical indications and translations of geographical indications meet Australia’s international obligations under the World Trade Organisation Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights. The changes will provide rules for the protection of foreign countries’ geographical indications, translations of foreign countries’ geographical indications and traditional expressions and the introduction of provisions by determining geographical indications.
The changes also provide a determination process for foreign countries’ geographical indications and translations of geographical indications. These amendments will effectively protect Australian and European wine distributors from misuse in Australia. In addition, the amendments also resolve issues regarding the meaning of ‘false, misleading and deceptive practices’ in relation to geographical indications. These are all very important amendments in this bill.
Section 42 makes it an offence to sell, export or import wine in trade or commerce with false description. This is to ensure the geographical indications, traditional expressions, quality wine terms and other terms that are protected under the agreement have adequate protection against misuse. Under the current system the mental element of intention must be presented in order to prosecute someone for selling, importing or exporting a wine with a false or misleading description and presentation. This meant that if a person could provide incontestable evidence that they had no intention to mislead they would avoid liability. The amendments change the offence provisions to make it an offence if the sale, importation or exportation of wines is performed with the party or parties being reckless to the fact that the wine was false or misleading in its description and presentation. By changing the fault element to recklessness, the barrier to prosecution can be improved, making it easier to take action against any parties that commit this offence. It also brings offence provisions in line with the Criminal Code Act 1995.
Other changes extend record keeping requirements for the members of the grape and wine supply chain, whose actions are captured by the Label Integrity Program which operates under the Australian Wine and Brandy Act. The changes to the Label Integrity Program will benefit both consumers and the Australian wine industry by helping to ensure that Australian wine labels are truthful and accurate in relation to their origin and characteristics. Implementing this system will allow the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation to trace a batch of wine from the retailer to the vineyard and confirm details that appear on the label are consistent at each point of the supply chain. This coverage will be extended to all wines. The additional reporting requirements for those captured by the Label Integrity Program will not be onerous, will not increase the reporting demands on the supply chain and will reflect was is generally considered to be sound business reporting practice. By having records at each point of the supply chain the integrity of the label can be confirmed. These amendments will strengthen the Label Integrity Program and increase the veracity of labels.
Another important change is to the compliance provisions in the bill. Changes will be made to rectify identified weaknesses in the compliance provisions of the Australian Wine and Brandy Act. The objective of these changes is to provide the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation with the means to protect the reputation of the Australian wine industry for quality. Where a person is performing actions that may be contrary to the act, the change will provide the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation with the power to apply an injunction to stop or to direct a person engaging in an action that may be contrary to the objects of the act.
All of these amendments culminate in a representation of every area that needs to be changed to maximise the benefit for the Australian wine industry and maximise its potential to expand further into the prosperous European market. It has become quite clear, through support of this bill from the wine industry, that they are very keen to see these changes come into force. The Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation, as the responsible authority, requested the amendments, which are supported by the Winemakers Federation of Australia, the national representative body of winemakers. This federation holds voluntary membership from parties that represent 95 per cent of the wine produced in Australia. The amendments will have been discussed and supported by the Legislation Review Committee of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation, which consists of representatives from the Wine Federation of Australia, an independent lawyer and representatives of the major wine companies in Australia. The representative group, Wine Grape Growers Australia, also attended the committee and supported the amendments, including the requirement the wine grape growers keep a record of geographical indication in which the grapes were grown. The legislation review committee advised that the industry would derive considerable benefits from the enhanced Label Integrity Program and improved compliance provisions that will assist in preserving Australia’s reputation as a producer of wines of quality and integrity.
This bill, which is widely supported by all the parties involved in the agreement negotiation process, will not only bring the agreement into force and allow the winemakers to benefit from the outcome of over a decade of negotiations but also provide improvements in label integrity and in the compliance provisions. With so much support for the bill from within the very industry it will regulate, it seems infallible that the bill will serve only to benefit the Australian wine industry and is thus worthy of receiving royal assent. The sooner it does, the sooner the Australia-European Community Agreement on Trade in Wine can enter into force and the sooner the Australian wine industry can start to enjoy the benefits that come with it, as well as the other benefits that will arise from the bill—benefits that have been long deserved by all of Australia as well as the Australian wine industry. For people working in the wine industry anywhere in Australia, whether it be in the Barossa Valley, the Margaret River area or the districts of winemakers in southern parts or in the Northern Territory, this bill is good news. I must admit that I googled to see if there was a winery in my electorate of Solomon, and its phone has been disconnected. The bill represents a positive step into a new, prosperous era for the wine industry of Australia. Having said that, I might just go and enjoy a nice glass of shiraz over dinner. I will finish those comments there. I fully support the bill and I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN WINE AND BRANDY CORPORATION AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,23,1,speech
"Burke, Tony, MP",ALP,2010-05-24,"—in reply—I thank all the members who have contributed to the debate on the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation Amendment Bill 2009, most of whom have referred to the importance of the industry within their own electorate—although the most recent speaker, the member for Solomon, living in Darwin, has a limited number of vineyards in his electorate. Notwithstanding that, I am very grateful for all the comments that were made.
A lot of the themes of the contributions which have been made have gone well beyond the ambit of the bill, but importantly they have referred to some of the challenges that we have at the moment with a glut on the wine market in Australia. I want in particular to acknowledge the contribution made by the member for Barker, who acknowledged the importance of the wine industry’s need to be able to restructure and also noted that it was not for government to take control of that restructure; it is something for industry to do themselves. I do not think any of us want to repeat the mistakes of years gone past, when governments first of all paid people to pull out their vines and then provided tax incentives for them to put them back in, leading to another wine glut, which we are in now. There are some challenges which appropriately rest with industry and some challenges where government can play an important role. This bill represents one of the areas where we can play an important role.
The bill has a number of roles. Importantly, it implements the agreement between Australia and the EU on trade in wine. In that agreement, the Europeans wanted to make sure there was protection of their geographical indications and traditional expressions. In exchange for that, we wanted to make sure that they would recognise the need to simplify their labelling requirements for Australian wines and to protect our geographical indications from incorrect use in the European market. The bill strengthens the Label Integrity Program and rectifies weaknesses in the compliance provisions.
Some people have made reference in passing during the debate to the fact that this bill has been delayed, but thankfully no-one has complained about that delay. The delay was for the very good reason—I know that the member for Eden-Monaro referred to this—that there was a dispute and a disagreement between us and the Europeans over some particular varieties. The bill was stalled in the parliament here while that dispute was resolved. Now that there is agreement between us and the EU, we have a situation where the bill is again able to proceed.
As a result of these amendments, consequential amendments will need to be made to the Trade Marks Act 1995 to enable trademark owners to amend their marks where necessary. The bill also, as I said, amends provisions of the Label Integrity Program, including strengthening record-keeping requirements for those involved in the production, distribution and sale of wine and wine grapes and ensuring that the offence provisions which apply to those who make a false or misleading claim relating to the vintage, variety or geographical indication of a wine are appropriate. Once again, I want to note that although the changes to the Label Integrity Program are important and necessary they do not place onerous requirements on industry and they are fully supported by industry.
The bill also proposes a number of changes to the compliance provisions of the act, which have stemmed from problems which have been identified in the current arrangements. These amendments will strengthen the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation’s ability to stop a person from engaging in action that may be contrary to the act, while also providing the power to pass on information obtained under the act to others who may have a role in enforcing the laws relating to wine and health.
I take the opportunity to thank those involved in the AWBC, both those who work for it and those who chair and serve on the board, for the contributions that they make. I thank the various members who have spoken in the debate for their commitment to the industry, whether it be a commitment through their connection to producers or through their connection to consumers. In either case, the bill puts industry on a stronger footing and I am grateful for the bipartisan support which has been shown during the course of this debate. I commend the bill to the House.

"Robb, Andrew, MP",LP,2010-05-24,"—I rise to speak on the Ministers of State Amendment Bill 2010. I will not take up much of the time of the Main Committee. This is a non-controversial bill and I am not very keen to spend too much time on the record speaking about parliamentary salaries. Section 66 of the Constitution requires a specific appropriation of money to pay for the additional salaries of ministers and parliamentary secretaries. In the past this has required new amending bills each time executive salaries have risen beyond the set appropriation. This bill increases the maximum amount potentially payable under section 66 of the Constitution for the salaries of ministers, including parliamentary secretaries, for the current financial year and for later financial years to $3.5 million. It is currently $3.2 million. It will also allow future increases in the appropriation to be made by regulation, which in my view is a sensible measure. I commend the bill.",REPS,<title>MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Laming, Andrew, MP",LP,2010-05-24,"—I will happily rise and talk about legislation that effectively moves to allow the increase in the salaries of ministers and to make further increases subject to regulation, because how can a government propose legislation like this with a record of 2½ years not of incompetence, not of impotence but of shameful and hideous waste? How can any minister in this government support this legislation when they have a record of having watched billions of taxpayers dollars burnt away to nothing, with nothing to show for it except smouldering ruins in their own portfolios? I am looking for one government minister to come in here and justify that pay rise under a Prime Minister who in his first year in power froze all parliamentary salaries in seeking out a headline for a day. He froze those salaries and then, when we were in the midst of an economic recovery, when we most needed to stimulate the economy, he allowed the salaries to rise again. That is what I call countercyclical economic policy, if ever I have seen it. This is a Prime Minister who says one thing and then does something completely different. This is a Prime Minister who has presided over spin and inputs rather than wins and outcomes.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I know that the honourable member can talk under water, which is why I am taking this point of order. He is not allowed to do that or range wide. He needs to be brought to the details of the bill, which are quite restrictive. I ask that you bring him to order.
—The member will refer his comments to the bill.
—I will defend my right to speak to the Ministers of State Amendment Bill 2010 if it pertains to increasing the salaries of incompetent ministers. Let us do them one by one. Why doesn’t the minister for the environment step in here and justify his salary increase that is part of this bill. This is a minister who burnt off $2.45 billion—not million—on home insulation and could not get it right. This is a minister who set it at $1,600 per household. Some of these were 40 square metres. He amped up the price of home insulation from $4 per square metre to nearly $8 per square metre, mostly gouged, and then employed thousands of people who relied on the word of our Prime Minister to lay out and roll out that program. It was guaranteed to run until 31 December 2011 but it crashed in a heap because they could not monitor the training component. Show me the education minister who is meant to train those installation advisers.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: the speaker opposite is abusing his position when speaking on this bill. He is only entitled to speak on the generic details of this bill, which relate to a generic increase across the whole of the ministry and relate to a regulation being added about future increases. It does not allow him to go into the level of bluster that he is going into now. I would ask you to call him into order—otherwise, he will have 50 points of order. He will not be able to open his mouth to say more than two or three words, and that is not the intent of this debate.
—I would ask the member to return to the facts of the bill.
—These frivolous points of order I will contest. Let me read through this. It says ‘parliamentarian’s base pay’. I am saying these ministers have not even justified an increase, and these ministers have certainly not justified the right to make future increases on regulation, when for 2½ years they have not even given value for money. I will continue to go through these achievements. We have a record in education of $1.6 billion going down the hole, completely unaccounted for in school blowouts. We have $25,000 being spent per square metre on school halls—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point of order: the speaker, I submit to you, is in effect speaking against your ruling on speaking to this particular bill. If he continues in the way he is, there might be other forms that we will use. I do not want to stop him speaking on the generics, but it is abuse. I also note the other point on the substance of what he is saying. The former speaker from the opposition indicated the opposition is supporting this bill. If you listened to this speaker, you would think he is opposing the bill, and that is a further consideration I would ask you to take into account in bringing him to order. I am reluctant to do this. I have rarely done it in the 20 years I have been in this place, but this is an abuse.
—I must rule on that point of order. I do believe that you must return to the facts of the bill. So I would ask you to do that; otherwise, you may leave me with difficult choices.
—That is fine, Mr Deputy Speaker. I return to another element of the bill. Since 1952, this change to legislation has only been made a number of times. The last time it was done was in 2006. I would put to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the justification for bringing this legislation to this chamber cannot be supported, given the performance of these ministers. I am absolutely insistent that we have a situation, politically and historically, where, for the first time in Australia’s history, we have a government that has insisted on wasting enormous amounts of taxpayer resources, with extremely limited accountability, and then they have the effrontery at the end of their first political term, only months before an election, to demand a salary increase. If I were this government, I would be scurrying away from this place, trying to do everything I could to obfuscate the lack of achievement over these last 2½ years because it is a shameful record. I think that the records of this party, the records of this government, are extremely tenuous and to make the association—
—I have a question that I would like to ask the member, if he wants to take it.
—Are you prepared to take it?
—Yes.
—We have had a railing for the last six or seven minutes on each and every minister that he seeks to name, when dealing with this bill. Can I ask through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, whether it is a fact that this member is going to vote for this bill, or whether he is going to remain silent and do what his party has said it will do, which is support the bill—completely in contradiction to the things he is now placing before the committee. I refer to his former Prime Minister, John Howard, who issued an edict about truth being absolute as part of his 1996 election speech. What has this ranting and raving to do with how he is going to vote on the bill? How is he going to vote on this bill? Does he support the bill? Is he voting against it?
—Our position as opposition does not preclude me from pointing out many of the inconsistencies of the administration on the other side. I am within my rights to stay within the matters pertaining to this bill. In this case, it is ministerial salaries, the right to increase them and the right to make subsequent increases by regulation. I am simply, in the period of time allotted to me, pointing out the enormous waste that has occurred. Each of the ministers should be speaking to this bill but they have not come and done so. I ask the ministers who thought up the 2020 Summit to come and speak on this bill. I ask the ministers who are asking for a pay rise, who dreamt up GroceryWatch and Fuelwatch, to come and speak on this bill. But they are silent, and that in itself says something about the subconscious guilt that exists on the other side about their performance in the last 2½ years.
In effect, with respect to the member on the other side—and I have taken this question in good faith—they are simply too shy to come up and justify a pay increase. I would not mind if this were a government that had set out with some pretty big challenges and had done fairly well. I would not mind if this administration had actually been fairly incompetent but not wasteful. But, no, they have wasted enormous sums of money. To the average small business holder in this country they would say, ‘If the till is a little bit out, there are plenty of workers around who have been asked to make up the difference.’ But there is no minister who will take responsibility for the enormous waste that we have seen.
I will commend one minister. The member opposite will be pleased to know that this is not all a rant of criticism. There is one minister who definitely, on fiscal responsibility alone, deserves the pay rise. The best finance minister that the government has had in a very long time is their very own Minister for Health and Ageing, who has spent the last 2½ years bringing in Treasury bills to save money in the guise of health legislation. The best examples of that were the alcopops legislation, the cataracts legislation and the cuts to pathology funding. We have had no serious health reform to remove the overlap, the waste and the cost shifting between Commonwealth and states. No, there is none of that, which would make a more efficient health system. There is just a more bloated one with pre-election promises and a whole series of Treasury bills that have occupied our health minister for 2½ years.
The minister’s first year was completely consumed by the alcopops debate—fighting over whether we taxed tiny bottles of sweetened alcohol. Then it moved to trying halve the rebate on cataract surgery, which for three months left seniors in Australia having no Medicare rebate to assist them with a cataract operation. Then, of course, there was an idea from the blind side to gouge into pathology rebates for seniors, leaving many of them without bulk billing. If there is one minister who does deserve a pay rise, it is the health minister for being a very good finance minister. But that is a complete disaster for health, as you on the other side know. How many of the superclinics have been built? Three have been built and only two of them are operational. Even today, we had 50,000 services delivered Australia wide out of 150 million needed. It is a speck in the ocean. So for health, it is a big D; for being a finance minister, it may well be a B-plus.
Let us move onto the promises about whaling. Wouldn’t a minister wanting a pay rise admit that they had failed in their pre-election promise to actually take Japan to court? Instead we have this perpetual and tired—
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I continue to rise to say that the speaker needs to be pulled up. Not only is what he is saying irrelevant but he is being hypocritical. He has conceded that he is going to vote for this bill. More importantly, if he wanted to single out particular ministers, he would have a case if there were amendments before the chamber. There are no amendments being moved by the opposition, and I submit that that is further evidence that he is way off the mark and running a political argument, not an argument in relation to the bill. He should have moved an amendment. I have raised the point.
—I have asked the member to speak within the confines of the bill. I think perhaps, Member for Bowman, that you should bring your remarks to a conclusion.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker Ramsey. I will do that, because I have almost run out of billion-dollar blow-outs by this government. You are quite correct; my material is running thin. I am down to the National Broadband Network, the $4.7 billion that became $43 billion of money that this government cannot even find. I will finish with the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy, a person who has spent 2½ years trying to create an internet filter that, from any evaluation done in the private sector, no-one can actually see will work. We have an NBN that remains completely unfunded. We have only just seen a business plan. I do not think that minister can justify that either. I thank you for the latitude you have provided me with, Mr Deputy Speaker. I appreciate your understanding and sympathy and I think that one thing is very clear: no minister who is asking for this pay rise is prepared to stand up and justify it, and that is a great sign of their reluctance to stand up for their record.",REPS,<title>MINISTERS OF STATE AMENDMENT BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Kelly, Mike, MP",ALP,2010-05-24,"—in reply—I thank all members who have made a genuine contribution to this debate. Section 66 of the Constitution, which we are discussing here, prescribes the maximum annual amount that can be paid out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the salaries of ministers of state, unless the parliament provides otherwise. The parliament has otherwise provided for the maximum amount payable in section 5 of the Ministers of State Act 1952, which currently limits that amount to $3.2 million each financial year. This amount needs to be increased to $3.5 million to pay ministerial salaries at current levels for 2009-10 and for future financial years and to meet any additional expenditure such as payment of additional salaries for acting arrangements.
There have been 29 amendments to the amount set under section 5 of the Ministers of State Act 1952 since its introduction in 1952. This averages one amendment every two years. This section was last amended in 2006 and is therefore well overdue for the regular amendment. This constant cycle of amendments is not the most efficient way of dealing with this matter—as I think is agreed by both sides. Enabling the maximum sum available for ministerial salaries to be provided for by regulation obviates the need for recurrent amendments to the act. As such, regulations would be subject to disallowance and there will continue to be parliamentary scrutiny of any future changes to the amount. So I thank all members for their contributions and I commend the bill to the House.

"Markus, Louise, MP",LP,2010-05-24,"—I rise to acknowledge three young, passionate individuals from my local community who visited Parliament House two weeks ago to participate in the Make Poverty History awareness week. I had the pleasure of meeting with Zoe Tomaras from Kurrajong, who is a media and cultural studies student; Joel Clark from Blackheath, who is studying law and manages a local YMCA facility; and Caley Bawden from Katoomba, who is vice-captain at Wycliffe Christian School and has a passion for international policy development.
Around the globe more than 2.5 billion men, women and children live in grinding poverty on less than $2 a day. They suffer from chronic hunger and malnutrition, preventable diseases such as malaria, measles and tuberculosis, environmental degradation, low literacy rates and countless other social, public health, economic and political challenges.
The eight Millennium Development Goals that we must continue to promote and support are: to eradicate extreme poverty and hunger; to achieve universal primary education; to promote gender equality and empower women; to reduce child mortality; to improve maternal health; to combat HIV/AIDS, malaria, and other diseases; to ensure environmental sustainability and to develop a global partnership for development.
I commend Zoe, Joel and Caley and the other students who joined with them to help the Australian and international community draw attention to the importance of these goals. (Time expired)

"Morrison, Scott, MP",LP,2010-05-24,"—Sydney airport is vital economic infrastructure for Australia, for Sydney and, more importantly and specifically, for the Sutherland Shire, supporting thousands of local jobs. The long-term operating plan for Sydney airport, also known as LTOP, was an election commitment that the Howard government took to the 1996 election. It involves the principle of sharing aircraft noise around all areas surrounding Sydney airport, using different combinations of runway modes. Subject to safety and weather considerations, LTOP seeks to maximise the number of flights over water and non-residential areas. Within LTOP there are specific targets for the percentage of flights to be routed from and to the south—around 55 per cent—and equally from the east, the west and the north. The assumption is that flights to the south are over water—but, as those at Kurnell would know, those flights are over their places. It is also implicit in the assumption that 55 per cent of flights to the south are over water that the flight path predominantly used, other than for planes that come in directly over Kurnell, will be over water.
A key component of the plan to achieve this objective was the way in which flights are intended to track when landing from the south. Approaching from the north, they are intended to track east of the airport—out to sea, off the coast—before looping around and landing from the south along the two parallel runways. On this route they do substantively travel over water. LTOP became a legal obligation for Airservices Australia when it was made the subject of a ministerial directive referred to in a motion by the then transport Minister John Sharp in 1997. Following the last election an announcement was made by Sydney airport that construction works were required at the western end of the east-west runway to erect a jet blast barrier. These were important and necessary safety works. Following consultation and approval by the minister for transport, requiring a series of worthy safeguards for the project, the project was agreed to and allowed to proceed.
A key element of the approval was to ensure a fair sharing of aircraft noise during the construction phase due to the restricted use of the east-west runway. An environmental impact statement was also done as part of this process. The project got underway in the latter part of 2008 with the goodwill of the communities that would be affected. For shire residents, a key issue was that the government should be held to the promise that—and I quote from the Sydney airport release—‘as soon as the construction is complete, normal airport operations and noise-sharing arrangements will resume’. As the project proceeded, many residents from Kareela and the nearby suburbs of Sylvania, Jannali, Miranda, Gymea Bay and Grays Point contacted me to register their opposition to the increase in aircraft noise over their homes. I raised this issue with Airservices Australia and they told me that these flights were normal and not subject to any LTOP obligations. That was plainly not true. They were definitely subject to LTOP obligations, as required over many years.
The publication of operational statistics for Sydney airport told me a very different story to the one initially presented by Airservices Australia. It showed that there was a direct concentration of flights over the area that was affected and from which the complaints were originating. The increased noise was the result of the increased use of a standard arrival route known as Boree 4. It showed that there had been an increase in the concentration of flights on that route from 2.8 per cent of arrivals to 7.8 per cent of total arrivals in just a 12-month period. I call it ‘Labor’s highway in the sky’. Once again, this route applies to landing from the south but, rather than going to the east of the airport and out to sea, the planes are flying directly through the member for Lowe’s electorate, right down through the member for Watson’s electorate and the member for Barton’s electorate and across my electorate in the shire. They are supposed to be flying over those areas at a height of 6,000 feet before looping around and landing from the south. The problem with this approach is not only that it is against the principles of LTOP—which were put in place and which this motion seeks to have applied—but also that there has been a constant struggle to ensure the community gets access to information about what they know to be really happening on the ground.
These flights arrive during the early part of the morning, particularly in the curfew shoulder period and between six and seven. What we have been able to establish through the Sydney Airport Community Forum is that not only has this been happening, and it has been a real experience, but also, since the construction project that was blamed for the increase in noise has been completed, the noise continues. So we have been asked to ensure that the government provide the information that will confirm what people know on the ground: this flight noise is continuing because the government has not changed the flight paths back to normal, as was suggested, and the community is calling on them to do just that—to return aircraft operations at Sydney Airport to normal, as promised.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS’ BUSINESS</title>,<title>Sydney Airport Long Term Operating Plan</title>,Private Members' Business,26,1,speech
"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2010-05-24,"—I thank the member for Cook, through his motion this evening, for the opportunity to discuss the issue and the history of aircraft noise arising from Sydney Airport. As you know, Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, I have been campaigning long and loud for fair aircraft noise sharing for more than a decade in this place and also at the Sydney Airport Community Forum. I am somewhat astounded, astonished and amazed that the opposition would raise this issue, in light of the Howard government’s appalling 11½-year record of failing to address the concerns of the people I represent to the north of the airport. I make the point that the Howard government did very little to get Airservices Australia to fully implement the long-term operating plan.
I accept that the member for Cook was not here in the period during which I raised issues with the former government, so I will go over some of the history. I have prosecuted the case for many years on behalf of my constituents, both here and at SACF, as I said. Through all that time, the Howard government threw sand in my eyes. I remember well asking the then Deputy Prime Minister and minister for transport, John Anderson, hundreds of questions about the failure of Airservices Australia to meet the 17 per cent target of aircraft movements to and from the north of Sydney Airport. Mr Anderson eventually refused to answer my questions and arrogantly dismissed me and my constituents with the line, ‘The LTOP has been substantially implemented.’
The arrogance of the former, Howard government on this issue does not end there. The Howard government’s indifference to my constituents was plain for all to see when it sold its soul on this issue by selling the airport to the Southern Cross consortium, which included Macquarie Bank. The government sold the airport without community consultation and without requiring the 17 per cent movement target to the north to be met. Moreover, the Howard government claimed Sydney would not need a second airport for at least 20 years and approved the master plan for Kingsford Smith airport which has allowed substantial expansion of activity at the airport.
However, I can assure my constituents that the current minister for transport, the Hon. Anthony Albanese, has already established a joint planning task force with the New South Wales government to search for an appropriate site for a second airport and that it received $8.5 million in this year’s federal budget. I am also pleased to report, as the member for Cook knows, that Minister Albanese attended the Sydney Airport Community Forum last Friday and pointed out that the most recent figures from Airservices Australia show that aircraft movements to the north of the airport are the lowest they have been since the LTOP was introduced. In addition, I am pleased to report that the minister has reaffirmed our commitment to maintaining the curfew and cap on aircraft movements, ensuring respite for noise-affected residents. Furthermore, the minister has announced that older and noisier jet aircraft will be banned from Sydney Airport from 1 September, including the noisy Boeing 727 freight plane that currently flies over thousands of Sydney homes late on weeknights. The minister has also announced the establishment of an aircraft noise ombudsman to give residents more than an automated voice recording to lodge a complaint, and to improve the dissemination of information. My local community campaigned on this very issue, and I thank the minister for listening to their call.
It is also very important to note, particularly for the member for Cook, that the Sydney Airport Community Forum will be retained, because our government recognises the importance of community consultation. These measures highlight the fact that the minister and the government are serious about the concerns of aircraft noise affected residents and are acting to minimise the impact on our community. Minister Albanese, unlike former Howard transport ministers, is making a real difference.
I am very pleased with the actions of our government to minimise aircraft noise at Sydney Airport, particularly in light of the unforeseen closure of the east-west runway announced only days after the last federal election. It is timely to record at this point and to the House that before the last federal election the Howard government concealed its negotiations with Sydney Airport to close the east-west runway for the safety upgrade that the member for Cook talked about. He did not mention that first part. Due to the closure of the east-west runway, flight paths as prescribed in the LTOP were necessarily restricted. However, since the recent completion of the RESA project and the reopening of the east-west runway I have had feedback from constituents, and this improvement has been noticed and appreciated, as supported by Airservices statistics. I will, however, be campaigning to monitor closely the continued movements of flight paths over my electorate. (Time expired)

"Turnbull, Malcolm, MP",LP,2010-05-24,"—I am delighted to rise in support of the member for Cook’s motion today. Residents of Wentworth took on substantially increased aircraft noise in 1996, when the Sydney Airport Long Term Operational Plan, or LTOP, was established. As a consequence of the LTOP, Wentworth residents received two new departure flight paths and about 30 per cent of all take-offs.
In mid-2008, at the Sydney Airport Community Forum, my office was advised by Airservices Australia that in order to undertake runway upgrades—known at the Runway End Safety Area—Airservices Australia would implement from late 2008 a new runway configuration. Known as mode 15, this configuration directed increased departures over suburbs in Wentworth. However, we were assured that mode 15 would only be used for the specific period of the Runway End Safety Area works, and would then be discontinued.
It was with alarm that residents in my electorate read recently in both the Sydney Morning Herald and the Wentworth Courier that mode 15 could potentially be reintroduced. Last Friday, the minister for transport, Mr Albanese, announced at the Sydney Airport Community Forum that the mode 15 option remains on the table. This is not what we were told in mid-2008. It is very disappointing, considering our community’s preparedness to accept increased levels of noise during the airport upgrades. Mode 15 does not meet the objectives of the 1996 LTOP and the principle of fair and equitable noise sharing. I have written to the minister requesting that he clarify, as a matter of urgency, this position on the continued use of mode 15.
There were further concerns at the same Sydney Airport Community Forum last Friday. Members were given a brief presentation by Airservices Australia on new technology soon to be introduced to Sydney Airport. This system, called required navigation performance, has the potential to channel aircraft down corridors as narrow as 30 metres wide and to concentrate noise over a fewer number of flight paths than currently exist. A study is to begin into the environmental and noise implications of this technology; but, alarmingly, the recommendations will be the culmination of the findings across 28 airports in Australia and will not exclusively address the unique situation of Sydney Airport. No other airport in Australia confronts the same problems of aircraft noise as Sydney, with such a high density of residential development in such close proximity and the sheer numbers of commercial aircraft movements. At the meeting, the minister called for a cooperative approach to aircraft noise problems at Sydney Airport. If that is the case, this is not the approach he needs to employ. He needs to start listening to potentially affected residents and to those who represent them.
This brings me to my last point: the position of Aviation Community Advocate. If the government wanted to ensure that the interests of residents affected by aircraft noise in Sydney were given due consideration, then the single most useful thing it could do would be to reinstate the position of Aviation Community Advocate. The myriad issues arising from the operation of an airport are complex and are getting even more complex. It is unreasonable to expect any single member of the Sydney Airport Community Forum to be able to locate, monitor and research the reams of information that the operation of an airport of the magnitude of Sydney generates and to then evaluate in a timely manner the impact on local communities and to engage directly with the local communities. That is truly a full-time job, and correctly it is the role of the Aviation Community Advocate, a role the current minister sees little benefit in maintaining. He argues that no other airport has an aviation community advocate and that there are no funds available. Well, there is $1.6 million remaining from the airport noise levy program, funds which should continue to be used for the mitigation of airport noise. The role of the Aviation Community Advocate is in substantial measure devoted to reducing the impact of aircraft noise on residents, and these remaining funds should be released to reinstate immediately this vital position.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS’ BUSINESS</title>,<title>Sydney Airport Long Term Operating Plan</title>,Private Members' Business,26,1,speech
"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2010-05-24,"—It gives me great pleasure to get up and speak once again about airports and airport issues in Australia, especially because I have an airport in the middle of my electorate of Hindmarsh. In the case of Adelaide Airport and the residents of Hindmarsh, no matter where the flight paths change, how they change or what diversions are made, every single plane that lands at Adelaide Airport is at such a point that there is no diversion from the flight path because Adelaide Airport is situated in the middle of the electorate. Therefore, by the time they reach my electorate, they are actually landing. I have said in this place many times that the residents of Hindmarsh—in suburbs like Mile End, Richmond, Cowandilla, Glenelg North, West Beach and Henley Beach—can stand on their roofs and tickle the tummies of the airplanes as they go over their houses.
It is interesting to hear the members opposite and to hear the member for Cook, who obviously was not here in the last parliament, speak on this issue. On many occasions I raised the issue through questions on notice to the previous government and through letters to the then minister about an airport ombudsman. In fact, I moved two private member’s bills during the last parliament and on each occasion they were not raised within the federal parliament. They fell on the deaf ears of the former government. So I was very pleased when last year the aviation white paper was released under the Labor Rudd government and it included the establishment of an aircraft noise ombudsman. As I said, in opposition I moved a private member’s motion twice and twice it fell on deaf ears.
The white paper states the aircraft noise ombudsman is to be established in Airservices Australia to:
independently review noise complaints handling procedures and make recommendations for improvements where necessary; and
improve Airservices’ consultation arrangements and the presentation and distribution of aircraft noise-related information to the general public;
This is real action that has been taken by this government not only for the residents in my electorate but also for residents all over Australia. This is real action that will ensure residents have an independent voice. They will have an independent say through an independent body that is not related or governed by the government or by Airservices Australia. It will look at issues independently and come out with particular findings.
I was also very pleased that in the white paper the curfews that are currently operating around Australia are enshrined and that we have ensured that they will remain to ensure there is some stability in terms of noise around the country where residents live under the flight path and that there will be no change, especially to the Adelaide Airport curfew. We recently heard of the diversion of a Qantas plane that was flying from Canberra to Adelaide. It had to be diverted back to Canberra because approximately 10 to 15 minutes out of Adelaide the pilots asked for dispensation. The following day we had a whole range of people speaking out, including Michael Pengilly from the Liberal Party, who went on radio and said he wanted to get rid of the curfew. The Leader of the Opposition into South Australia, Isobel Redmond, said that we should look at the curfew and perhaps change the laws that exist. Here are people who have no understanding of what it is like to live under a flight path. They have absolutely no understanding of what it is like to hear jets go over your roof on a constant basis. I have lived under the flight path all of my life; I was born under the flight path. For many years we would run out to the front yard to see the planes that would fly over into Adelaide two or three times a week. Now they fly over two to three times every hour.
So I have to say that there have been some achievements under the Rudd Labor government. There was also the issue of banning noisy aircraft in and around Australia, and an announcement was made recently that from 1 July 2010 no new services using old, noisy freight jets will be allowed at Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth, Adelaide, Hobart, Darwin, Cairns, Gold Coast, Essendon, Newcastle (Williamtown), Avalon and Canberra airports, and from 1 September 2010 all existing services will cease at the Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne and Perth airports. This course of action was first foreshadowed in the aviation green paper in December 2008 under the Rudd Labor government and then restated as government policy in the aviation white paper.

"Neville, Paul, MP",NATS,2010-05-24,"—This afternoon, Lieutenant Colonel Harry Smith received a letter from the Prime Minister regarding the reinstatement of original gallantry recommendations for 12 veterans of the Battle of Long Tan. Would anyone in this parliament be surprised that not only did the Prime Minister turned down Harry’s request that the honour be reinstated but that it took fully six months for the Prime Minister to respond to Harry’s original correspondence of November last year? Bear in mind that between then and now Harry had written two follow-up letters and neither of those was acknowledged either.
My taking up the cudgels on this matter would come as no surprise to those who know me. I have spoken on this topic before and I will continue to do so until a satisfactory conclusion is reached. This matter has dragged on for a number of years, following the 2008 review by the Honours and Awards Appeals Tribunal, which reinstated the original award recommended to Lieutenant Colonel Smith—he was Major Smith at the time of the action. He received the Star of Gallantry, which is the equivalent of the Distinguished Service Order. Upgraded with him were two of his platoon commanders: Dave Sabben and Geoff Kendall, who were awarded the Medal of Gallantry, the equivalent of the old Military Cross. However, 12 other men from D Company did not have reinstated their original gallantry recommendation—three medals for gallantry and nine commendations for gallantry, the commendations being the equivalent of mentions in dispatches. This is something that Harry Smith and I want to see reconsidered.
For the record, the causes he is promoting are those of Delta Company’s Lieutenant Gordon Sharp, posthumously because he was killed in the action; Bill Roche; Ian Campbell; Geoff Peters; Barry Magnussen; Neil Bextrum; Allen May; Noel Grimes; and Bill Moore; and the APC Reaction Force’s Adrian Roberts, Frank Alcorta and the late Ron Brett, who died after the war. All these were seminal characters in the Battle of Long Tan. It is hard not to think that these men have been and continue to be treated with disdain by this and previous governments. In fact, in his response, the Prime Minister goes to great lengths to reiterate the awards already presented to the members of D Company and praises Lieutenant Colonel Smith’s efforts to gain recognition for his men. He then shamelessly goes on to say:
The government’s policy is to adhere to the Tribunal’s finding. I am confident that the Tribunal’s recommendations in the case of honours and awards for the Battle of Long Tan are based on sound reasoning and I do not intend to seek to have them overturned … I reassure you of the government’s commitment to honouring our Vietnam veterans.
Consider this: if the six-month delay in responding to Lieutenant Colonel Smith’s correspondence—along with the very content—was not enough, it seems that our government has not even informed the New Zealand government of an Australian unit citation for three New Zealanders who fought in that Battle of Long Tan. It is almost unbelievable.
One of these men—gunnery officer Morrie Stanley, who is terminally ill with cancer—is meant to be presented with his award this coming weekend. Lieutenant Colonel Smith is travelling there for the ceremony and he informed me that as of this morning the New Zealand government still had not had an official letter from our government saying that the award has been approved. I find that inconceivable. I hope there is some explanation for it.
Many observers have suggested that the Battle of Long Tan, if decorated along the UK system of similar awards, would have received something like: two Victoria Crosses, 10 distinguished conduct medals, 10 military medals and 20 mentioned in dispatches. Smith recommended 23 awards—being the commanding officer of the company—but only nine were awarded. Such a state of affairs makes it hard not to agree with Harry Smith when he says, ‘Long Tan may be an historic battle, but it is an absolute shambles in terms of awards.’ And so it is.
The treatment of our troops when they came back from Vietnam—by all of us, I am not being partisan in this—was disgraceful. But what is worse is that the shameless way those troops were treated has still not been corrected and could be corrected. There were 726 awards over the 10 years of Vietnam. Nearly half of them were MIDs—mentioned in dispatches. Only 61 went to private soldiers in the front line. Of these, only 35 received medals. There were only 35 medals that went to privates in 726 awards! To my way of thinking, this is an utter disgrace.
In the First World War seven per cent of troops received awards. In the Second World War, it was 2.8 per cent. In the Korean War, again it was 2.8 per cent. But in Vietnam, it was 1.7 per cent. Some of these people have been recommended: Harry Smith; two of his colleagues whose awards he had upgraded by the tribunal, Sabben and Kendall; one for whom he is recommending a posthumous award, Cameron Sharpe; and an APC reaction force lieutenant, Roberts. Not one of them went to Duntroon. Four of them were Portsea graduates and one was a national service officer.
I find it almost inconceivable that these people, who were forced to go there—and they were forced to go there by a government of my colour, so I take my share of blame in this—did not receive appropriate awards. Smith himself did, and the two he fought to get their awards for did, but not the others. A DSO was awarded to the brigadier for his able and personal direction of the battle. He did not attend the battle. A DSO went to the lieutenant colonel who arrived after the battle and was there for the three or four days afterwards when the Vietcong had gone.
In that battle, the Australians faced somewhere between 2½ thousand and 3,000 troops, and not all of them were Vietcong. Some of them were North Vietnamese regular troops and some were local regional troops. There was another regiment in reserve. That night, it is now acknowledged, they planned to knock off the Australian base at Nui Dat. Had it not been for Harry Smith and his D company, who took them on in the rubber plantation at Long Tan, God only knows what would have happened that night. It could have been our worst disaster since the Second World War, but I will not speculate on that—I will just say this: why weren’t those last 12 properly acknowledged when everyone else, the commanding officers and so on, got their honours? Two tribunals have looked into this. Furthermore, 37 DSOs were awarded to senior officers during the Vietnam War: one to the Navy, 10 to the Air Force and 26 to the Army. It seems that these 12 that Harry fights for have not received their just rewards.
I beg to disagree with the Prime Minister. This will never rest. Every time we put our hands on our hearts on Long Tan Day, or Vietnam Veterans Remembrance Day, and do not correct this, it is a denigration of the work of all those troops who went to Vietnam. I will not abide it and I will not rest until it is corrected. Madam Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to table the names and ranks of the people that Lieutenant Colonel Harry Smith has recommended for awards.
