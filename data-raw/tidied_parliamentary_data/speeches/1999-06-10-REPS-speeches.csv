"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,1999-06-10,"—I move:
That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent notice No. 13, Private members business, submitted in my name, being called on forthwith.
This is a motion designed to do what the Howard government has been unprepared to do—that is, to stand up for Australia's almost one million small firms. When the Prime Minister signed that now infamous deal on the GST with the Democrats, he in effect sold out Australia's almost one million small firms. What is an uncontestable fact is that the compliance costs involved in government regulation fall disproportionately on small firms.
—Mr Speaker, I have a point of order. Could I inquire of members opposite whether there has been agreement with the managers of business for this?
—There's no point of order.
—There is no point of order.
Motion (by Mr Abbott) agreed to:
That the member be not further heard.
—Mr Speaker, I rise to—
—The member for Paterson does not have the call.
—Mr Speaker, on a point of order: you do need to deal with the motion before the House. The fact is that this compliance cost is going to cost Australian firms $200 million—
—Order! The member for Hunter will resume his seat. The Minister for Employment Services will resume his seat. The House has already voted that the member for Hunter be not further heard. At that point the member for Paterson rose to second the 
 motion but did not have the call and, for that reason, I sat the member for Paterson down. The member for Paterson has the right to rise and seek the call if he wishes. I call the member for Paterson.",REPS,<title>SMALL BUSINESS</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing and Sessional Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,0,1,speech
"Horne, Bob, MP",ALP,1999-06-10,"—I rise to second the motion moved by the member for Hunter.
Motion (by Mr Abbott) agreed to:
That the member be not further heard.
—Mr Speaker, I have a point of order. I would inquire as to the motion before the House. I understand there is a motion currently before the House that needs disposal.
—The member for Denison is right. There is some confusion both between the chair and the clerks, which is entirely understandable, simply because the clerks are not in receipt of the motion in the written form for which the standing orders provide.
Mr Horne interjecting—
—Order! If it facilitates the cause of the House, I will allow the member for Hunter to submit that motion in written form if he so desires.
Government members interjecting—
—Order! The chair is now in receipt of the motion.
—Mr Speaker, I have a point of order. I understood that, under the standing orders, any member of this House was entitled to have read at any point throughout the debate the motion before the House.
—First, you have to sign it. Have you forgotten that?
Opposition members interjecting—
—Order! The House will come to order. The confusion has arisen because the chair was not in receipt of the motion. The member for Hunter has the right to read the motion if it has not been circulated and, in fact, the motion has not been circulated. The chair proposes to read the motion to the House. The member for Hunter has moved:
That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent notice No. 13, Private members business, submitted in his name being called on forthwith.

"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,1999-06-10,"—I rise to speak to the amendment proposed by the honourable member for Wills to Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1999 . That amendment deals with the government's GST package. This morning we witnessed a very disappointing response from the government to an attempt by my colleague the member for Hunter, the shadow minister for small business, to bring on a debate about the impact of the goods and services tax on the small business sector. The government did not want that debate to occur and it used its numbers to prevent it. In speaking to this amendment, I am taking the opportunity to deal with, amongst a number of other matters, the adverse impacts of the goods and services tax on small business.
I have spoken on this topic on a number of occasions. Having provided a great deal of evidence about the adverse impacts of the GST package, not only on the economy but on fairness in our society, I want to bring that together today and synthesise it into a summary. I wish to make the following statement, which I will establish during what I have to say: the government's tax package is not tax reform. I will go, one by one, through the various claims that have been made by the government for the goods and services tax package. I will demonstrate that each and every one of those claims is wrong.
Firstly, on the purported economic benefits of the package, the government claimed before, during and after the election that the GST package will create jobs. In fact, Treasury did no modelling to substantiate that claim; it was merely an assertion by the government. Work commissioned by the Senate GST inquiry—done by some of Australia's best economic modellers— 
 revealed that under the most optimistic scenario, on the most optimistic assumptions in  the short term, the package as a whole may be able to generate 30,000 jobs. But the key point here is that any jobs that are created in the short term as a result of the package will be due entirely to the fiscal stimulus associated with spending a large part of the budget surplus. Not one job in the short term will be created by the goods and services tax itself.
Those results were under the most optimistic assumptions. Let us start relaxing those assumptions. It is assumed by modellers initially that every cent of the savings from abolishing the wholesale sales tax will be passed on to consumers on Saturday, 1 July 2000. Obviously, that is a completely unrealistic assumption, so the modellers looked at the case where there was some delay, even a moderate delay, in the passing on of some of those savings from indirect tax reductions. The result obtained is that, rather than achieving job creation through the entire package of 30,000 jobs, there would be job losses of 15,000, a very realistic scenario indeed. But it gets worse: if wages follow the increase in prices associated with the GST, there would be an adverse impact on jobs of about 100,000 jobs lost. Again, this is a realistic scenario because wage and salary earners will seek to recoup at least some of the increased costs of living associated with the GST, a very reasonable thing for them to do. As a result of that, the modellers predict job losses in the order of 100,000.
Let us have a look at the impact of the Howard-Lees package and the impact of the partial exemption of food. The economic modellers in those circumstances forecast job losses of up to 68,000. So, far from the GST creating jobs, we heard evidence at the Senate inquiry that the GST would be `job destroying'. Even the Prime Minister's preferred modeller could find absolutely no jobs being created by the goods and services tax itself. In the long run, no jobs were identified at all by any of the modellers from the GST package. There is the first assertion from the government—that the GST package would create jobs—completely and utterly refuted by 
 independent modelling commissioned by the Senate GST inquiry.
The next assertion of the government is that the GST package is good for Australia's trade balance. This is a new tax that taxes tourism and education exports. The impact of that is that there will be an adverse terms of trade effect. There will be an adverse turnaround in the price of our exports and imports. So, again, claims that this package is going to be good for Australia's trade balance have been refuted by independent analysis commissioned by the Senate GST inquiry. Once again, this demonstrates that this is not tax reform.
The next claim is that the GST package is good for economic growth. This is a claim that the Prime Minister and Treasurer have repeated often. The modelling has shown negligible impacts on economic growth, but the relevant question is whether it is good for Australian living standards and, on this matter, a lot of modelling has been done. The Prime Minister's preferred modeller again has forecast—even under the most optimistic scenario—that there could be, after six to 10 years, an increase in average living standards in Australia equivalent to 65c per person per week. That assumes no compliance costs whatsoever. It also assumes no transition costs. All of the disruption that has been predicted and forecast by economists of short-term job losses are just completely assumed away by Mr Murphy.
Professor Dixon from Monash University also modelled the impact of the goods and services tax package on average Australian living standards. He came up with the result of a reduction in average Australian living standards. The reason for that is that the impact of the GST package on our labour intensive exports, namely tourism and education exports, will be adverse, but there could be a favourable impact on mining. Well, where are the jobs? Where are the current improvements in living standards? They are coming from those sectors that are labour intensive and expanding.
The world prices of tourism and education exports are rising, and the world prices of our mineral exports are falling. That is why we get the adverse terms of trade effect and that 
 is why we get in the modelling a forecast of a reduction in Australian average living  standards. How could this be described as tax reform when we have results showing that the tax package will reduce average Australian living standards?
The next claim is that the GST package is more efficient, as if that is an objective in its own right separate from its effects on living standards.
We were told before the election that the GST itself was going to replace 10 so-called inefficient taxes—but it has emerged, following the Howard-Democrat amendments, that only four of those 10 taxes are going: the wholesale sales tax, one stamp duty, financial institutions duty and minor bed taxes. But six are staying. A debits tax is staying at least until 1 July 2005—and there is no mechanism whatsoever to get rid of it in any agreement—and another five stamp duties are staying indefinitely.
The GST is not an efficient tax. Certainly, the one that is being proposed by the government is now riddled with exemptions and special rates. It has the following rates: zero, 10 per cent, a rate associated with input taxing, a special rate for tobacco and a special rate for luxury cars. The result of all this is going to be a $5 billion increase in the indirect taxes that are regarded by the government as inefficient.
Access Economics have done some work on the abolition of the wholesale sales tax and they find that the deadweight losses to the community from the wholesale sales tax are less than 10 cents in the dollar, very comparable with their estimates of the losses from the GST—so no efficiency improvements there whatsoever. That is why we will not get any improvement in living standards.
On compliance costs, at present under the wholesale sales tax 75,000 businesses pay the tax. It is collected at 75,000 tax collection points. Under the GST, 1,600,000 small businesses will be caught in the GST net. That is why we really do have, under this proposal, a nightmare on Main Street. This is not tax reform. I draw your attention to the evidence provided in a speech by the Commissioner of Taxation to the Taxation Institute 
 of Australia convention in Hobart on 24 March 1999. Amongst many examples, he pointed to fish and chip shops in the United Kingdom, where fresh fish is GST free but cooked fish bears the GST. In the United Kingdom, the Treasury has identified the prospect of large-scale evasion because the fish and chip shop proprietors are understating the amount of cooked fish that they sell and overstating the amount of fresh fish. He says, in going through this:
At one level you can get a laugh out of the overseas examples. But the costs to business and the community in the form of our additional administration costs are not quite so funny.
However, there is perhaps a subtle but potentially more dangerous cost to all this.
Ask yourself this question. What do you think will be the impact on attitudes to compliance with the GST, and perhaps other taxes, of introducing rules that inevitably will be subject to ridicule and that almost encourage people to become comfortable with entering into arrangements to exploit them?
They are very poignant remarks by the taxation commissioner, and a clear warning by him to avoid the Howard-Democrat deal to partially exempt food. Today in the Australian Financial Review  we have found evidence that has been given of the new revenue sharing agreement that is being imposed by the Commonwealth on the states. It says:
The Federal Government's revised GST deal will raise progressively less revenue than the original estimates, possibly reflecting the impact of tax avoidance driven by the food exemption . . . 
That was revealed in the new intergovernmental agreement that has been developed by the Commonwealth and imposed on the states, where the Prime Minister of Australia has said that he is not interested in another Premiers Conference and that this is the deal.
In fact, the intergovernmental agreement reveals that in the first year, 2000-01, the GST would raise $24.2 billion under the Howard-Lees deal, which is $3 billion less than the original estimates. By 2002-03, the latest year for which figures are available, the government would raise just $29.2 billion, compared with $32.8 million originally, before the Howard-Lees deal. That is a difference of $3.6 billion, which indicates that 
 the gap has grown by 20 per cent in just two years.
Furthermore, the intergovernmental agreement shows that, in the first year, administration costs will blow out by $120 million to a massive $820 million, whereas the government has only revealed higher costs of $60 million. They are the problems with compliance with this new shemozzle that has been created in the Howard-Lees deal. Again it is quite clear that this is not tax reform.
On the question of fairness, the top 20 per cent of income earners will, under this package, get around half of all the tax cuts. The switch in the tax system away from progressive income tax towards regressive indirect taxes is going to be greater than $15 billion—very much greater than the $2.75 billion claimed by Senator Lees in her press release the other day. Is this fair?
The GST taxes the essentials of life. At least one-third of the food that is consumed by low income households will still be subject to the GST. The following items will be taxed by the GST, all or most of them for the first time: clothing, housing, electricity and gas supplies, haircuts, public transport, used cars, home and contents insurance, car insurance, home repairs. I have listed a range of services—that is the `S' in GST, and people need to understand the extent of the reach of this tax on essential services in Australia.
Interestingly, the only proposal for the wholesale sales tax to tax the essentials of life—at present, the wholesale sales tax avoids taxing the essentials of life—has been from none other than the current Prime Minister. I draw your attention to remarks in Inside Canberra on 4 June this year, just the other day:
The only time an attempt was made to apply the WST on the necessities of life was in the August 1981 Budget which proposed, as well as increases in the four existing rates, a new 2.5 per cent WST on clothing and footwear. And the Treasurer at the time? Why, none other than John Howard. He proposed this increase on a necessity of life without offering compensation. Senator Brian Harradine led the charge against the Howard tax and, with the Democrats, defeated the measure. 

The Democrats defeated that measure back in 1981 but this time they have rolled over. It goes on:
So determined were the Fraser Government and Treasurer John Howard to tax footwear and clothing, the Bill was put forward as one of the double dissolution triggers which gave Fraser his (disastrous) 1983 double dissolution election.
This can hardly constitute tax reform. It is supposed to be fairer under the Democrat amendments, but I draw your attention to a statement by my colleague the member for Lilley and the shadow minister for family and community services, in which he has analysed the claims of the Democrats. As a result of that analysis we find that a single pensioner would get at best an extra 70c a week. This is a great victory, according to the Democrats. The poorest single person at best would get $1.62 a week—a great victory by the Democrats. And the poorest family with two children would get an extra 99c a week.
Just today ACOSS has revealed its analysis of these Democrat claims. It is pointed out that the Democrats have relied on flawed assumptions and exaggerated gains for low income households by deliberately not taking into account the increased prices of housing and tobacco. In today's Age ACOSS is reported as follows:
The President of ACOSS, Mr Michael Raper, said the Democrats ignored the regressive retention of the bank accounts debits tax and the new package should be independently modelled.
We agree wholeheartedly with those sentiments. In conclusion, on 1 July 2000, all of the untied grants to the states will be abolished. After the transition period, the government is able to declare open season on the tied grants. These are payments to the states for vital services such as literacy and numeracy, government schools, youth suicide prevention, homeless youth programs and public housing. It is inevitable that these tied grants will be cut by the Commonwealth over time under a conservative government. I hope and fully expect that there will not be a conservative government at that time. But without an education our children have no future. And that is where we are headed with this unfair regressive tax. It is a tax on learning. It is a tax on the lifetime prospects of our 
 young people. It is not tax reform. The GST tax package is regressive. It is bad for the economy and it is bad for small business. The  Howard government and the Democrats stand condemned for seeking to impose this unfair regressive tax on the Australian people.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Kelly, De-Anne, MP",NP,1999-06-10,"—I rise today to speak on Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1999 . This bill makes amendments to the sales tax law to correct a deficiency relating to the exemption for goods incorporated into property owned by or leased to always exempt persons or the government of a foreign country. Access to this exemption will now be restricted only to those who own a property that is occupied principally by an always exempt person or the government of a foreign country or where the property is used principally for the provision of services to an always exempt person or again government of a foreign country. It will apply after 2 April 1998.
The financial impact of this is quite substantial. The gain in revenue in 1998-99 will be $40 million; 1999-2000, $50 million; 2000-01, $50 million again; and 2001-02, $50 million; and so on thereafter. The compliance cost is estimated to be in the order of $1 million per annum. So there is a considerable rise in revenue and it is a sound initiative from the Minister for Financial Services and Regulation.
I would like to move now to a recent parliamentary report entitled Taxable income and tax paid in Commonwealth electoral divisions, 1996-97. This provided an insightful snapshot of the average taxable incomes and average tax paid in all 148 federal electorates. The data presented was based upon personal income tax collections that financial year by the Australian Taxation Office and, of course, excludes other taxes paid, including state or territory imposts.
It was interesting to look at my own electorate of Dawson, where there were 56,923 people paying income tax in 1996-97. They had an average taxable income—after all deductions—of $29,748 and, per head of taxpayers, paid an average effective $6,912. Some caution needs to be used in interpreting these figures. For instance, in 1996-97 a 
 taxpayer with a taxable income of $29,748 would have paid a total of $5,967.68 on the existing tax scale, which required—and still requires—a payment of $3,060 for income up to $20,701 and 34 cents in the dollar for every dollar up to and including $38,001. According to this analysis, Dawson was placed at 75 on the list of 148 electorates in terms of its average taxable income and at 77 in terms of its annual average income tax payment.
As I said, there were 56,923 people in Dawson that year paying income tax, and they paid a total of $1,693 million. In terms of the number of taxpayers and the amount they paid, Dawson ranked No. 61 on the list of all 148 electorates. On average in 1996-97, a Dawson taxpayer with a taxable income of $29,748 earned $496 more than the average Queensland taxpayer and paid $96 more in income tax. Of the 27 Queensland federal electorates, only 10 had higher average taxable incomes than Dawson. However, the average Dawson taxable income was $2,093 lower than the national average of $31,345 and our average income tax of $6,912 was $788 lower than the national average.
All of these figures are presented to show that Dawson, while not affluent, was about average in the Queensland context, although it was somewhat below in terms of the national context. There will be any number of Dawson taxpayers that will tell me quite rightly that they did not earn anywhere near $30,000 a year in 1996-97 and do not earn anywhere near that today, for that matter. But these are only statistical averages. On the evidence that I see every day in my electorate, where many are doing it extremely tough, I can only surmise that in 1996-97 a small number of people must have been earning considerably more for the average to be set so much higher. I can only surmise what the average annual taxable income is now in Dawson for 1999-2000, but I suspect that there has been little real growth, if any, given that the sugar industry, which is the principal financial base for the local economy, had a very disappointing last season and will have an even worse return this season due to bad 
 weather and the collapse in the international sugar price.
Undeniably, the great majority of Dawson residents would not just have had a lower  taxable income of $29,252 in 1996-97; they would not be getting anywhere near that now. As I said earlier, that average Dawson taxpayer paid $5,967.68 in income tax in 1996-97. I notice that the member for Rankin had a great deal to say about the government's new tax package. Let us have a look at what it means for average folk around rural and regional Australia. I am using my own electorate as an example. Under the government's new tax package, an income of $29,252 will mean an income tax payment of $5,155.60, or a saving of $812.08. Under the new income tax scales, the tax free threshold will increase from the existing $5,400 to $6,000. Under current rates, the next $15,300 is taxed at 20 cents in the dollar, while every dollar earned between $20,701 and $38,000 is taxed at 34 cents in the dollar. Under the new rates, income from $6,001 to $20,000 is taxed at 17 cents in the dollar and income from $20,000 to $50,000 at 30 cents in the dollar.
If we assume, for the sake of the argument, that the average taxpayer in Dawson who was on $29,252 in 1996-97 will earn, say, an extra $2,000 a year net taxable income by the time the new income tax scales apply, that taxpayer would have been liable for a further $680 in income tax on the current scales at that rate of 34 cents in the dollar that we inherited from the Labor Party. Under our new tax scales, the extra income tax on that $2,000 will be $600, because the rate will be only 30 cents in the dollar. Of course, there is always the insidious effect of bracket creep, and it will not take many years for Dawson taxpayers earning just slightly more than the 1996-97 average of $29,252 to earn more than $38,000. At that rate, under Labor's income tax scales, every dollar earned will be taxed at a crippling 43 cents in the dollar. Under the government's package, a taxpayer would be able to earn up to $50,000 before the next highest tax rate of 40 cents in the dollar applied on income above that level.
Therefore, for average folk and struggling families in my electorate, the new income tax 
 scales will mean very significant benefits for the overwhelming majority of people. While I recognise that it may be a long time before many of them could hope to earn above $50,000, they are reassured in the knowledge that, should they choose to take on overtime, additional work or perhaps a second job, when they do by hard work and application lift their incomes above the average they will not be penalised with the existing high rates of tax for incomes above $38,000. The savings for lower income earners in my electorate will also be significant.
For Labor to argue against the tax reform package is to argue against the aspirations and the hopes of ordinary, decent working Australians. Tax reform means more than just having more money in your pocket, although that in itself is significant. It means more competitive prices. In the Weekend Australian  of 5-6 June, Professor Ann Harding of the highly regarded National Centre of Economic and Social Modelling presented her analysis of the tax reform package as it now applies. Professor Harding was quoted as saying:
For a taxpayer earning $30,000 a year, the new deal looks twice as good.
This $30,000 figure is a handy one because it is about the average taxable income in Dawson. It relates pretty much to the average battling family in my electorate. Professor Harding estimates that the overall impact of the reform package, after taking into account tax cuts and the other measures including the abolition of wholesale sales tax, a raft of other taxes and the imposition of the goods and services tax, will provide an extra $423.80 or so a year for that $30,000 income earner. This amount is perhaps the school fees for a child for a whole year in one of the more modest schools in my electorate. It could well be the opportunity for a family to take an additional few days holiday at Christmas. It will certainly pay for the school shoes for a family of three. It is a considerable advantage.
Professor Harding goes on to say that there is a net gain after taking into account the cost of living. I might add that Professor Harding is cited as an expert by the Labor Party, amongst others. That same edition of the 
Weekend Australian did a room by room comparison of what the cost of a large range of household items will be after the new tax reform package is applied. Overwhelmingly,  the cost of most items is shown to have actually fallen. Of 24 items in the bathroom, 23 fell and only one, the toothbrush, increased in price. One item, Panadol, stayed the same. In the kitchen, the costs of 34 items were assessed and, of these, only two—beer and wine—showed a small increase. Thirteen standard food items remained the same in price, while 19 items fell in price. In the living room, only the cost of an atlas as a coffee table book rose slightly, while the cost of every other single item fell.
These are not government figures; they are not the scare campaign from the opposite side of the House; they cannot be dismissed as having a partisan view. They come from a respected expert. I commend the analysis to all honourable members because it provides an immediate and impressive explanation and robust defence of the new tax system. While these cost estimates are impressive, I presume that they were calculated in either the Sydney or Melbourne markets and, therefore, reflect a very considerable mass market with strong competition and low freight rates. In my electorate of Dawson practically everything we buy—and certainly everything we sell—has to be transported by road or rail. The cost of transport, which is passed onto the consumer, is undeniably high. The tax reform package has preserved the huge benefits of the original tax package insofar as regional and rural Australia is concerned. This is not just wonderful news for our exporters but wonderful news for every consumer who can expect further relief from rising prices when the diesel fuel rebates begin to apply.
In a speech I made in the Main Committee the other day I mentioned two transport companies in my electorate. One uses 2.5 million litres of fuel a year and transports most of the cane, raw and refined sugar in my electorate. It is going to save over $575,000 a year on excise alone. That is one company. There are many such transport companies in Dawson that will be passing on these benefits to farmers, to small business people, to 
 consumers and to families. It is the first opportunity to tilt the balance in favour of rural and regional Australia. I know it is very close to your heart, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, that there be justice and fairness and an opportunity to promote the advantages of decentralisation which definitely come and flow from this tax reform package. So for the battlers, for the exporters, for the small businesses, for all of those low to medium income earners and for our hard-pressed exporters, again, in the sugar industry in Dawson, this new tax reform package is a win-win situation.
I am delighted that the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Transport and Regional Services have worked so hard to achieve such a sound outcome for all of those in rural and regional Australia. It could have been achieved, of course, only with the cooperation of the Australian Democrats' leader, Senator Meg Lees, who with her colleagues in the often delicate negotiations recognised the special needs of rural and regional Australia in a number of practical ways. I commend the tax reform package and wish to thank the minister, Mr Hockey, for the current bill before us.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,1999-06-10,"—At the outset, the government appreciates the participation of the honourable members for Wills, Mitchell, Rankin and Dawson in this debate on the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) 1999 . This bill corrects a deficiency in the sales tax legislation relating to the exemption for goods incorporated into property owned by or leased to always exempt persons or to the government of a foreign country. The principal opposition speaker—the honourable member for Wills—claimed wrongly that there was an adverse impact flowing from proposals on private infrastructure projects. It ought to be recognised that the reason we need the amendments before the chamber is that Labor's 1991 legislation actually created this anomaly because it was drafted too broadly. He also suggested that the proposals ought to be referred, once again, to a Senate 
 committee. This matter has previously been to a Senate committee and, because of the calling of the election last year, the bill lapsed  and the committee was not able to hand down its report.
The government, however, as you would expect, closely examined the submissions made by stakeholders. There were a number of meetings between the government and industry representatives and between departmental officials and those industry representatives. As a result, the limited recourse debt measure, as reintroduced, contains a number of measures which address the concerns of the stakeholders. One change that resulted is that refinancing on an arms-length basis will not generally trigger an adjustment. Another change addresses concerns over the definition of limited recourse debt. The government considers that these changes, in addition to some minor technical alterations, address the concerns of stakeholders in the infrastructure industry. We also, as a result, reject the criticism made by the honourable member for Wills.
An amendment has also been made to the sales tax measure. This will ensure that the sales tax exemption continues to apply for goods purchased before 2 April 1998 even where those goods are not incorporated into a building until after that date. Again, in this circumstance the government has consulted extensively and has made changes to address legitimate concerns. Because of the previous Senate committee process and the subsequent ongoing consultation, the government sees no need at all for the matter to be referred to a Senate committee again. It ought also to be recognised that, with the introduction of a new tax system, Labor's sales tax will be abolished, and this legislation is designed to cover the situation up until the new tax system is introduced to provide a better future for all Australians.
The honourable member for Wills also claimed that Labor supports the principles being addressed in this legislation, but he claims that the government has not got it quite right. He also professes to believe that the bill is a poorly drafted bill that will generate what he referred to as `collateral 
 damage on industry'. Then he proceeded to fight the coming Victorian election campaign by talking about Citylink in Victoria at great length, which of course has only peripheral connection with the subject matter of this bill. Again, I want to reiterate that the drafting of Labor's original legislation in 1991 has caused the anomaly and has caused the need for this bill to come back before the chamber. The government consulted, as I said. We have listened to their views. We have made changes, and the amendments which we are proposing are amendments which are fair and reasonable.
The honourable member for Wills is often a credible person, but when he expressed concern about the environmental impact of our legislation he surely could not have been serious. This government, as I said the other day, is the greenest government in Australia's history. It has a real and meaningful commitment to the environment. We all know about the $1.25 billion Natural Heritage Trust, which will preserve the future of Australia for future generations. Also included in the tax plan is an extra $1 billion of initiatives specifically for the environment, particularly in relation to greenhouse gas emissions and cleaner air. We are protecting the environment in a way that the previous Labor government simply failed to do.
The honourable member for Rankin, being a new member, claimed that the GST would have an adverse impact on jobs. The Labor Party is the last party which ought to talk about jobs and the jobless. We all remember the million long dole queues and the recession we had to have. This government is proud that it has brought the unemployment rate down to 7.5 per cent, which is the lowest rate for some nine years. It is still too high, of course, but we have put the policies in place which will continue to improve the employment outlook for Australians. The honourable member for Rankin also pretended to state that the GST would be bad for trade. The GST will remove over $4,000 million from costs to exporters. Far from being bad for trade, the policies which the government is bringing in will be very positive for trade.
The Labor Party is the party of the wholesale sales tax. It claims that our GST will have compliance costs in excess of the compliance costs under its wholesale sales tax.  What we are proposing with A New Tax System is infinite improvement on the tax system which we inherited. The member for Rankin suggested that the wholesale sales tax does not tax the necessities of life. They might not have been his words, but that was the import. I have a list here, and some of these items are clearly necessities of life: flavoured milk and fruit juice with at least 25 per cent juice content are taxed at 12 per cent; dishwashing liquid, 22 per cent; household cleaning products, 22 per cent; other fruit juice, cordials and soft drink, 22 per cent; razors and shaving cream, 22 per cent; toilet paper, 22 per cent; toothpaste, 22 per cent; and the list goes on.
Time does not permit me to outline the six different rates—seven if you include the zero rate—which apply to goods. The compliance costs of the wholesale sales tax are very high. It is an irrational tax. The Labor Party continued to hike it. They are the last people to suggest that this government has not brought in a system which is infinitely simpler than the system which they passed on to us upon our election to government.
The member for Dawson made a very competent contribution. She dismissed and dispelled many of the myths which Labor continues to perpetuate and peddle in the Australian electorate. She pointed out the benefits to the transport sector and the assistance for families. She also emphasised the effect of the wholesale sales tax throughout the home and the supermarket. At the present time under Labor's wholesale sales tax regime, wholesale sales tax is embedded in the cost of every food item and in the cost of every item sold. When you look at a food item which might technically be exempt at the supermarket, you see that you have the cost of wholesale sales tax built in to the cost of transport, the cost of printing the packaging and the cost of packaging. So wholesale sales tax is in fact right through everything which is sold in Australia, even those items which are technically exempt. The member for 
 Mitchell highlighted the inconsistencies of Labor's wholesale sales tax. He also emphasised, as if anyone could forget, Labor's high tax obsession.
Sales tax in Australia generally applies to goods which are manufactured in this country or imported into this country for use in Australia. The Sales Tax Assessment Act 1992 provides that dealings with assessable goods are subject to sales tax unless an exemption applies. Item 192 in schedule 2 of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1992 provides a sales tax exemption for goods purchased for incorporation into any building or property owned by or leased to an always exempt person. This provision has been inappropriately exploited in a way which is not consistent with the original intention of the legislation. It has allowed unintended access to exemption for certain goods attached to properties owned or leased by always exempt persons but not used by always exempt persons or not related to their purposes. There has in fact been some publicity about its inappropriate use in certain private sector projects.
This government believes that deficiency in the law—particularly a law which we inherited from the Labor Party—should be corrected as soon as possible. From now on, the exemption will be available only where the property is occupied or used principally by an always exempt person or by the government of a foreign country. This will have the effect of removing unfair competitive advantages certain private sector operators have had in relation to certain projects—advantages which have arisen only because of the unintended exploitation of tax exemption provisions.
Developers should not be able to exploit this exemption to obtain a significant cost advantage over developers who have correctly paid sales tax on goods used in a development. The types of property the amendments will specifically exclude from the exemption include shops and shopping centres, the fit-out of major hotels and casinos, private residential apartment blocks, any property similar to these and properties prescribed by regulation. Hence, as a result of the amendment, an always exempt person will not be exempt 
 from sales tax in all situations. The amendment applies to dealings after 2 April 1998 unless the goods concerned were acquired on or before that date.
The bill also includes amendments which were previously introduced and debated as part of the Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 4) 1998, which lapsed. Capital allowances under the income tax law are based on the initial cost of an asset or specified capital expenditure but do not take into account any non-payment through default under related finance transactions. Therefore, if capital expenditure or the initial cost of an asset is financed by hire purchase or limited recourse debt, a taxpayer can currently obtain deductions greater than actual outlays if the hire purchase or debt arrangement is not fully paid out and the creditor cannot obtain full redress—for example, where the relevant asset can be repossessed but no further payment can be demanded. This is a tax avoidance technique which is used to inflate a taxpayer's cost base for capital allowance purposes by writing off part of the debt used by the taxpayer to acquire an asset. Excessive tax benefits should not be able to be obtained in such situations.
Following an extensive consultation phase, technical changes were made to the legislation. I have previously outlined those. The measure was originally announced in the 1997-98 budget and will prevent taxpayers obtaining deduction for capital expenditure in excess of their actual outlays. This is an appropriate and equitable reform which reduces the unnecessarily broad scope of the exemption to be consistent with its original intention. Taxpayers who finance equipment purchases or other capital expenditure by a limited recourse debt or higher purchase ought not to be entitled to full deductions if they do not pay all of the debt. Under the present law, they are more favourably treated than taxpayers who are fully at risk in the repayment of their borrowings. The legislation before the chamber improves the law as it presently exists, and I am happy to commend the bill to the chamber.
Amendment negatived.
Original question resolved in the affirmative. 
Bill read a second time.",REPS,<title>TAXATION LAWS AMENDMENT BILL (No. 5) 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1,speech
"Kerr, Duncan, MP",ALP,1999-06-10,"—Manufacturing in bond is the subject of the Import Processing Charges Amendment (Warehouses) Bill 1999  and the Customs Amendment (Warehouses) Bill 1999 . Manufacturing in bond is a practice whereby Australian companies can establish arrangements with Customs to import component parts and to manufacture in Australia on the same basis as other countries establish free trade zones. So, for the purposes of manufacturing, when you establish a manufacturing in bond warehouse that is essentially treated as if it were foreign territory. Imports that are brought into the warehouse and that are made there but which enter Australia into domestic consumption obviously have to attract duty and they incur sales tax and duty liabilities at the time they leave the warehouse for sale in the Australian domestic market.
The idea of a manufacturing in bond scheme is not new. It existed in Australia until 1988 and was abolished as a result of the Industry Commission's 1987 report. It was suggested for reintroduction by the Australian iron and steel industry, in its report to the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism, and by the parliamentary committee inquiring into the steel industry, chaired by David Hawker. In December 1997, the government announced that it would be introducing 
 measures to facilitate manufacturing in bond. The objectives of manufacturing in bond are quite sound. We want to attract into Australia  manufacturing capacity that would otherwise go to other regions and where Australia would benefit from our ability to have manufacturing in this country, for export, of goods that would not otherwise have been made here.
Arrangements exist in other jurisdictions: free trade zones and similar manufacturing in bond arrangements. Australia, to be able to compete effectively to attract manufacturing industry, needs to be able to look to measures of these kinds. What we want to do, of course, is to generate net additional economic activity and employment in Australia. One of the key objectives of manufacturing in bond is to facilitate trading operations by streamlining the administration of imports which are subsequently re-exported, whether in processed or in their original form. Obviously, if there are significant red tape or costs associated with bringing components and those parts of manufacture which are consumed in the manufacture of other goods into Australia, the cost advantage that should flow from manufacturing in bond in Australia becomes insignificant.
Indeed, that is the problem we have had with the government's arrangements to date. They have not worked effectively because there has been too great a set of transaction costs associated with the proposal. Although manufacturing in bond was introduced in December 1997, the restrictions within the scheme have prevented it from being fully taken up. The most important problem so far has been the cost recovery arrangements that have been applied by Customs. A cost recovery charge of $22.80 was applied by Customs on each and every imported component; so, for example, a manufacturer of a product who imported 100 components would face an additional cost of $2,280 from this cost recovery package.
That has attracted considerable criticism. I note sitting opposite me Peter Slipper, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration, who commented:
. . . up until now, operators of MIB warehouses were subject to import processing charges and fees 
 that were introduced in 1997 to recover the costs incurred in processing what are known as `customs entries'.
Currently, a charge applies to entries lodged to allow imported goods to be moved into, and, if goods go into Australian commerce, out of warehouses.
Mr Slipper noted:
Industry has claimed these charges and fees make the operation of MIB warehouses uneconomic, and serve as obstacles to attracting international manufacturing and investment to Australia.
Those observations are absolutely right. Although the government did establish manufacturing in bond, basically there has been limited to no take-up of it. That means that we are missing out on the opportunity of building in this country manufacturing arrangements which will enable us to build employment and economic activity focused principally on re-export, allowing us to compete with areas of commerce right around the world which have cheaper and better facilitated arrangements for free trade zones. The government responded to the reports and the criticisms.
Senator Vanstone announced on 29 April this year that the changes were in response to industry representations that removing the processing charges on imports entering manufacturing and bond facilities would improve the ability of the scheme to attract international manufacturing and investment to Australia. Minister Nick Minchin said:
Removing these charges on the manufacturing in bond facilities will improve Australia's attractiveness as a regional manufacturing and warehousing site by exempting exporters from customs duties and sales tax on imported goods subsequently re-exported or used as inputs to exports.
The first question we would ask is why it took so long to do what is so obvious. If you are going to set up a scheme which facilitates Australia competing to attract international and domestic capital to establish manufacturing capacity in this country—competing so that we do not have transaction costs at the border, allowing people to bring product into Australia, transform it here and sell it again into the international market without additional substantial costs—I would have thought it would be pretty obvious that, if each particu 
 lar import transaction attracted a fee of $22.80, the operation of the scheme was bound to fail. In other words, the transaction costs associated with it would doom it to failure from the outset.
The government must have been aware of this problem ever since the inception of the scheme. Certainly the opposition has been made aware of the concerns of industry that this was an impractical arrangement, and one in which the overwhelming desire of Customs to operate in a mandated cost recovery environment was in conflict with the government's stated objectives of creating some flexibility in manufacturing in Australia so we can compete against overseas free trade zones. Not only was the government made aware of this; colleagues on the opposition side have been quite vocal in this area. My parliamentary colleague the member for Newcastle, Allan Morris, has for a long time been quite vocal in his representations in the hope that the Newcastle region will benefit from investment and activity facilitated through the manufacturing in bond system. The member for Newcastle has said to me—and, I think, to members of the government—that the government has significantly underestimated the economic opportunities that could flow from developments of this kind. Our criticism is that the government has taken a very long time to wake up to the fact that, if you are going to set up a scheme like this, you do not handcuff it and put manacles around it so that essentially it cannot work.
The framework of the scheme is actually quite a sound one. It avoids some of the difficulties that were involved in the theoretical construction of physical free trade zones. If we were to establish physical free trade zones, there would no doubt be argument as to which parts of Australia would be entitled to the benefit of those zones. For example, Tasmania would certainly like to be favoured by being named as Australia's free trade zone. But I fear that I would then come into competition with my colleague the member for Newcastle—and with, no doubt, other members on both sides of the House—who wished for their regions to be the beneficiaries of the increased economic activity that could be 
 attracted to the physical location of such free trade zones.
Manufacturing in bond as an idea is quite good because it frees us from those debates about which areas will be favoured by the allocation of a free trade zone. It says, essentially, that if you provide the proper information to the government, to Customs, so that they are assured that you are a sound and credible operator and that you operate a business that is focused on increasing its exports overseas and will monitor and report those transactions in a sound way, then wherever you are in Australia you can set up in a sense a virtual free trade zone. That is an excellent idea because it means that enterprises seeking to increase their penetration of overseas markets will be able to do so, and they will be able to operate in an environment which parallels the environments in which a lot of manufacturing occurs; places like Ireland and many of the Asian countries where free trade zones or similar manufacturing in bond arrangements have been established.
But of course you cannot do that if, at the same time that you set the scheme up, you cripple it by putting charges on the system so that you make it uneconomic—and that has been the problem. There is simply no justification in terms of the fundamental underlying principle of trying to build economic activity in Australia and to provide our local industry—and those who would seek employment in it—a competitive playing field with overseas countries. You cannot do that unless you also provide a fees regime which is competitive. So the first question we ask, and the first criticism we make, is about the inordinate delay from the time of introduction of this to this bill coming before the House. There were obvious problems—the scheme was never going to work as it was proposed—and this bill seeks to do something to rectify some of those problems.
The explanation for the failure of the government to do anything about it until now was set out in the Bulletin magazine in January this year in a report by Fred Brenchley, where the article says:
Despite meetings and pressure from then industry minister John Moore's office through 1998, Customs refused to budge. Cost recovery had been  foisted on it by the Finance Department and was a major source of the agency's own revenues.
So what we really find is essentially that the government had two conflicting policy agendas. On the one hand, it said it wanted to establish a scheme in Australia whereby manufacturing in Australia would be facilitated on a level playing field with free trade zones in other countries for products principally focused on overseas markets. On the other hand, we had Customs burdened by a Finance decision that whatever it did it had to have full cost recovery. Of course, in a situation of that kind, were Customs not to impose full cost recovery in the manner in which it did, it would simply not have funds available to undertake its functions. So the government had conflicting priorities and, unfortunately, those conflicting priorities were resolved in favour of the tax man or those who want to facilitate additional costs on Australian industry.
This bill is a recognition that you cannot have the cake and eat it too. You cannot set up a scheme in Australia which builds larger economic performance over the complete range of industries that could be advantaged in this way and, at the same time, impose fees and costs on the system which make it uncompetitive and uneconomic. Former industry minister John Moore has known of this since it was introduced, so too did the minister for customs and the government as a whole. But the government has gone through the farce of pretending that it is offering an opportunity for Australian and international investors to build a free trade related sector in Australia without actually putting in place measures which would facilitate that. Our criticisms go beyond simply this timing issue because the measures that have been put forward in this bill do not go to what industry really wants.
Manufacturing in bond representatives, who have been pressing the government on this issue, have been arguing that a manufacturing in bond facility should be treated as an export destination for Australian domestic manufacturers and suppliers, so that it would allow domestic suppliers to compete equally with 
 suppliers from overseas. They are particularly concerned about the introduction of a goods and services tax, which we are led to believe will see these treated as duty free imported goods. As things stand, domestic supplies will be disadvantaged by 10 per cent when compared to imported products, although the GST is refundable if the goods are exported. By allowing the duty and GST to be refunded on entry to a manufacturing in bond facility, business cash flows would be improved.
They want to encourage small businesses to expand, using manufacturing in bond facilities as a halfway stop to full exportation, and they want to be able to facilitate job growth in Australia. They want to see the removal of duty paid on consumables used in the production process. And they are particularly anxious to see a system which would allow a single licence to cover multiple user applications, so that you could have multiple tenants serviced in one bonded warehouse and the process controlled by a software system so that goods could travel under bond between production lines and stores. The government does not seem to be particularly concerned or even aware of these issues. Representatives of those who would seek to take up these opportunities have not had the opportunity of meetings at a senior level with the government, despite pressure from those industries and representations from members on this side of the House.
One of the key issues that applies to manufacturing in bond is: how do you deal with those aspects of production which do not go into the export markets? The whole idea of course of manufacturing in bond is to facilitate a duty free arrangement which enables us to build an export orientated sector. But there is a subsidiary question because, once you have manufacturing in bond in Australia, some of that will come into the Australian domestic market. So how, for example, do you deal with a computer? Let us assume you bring all the componentry required to make a computer into this country and then most of those sales proceed overseas but some goods are sold into the Australian market. How do you properly deal with those transfers into the domestic market? This bill and the regulations 
 that will be associated with it deal with the matter on the basis that, when an item enters  the Australian domestic market after being produced in a manufacturing in bond facility, duty is taxed on all the imported components as if they themselves had been imported into Australia, not on the finished computer.
The economic impact of this will differ with particular goods. But take the computer example for a good discussion point. This means that a manufacturing in bond producer is disadvantaged because each of the components individually attracts duty which in aggregate would be substantially more than any duty applicable on the manufacture in Australia of a completed computer or on the entry into Australia of a fully imported computer. So essentially there is a significant economic disadvantage for somebody seeking to establish a manufacturing in bond facility to make computers here.
That is a very sad thing because we do not have a particularly strong computer manufacturing facility in Australia. We have encouraged it—for example, the former government entered into partnership arrangements with IBM to build some hardware manufacturing capacity in this country. But members on both sides of the House would have to acknowledge that we have not thus far really attracted a significant computer manufacturing capacity to this country. If you look at our trade figures for physical imports you will see that one of the real reasons we have such a high deficit in the terms of trade is that we import so much of this computer material—peripherals, computers and the whole physical set-up that goes with the information age. Most of it is imported from overseas. The way the manufacturing in bond proposal is structured will do nothing about that at all. It does not give a way of encouraging local industry to build computer manufacturing facilities or to get a regime in terms of its economic circumstances which would facilitate it filling that gap.
That is not to say that we do not recognise that there are some competing considerations. There certainly are concerns that we would have to balance the economic interests of new entrants in manufacturing in bond facilities 
 against Australian domestic suppliers that are already in place. In different industry sectors that circumstance may be something of some significance. But the government does not seem to have addressed these significant economic issues at all. Again it is going to mean that we have a half measure that purports to give us an opportunity to attract big investment and to grow Australian export related industries but which handicaps them in the way in which they will operate.
Labor's response is to recognise that to be competitive and innovative in the international global economy, ideas such as manufacturing in bond need to be developed, but they have to be developed correctly. The government has managed to completely stuff up a potentially good idea and has wasted nearly 1½ years of its potential at the same time. We will support this bill's passage through the House, but we will be looking at it very closely in the Senate. We will be discussing these matters with the minor parties to look at whether we can make amendments to it which can make it more effective in doing the task that it is intended to achieve.
The Labor Party is way out in front of the government when it comes to understanding the issues involved in the manufacturing in bond facilities. We have been talking to business and seeking to gain an understanding of their concerns regarding this issue. We want to listen, consult and learn from all affected groups. That is a process that involves listening to those who are affected. That is why, when this bill comes before the Senate, we will be seeking to have a committee closely examine it. We want the Senate to look at various aspects of this issue. Firstly, there is the duty paid on consumables before the production process. Consumables are those products that are used up in the manufacturing process, such as petroleum, machine tools or solder. Currently it is required to pay duty on them before they are used in manufacturing in bond. Does it make sense to treat in this way components and items which are fully consumed before a fully manufactured product is made?
Secondly, there is the duty paid on capital equipment. Imported capital also carries a 
 duty with it into manufacture in bond. However, capital as a fixed investment may well  require an approach different from that taken with consumable imports. We want the Senate to examine those costs imposed in this process by Customs and the best methods required to reduce them to the smallest possible level. We want to look at the present high cost of obtaining a manufacturing in bond licence. We want to look at the current requirement that manufacturing in bond licences go to those who can demonstrate an almost exclusive export benefit. There may be some significant potential benefits for on-selling to the Australian market products made through manufacture in bond particularly where there is not already a strong manufacturing sector in this country. It may well be the case that in some sectors where we already have well-established, efficient local manufacturing we need not explore this. But where we do not make a product in Australia or where we do not have strengths in a product, does it not defy our national interest not to examine whether manufacturing in bond may be a measure to entice investors to build facilities here which enable those products to be made in this country—products which would otherwise be wholly imported from manufacturers offshore? We want the Senate to look at that issue.
We want the Senate to look at the effects that manufacturing in bond licences have on the competitive ability of those domestic producers who do not have manufacturing in bond licences—the balancing consideration. We want it to look at making manufacturing in bond non-location specific in the licence agreement so that you can have multiple sites under one licence through a licence multiple user model. We want it to look at per item accounting of manufacturing in bond through virtual bond stores rather than through warehouse specific manufacturing in bond to allow production through any facility at any location in Australia. We want to play a constructive part in this debate but we believe the government has not grasped an issue which has great potential for this country.
We know that there are still significant unresolved issues. For example, the govern 
 ment has said, in relation to the arrangements that it wishes to put in place, that there will be a single administrative charge for the charging of duty on components that are brought in for domestic manufacture. But that is not in this legislation, and there needs to be some clarification and reassurance that that in fact will be the case. Otherwise, industry will again be unwilling to commit to a scheme which places high overheads and red tape on their operations.
We want to play a positive role in this debate and not look for simple or quick fix solutions. We understand that the minister has set a date on which these proposals are intended to come into effect and we understand the anxiety of the government to facilitate changes to make some sense of a scheme which has thus far failed. We want to facilitate that also. So we do not intend, insofar as it is within our control, to hold these processes up in the Senate. But we do want to open up the process so that these significant issues that industry has been battering on the door of the government to have addressed and to have listened to do have an airing and so that we can have the opportunity of setting on track a process to make sure that the opportunities that should exist to grow jobs and to grow economic impetus in Australia are not missed. That is where we stand in relation to these measures. We want to be constructive, we want to see that these reductions in charges are brought into effect, but we want to make certain that all the other issues that stand in the way of making manufacturing in bond a growth sector for Australia are dealt with also.
I have mentioned my colleague who will be speaking later in this debate, and of course our industry spokesperson will be speaking further in this debate at a later stage. We say to the government: we would welcome your input into how that Senate process can be facilitated. We do not want to delay the matter but, on the other hand, we do not wish to give a tick to a process that only half deals with a deficiency that the government itself has identified and which has been the subject of continual representations by industry. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>IMPORT PROCESSING CHARGES AMENDMENT (WAREHOUSES) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Baird, Bruce, MP",LP,1999-06-10,"—I am pleased to be able to stand today and support  the government's bills, the Import Processing Charges Amendment (Warehouses) Bill 1999  and the related bill. I congratulate the Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice and Customs in terms of their roles. It is undoubtedly another significant move in making Australia more competitive in export markets. I was particularly interested to follow the member for Denison and to hear him say that the ALP were well ahead of the game. If ever there was a great degree of irony in a statement I have heard from the member for Denison it was in that. They are behind the eight ball in every aspect of this legislation. It was their government which when in power actually removed the provision for manufacture in bond in 1990. We have not had anything to replace it until the present government brought in the manufacture in bond initiative and the government's 1997 `Investing for Growth Industries' statement. It was because of that that the plans were implemented for manufacturing in bond.
Clearly some changes need to be made, because there have been some charges made in the processing of the documents on recovering the user-charges involved. Because of this bill that will no longer be the case, as there will be a charge only when the goods are brought into the country for domestic use. So it is a clear nonsense to say they were ahead of the game. They were behind the game, because when they were in government they did not have that provision at all. Certainly there have been some changes made, and we hear the comments that the member has made. But his example of computers, that those who wanted to assemble computers in the country would be disadvantaged because of the charges that would be made on the individual components for computers, is a bad one, because components for computers are brought in duty free and computers themselves are brought in duty free. It is fairly typical that the ALP do not get their facts right when they come into this chamber and claim they are ahead of the game. They are well behind the game, having abolished the scheme in 1990. Secondly, there was no record of their having raised before their 
 concerns about how this would operate. Finally, they raise problems in terms of the mythical computer case which has no validity.
The question of the GST again is a nonsense, because through this bill people will have to pay none of the normal duties on goods brought into the country and re-exported. It removes that requirement. If you want to talk exports, that is one of the great strengths of the GST. Instead of manufacturers in this country having a whole range of wholesale taxes—you know the range of them—all of that is removed and they can compete very effectively in the export marketplace without that tax impost. In my former life I was a Trade Commissioner, and I see that this would be an extremely important element. When you are overseas, you are often aware of the very fine margins that are involved for Australian products to actually be successful. Australian manufacturers and Australian mineral producers are extremely enthusiastic because they know what will happen as a result of instituting the GST scheme and how competitive it will make them. There are billions of dollars of tax reductions for our manufacturers and for our mineral producers in the export market because of the GST proposals.
So one huge furphy raised by the member for Denison, amongst the number of furphies he raised, is the question of the GST. This is the great strength in putting us in a viable and competitive position in relation to exports. It means that manufacturers will be able to produce goods in this arrangement. They will no longer be required to pay a processing charge. They will not have to pay the normal duties that apply. As long as items are brought into the country, assembled under this proposal of manufacturing in bond and then re-exported, no charges will be levied and the previous processing charges will be removed by virtue of this bill. It is only bringing it into the country that attracts the charges.
I think that is a great situation. It is fairly modest at the moment. I was interested in the proposal from the member for Denison, who suggested that the whole of Tasmania should be turned into a manufacturing bond island. Good try, but that is not quite appropriate. It 
 is modest at the moment. DHL is involved at  the moment. It is predominantly a freight forwarding company and obviously wants to get into the market. BHP has shown an interest. Undoubtedly, honourable members opposite have been briefed by BHP, and it is appropriate that they should be in terms of their concerns with some of the logistics.
Some concern has been raised about what this would mean for the minority of product which ends up in the domestic market and whether it would be taxed under the old regulation that was part of the legislation, where you paid the tax on either the components or the whole price of the product, depending on which was the cheaper. Even though the whole manufacturing in bond legislation was removed in 1990, the regulation continued. It was removed in 1998 as a result of this scheme being introduced.
We now have a situation where it is simply done on the components involved. It has not been proven that this will present a disadvantage. The member for Denison used the example of computers. That is not a valid example. I am sure the minister will keep her eye on it to see whether any changes are needed to finetune it. Some things are very clear. Firstly, this is a great scheme developed by this government. It is aimed at establishing Australia as a hub for manufacturing in bond here and then re-exporting. One of the hallmarks of this government—led, in particular, by the Deputy Prime Minister, Tim Fischer—has been a very strong emphasis on our trade potential. This legislation is part of establishing this country as a hub for the region, bringing product in, manufacturing it and sending it out to other areas.
Secondly, it creates potential for the future in encouraging more companies to establish and to operate under this scheme. If further requirements need to be changed, I am sure the government will look at that, but there is no doubt that it provides greater flexibility and removes some of the rigidity that was previously there. It removes the charges that were creating problems and making it unviable to establish such a manufacturing in bond requirement.
I believe the government and the ministers should be congratulated. The comments made by the opposition do not have a great deal of validity. The opposition should be congratulating the government on these changes rather than talking to the minor party upstairs to see what further trouble they can create. This has been called for by the companies involved. The government is acting. Some issues which are very much at the margin have been called to our attention by the member for Denison and I am sure the government will look at them.
However, overall, it is a great piece of legislation which highlights the government's strong commitment to export growth and to creating Australia as a centre for trade development for the region. It again highlights where we stand at the moment in the South-East Asian situation. This is the boom economy in South-East Asia. We talked in the past about the tiger economies of South-East Asia. Australia is now the tiger economy because the actions of this government have changed things so dramatically.",REPS,<title>IMPORT PROCESSING CHARGES AMENDMENT (WAREHOUSES) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Morris, Allan, MP",ALP,1999-06-10,"—I suggest that the member for Cook stay for a moment and I will explain what he misunderstood about what was said by the member for Denison about these warehouse bills—or he may want to read what I say in Hansard . He is a respected ex-minister of a state parliament and I would like to explain this while he is still here. The processing charge that is currently applicable, and which will still be applicable for imports to the domestic market, needs to be better understood. Clearly, from the member for Cook's comments, the government does not yet understand what issues are at stake.
I will go through it. There are two big benefits of MiB in Australia: our low transport costs into Asia and the fact that we are the second biggest domestic market in the region after Japan. Therefore, exports into our domestic market from a manufacturing in bond area are quite critical. When we look at charging $22.80 per customs entry for goods going into the domestic economy, we need to understand what that means. I will explain why the case of the computers that the mem 
 ber for Denison spoke about is such a critical issue.
A computer has literally hundreds of components. The entry through Customs charge is $22.80, plus 20c per line after 10. In other words, you are allowed 10 lines per entry, even though one line may have 10 transistors on it. If we then apply the processing charge on the entry into the domestic economy as if they were coming in as components, rather than having one line of 50 computers at $22.80 for the entry, we literally have hundreds of entries for each computer at $22.80. Even though each entry may have a number of components per line, the importer of the made-up computer is paying only the $22.80 on an entry about computers, not about components. That is the first point to understand.
With the margin on computers being very narrow, we will not have a hope in hell of attracting that kind of investment because any of those burdens will be unreasonable. What is more, it is not fair. Why should an importer pay a processing charge at one rate when a manufacturer is paying at a much greater rate, simply because he is being forced to pay out on components? I am sure the member for Cook is listening and that he will look at what he has said and at what I am saying. This is not a question of being critical; it is a question of saying it is a complicated point of logistics that is not commonly discussed in this parliament or even in the community. I can understand the government not getting in on it.
There are a number of goods where the raw material is dutiable but the finished product is not. I am not going to go through all of the different customs tariffs and duties that exist in this country but let me tell you that they were all designed for other reasons, for other ages. What we are trying to do here, and have been trying to do for 2½ years, is modernise our customs and manufacturing processes. The red tape is horrendous and the obstacles are quite serious. If we are genuine about attracting investment in modern manufacturing, we have to rethink it a lot more than we have. 
MiB came about not because the government had a bright idea but because in 1996 BHP, as part of their Steel River project in Newcastle, did a lot of work towards attracting investment to a very large piece of industrial land. They found that one of the impediments was our customs regime. They went to look at America where there are about 550 foreign trade zones that operate as if they are offshore. They are not duty free in the sense of avoiding duty. They are zones that are designed around industries—for instance, with the car industry in America most of the car components are made in foreign trade zones. They enter the American market as if they have come offshore, which makes them equal to importers of the same products.
BHP put forward in late 1996 a substantial proposal to the government recommending foreign trade zones. I was not aware of this, but I understand that DHL, a transport company mentioned by the member for Cook, was also putting forward similar proposals at about the same time, for other reasons, particularly around their business operations. Shortly after that submission went forward, the minister for industry established a committee of parliamentarians, chaired by the member for Wannon, to examine steel. As part of our investigations into steel and BHP, the committee received the submissions that BHP had previously put forward. The New South Wales government and the parliamentarians in the Hunter region supported those submissions and had recommended that BHP submit them to the committee. That committee recommended to the government—unanimously and in a bipartisan way—the adoption of the foreign trade zone concept.
There then ensued a debate for many months within the parties on both sides and within the department. In October 1997, the Leader of the Opposition, in a speech in Sydney at a Labor Party conference on the October Labour Day weekend, publicly supported the foreign trade zone concept and gave the Labor Party's support to the government for such a proposal. In December 1997, the government announced in its `Investing for Growth' statement the manufacturing in bond concept. We all supported it. It has not 
 been a political issue, and most of our discussions have essentially been private. I have discussed it with the member for Wannon on  a number of occasions, particularly in recent months.
We have been trying to achieve a consensus without it becoming polarised, because we know that investors and future manufacturers would not appreciate it if we made it some kind of political football. I have bitten my tongue on a number of occasions when trying to get these changes understood and supported. It is therefore disappointing that we are at the stage we are at now. I am urging government members and the department to try to understand the opportunity they have. They were given a policy concept which, quite frankly, came out of nowhere back in 1996. Most of us were sceptical of it because of the free trade zone implications, which most of us think do not work in the way the Australian customs system works.
Manufacturing in bond is a licensing system where a licence holder would guarantee the duty would be paid for those companies within their stable—the people they represent. We have been arguing for it to not be a physical zone but a virtual zone, a virtual bond store, which would mean that existing companies manufacturing in Australia could become absorbed by a licence holder where it suited them. They would be encouraged to export and also to examine their import costs. Quite frankly, a lot of companies who import goods and then either export them or go domestic do not try to get their tariffs back. The tariffs are often very small, the paperwork involved is cumbersome and most of them do not have customs expertise.
I have talked to a number of companies about that, particularly companies that make products in the chemical field. One company with substantial exports said, `We really cannot be bothered. It is too complicated. We would rather pay the duty and be done with it and shave our margins.' That has been the approach. We never saw ourselves as exporters. We have basically been a domestic manufacturer for domestic consumption. If we are going to move into the bigger markets in the export field, we have to understand that.
So the manufacturing in bond is a licensing system which means that the government is protected because the licence holder would guarantee the duties would be paid if the companies within that zone, within their stable, do not perform or go broke. Because the revenue is guaranteed, it is not a risky scheme in that sense. Secondly, it means existing manufacturers can be absorbed into it; if it is a virtual bond store, it is non-location specific. So a company with locations all over Australia could have all of those companies in a manufacturing in bond store, in that sense. The parameters of the store would be the stock control system of the licence holder, and that is quite straightforward. I get frustrated with my colleagues at times when they boast about their lack of computer literacy. I hear that more often than I want to. For parliamentarians to boast about that these days is disgraceful.
The fact is that the concept involved here is actually quite straightforward: a virtual bond store, where a stock control system—which is run by a licence holder and which Customs can scrutinise and audit as they wish—would mean that the old days of a physical store with padlocks and bars on the windows has long gone. But we still think the same idea. In fact, in the regulations that are now here, Customs say that the company will be required to keep its domestic inputs and its import inputs separate. So we are still in the physical store approach, still into physical barriers, which was the historic Customs role: if you crossed the barrier, you paid the duty. In the modern world where people work now, their components are floating around the world. They can be on an aeroplane, in a truck on a highway, in a train or in a ship: they know where they are and that they are coming together at a final manufacturing point. We need to move forward so that we can actually get in tune with that—because, if we do not, we will be left behind. We are being left behind already.
A month ago I was in Ireland, particularly looking at foreign trade zones at Shannon Airport. There are 20,000 jobs there—20,000 jobs developed through a foreign trade zone which is less sophisticated than what we are 
 putting forward here. Those jobs are not low wage jobs. They are good jobs. They are jobs for the skilled, with high wages. Ireland is not  a country of low wages. They are a small, highly skilled country with a good standard of living, on the edge of a small market—just like us. They learned years ago what was needed to make them viable and to attract investment, and they have got it in bucketloads.
Dell Computers make their computers in Ireland. They announced when I was there that they are moving a lot of their design capacity to be next to their manufacturing because, when you have got the assembly of goods, normally you get the product testing and eventually the design work as well—the very things that we want in this country. But we have to fit their system, we have to fit their requirements. This does not mean giving them some welfare or concession; it is actually saying, `Why would you want to charge somebody to tell us that they are bringing something into the country and then taking it out again—which is what actually happens now?'
Back in 1997 when the government made that announcement, and following that in July 1998, Customs and the department of industry produced a paper on manufacturing in bond which did two really quite serious things. Firstly, it actually specified the processing charges that would be applicable, and so we were telling prospective investors that they were going to be charged for bringing stuff in and sending it out. It is not a tariff and it is not a duty; it is a processing charge—and in many cases, given the value of some of the components, a very high charge, very much greater than tariffs. Secondly, it also told them about the dutiable content for goods coming into the country. The point raised by the member for Denison about how you eventually levy the duty is actually quite a critical one. We are trying to suggest here that the MiB concept is saying to our manufacturers, `You can set up a manufacturing facility onshore and pay the same duty on your input to the economy as any other importer, so that you are not burdened with any other cost.'
If one goes back to the regulations—and the member for Cook referred to those, and particularly to 72 and 72.2, which had been the regulations until they were changed only last year—the duty will be charged at the lower rate of either the components or the finished product. The government is really saying that something made in a manufacturing in bond context is not a product but a bundle of components, and the supplier has to keep tracking through all the components, pay the processing charge on the entries effectively as components and pay the duty on the components, if dutiable, as well. Well, we have just killed it. It defeats the whole purpose.
What happened post 1997 was, as Fred Brenchley said in the Bulletin in January, that Sir Humphrey took over. Customs and Treasury took over this system and saw it as a revenue system. This stuff was changed for revenue purposes and for no other reason. Logic says that, if you were trying to attract investment, you would apply duty at the lower rate. You would make it a level playing field so that a manufacturer in bond was no worse off than an importer. These things were in the regulations before. Today the government wants to put into legislation, into the law, the fact that your duty would be charged at the component level—no choice, no either/or; it must be at the component level. Why would you do that? My question to government members is: what is the point? It defeats the whole purpose.
These regulations have been in the system for decades. Why rip them out? At the same time as the government was talking in `Investing in Growth' about attracting investment to make manufacturing in Australia more competitive than it had been and make us more comparable with other countries—a measure which we supported and have given absolute support to for a year and a half—why would you suddenly introduce this and say, `By the way, we will levy a charge on the stuff being used and, secondly, we will now change the laws so that the duty is being paid at the maximum component level. Furthermore, when you report this stuff coming into the economy, you will be reporting it as com 
 ponents'? Why would you do that? It is against all the comments, against all the speeches, against all the government's policies.
Was Fred Brenchley right? Did Sir Humphrey take over? Did Customs or Treasury see it as a side revenue source? I honestly do not know—and I do not think the members of the government know either. When I raise this question, I am raising it in a genuine sense. There is a need to understand. Look at the Irish experience and see how they succeeded in attracting all those companies. There were 120 companies located at Shannon, with 20,000 jobs. How did it happen? They really made their customs system much more in tune with manufacturing needs than with revenue raising needs. They turned themselves inside out. Manufacturing in bond is a start in that process, but each time something happens we go one step forward and two backwards. That is what is happening now.
The regulations that were there until last year—particularly 72.2—should still be there. All the government needs to do is to let it go back to what it was—the `either/or' where the duty is charged at the component rate or at the finished product rate. From discussions with BHP and with DHL, the only two companies in the field at the moment—and we want more in the field—there are a lot of people interested in what we do. We offer some massive advantages: a stable social environment, a stable political environment, a high skilled work force, a large market in relative terms and excellent education systems. There are a whole range of factors which make us very attractive.
We have one major impediment, and it dates back to the Rum Corps days, to our system of excise and duty—a system which was originally a government revenue system. The revenues we are forgoing by making it so difficult are vastly greater than the revenues we gain in this system. Getting those investments and those jobs in Australia is worth squillions to us. It is not just that; it is worth our future. There is a massive future in modern manufacturing if we understand it. And if we do not understand it, it is at our 
 own peril. Our best chance of switching from resource based, low value added, low skilled exports to being a more high skilled exporter of manufactured goods lies in rethinking why we do things the way we do.
I would have preferred a foreign trade zone—the way we put forward at the start. But people saw that as being too complicated in legislation. MiB was a halfway house. The government is now saying Tradex is going to fix it, but Tradex is just as bad. It has all the same problems and will not fix it at all. If the government thinks that, it is being misled. So I am urging those on the other side in both houses to look at what has been said over the last year and a half since  Investing for Growth. Go back, if you like, and ask BHP for their submission to the government. Ask DHL for their submission to the government. Look at what they are saying. Look at what the government has said in its speeches in response. The government has supported the thrust of all of these things. Then we got to the legislation and it went backwards. The question is: why? I hope that in the Senate the government will actually answer some of those questions and accept that what we are trying to do is to get a workable system. We are not looking for some phrase or some slogan; we are looking for a workable system that will attract investment. What we are doing at the moment still does not do what is required. I urge this House to understand that, because the future of this country is much more in these things than in most things we ever debate.",REPS,<title>IMPORT PROCESSING CHARGES AMENDMENT (WAREHOUSES) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Lindsay, Peter, MP",LP,1999-06-10,"—I thank the member for Newcastle for his thoughtful, positive and supportive contribution to the debate. I am interested in the one impediment to the growth in our country that he did refer to in the latter part of his speech. There is another impediment, of course, and that is that the country desperately needs a new tax system. The government is certainly proceeding along those lines.
The  Import Processing Charges Amendment (Warehouses) Bill 1999  is part of the Investing for Growth strategy that the government has implemented, a strategy that has provided an additional $1.26 billion over four years to 
 encourage business innovation, boost investment, improve our trade performance and enhance our competitiveness in key sectors, including information technology and financial services.
The major initiatives in the Investing for Growth strategy are fourfold: a substantial increase in support for innovation, with $1 billion to encourage increased business research and development over the next four years; the establishment of a new agency, Invest Australia, to more actively promote Australia as an investment location and to identify strategic new investment opportunities; extending the Export Market Development Grants program, at a cost of about $150 million a year in 2000-01 and 2001-02; and introducing a new system—the fourth initiative is what this bill is all about—of manufacturing in bond to allow firms to use Australia as a regional hub for operations without incurring duty liability on goods for re-export or for use as inputs to exports.
There are a number of other measures involved in the Investing for Growth strategy, but I would like to continue in relation to this bill. The bill provides a legislative base for MiB and ensures that regulations that will be made will be lawful. The government has a policy of attracting international investment for export related industries. This bill gives effect to this policy.
For manufacturing in bond sites, there will be no import processing charges, customs duties or sales taxes. The bill takes effect as of 29 April 1999 and provides interested businesses with a certainty of charges from that date. There is already one approved manufacturing in bond warehouse in Brisbane. I think in the area of the member for Newcastle there is some interest in the Steel River concept. This now makes that a viable possibility.
For my own region there are certainly some very great opportunities for Townsville to use what is in this bill to further our city and to further the development, growth and prosperity in the region. Townsville has one of the best ports in Australia. It is the third largest port in Queensland, but its facilities and its closeness to the South Pacific and Asia 
 underline the opportunities we have as a regional city. Townsville is also Australia's largest tropical city. Most people, when asked that question, would nominate Cairns. Cairns is actually a small village about 400 kilometres north of Townsville.
—With or without Thuringowa?
—With Thuringowa. Or they would nominate Darwin. But Darwin is considerably smaller than Townsville. So here we have an opportunity for a manufacturing in bond process to establish—probably in the port area, as the land is available. But, more than that, we have an established international airport in Townsville. And product coming into the MiB process could come through the international airport.
I would like to see businesses in my city seize the opportunities that are now provided by this bill and look closely at how there is now another business opportunity to do well. We would build on the resources available in the near Asian countries and in the South Pacific. We should not overlook countries like the Solomon Islands, for example, which would not normally be considered. There is an easy link between Townsville and the Solomon Islands. We should not overlook New Guinea. But equally so, we should not overlook what is in the hinterland behind Townsville and the metal refineries that are in Townsville that could contribute to the operation of the MiB process. Townsville supports the largest mineral region in the world. The north-west minerals province in western Queensland has the most potential and the most readily available mineral product that exists in the world today. We have copper, lead, zinc, gold and so on. That is all available to be used as part of this particular process.
Those wishing to take advantage of this legislation should approach the Department of Industry, Science and Resources with their business plan. The department will check out that business plan and, if it is in accordance with the operation of this particular legislation, the department will then recommend and pass that on to the customs department, which will then issue a bonded warehouse licence. It is a very simple process. It is something 
 that is easy to do, and there is no reason why local businesses in the Townsville- Thuringowa region should not now be able to take advantage of that.
As I have moved around Australia I have seen many cluster operations begin. I saw one very recently in Sydney at North Ryde, around the CSIRO facility there, which has turned into an information technology type cluster.
—That is the Prime Minister's electorate, is it?
—It is; it is the member for Bennelong's electorate. I think there is an opportunity to get a cluster system involved in this particular process as well. It is not only information technology, it is also biotechnology. Biotechnology is rapidly overtaking the major advances and importance of information technology. This bill provides for a manufacturing in bond process which further underlines and underscores the strength that we can have in our Australian economy. I recommend the bill to the House. I am pleased to see that there is support from the opposition in relation to this bill.",REPS,<title>IMPORT PROCESSING CHARGES AMENDMENT (WAREHOUSES) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,1999-06-10,"—The opposition's position on the Import Processing Charges Amendment (Warehouses) Bill has been outlined comprehensively by the shadow minister for customs, who has had principal responsibility for dealing with this matter, and supported by the member for Newcastle, who has been an active advocate of development in this issue for some time but particularly since the steel industry crisis in Newcastle, which led to the establishment of a House of Representatives committee to look into issues relating to the iron and steel industry. This became a central point in the recommendations concerning a possible response to the steel industry crisis. The member for Newcastle was a leading participant in that and a leading advocate of this policy within the committee, in the public debate and inside the Labor Party.
It has now become more than a response to the Newcastle crisis. It is becoming an opportunity for Australia to play an enhanced role in the regional warehousing and manufacturing business for the whole of the western 
 Pacific. It is in that capacity and as shadow minister for industry that I want to say a few things about potential, and why this legislation, even though it needs some scrutiny, should proceed. It is a step in the right direction. I still do not think the government has got it right. There is a lot of talk about this being new. It is in fact a very old idea—an idea that has been implemented in Australia before and that was wound up on the basis of an Industry Commission report.
Historians will judge whether the criticisms that were made at the time of the way that scheme was running were correct or not. It may well be that either the time was wrong or the model was wrong. At the moment it is a judgment I cannot make. Looking back, there was not much controversy about the decision at the time—I do not remember it being a hard-fought matter; I think it was pretty well shared—that for some reason or other it was not working. Perhaps it is the advancement of globalisation that has created the circumstance where now there are new opportunities for this. That is one of the things I want to talk about—the fact that perhaps we can go beyond the old concept of manufacturing in bond and the image it has of fenced off areas, like big free trade zones, and look a bit more imaginatively at how manufacturing in bond might be allied with modern technology. We can look at what I think the member for Newcastle referred to as `virtual bond stores' and make it possible for smaller companies to participate to open up some new possibilities.
However we proceed, the element in this measure that goes to removing the processing charges is a necessary part of the process. It is one step along the road to making Australia active as a regional manufacturing and warehousing site. The government announced it was going to do this some time ago. There was a substantial amount of concern and apprehension between December 1997 and April, when the policy with regard to the processing charge—the cost recovery charge—was announced, which has been reflected in this legislation. That caused a lot of consternation and the process did not go 
 anywhere—we were not making any significant progress.
Industry still is expressing to me apprehension that there is a long way to go before we maximise the potential of the initiative. This is a broadly bipartisan initiative. I do not know of any significant resistance to the principle in the broader Australian community. There may be some dissidents, but they have not made themselves known to me. I have not seen it reported—neither in the parliament nor in the public debate. But there is debate about the detail, about how Australian participants in this scheme become domestic suppliers. I know it is possible—the rules are there—but there is debate about whether the playing field is level both for them vis-a-vis overseas suppliers and vis-a-vis Australian domestic producers, although of course it is possible for Australian domestic producers to become domestic MiB suppliers if they think that is an advantage to them.
But we do have to make sure that domestic suppliers under MiB are able to compete equally with suppliers from overseas, because—and this goes to the treatment of components, the treatment of consumables—we will have to look at the application of the GST regime in this area is well. That does not go to the merits or otherwise of the GST—which is a debate for another time and which probably most Australians think we have had enough of, although I regret to tell them there is a lot more to come—but, if it happens, we have to make sure that its application in MiB circumstances do not create, at least in cash flow terms, a relative disadvantage for domestic suppliers. That is an issue to be addressed. I do not expect this bill, of course, to address that matter, because we are not at the point of doing that, but it is a matter that the government will have to address.
There is the consumption of production consumables, the things that you buy that you use up within the manufacturing enterprise on which duty is paid. How is that matter to be dealt with for competition with domestic supply? There is the question of what I think the member for Newcastle referred to in his speech as the `single licence, multiple user option' and the virtual bond store concept. 
 These are important issues, and they also overlap with the question of the licence fees to establish a MiB operation. All of these are issues that I, on behalf of the opposition, want to say we will be focusing a lot of attention on. We want to give this proposal more scrutiny. We do not want to interfere with what seems, on the face of it, to be a step forward in improving the operation of the existing scheme. If it gives one more company the chance to participate effectively, it is a plus. But if it does not take us as far as we should go, it is a wasted opportunity. That is the balance we are trying to strike here, and that is the balance we will try to strike in the Senate consideration of this matter.
The circumstance we face today is we know we have a general consensus about the direction in which we want to go with this issue. But we are inching forward very cautiously. The government is inching forward very cautiously and, on behalf of the opposition, I say that we do not have the resources to leap from where we are to a new policy position. We will closely monitor what the government does and, if we are not satisfied with what it is doing, we will go to the next election with a policy designed to facilitate and enhance the operation of this manufacturing in bond scheme as it evolves over the next two years. We will be reviewing it. We will be closely liaising with the industry participants, ensuring that we proceed as fast as we can on the scheme that the government has, and developing an alternative scheme so that we achieve the maximum economic benefit for the Australian industry and position Australia most effectively to be an effective participant in the emerging global economy.
This is not the answer to Australia's participation; this is a small piece in the mosaic of initiatives we have to take to establish Australia as a successful manufacturing participant in the global economy, which we need to be because manufacturing remains the fastest growing area of world trade. Australia needs to participate more effectively in that rapidly growing area if we are to create wealth and to be able to distribute that wealth successfully. This is a step. We do not wish to impede its progress, so we will happily 
 cooperate in its passage through the House. We will give it some extra scrutiny in the  Senate, and we will be working to develop better and more comprehensive alternatives in the lead-up to the next election.",REPS,<title>IMPORT PROCESSING CHARGES AMENDMENT (WAREHOUSES) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Rudd, Kevin, MP",ALP,1999-06-10,"—The manufacturing in bond scheme, which is the subject of the Import Processing Charges Amendment (Warehouses) Bill 1999  and the Customs Amendment (Warehouses) Bill 1999 , is potentially an important one in terms of its overall impact not only on Australian manufacturing but on the contribution that can be made by Australian manufacturing to Australia's overall international export performance. When we look at the MiB scheme and its potential for utilisation in Australia, we see that until now the utilisation has been relatively limited. An MiB scheme was utilised in Australia by a limited number of manufacturers until 1988. It was abolished as a result of the IC's 1987 report. It was suggested for reintroduction by the Australian iron and steel industry report to the then Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism and by the parliamentary committee inquiring into the steel industry under the chairmanship of David Hawker in September 1997. In December 1997 the government announced the Investing for Growth strategy that contained both the MiB and Tradex initiatives.
Manufacturing in bond is a provision to allow the manufacturing of goods in a Customs licensed warehouse. A firm with MiB approval will be able to import dutiable goods into a licensed warehouse free of duty and sales tax. If these goods are subsequently re-exported, in either their original or their manufactured form, no duty or sales tax liability is incurred. Imports brought into the warehouse and subsequently entered for home consumption—that is, sold into the domestic market—incur a duty and sales tax liability at the time they leave the warehouse.
Benefits to manufacturers under this scheme are potentially similar to those of free trade zones, such as the deferral of duty until products are sold into the domestic market, duty payable on goods released into the domestic market being the lesser of the amount payable on the input goods to that 
 applying to the finished product, and duties not being payable on imports imported into the zone and then re-exported without the domestic market. The immediate objective of the MiB is to facilitate trading operations by streamlining the administration of imports which are subsequently re-exported whether processed or in their original form. The broader objective is to generate net additional economic activity in employment in Australia.
Our view is that, to be competitive and innovative and to be part of the global economy, ideas such as the MiB need to be developed. But, as the shadow minister who has just spoken has pointed out, they need to be developed in a correct manner. To date, the government has not demonstrated a great degree of competence in its handling of what is potentially a good idea. To date, we have seen nearly a year and a half of useful time wasted in the development of this proposal, yet find it developed in a manner which still does not meet the industry's requirements.
The opposition will support the passage of this bill through the House, but we need to look at it carefully in the Senate, along with the minor parties, and make appropriate amendments to it. The opposition has for a long time been considerably out in front of the government when it comes to its understanding, its comprehension and its support for initiatives such as MiB.
—We're in front all the time.
—As the honourable member for Bowman has interjected, generally in terms of its approach to initiatives in support of Australian exporters and initiatives in support of the economic development of this country, the Labor Party has a proud history of internationalising the economy and encouraging and assisting Australian businesses to take the lead in furthering our interests in the global economy.
The Labor Party, unlike the government, intends to listen to and to consult with all industry groups affected. In formulating our approach to be adopted in the Senate, we will take our position from those consultations. This is an overall process that will involve an examination of issues in their technical detail and meshing that with appropriate consulta 
 tion with all industry groups and individual firms affected. Unfortunately, the same spirit  of consultation has not been evident in the approach taken by the government.
There are a number of specific issues which we in the opposition wish to see further examined in this overall proposal. First, we are concerned about the duty paid on consumables before the production process. Consumables are those products that are consumed in the manufacturing process, such as petroleum, machine tools or solder. Imported consumables currently require duty to be paid before they are used in manufacture in bond. Second, there is the duty to be paid on capital equipment. Imported capital also carries a duty with it into manufacture in bond. However, capital as a fixed investment may well require a different approach than that which is taken with consumable inputs.
Third, we need to look at those costs imposed on this process by Customs and the best methods required to reduce them to the smallest possible level for the service to be delivered. Fourth, there is the current high cost of obtaining a manufacture in bond licence. Fifth, there is the current requirement that MiBs go to those who can demonstrate an almost exclusive export benefit. Sixth, we need to examine the potential benefits for on-selling to the Australian market products made through the manufacture in bond process. Seventh, we need to examine the effects that the MiB licences have on the competitive ability of those domestic producers who at present do not have a MiB licence.
Eighth, we need to look at making MiBs non-location specific in the licence agreement; that is, to look at allowing production at multiple sites under one licence through the use of a one-licence multiple user model. Finally, we need to look at per item accounting for MiBs through virtual bond store rather than warehouse specific MiBs, to allow production through any facility at any location in Australia. These are all important aspects of this overall proposal which need to be examined when the Senate goes through this bill in detail.
The overall proposal for MiBs, as I said in my initial remarks, is particularly important 
 in terms of its contribution to Australia's export performance. It is on that question that I would like to address a few additional remarks. Australia's export performance in the last six to nine months has been spiralling downwards. We have repeated pronouncements by ministers sitting on the front bench opposite that, due to the leadership of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Trade, the export performance of this country is going through the roof. If we look at the cold, hard, statistical reality, we find that in fact the reverse is the case. Month by month we are generating balance of trade numbers for this country which this country has not seen before.
When the Treasurer of the Commonwealth stands and proclaims the fact—as he would see it—that Australia is an economic miracle in Asia-Pacific economic terms, given the downturn of the last year and a half, his remarks are completely out of order when you look at the actual reality of declining export performance. There is a large locomotive coming down the train tracks towards fortress economic Australia at the moment called the balance of trade deficit, which in turn is fuelling an exploding current account deficit.
It is arguable, when you look at the analysis in terms of Australia's current performance on the export front, as to when we are likely to hit the wall, when the current account numbers become such that the international market reaction becomes unsustainable. We have had repeated warnings that, once this country breaks through the threshold of a six per cent of GDP current account deficit number, international financial markets will begin to react negatively to the Australian dollar. We are on or about six per cent now. Six per cent was the figure where the current account deficit stood when the banana republic statement was made more than a decade ago.
Most market analysts now would say that the elasticity within financial markets lies somewhere between six and seven per cent. Their view of this economy—and this is based on what the analysts with whom I have spoken have said—is that if the export performance of this economy continues to dete 
 riorate and domestic consumption continues to explode—reinforcing a parallel increase in imports—then it is not inconceivable that within the next 12 months we will see the current account deficit figure rise from somewhere in the vicinity of six per cent to seven per cent. If that occurs, I think we are beginning to enter into extremely dangerous territory.
The great and unstated risk this national economy faces at present is the reaction of the international markets to an unsustainable level of Australian debt. If that occurs, and we see the selling down of the Australian dollar, the consequences it will have across the cycle in terms of interest rates, economic activity and employment will be most serious. It will be interesting to match the rhetoric which will be used to defend the economy's performance at that time by the government which occupies the treasury bench at present, against the triumphalist rhetoric that is currently being used by the government in describing the economy's performance today.
I place on record today, in this parliament and in the Hansard, that we are facing a major potential current account crisis. The export performance of the country is not contributing anything at this stage to the amelioration of that potential crisis. The export nonperformance of this economy at present is in fact exacerbating that emerging difficulty. Furthermore, when we look at the explosion in domestic consumption and the fact that consumption is the single factor which is driving growth in this economy at present and not investment, the prognosis becomes quite gloomy. The sort of triumphalism we hear opposite is, I think, within 12 months, likely to be extremely misplaced against the cold, hard economic reality we are likely to face at that time.
The government always uses the excuse of the East Asian economic downturn to justify the problems we currently encounter on the export front. However, it was the same government during the unfolding of this crisis that said repeatedly that, while the crisis had hit East Asia, the policy management of this economy had been such that we had been fireproofed and ring-fenced—that we had 
 somehow been immunised from the effect of this crisis on the Australian domestic economy. If we look at the tonality of the comments of the Treasurer and other economic spokesmen on this question over the last two to three months, I think it is fair to say that that tonality has changed. We have moved from capital `t' Triumphalism to small `t' triumphalism, the reason being that even the Treasurer, and certainly his advisers in the Treasury and those who provide economic advice to the Prime Minister, would see that this train is rumbling down the tracks towards us. And, when it arrives, the impact on the domestic health of this economy will be something that we will all watch with grave concern.
The comments I have just made relate to the problems of this economy's external account, problems which are not being addressed by the current raft of policy put forward by the government. If you look at the potential impact of the tax package the government has initiated, its single impact through its fiscal stimulus will be to suck in more imports to the economy and lead to a further deterioration in the trade and current accounts. Furthermore, when we start to see economic activity heading in reverse and negative numbers emerging on the economic growth front that a budget surplus is necessary to be drawn upon to cope with the sort of social security requirements and other government outlays that inevitably arise at a time of economic downturn—when the social burden increases.
Our grave concern with the fiscal planning for the government's current tax package is that, when the time arises to draw on those fiscal resources of government, that surplus will not be there. It will have been flushed down the drain in executing the transaction that the government has sought to pull off with the Democrats over the last couple of weeks. We are frittering away what would otherwise be a substantial surplus to be drawn upon for future requirements when the overall pattern of economic activity heads south.
I make those remarks in a broader context as well and it relates not just to the problems we face on exports and international econom 
 ic competitiveness but more broadly to this government's overall approach to its international engagements—economic and otherwise. I have just returned from a period in Indonesia and prior to that I spent some time in China. I think it is interesting to note, each time one comes back from the region, the residual impact that this government's management of its international posture over the last two or three years has had. What you find in each capital across the region is still a level of scepticism and cynicism about the sincerity of this government's commitment to continued integration with the economies of the region and, more broadly, with the Asia-Pacific region.
It is my melancholy duty to report to the House that the residual influence of Hansonism in terms of the region's perception of Australia is still very large. When you explain to the region and to its principal political and economic players that, in fact, the member for Oxley, as she was then, has since been voted out of the legislature they say that is not so much the complaint. The complaint is about the manner in which the government dealt with Hansonism when it existed and existed in particular strength during the time when Pauline Hanson was the member for Oxley.
The reaction that we have had and that we hear across the region is that this government was not nearly strong enough in its response to the Hanson challenge when it existed. All governments and senior corporate executives in the region said that when they saw evidence of the rise of One Nation and the set of political sentiments associated with it they could accept and understand that this was a phenomenon which does occur elsewhere in the world. They looked at the rise of extreme right wing parties in Germany, France and elsewhere. However, what they find inexplicable and incapable of finding justification for was the government's failure at the time to provide a robust refutation of what Hansonism stood for. What sticks most clearly in the minds of government and political leaders across the region was the silence of the Prime Minister for such a long period. What sticks in their minds was his use of the Voltairean 
 defence of Ms Hanson: that is, he may not agree with what she said but would defend her right to say it.
—Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. I was listening to the thoughtful contribution by the member for Griffith but, as we are debating the Customs Amendment (Warehouses) Bill 1999  and the Import Processing Charges Amendment (Warehouses) Bill 1999 , the impact of Hansonism is very remote from the topic of the bills that we are discussing. I would ask you to bring the honourable member back to the question before the House.
—The honourable member will return to the question before the House.
—When we look at the contents of the legislation before the House and the particular role which MiB plays in the prosecution of Australian exports and the enhancement of Australia's balance of trade and current account circumstances, I think it is inappropriate for the parliamentary secretary at the table to somehow conclude that exports and Australia's international economic activity can be clinically separated from the way in which the region and the world—both as markets and economies—view us. These are not clinically distinct commodities; they interrelate. The decisions by entrepreneurs and businessmen across the region, in particular, about whether they do business with Australian companies, about whether they buy Australian products, and about whether, in fact, it is worth while investing here in the first place are anchored in a series of perceptions about this country of which the Hanson phenomenon is a large part. It is not only the Hanson phenomenon that is a large part of it but also the government's handling of the Hanson phenomenon. They are wrapped together.
What we are looking at is a challenge to the current account, a challenge to the balance of trade and a challenge to this government's policy credentials. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>IMPORT PROCESSING CHARGES AMENDMENT (WAREHOUSES) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,1999-06-10,"—in reply—I am pleased that the honourable members for 
 Denison, Herbert, Newcastle, Cook, Fraser and Griffith participated in this debate. It is reassuring to see that there is broad general support for this very important policy initiative being implemented as a result of the bills currently before the House.
In December 1997, the government announced in its `Investment for Growth' industry statement that it proposed to introduce schemes designed to make Australia more attractive as a site for regional manufacturing and warehousing. Honourable members opposite suggested that the government has dragged the chain, that it has delayed and that it has lost 18 months in implementing what is an initiative which shares bipartisan support. It should be remembered, of course, that the former Labor government, acting on a Productivity Commission report, chose to do away with the previous manufacturing in bond scheme which was then operational. This government ought to be commended for implementing this scheme as a result of the `Investment for Growth' industry statement.
In 1998, the government announced that this scheme would be introduced. The aim of this initiative is designed to remove all duties for goods brought into and subsequently re-exported from what are known as MiB warehouses. In announcing this policy on 20 March 1998, the then Minister for Industry, Science and Technology—my good friend and parliamentary colleague the honourable member for Ryan—said that MiB will help businesses use Australia as a base for operating in the Asia-Pacific region without incurring customs duties or sales tax on products intended for re-export. MiB will provide more streamlined administration of imports intended for re-export in either their original or manufactured form.
Earlier debate has seen that DHL and BHP have expressed interest in this concept. However it is clear, and it ought to be recognised, that operators of MiB warehouses have been subject to import processing charges and fees that were introduced in 1997 to recover the costs incurred in processing what are known as `customs entries'. Currently a charge applies to entries lodged to allow imported 
 goods to be moved into and, where those goods go into Australian commerce, out of warehouses.
Industry has claimed that these charges and fees make the operation of MiB warehouses uneconomic and serve as obstacles to attracting international manufacturing and investment to Australia. Therefore, the government has responded to representations by industry, and it is addressing the problems through the proposed amendments to these bills. However, goods entering the domestic market will attract the same fees and charges as goods imported into Australia through a general warehouse, as well as, of course, the relevant customs duty and sales tax ordinarily payable on the imported goods. The bills provide that goods exported from a MiB warehouse do not have to pay these charges.
While keeping the maximum amount payable for processing various types of entries in the act itself, the amendments proposed in these bills will also allow the regulations to make changes to customs charges providing flexibility in meeting emerging industry requirements. This flexibility will remove the rigidity in the current structure and enable cost recovery charges to be adapted more easily in the future to meet government initiatives and other changed circumstances.
These changes in the bill will commence from 29 April 1999, the date the government announced this initiative. There is some inconsistency on the part of those honourable members opposite. The honourable member for Denison claimed that the government was in fact very slow in introducing this amendment, but the honourable member for Fraser, admitting that there is a general consensus on this issue, suggests that it is more appropriate to inch along cautiously. He also said that he wanted to scrutinise the bills further in the Senate, as was mentioned by other honourable members representing the opposition.
The honourable member for Newcastle, obviously speaking from the heart, given the fact that he is one of the representatives from the Hunter Valley, clearly was interested in the concept of a free trade zone. I must say that all of us individually would like a free trade zone in our own electorate. But the MiB 
 scheme, which is being implemented by these bills, is, as was conceded by the honourable member for Denison, a much more appropriate way to proceed, because it means that, effectively, provided the circumstances are met, we can have these free trade zones in all parts of the country. The honourable member for Newcastle referred to regulation 72 and suggested that it ought to be reinstated or ought to have been left in the provisions.
I want to place on record that regulation 72 related to the MiB arrangements which were abolished by the former Labor government in 1990 and was therefore redundant. The MiB initiative is aimed at attracting investment for export but, where goods enter the domestic market from MiB, they are treated in exactly the same way as a local manufacturer who imports components to manufacture a final product. Both MiB and local manufacturers compete equally with a direct import of a final product.
The honourable member for Denison, who has returned to the chamber, and the honourable member for Newcastle, suggested that each and every component will attract a $22.80 charge on import. Import entries do attract a charge of $22.80 but these apply to all components included in the entry. There was an example given of 100 components. They would attract, so I am advised, a charge of only $22.80 if included in one entry and not $2,280.
The honourable member for Newcastle also spoke about what happened following the difficulties of the steel industry in that region. The honourable member for Denison, in addition to claiming that the whole of Tasmania ought to be made some sort of free trade zone, indicated his lack of understanding of the way in which computer components are treated on import. As was pointed out by my colleague the honourable member for Cook, these are largely not subject to duty.
Mr Kerr interjecting—
—It really is important to recognise that this is a very important piece of legislation. The government is implementing the strategy which was announced because we see that, in view of the position in which Australia now finds itself, having a 
 very strong economy in a weak region, there are very real opportunities that we have as a nation to boost our export performance. Honourable members representing the opposition referred adversely to the new tax system which will be implemented and suggested that the GST would in some way negatively impact on Australia's exports. It is a simple fact that there will be a tremendous boost to Australia's exports as a result of the implementation of A New Tax System. We are certainly not going to apologise for that because we believe that A New Tax System is what Australia needs. The people of Australia, at the election last year, voted very strongly to give us a mandate, and we are seeking to implement our promise.
The honourable member for Denison also suggested that there had not been opportunity for industry to meet with senior levels of government. This is simply not correct. This government is a consultative government—
Mr Kerr interjecting—
—We are regularly available to talk with people. The honourable member for Denison should listen; he ought to know what I am about to say. Industry has had numerous meetings with both senior staff of the Australian Customs Service and the Department of Industry, Science and Resources as well as the officers of several ministers in the government. There has been a wide consultation. People who wanted to put forward a point of view have certainly had the opportunity to do so.
The honourable member for Herbert outlined the wonderful opportunities available to the Townsville region and also the benefits which would flow to his area. The debate was largely bipartisan until the belated entry of the honourable member for Griffith who, most inappropriately in my view, sought to criticise the Prime Minister and the government for our approach to the Hanson phenomenon of last year. The Prime Minister's approach was absolutely right. We are a nation where, as a free society, people do have the opportunity to express their views. The government indicated that we did not agree with the views of Ms Hanson. The government at the federal election put the One Nation Party last by way 
 of preferences, and in Queensland we did put One Nation last. We took certain personal and political risks in doing so, but we stood up for principle, the Prime Minister stood up for principle, and he was rewarded with the very strong support of the Australian people who gave the Howard government a mandate to be the government of this country as we move to the next millennium.
This is, as I said at the outset, one of those pieces of legislation which does broadly enjoy bipartisan support. The debate and the argument has largely been at the margins. I personally was interested in the suggestion that there ought to be, as we move into this technological age, `virtual' warehouses and locations and that maybe we ought not look at the physical location of these particular places. This is something which certainly could be considered for the future. I thank honourable members for their contributions and commend these two bills to the House of Representatives.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Kerr, Duncan, MP",ALP,1999-06-10,"—It is rare in this parliament for a bill to have the characteristics of being controversial and inconsequential at the same time, but that really is the nature of the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Amendment Bill 1999 . The controversial aspect of its background simply lies in the quite unfounded claims that were made in the second reading speech regarding the history of the establishment of the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act and the way in which, as the minister at the table suggested, this measure would in some way be a major improvement in the way the legislation would operate.
The facts are rather more pedestrian. The facts are that the legislation was established many years ago, during the term of the former Labor government, and the legislation has been of use to protect and to prevent the export from Australia of some items which would otherwise have left this country for purchasers abroad. The Minister for the Arts and the Centenary of Federation, in introducing the bill, instanced some of the kinds of matters that could be subject to such protection, from art works to fossils, historic manuscripts to steam engines, Aboriginal sacred/secret material to Sir Donald Bradman's cricket bat. So far so good.
What the government really claims as its major new addition to the legislative framework is a proposal to change the financial provisions relating to the fund or the trust that is established under the legislation and to shift it to operate in the same terms as other accounts under the Financial Management and Accountability Act. This is a matter of such inconsequence that one really is puzzled that any claim of merit is attached to it. The previous legislation established financial mechanisms which allowed for the establishment of a fund to purchase back in some 
 instances property which would otherwise have been prevented from leaving this country but where a private owner might have possession of it, if it was thought appropriate. Successive governments have not thought it necessary to provide funding of any standing nature for those arrangements. That is not to say that the act has not been used to prevent the export of movable cultural property items—it has. But there has been no pressure from either the former Labor governments or, indeed, the Howard government during its first term in office in relation to the provisions relating to the fund which was established by legislation but not utilised hitherto.
Now the government comes forward and says that it is going to provide a whopping $0.5 million to go into that fund on a rolling basis. There we are, a whopping $0.5 million, to protect Australia's movable cultural heritage. When an order is made preventing the export, for example, of Sir Donald Bradman's bat or of some important cultural treasure—an artwork of some substance by one of Australia's early colonial painters or, indeed, by Arthur Boyd, or a work by some artist that has contemporary significance—there will come the government to say to the person who would have otherwise sold to the international market and whose present options are to sell only to an Australian domestic purchaser, `We will make certain that you are not financially disadvantaged in any way, and here we have this whopping $0.5 million to do it.'
Forgive me a little moment's cynicism, but the way things are going with items of some historic and cultural significance, I reckon you could subtitle this bill `The Plugger's Ball Trust Fund', because it is about the sort of fund level that would be appropriate for securing for Australia one Bradman cricket bat and one Plugger ball. And on the other provisions in the bill which facilitate and encourage private donations towards this fund, I have to say to you that I am not so sure that there will be a huge return on that. The private sector, which is being encouraged, quite properly, to make contributions to the arts, might well say there are better places to put their money in terms of protection of 
 Australia's cultural property because the bill itself can provide an effective framework for refusing export permits in relation to that property.
One might have thought that those who were of a philanthropic mind might prefer to direct their energies to some other areas rather than towards securing the financial wellbeing of the propertied and moneyed classes in Australia who have the financial wherewithal to sell items of this nature.
That is not to say that there will be some instances where this legislation does not have some importance. There may be some instances where, for example, as is I think the case with a couple of our Olympians, illness or some personal tragedy strikes, they are not particularly well off financially and wish to be able to sell something they treasure—a medal or something of that kind—and the Australian domestic marketplace cannot provide an adequate return for that property. But I suspect those cases are quite rare. Indeed, I would think that in most instances where items of particularly Australian interest were on the market there would be an Australian purchasing market rather than an international one, particularly for things like war medals and Olympic gold medals and the like.
I am not seeking to entirely trivialise what the government is wishing to do in relation to this measure but to put it in some kind of context. This is not groundbreaking legislation. This simply changes one set of financial arrangements which have been in place for a decade but which have not been utilised by previous governments—Labor governments or, indeed, the Howard government during its first term—and sets up a new financial and accountability framework for the management of that fund, which has hitherto not been utilised, under the arrangements which now apply for the management of government held funds. Fine. Good. We have no objections to it, and we wish this bill speedy passage through the House.
On the other hand, we would point to the irony of a circumstance where we are talking about the protection of our cultural heritage at the same time as the government is doing its level best not to facilitate us having a 
 future cultural heritage. We have got a government with eyes fixed on the past. If it is the Bradman bat, if we see it in sepia tones, if it is the old documents—
—The 1950s; Mr Howard's 1950s.
—Not just the 1950s. It goes back to well before then. It is the dreams of the Howard childhood, I suspect, that we are thinking of here. If those items are sought to be removed from Australia, the act will come into place to prevent their export. Again, we set that legislation up. They were sensible measures. The fund, such as it is, the half a million dollars, will be there to make certain that people who are placed in that position, at least in some instances, will be able to assert that they have suffered some loss and detriment, and the fund may be used to make good any private loss they have suffered.
But what about our future cultural heritage? The Australia Council, which is the government's principal adviser in relation to arts and cultural matters, provided evidence to the Senate inquiry into the goods and services tax to the effect that the impact of the goods and services tax on the arts sector would be devastating. That evidence was uncontradicted. There was no suggestion at all through the proceedings by any person—Treasury or any of the other witnesses—that evidence given by the Australia Council, research that was privately commissioned through KPMG and verified by Econtech that the arts sector would be peculiarly disadvantaged by a goods and services tax, was other than a strictly accurate account of what would be the impact of the introduction of a goods and services tax.
What we are likely to see, if we look through it, is a savage impact on our capacity to grow a cultural sector for the future. The sepia tones, we are happy to look after; and really, when we look at what we are talking about—the Bradman bat and the Plugger ball—I am not so sure that that really represents the totality of what we might encompass in what we could be proud of as a nation. I think there are many other aspects that we are entitled to be proud of. What we are entitled to be proud of now are some of the most 
 exciting things that are happening in the visual arts, in dance, in literature and across the range of cultural industries. We are entitled to be proud of those. But what is going to happen to those very activities?
Let us look at something like dance. What if you apply a goods and services tax to dance? Take the Australian Ballet, which is doing something very exciting with its latest program—which I think is called Trilogy—by putting on a joint enterprise with the Bangara Dance Theatre, our premier indigenous Aboriginal based dance company. There are virtually no inputs in theatre production or dance production which can be rebatable. That essentially means that the whole impact of the goods and services tax has to apply to the ticket price—there is nothing rebatable. The estimates of the consequence of that vary, but the lowest estimate of the increase in prices on tickets in the theatre sector is five per cent. The greatest estimate is 18 per cent. Somewhere between five and 18 per cent, the number will fall out, and I suppose it depends on how exactly the arrangements are implemented and what it is possible to rebate in some circumstances. But whatever is the case, the cost of an already expensive activity goes up.
Let us look at some of the smaller and mid-range companies: community arts activities that are conducted in every member's electorate by organisations which struggle through on shoestrings, which provide opportunities for local potters, for amateur theatre companies, and for those who are engaged in things like eisteddfods and a whole range of activities of that kind.
—The Savoyards in my electorate.
—The shadow minister for immigration makes an absolutely accurate point: there would not be a member in this House who could not name some community cultural activity that would be damaged substantially by the imposition of a goods and services tax because, straight off, they must apply that tax to the ticket price. How do they rebate it? They cannot, because they do not have the inputs.
—What about the wholesale sales tax?
—They don't charge wholesale sales tax; there are no inputs.
—Look at the impact in the visual arts, in photography and in painting. In photography and the visual arts artists are exempted from any payment of tax—totally rebatable under the wholesale sales tax. They do not pay it. Under the system proposed by the government, they pay the tax of 10 per cent. Their margins will be decreased and their effective capacity to earn a living in the marketplace gets reduced.
The government has also agreed to apply this goods and services tax to books—another area where we have had a flourishing and growing international and national industry. What can we expect? What we can logically expect is pressure on Australian book writers and retailers from online services, which are in direct competition. It is expected that many of those sales transacted in foreign jurisdictions will effectively escape any GST imposition and will undercut substantially the market for Australian produced products. So we are going to face a substantial reduction in the strength and vitality of the Australian publishing industry and the income coming to Australian authors.
—I have a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker. I wish to be as tolerant as possible in this debate. However, the legislation before the House is very narrow in its scope. It is introducing a $500,000 fund in a way that the Labor Party never did for 10 years. The member has had ample time. Our tolerance has been pushed to breaking point in  addressing the issues of the bill. Instead, we have been subjected to almost 15 minutes of irrelevancies.
—The member for Denison, I am sure, will return to the question.
—Madam Deputy Speaker, I understand the minister's sensitivity. He is the only arts minister in Australia who has presided over the destruction of the sector for which he is responsible, so the minister's nervousness is to be expected. But it is 
 plainly within the realm of this debate. We are talking about a bill which provides a framework for the protection of movable cultural heritage. The government, in defence of its measures, says that this will make a substantial difference to our cultural heritage. What we have said in relation to that is that when we look back to the sepia days of—
—On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker: I am not entirely clear whether the honourable member is addressing my point of order before you rule on it or whether he is continuing his irrelevant discussion.
—The member for Denison, you are reverting to the question?
—Madam Deputy Speaker, I do not think that I have ever moved away from the question. The question before the House is measures to protect Australia's movable cultural heritage which the government, in the second reading speech, acclaims as a substantial improvement. It says:
Australia's heritage comprising more than our built or natural environment . . . It is also the objects we create, we value and we collect . . . This might include anything from artworks to fossils, historic manuscripts to steam engines, Aboriginal sacred/secret material to Sir Donald Bradman's cricket bat.
I would have thought that what I was saying was entirely in line with what the minister has said. I said at the beginning that this is an odd situation where we have both an inconsequential and controversial piece of legislation. Why the minister, in introducing this legislation, thought fit to take some pot shots at the record of the former Labor governments in terms of protection of this important movable cultural heritage is beyond me. If any governments had a reputation for building, supporting and maintaining a commitment to our cultural industries, they were the Hawke and Keating governments. Those governments put in place these frameworks. I am contrasting what I see to be a trivial and quite inconsequential change to the financial arrangements in relation to this legislation—
—Trivial!
—A trivial and quite inconsequential change to the financial arrangements. All this bill does is change a provision in the previous bill which set up a financial system of administration which neither my predecessor government nor yours sought to put any money into. Now you come forward and say, `Whoopy-do, Australian community! It's here, the new millennium.' We are giving $0.5 million to protect Australia's movable cultural heritage when at the same time we are introducing a GST which will decimate the arts and when at the same time this minister seeks to avoid the issue by sitting me down and moving me away from a bill which is plainly and squarely on this subject. This minister has abrogated his responsibility to speak up for the very sector that he now asserts this $0.5 million does something for, at a time when those tax changes will rip millions and millions out of the income of Australian artists, performers, theatre directors, dancers, those who are involved in the book production industry and the like. The minister really ought to retreat to his office where he was before he came down here and actually take the opportunity to study the Hansard  and to engage in some serious dialogue with representatives of the industry associations.
I have had people like the National Institute of Visual Arts come to see me. They are the people who create much of what we will have in the future as our cultural movable property. They have said that the GST is going to absolutely decimate the income capacity and the employment base of those who work in the visual arts.
—On a point of order, Madam Deputy Speaker, I return to the issue of relevance. The occasional throwing in of the title of the bill does not entitle the honourable shadow minister to range so completely away from the intent of the bill. This is a specific, narrow piece of legislation which creates a fund of $500,000 for the purchase of cultural items.
—I ask the member for Denison to revert to the question.
—I would be grateful for a ruling on this matter. I submit that everything I have said is directly material. What the 
 minister is seeking to do is prevent the opposition from contrasting what it says is a trivial response to the issues facing the Australian cultural community with what the government is imposing in its GST legislation, which the Australia Council, in undisputed evidence before the Senate committee, has said will decimate the arts. We are not in an area of any substantial dispute as to that impact. If the minister for the arts, who is in the chamber, wishes to suggest that the Australia Council's evidence before the Senate was wrong, he has had ample opportunity to do so. He has not. We have a sleepy interjection from the minister assisting—what is your title?
—I am not going to help you.
—I know you are not going to help me. Joe Hockey—we have a sleepy Joe Hockey at the table.
—I ask the member for Denison to use the minister's title.
—I do not know his title; I asked him, and he did not assist me. A sleepy Joe Hockey.
—The Minister for Financial Services and Regulation.
—The Minister for Financial Services and Deregulation?
—No—regulation.
—Regulation! But whatever he may be—and he obviously did not know for a moment because he was unable to assist me; it slipped his mind—he says that I am wrong, that the member for Denison is in error. But the minister for the arts and his portfolio minister, Senator Alston, have never made any suggestion at all that the evidence given by the Australia Council was in error. And yesterday in Senate estimates some of the more serious issues which have been raised by the arts community were again agitated. We had the confession, for example, that the GST will apply to grants made to arts bodies.
—On a point of order, I return to the issue of relevance. If it would assist the honourable member, I am happy to explain for him the intent of this legislation, 
 which he has not read. I fear he does not have the faintest idea what we are talking about in the bill before the house.
—The member for Denison will resume his comments.
—I well understand the minister's embarrassment. In fact, this is one of the odd occasions that I am able to. He came to see me last night. We were both at the opening of the Monet to Moore exhibition dressed up in our bow ties and looking resplendent. It was a great evening; very enjoyable. We both lamented the fact that we did not have too many opportunities for that kind of exchange. But, of course, when we do actually gain an opportunity for a substantial exchange on arts policy, what does the minister seek to do? He seeks to say, `This bill is only about the narrowest, tiniest, littlest aspect. We do not want you to identify the serious issues about which I, as minister for the arts, have been derelict in my responsibilities. We do not want you to be able to range more broadly than the narrowest compass of this bill.' But what the minister did do by setting up what I thought was an extremely contentious second reading speech, which itself ranged widely in relation to these matters—
—I do not think so.
—Minister, you talk about all the sorts of things that your government is seeking to do about these valuable cultural properties and the like—
—The fund.
—You take this very straightforwardly: if we are to protect Australia's cultural heritage, we must not only protect its past but also its future. This country does not live with rear-view mirrors alone. This government is in the business of destroying the financial viability of an arts sector which provides not only enjoyment, entertainment and pleasure but also employment for many thousands of Australians. The total number of people employed in the arts and associated industries is in the tens of thousands, if not in the hundreds of thousands.
Mr McMullan, when he was in the position of the now minister, published a report on the economic significance of the arts sector. One of the interesting things it showed was the importance of the arts sector to the national economic infrastructure. In my own state of Tasmania, for example, the Premier, who was the minister for the arts, noted in conversation with me that if the cultural activities were aggregated they would be the single largest employer in the state. That is an extraordinary situation. It involves all the people who are involved in the arts, the tourism sector that draws on it, the people who are involved in theatre—
—Tourism isn't part of the arts.
—The minister at the table says that tourism is not part of the arts. In my state cultural tourism is one of the most important aspects. People come to Tasmania in order to go to places like Salamanca Place, the market which is an outlet for art workers. People go to see our fixed cultural heritage, like Port Arthur; they go to see part of our movable cultural heritage in the museums. In every state there are so many people who are actually engaged in creative pursuits and in the representation and display of historical cultural activities that to deny their importance would be a big mistake.
Here we have a minister for financial services who believes everything can be reduced in value to a computer transaction by some screen jockeys. We have our debates about these things; we think these are important issues. But Australia's spiritual component, its cultural and artistic future, is not something to be tossed aside as dross. That is essentially what has happened in this debate: the government has tossed aside as dross the arts sector because they are going to be peculiarly disadvantaged by the impact of a goods and services tax.
—No they're not.
—`No they're not,' he says. The minister at the table does not say that because the minister obviously knows—the minister's prime advisory body has told him so. He does not dispute it. All we have are the silly arguments from people who know nothing about what they are talking about, who are 
 peripheral to the debate, who defend what the government is doing on a basis of absolutely zero knowledge. Minister, what I say to you—
—No, you will address your remarks through the chair, not directly to the minister.
—Well, Mr Deputy Speaker, I am delighted you have joined me in this chamber. Through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I say to the minister: you will be remembered in Australia not for providing $0.5 million to protect Australia's historic cultural movable property because this bill does not do that. It does not protect it; it simply means that those who are not allowed to export their property from this country can be compensated if they suffer a personal loss. You will not be remembered for that.
You will be remembered if you can achieve some amelioration and a removal of the impact of a goods and services tax on Australia's living cultural industries, on the people who make art and who are performing, who are engaged in the enterprise that built Australia as a successful creative nation that is engaged in an industry that has hitherto been part of the great growth we have had in film, in literature, in dance, in the visual arts. Minister, you may be quite happy to simply leave this debate as it stands and claim the credit for this bill as if that discharges your responsibility. It does not. Minister, your responsibility—
—No, no, no. Are you deliberately defying the chair?
—I was not. It was an oversight.
—Not deliberately. Order! The honourable member's time has expired.",REPS,<title>PROTECTION OF MOVABLE CULTURAL HERITAGE AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,8,1,speech
"Hardgrave, Gary, MP",LP,1999-06-10,"—The member for Denison described the bill before the House at the moment, the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Amendment Bill 1999 , as trivial and inconsequential. I cannot help but want to draw on all sorts of RSPCA analogies in as far as, thank heavens, his time finally expired, he was put out of his misery. He also talked about creative pursuits. I suspect for the last 
 half an hour the people of Australia who have tuned in to the broadcast of proceedings here in parliament, and those who are joining us in the gallery, as well as all members present, were themselves exposed to one of the most creative pursuits in the Hansard . There is no doubt about it.
As far as the Minister for the Arts and the Centenary of Federation, the member for Gippsland, the Hon. Peter McGauran, is concerned, I submit to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that he will be remembered well in this nation because of his stewardship of the centenary of our Federation. He will be remembered extremely well for highlighting, in these years as we head towards the centenary of that Federation, the importance of remembering who it was that helped create this country and for the discussion that we have seen in ads that the minister himself has organised, challenging people: `Who was the first Prime Minister?' Those ads are very good and I know that Minister McGauran had more than a small hand in that. So I think Minister McGauran is doing a great job as far as the arts are concerned. Because of the matters that have been raised by the member for Denison, it is important for me to address a couple of them before addressing the absolute tenets of the bill.
The Australian Labor Party really have typified themselves in these last three and a bit years they have been in opposition: their simple philosophy is more equals less. Every time they talk about something going up, in reality it has gone down. They talked about a surplus existing when they left office when in fact we all know it was a ten and a bit billion dollar deficit. Whatever you hear from the dispatch box opposite, day in, day out, in this place tends to be the exact opposite in reality. As far as arts and taxation reform is concerned, it is important to point out yet again to the House that, as a result of the government's tax system that was endorsed by the people of Australia in October last year at the general election, average workers, people on a pension, people on fixed incomes because they are self-funded retirees—read: all Australians—will in fact have more money in their pockets to be able to pursue those sorts 
 of things they want to do instead of simply being able to just afford the things they have to do.
—Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. This may be a wide-ranging debate but, just as people were taking points on the honourable member of Denison, I think the honourable member for Moreton will agree that what he is saying has no relevance to the bill.
—No, you are debating the issue. You were talking about relevance.
—Yes, relevance to the bill now being debated.
—Thank you very much. Resume your seat. The honourable member for Moreton will continue but, of course, he will be relevant to the bill.
—Always, Mr Deputy Speaker. Reflecting upon the debate thus far, it was important to restate in the Hansard  and for the record of all Australians that more money in the hands of average Australians will mean decisions about personal expenditure in relation to the arts will become a far easier thing to facilitate.
—Like the Bellingen Jazz Festival.
—The Bellingen Jazz Festival I would of course love to attend, but I spend so much time in the festivals in the electorate of Moreton, Mr Deputy Speaker, I doubt I would find the time. The bill before us today is yet another thing the Australian Labor Party lamentably left undone. They might have had legislation in place for 10 years—in fact, it is the Protection of Movable Cultural Heritage Act 1986 that we are amending today—but for 10 years the Australian Labor Party did not put any money towards it.
—How long?
—For 10 years. The minister wanted to know for how long, Mr Deputy Speaker. In fact, it is yet another promise that has been kept by the coalition government, a promise that was made in the 1998 election campaign delivered: $0.5 
 million is the government's contribution to a fund which will attract others to put money in because of the tax advantages that come from putting money into that fund to assist in the purchase of cultural items, items that are important to our nation's contemporary history, our future history and, of course, respecting our present and our past. It is important that this fund exists and that people are able to gain a tax deduction for contributing towards the maintenance of those items in this country.
In order to qualify for that tax deduction, there has to be a register of items that are identified as being of importance in a cultural heritage sense. That is also what this bill is providing for. It is yet again the keeping of faith with the people of Australia that we have before us today. There is nothing trivial and inconsequential in the fact that the major political parties in this country keep faith with the people of Australia. At least the Liberal and National parties have a track record in government of doing what they said they were going to do prior to an election, of delivering in full, as we are today.
If you reflect back to a long time ago, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl—and I hope those opposite do not want to take a point of order on this—it is an absolute fact that, when in the 1880s the head of Yagan, an Aboriginal warrior from Western Australia, was smoked cured and taken to Britain as a curio in 1883—it was buried in 1964 when it began to decompose and only almost two years ago finally returned to Australia—had this sort of demand of the people of Australia been met by this kind of legislation we would not have seen those sorts of unfortunate events unfolding.
While the head of Yagan stands perhaps at one extreme, at the other there could be all sorts of untold important cultural heritage items literally sitting in the roofs of people's garages these days. I suspect the challenge for people in my electorate, particularly in the older suburbs like Annerley, Fairfield, Moorooka and Greenslopes where there are some longer term houses and older constituents and where people have a real sense of history, as we come to the centenary of our Federation, 
 is for them to start liberating some of that cultural heritage that might be lying around in their garages, in their back sheds or in their top cupboards. It is very important that people do start to reflect upon what it is they have got. Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure, like me, you have seen over the years a lot of very interesting collections that people have put aside, and perhaps they have grown their own museums in their lounge rooms—everything from an amazing collection of beer cans, right through to some immaculate motor vehicles or farm machinery and those sorts of things.
It would be an absolute tragedy if that kind of curio cultural heritage were to ever be bought by somebody from another country and taken offshore. Even down to that kind of level, this bill is addressing a real need. It is very much aware that people may be attracted to sell some of those items offshore to a broader market. There is a great deal of interest in Australia and its cultural heritage, both since European settlement and earlier, and it is important that the government support those who want to make a contribution to the fund by putting this half million dollars in.
In the 10 years or so that this legislation was operated by this Australian Labor Party, they did not put one cent into it. That was the level of investment that they wanted to put into Australia's cultural heritage. I suspect that while they are concentrating on what they call the `sepia tones' of Australian history—Bradman's bats and things like that—they are in fact, I think, ridiculing the aspirations of average Australians. I believe the average Australian is interested in matters such as Bradman's bat, or Plugger's ball. I think that the member for Denison wanted to try to attach some historic curiosity to Plugger's recent efforts—I do not really understand the code, Mr Deputy Speaker—but I find it amusing that he decided to ascribe that to some ancient history when it happened only a few days ago. It just goes to show you the real conflict the Australian Labor Party has with reality—more equals less, yesterday is today, and last week might be the day before yesterday. The matter that the government is 
 addressing is keeping faith with the people of Australia. This is an important bill.
Look at the sort of indigenous culture that we have to consider when we start talking about some of the movable cultural heritage that may be under threat if we do not act on this. There are all sorts of literary and artistic works. There are all sorts of symbols, designs, narratives and poetry. There is scientific, agricultural, technical and ecological knowledge that may, in fact, be subject to purchase from overseas unless this fund is given the depth and width to survive.
We have already talked about human remains—Yagan's head from the 1880s. There are sacred sites, the burial sites of historical significance, the documents of indigenous people's heritage, including films and photographs, video and audio recordings and archival collections. All of these matters are moveable cultural items. All of these particular items are always going to be subject to the competition of international funds trying to take these items out of this country. Unless we find the necessary funds to support the maintenance of these items here in Australia, what are we going to lose? We are going to lose our identity as a nation, our understanding of the past, and the legacy that we should leave to our children.
It is not just a matter of museums being the keepers of all of our cultural heritage and that is the end of the argument. It is a matter, as the government is showing in the lead that it is providing in this legislation, of looking for and challenging the people of Australia on the matters of cultural heritage items that they may have in their possession.
It is important that people understand the sense of real value that some of those items they may have in their possession could have to others. Some of us may have all sorts of accumulated historical artefacts and just think of them as junk. This bill before us and the creation of this fund may, in fact, make people look inside themselves, as well as inside their garages and their back sheds, to try to provide to the people of Australia in the broad sense some of the items that may be of great interest to so many others right around the country.
It is not good enough for the member for Denison to talk about things as being trivial and inconsequential. This government does not bring matters that are trivial or inconsequential for consideration into this place. This government is working very hard on a wide range of aspects to ensure that the people of Australia have a good today and a better tomorrow. Even in the area of the arts, where the member for Denison claims the Australian Labor Party has some absolute ultimate right to be the keeper of all things artistic and cultural, this government has yet again shown that it has gone one better than the Australian Labor Party ever did.
For 10 years the Labor Party sat on their hands. For 10 years they had an act in place. They did not bother to fund or provide any of the wherewithal that would be needed to ensure that the real potential of the act that they introduced in 1986 could be realised. This government, with just half a million dollars a year, allocated as promised in the 1998 election campaign, will exceed the Labor Party yet again. I commend the bill to the House.

"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,1999-06-10,"—My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, do you recall informing the House yesterday that Mr Entsch's company Cape York Concrete had won the `tender' from the defence department in relation to work at RAAF Scherger and had put in `the best bid'? Isn't it true that, according to defence department officials, there was no tender process? Are you now aware that this contract was awarded to Cape York 
 Concrete after only a verbal quote was received and that neither of the two possible competitors for the contract, McCosker Contracting Pty Ltd and Boral Concrete, was invited to bid? Are you aware of new evidence reported today that, in awarding this contract, the RAAF ignored the advice of its project managers, Gutteridge Haskins and Davey, to get three quotes?

"Howard, John, MP",LP,1999-06-10,"—I did not mislead the parliament. The situation is that, as attested to by the Department of Defence, the correct purchasing procedures were followed. It is also the case that the honourable member for Leichhardt was not aware of the contract until after it had been entered into with the defence department.

"Beazley, Kim, MP",ALP,1999-06-10,"—My question is to the Prime Minister. Prime Minister, do you recall yesterday that the member for Leichhardt described the $1.2 million cattle station—
—Where's the tax debate?
—The Deputy Prime Minister! The Leader of the Opposition has the call.
—We have asked you 55 questions on tax so far, Tim, so I think we might get onto another piece of accountability. Prime Minister, do you recall that yesterday the member for Leichhardt described the $1.2 million cattle station, Hurricane, owned by Vervale Pty Ltd, in these terms:
The property has been sitting with a caretaker for the last three years . . . It has not been operating . . . That is the only interest that Vervale has. There has been no active trading, no active business whatsoever in Vervale.
Prime Minister, if the property is the only interest that Vervale has, why did Mr Entsch tell the Courier-Mail  on 25 February 1999:
The property has four houses, heavy machinery, and a large cattle herd, any one of which, if sold, would meet the overdraft.
Prime Minister, hasn't Mr Entsch misled the parliament when the property has clearly been operating a commercial cattle herd, or has Mr Entsch been running a large cattle herd for the fun of it?
—No, no!
—No! That is ridiculous!

"Howard, John, MP",LP,1999-06-10,"—I think there are a lot of members on this side of the House who would like to take the Leader of the Opposition on a tour of rural areas, and he would learn the meaning of the expression `asset rich and income poor'. He would learn that it is quite possible for something to be making no money even though it maintains assets. As to the context of the remarks made by the member for Leichhardt, as he demonstrated yesterday, he is perfectly capable—and very effectively so—of speaking for and answering for himself.
I state the general proposition that there is nothing inconsistent with an assertion that you are not making any money out of something even though that something has a great number of assets that you are trying to dispose of—which I understand to be the position in relation to Vervale.

"Kerr, Duncan, MP",ALP,1999-06-10,"—When a serious matter involving the eligibility of Senator Webster was raised before the parliament, Senator Withers, leading for the then opposition in the Senate, indicated that the opposition would support a reference to the High Court, sitting as a Court of Disputed Returns, to determine that matter because it was of the utmost and paramount importance that such issues be resolved judicially and that to do otherwise would reflect discredit on the parliamentary system. That is not the manner in which the motion that has been proposed today by the Leader of the Opposition has been dealt with.
Instead, the Attorney-General has moved a proposal to amend that motion, to determine in fact that the House finds that the member for Leichhardt does not have a direct pecuniary interest with the Public Service and is not ineligible to sit by virtue of section 44(v) of the Constitution. By doing so, he has elevated an issue affecting the interests of one 
 member's eligibility, which was significant but appropriate for determination by a court, to a constitutional crisis.
More so, the Attorney has set this House on a constitutional conflict with the judicial system and has acted in a way that shows that he has no basic understanding of the separation of powers. A former Premier of Queensland, Mr Bjelke-Petersen, was reviled throughout Australia for not understanding that fundamental distinction. It is an extraordinary fact that the Attorney seems to be in a like position. He asserts that, despite the passage of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, this House has the power to clear any member of a constitutional act of omission or commission, and that that is a jurisdiction that exists alongside that which is given both by the Constitution and by the Electoral Act to the High Court of Australia. This is not an acceptable position.
The Attorney says that the Electoral Act still leaves space for this House to make such a determination. Of course it does not. It is a provision expressed until the parliament otherwise determines, and the parliament has otherwise determined clearly and explicitly by the Electoral Act. It is a like situation to that affecting the privileges of this House, where the Constitution provided that, until otherwise declared, they would be the same as for the House of Commons. When we passed the Parliamentary Privileges Act, those former privileges ceased to exist.
The real thrust and the real problem of what has happened today is that the Attorney, as first law officer of the Crown, will not facilitate this matter going before the High Court in order to have an honourable determination in a dispute where plainly there is divided legal opinion. Whatever else one says, the position of the member for Leichhardt's eligibility to this House is a matter of substantial contest. The Attorney will not facilitate that to be resolved in the forum where it is appropriate to be resolved, in the court. Indeed, what he seeks to do is immunise the member against the sins that are known to exist, and prevent any finding by the court to be made. I do not believe that to be constitutional but, more importantly, I do not believe 
 it to be proper. The Attorney-General has disgraced his high office by acting in such a way.
This parliament has given up its powers to pass bills of attainder. It cannot make convictions. It cannot act in a way to convict a person. It cannot imprison them, save in accordance with the Parliamentary Privileges Act. It does not have the power either to excuse a person as a single individual from criminal liability or to convict an individual on criminal liability. The fact that a member's eligibility which is contested can be challenged by a proceeding known as a common informer's proceeding shows that at least it is a quasi-criminal jurisdiction that is being exercised. And the fact that penalties apply to members who sit in this House in breach of their constitutional obligations also shows that. For the Attorney to seek to have this House declare to exclude the jurisdiction of the court is, firstly, impermissible and, secondly, an abuse of the gravest order. This Attorney should be in shame for what he has done to disgrace this House, placing it in conflict with the courts and avoiding the principles of the separation of powers. (Time expired)

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,1999-06-10,"—Today I would like to share with members the story of a young man that I have known for six years. His name is Troy Puttergill. He is a young man who was diagnosed as having autism at the age of four years. I met him six years ago. In actual fact, I helped him get his first job and he was very excited about that. It has been wonderful watching this young man develop.
He is now 23 years old, and 12 months ago he took up swimming. He joined The Valentine Torpedoes Swimming Club in the Shortland electorate and he has shown quite a talent for swimming. This year, he went to the Australian National Titles where he performed very well, particularly in the 50 metres butterfly where he won a gold medal for intellectually disabled swimmers. He was selected in a special team to go to Germany and England. In Germany his performance was outstanding. He obtained a gold medal in the 50 metres freestyle, a bronze medal in the 100 metres freestyle, and he took one second off his personal best time. He received a silver medal in the 50 metres freestyle and a bronze medal in the 100 metres freestyle. He was part of a gold medal winning relay team in the 100 metres and they broke the world record. He was also part of a gold medal winning team in the medley relay.
Unfortunately, Troy became ill when he went to England and his performance there was nowhere near as good as his performance in Germany. The Australian team, though, won the Five Nations Award in England. He arrived home last Tuesday and I spoke to his mother this morning. She said, `He is still sleeping.' Troy is a young man who really shows what you can achieve if you put your mind to it. At four, as I said, he was diagnosed as having autism but he has never let this get on top of him. Troy's mother, Diane, has been behind him all the way. She has always put in the effort and fought to see that Troy got the best opportunities in life. He is a role model for other young men and women who have been diagnosed as having autism, showing just what you can achieve. Troy is a young man with a big future and I wish him all the best in that future.

"Sidebottom, Peter, MP",ALP,1999-06-10,"—Thank you and good morning, Mr Speaker—Mr Acting Speaker; sorry.
— Deputy. The Speaker is still in Australia. I am only Acting Speaker when he is outside Australia.
—Excellent, thank you.
—You are most welcome.
—I cast my mind back to the recent political history of my electorate and the dramatic swing to Labor in Braddon at the last federal election. Indeed, it is no coincidence. The electoral successes of the major parties in north-west Tasmania have been inexorably linked to one thing. That thing is the GST. In the 1993 election the federal vote in Braddon saw a swing of around five per cent to Labor. Remember, a GST was being proffered by the then Liberal opposition. In 1996 the resulting 2.8 per cent margin held by the Liberals went out again to, unfortunately, over five per cent, but I suggest not a significant swing considering that the bells of change were ringing for Paul Keating after 13 years of Labor government. I am pleased to say that in the federal election last year there was a 10 per cent swing to the Labor Party in Braddon—one of the biggest swings across the country against an incumbent member. Of course, the GST was back on the coalition's agenda.
Although I would like to think that the fact that I was a candidate might have had a part to play in that, I don't believe it was the major deciding factor. It is true that the sitting member's time had come, but the goods and services tax—those dreaded words—was the underlying reason. It must be remembered that Braddon had long been thought of as a safe seat for the Liberals. The GST, therefore, is a key factor to understanding the shift in political fortunes in my electorate. In both the 1993 and 1998 federal elections, when the GST was on the drawing board, the electors did not believe it would be beneficial. The business community and the people of Braddon overwhelmingly rejected it. The GST was seen by them not only 
 as a regressive and unfair tax but they didn't believe it to be beneficial, appropriate or relevant. They voted against the GST and, judging by the subsequent confusion and chaos, they were right. Yet this regurgitated and reworked tax reform, complete with the Howard government's dubious deal with the Australian Democrats, remains the troublesome centrepiece of this government's budget.
Just for starters, on the new GST menu, take the dilemma now facing small business. One of the major unanswered questions for small business in the current debate is how it will be compensated for the cost of complying with the tax. The impost will fall disproportionately on the thousands of small businesses around Australia, not the least being the small business people of my electorate. Even those who supported a GST in theory now question whether it can work in practice. The nightmare will be even worse for the thousands of smaller food retailers in this `some food in and some food out' tax. What foods are in and what foods are out still hasn't been properly explained. But not only that—they now also have to worry about how they are going to comply with the tax collection. Larger food retailers will be able to cope better with the GST, but smaller business will suffer relatively bigger compliance costs. Consider this: I have been told by Tasmanian Independent Wholesalers that to put in the cheapest bar coding scanning system to handle the complexity of the tax will cost between $7,000 and $9,000. It is easy to see why small business, particular food retailers, are shaking at the knees.
I was recently contacted by a small businessman from Devonport, desperate for answers on how the GST will affect him and uncertain of how he will cope. So what has the government done to his and the many other concerns of small business? Well, it has set aside $500 million nationally to compensate small business for compliance costs. This will go nowhere near what it will cost to properly compensate them. It is a pittance by comparison. I noticed in the Financial Review yesterday that Treasury executive director Greg Smith said that the additional impact of compliance costs on businesses from the hybrid food exemption would influence negatively the GST's inflationary outcome. Jeff Kennett is right, I believe, to warn:
It's going to be a nightmare and the compliance costs are going to be extraordinary.
The Managing Director of Coles supermarkets was reported as saying:
We see the GST as very, very high risk. We have been viewing it as being as critical as Y2K.
It is the same for Coles Myer. Dennis Eck claimed it would cost them something like $54 million for the compliance side. I quote from the Financial Review  of Wednesday, 9 June:
Business and consumers face the imposition of state taxes worth $2.6 billion a year indefinitely after the revised tax package, with the government yesterday unable to give a new timetable for their abolition. As more details on the revised tax package emerged, Victoria's Premier Jeff Kennett renewed his attack on the GST deal, claiming it would be a nightmare for small business. Citing what he said would be extraordinary compliance costs from the hybrid food model, Mr Kennett said, `The people who will pay the price are the small business men and women of Australia.'
It has been estimated by small business organisations that business owners will face a $1 billion bill alone to set up accounting systems for the GST. But there is no accounting for the confusion and anxiety this will cause people in small business. They will find that they are not only de facto tax collectors but collectors in a far more complex system than ever imagined. Who is going to police it? And how is it going to be policed? We don't know. I recall reading in the newspaper this morning that the Prices Surveillance Commission won't be doing it; it will be left up to industry to do the policing. So we don't know who is doing what. It will be very interesting to find out, if we ever find out.
The questions are endless. So far there have been few answers. The Commissioner of Taxation, Mr Carmody, has warned that partially exempting food from the GST will create a culture of tax evasion. He asks:
What do you think will be the impact on attitudes to compliance with the GST, and perhaps other taxes, of introducing rules that inevitably will be the subject of ridicule and that will almost encourage people to become comfortable with entering into arrangements to exploit them? It should be a matter of grave concern that many of the smallest businesses will be hit with the greatest level of complexity.
The Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia says that at least one million firms will have to introduce new systems to handle the vagaries of the GST. It says further that, based on the New Zealand experience when the GST was introduced, the costs will average about $1,000 a firm. This is an impost small business can ill afford.
But it gets worse. The Howard government plans to spend many millions of dollars more promoting the new look GST—shamefully, more millions of dollars of taxpayers' money to sell a tax that threatens the very viability of their businesses. Everyone will know about the GST, very few understand it, but the majority of small businesses won't be able to afford to comply with it. Wouldn't it be money better spent on helping compensate small business, particularly in regional areas like my own? Remember, the government spent about $20 million promoting the GST during the last election campaign and it was still rejected. The money it now intends spending to sell the GST should be directed to those who will need it most—those in small business.
But I am sorry to say that directing money to where it is needed most does not appear to have been a major priority in this budget. Take, for example, education. What this government did to education in its budget, particularly the ramifications for regional centres like my own, is anything but clever.
In this budget the worst fears of students living in regional and isolated areas hoping to go to university have been realised. The Howard government's decision to abolish the Merit Based Equity Scholarships Scheme was a blow, particularly for students from Tasmania's west and north-west coast communities. This decision defies logic and exposes the Howard government's so-called commitment to education in regional Australia.
Students living outside metropolitan areas deserve a fairer and more equitable share of the education dollar, but in this budget they have missed out. Axing the scholarship scheme will save the government $10 million a year, but that is small change in the context of the forecast $5.4 billion surplus that the government is boasting about. This budget has thwarted the dream of going to university of a number of students from low income families living in places like the relatively isolated Queenstown and Circular Head.
Since the scheme was introduced in 1996, almost 70 students from rural and remote areas around the state have won scholarships to go to the University of Tasmania. More than half of the scholarships allocated went to students from the west and north-west coasts. One of the main aims of the scholarships was to improve tertiary participation rates among students from low income families in regional areas. Unfortunately, in both senior secondary and tertiary education, my area has some of the lowest retention rates in Australia—and we need all the help we can get to improve that.
I believe that this is a cruel, mean-spirited approach—and this government stands condemned for it. There remain more disincentives than incentives for students outside of metropolitan areas to go on to higher education; it still costs between $10,000 and $12,000 more for 
 students outside metropolitan areas compared with what it costs those living in capital cities. I call on this government to show a real commitment and not just talk about equality for `the bush'—as they now affectionately refer to regional Australia. Actions speak louder than words. All this government's talk about helping the bush is nothing more than the same old rhetoric that regional Australia has come to expect from this government. It makes a joke of the government's claim of making Australia a clever country.
The dilemma facing Tasmanian university students—indeed, students living in regional areas around Australia—was no more evident than when this government recently gagged debate on its controversial voluntary student unionism legislation; it exposed the common thread of this government. After coming to power, the government quickly gained a reputation for picking a target, taking aim and ruthlessly pursuing its prey. It is also a hallmark of this government that, almost without exception, students have been perceived to be easy targets—as have been the underprivileged and less fortunate, our youth, the unemployed, the elderly and, as we all know, unions.
This government—or, more particularly, the hard-core right-wing element of the Liberal Party—is obsessed with anti-unionism. These people are so obsessed by the ideological bent that, to them, unionism must be crushed at all costs, whatever the cost. The government's attack on student unionism is another example of what it sees as an easy target. The government found it easy to target funding for universities in the budget, and it has declared war on university students around Australia by its moves to abolish student unionism. This is another calculated assault on the welfare of students, typical of this government's heavy-handed approach.
One must ask: why isn't this government working as hard on important social issues as it is on attacking students? I can tell you why. It is because students are an easy target. It comes as no surprise that the GST will hit services for students and further force up the high cost of education. Furthermore, the lack of funding to the public education system in the budget compared with the amount going to non-government schools was a double whammy for regional areas. The government has promised to deliver an extra $210 per head per year to students in the private system, while 70 per cent of students in public schools will actually receive less than $10 more a year. While I acknowledge this government's recognition in the budget of the need for assistance to the more needy private schools, especially those in the Catholic school sector, this assistance should be complementary rather than in competition with necessary increases in public education funding.
I would like to draw attention to a letter to the editor in my local paper. I think this bears out some of the reaction that has been felt in my electorate in connection with this government's attitude to funding. I quote:
The Hellyer College council—
a senior secondary college—
is concerned at the Federal Government's decision to support the independent school system with an additional $1 billion while continuing to cut funding to the state system.
Under Federal Education Minister David Kemp's leadership—
if we can use that word—
we have now seen an orchestrated and cynical attack on state education in successive Budgets. The council does not repudiate the need to support the independent system. Clearly the country cannot afford for it to collapse. 

What arouses our anger is that the state system has received no matching resource support. This Government supports education policies that are designed to increase the gap between the haves and the have-nots, and which attack the underlying principles of social justice and equity that the state system is built upon.
Colleagues on this side of the House work on the principle that everyone deserves a fair go. Unfortunately that, I believe, cannot be said for women as a result of this budget; I am very concerned about its lack of initiatives for women. Social and economic analysts conclude that women are not sharing equally in the benefits of economic growth, and they and their families are under increasing pressure. There was no serious attempt to address issues affecting women in the budget. In fact, what was in it for them could be best described as `tokenism'. Soon they will be confronted head on by a GST and the confusion surrounding it. Too many women are still locked out of the work force by high child-care fees and falling employment opportunities, while those who combine work and family responsibilities find it a continual, difficult balancing act.
This year's budget was an opportunity for the Howard government to redeem itself in the eyes of Australian women. But, apart from a few minor gains, it failed. Minister Newman's rhetoric was not matched with any substantial gains. Any society that prides itself on providing equal opportunities for men and women has good reason to be concerned. The alarm bells started ringing following John Howard's election in 1996. He immediately slashed funding to the Office of the Status of Women and is presiding over its demise. Little wonder that at the last election a majority of Australian women voted Labor. Why was this? It really comes as no surprise when you also consider that it is women who will come face to face with the GST.
The Senate inquiry into the GST heard evidence that the impact of the tax package will fall more heavily and inequitably on women because women in Australia earn less than men and so will get fewer benefits; women are poorer than men and will therefore be hit harder by the GST; and, finally, women are more likely to purchase goods and services for the household and will have to bear the costs of the GST. Evidence suggests that not only are women failing to share in the benefits of a relatively buoyant economy but that the GST will swallow up any of the small gains they have made. In gender terms, the tax cuts will overwhelmingly go to high income males, while the proposed costs of the GST will be borne disproportionately by low income women.
Women's access to legal justice is another major issue, and I was concerned to see a further $1.3 million cut in the budget. This is a community service that goes to the heart of the wellbeing of the most disadvantaged of Australia's women and children. The budget provided little extra for child care and, despite strong wages growth, it is estimated that women are now earning $243 a week less than men. Funding for women's health was also inadequate. They benefited from a few welcome initiatives, but overall the scope of these is very limited.
Speaking of health, I must say in broader terms that this government has also failed Australia's public system while blatantly attempting to prop up the private health sector. On top of the carrot offered with the $1.7 billion, 30 per cent rebate, we have now before us the stick to join private health funds in the form of Lifetime Health Cover. Its potential to further undermine Medicare needs careful monitoring, along with its impact on funding of public health initiatives and hospitals.
The public health system in Tasmania, for example, is in crisis, and it is people in regional areas like the north-west coast and the people of my electorate who are bearing the brunt. More 
 than 7,500 Tasmanians are still awaiting elective surgery at the state's three major public hospitals. More than 600 disabled Tasmanians are going without proper services because of budget shortfalls. Health professionals tell us that it will take years to reduce the backlog.
Clearly the health care needs of many Tasmanians have been ignored. This budget does nothing to offer them hope. What it has offered is $1.5 billion in incentives for people to sign up for private health and a massive advertising budget to sell Lifetime Health Cover. I might add that the take-up rates for private health insurance have fallen well below expectations, notwithstanding though that $1.5 billion, if channelled into public hospitals, would have gone a long way to helping cure the health care ills that currently exist in the public sector, especially in terms of reducing elective surgery lists.

"Burke, Anna, MP",ALP,1999-06-10,"—In addressing Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1999-2000 , I am pleased to be able to comment not only on this year's budget but also on the whole budgetary direction of the government since its election in 1996. Much has been made of the waste of the budget surplus on the government's tax reform package and the plethora of problems created by the GST, and I intend to add my voice to the debate yet again.
I thought government was about governing, about ensuring a safety net for those in our society who are in need and about providing services through the collection and use of taxes. But, since I have been in this place as a member of the federal parliament, I have come to realise government is all about giving tax cuts to those not in need by sacrificing the government services provided to all, particularly those most in need.
Before I begin my look at the government's great tax adventure, I would like to address three issues that have come across my desk in the past few months that are prime examples of this government's wanton neglect of areas that are critical to the maintenance of Australia as a fair and just society. The first of these issues pertains to the availability of legal aid. The budget papers show that the Howard government's legal aid budget has been cut by $1.3 million in actual terms for the next financial year. Labor's shadow Attorney-General, Robert McClelland, has pointed out that, when this is adjusted for inflation, the cut in real terms is closer to $3.36 million. It is inconceivable that, despite a $5.4 billion surplus, the government cannot find more money for our legal aid system. The human cost of this neglect is being felt in my electorate.
At a recent community forum I held in Mount Waverley, I heard stories of people on low incomes being denied access to legal aid. One horror story was about a family's battle with the state trustee, which has cost the family in excess of $200,000. This was not to secure financial benefit for themselves but to ensure that their disabled sister would be cared for as their parents had passed away. None of this was covered by legal aid, even though this family could ill afford the bill they incurred. There are also young people who are unable to be represented in first-time criminal offences and, of course, numerous Family Court matters.
One of the local papers in my electorate recently carried the story of abused women in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne being denied legal help because of funding cuts. Two-thirds of the 350 women who used the Eastern Domestic Violence Outreach Service last year needed legal aid. Legal aid in the Family Court in Victoria is capped at $10,000. The cap is the Victorian method of coping with the savage cuts to the legal aid budget by this government.
This may seem like a reasonable sum of money, but those who have been involved in Family Court matters know it is not, particularly for acrimonious family law cases which drag on. These can drag on for many various reasons—directions hearings and others. Once the funds 
 dry up, both, and often just one, of the applicants are left unrepresented. A recent report titled Trial by legal aid has found that the legal aid system is inflexible and inconsistent and sets up a threat to these women for continuing violence. Women in difficult, violent situations are selling out their rights in order to secure safety for their children.
Many women denied legal aid or given inadequate funding are choosing to settle at all costs to be out of abusive situations, and are choosing to short-change themselves and often their children so as to not have to face the prospect of representing themselves in court and cross-examining their abusive partners. One can only imagine the intimidation a woman, the victim of an abusive relationship, will feel if she is forced to negotiate with her former partner without representation.
Many of these women caught in the cycle of an abusive relationship are barely managing to make ends meet and raise a family. Having to hire a lawyer to represent them when legal aid funding runs out or is not given is just not an option. This example illustrates the real effect of the government's dereliction of one of its primary duties: to provide for those most in need. Article 14(1) of the International Convention on Civil and Political Rights provides that:
All persons shall be equal before the courts and tribunals. In the determination of any criminal charge against him, or of his rights and obligations in a suit at law, everyone shall be entitled to a fair and public hearing by a competent, independent and impartial tribunal established by law . . . 
Yet again we see the government's flagrant flouting not only of its international obligation but also of its moral obligation by denying access to adequate legal representation to people in need.
Speaking of people in need, I would also like to touch upon a matter I raised in the House last week—that is, the lack of services for citizens with a non-English speaking background. Some of our most major public services do not provide literature about their services in a multitude of languages. As I come from such a multicultural city as Melbourne, this astounds me. The recent booklet put out by the Victorian Human Services Department entitled Guide to your Local Health Services did not provide sufficient information in common community languages such as Chinese, Vietnamese, Greek, Italian, Polish, Spanish and Turkish. It provided an index in multiple languages, when what was needed was a separate booklet. I note that the Victorian state government has established a multilingual web site, which is at least an attempt to rectify the situation, but it assumes most migrants have Internet access, which is clearly not the case.
One of the most repeated comments made to me by groups which provide services to help migrants settle in and adjust to our country is that there is still a basic lack of language services for newly arrived migrants. This is being acutely felt in my electorate, particularly within the Vietnamese community at this time. Unfortunately, in my electorate ethnic communities are suffering a further blow with the impending close of the Box Hill immigration office. Migrants will now have to travel into the city to have any face-to-face service.
In a recent tour of the Centrelink office in Box Hill, we were told of the problems of the phone based service. Clients can ring the interpreter's number and are given a number of languages they can choose from for an explanation of the Centrelink service and procedures. The only catch is that the person is asked in English which language they wish to nominate. This anomaly has been remedied in some respects by my Centrelink office by their providing 
 makeshift signs and their utilising their many bilingual staff—of course at no additional pay to these people.
The current use of phone based services is something I have spoken about in this House, and it is something we need to address significantly, particularly for people who do not have English as their first language. Dealing with someone over the phone when you do not have English as a first language is not a fantastic experience, especially when it is one of those voice interactive messages that says, `Press 1 now'—hopefully you will know what `one' is in the language to get you through the system. It is just astounding that we are taking away personal interaction from our community.
Another issue confronting ethnic communities is the move to a user-pays basis for the translation and interpreting services. Whilst migrant resource centres can make some calls on behalf of a client for free, they are charged on a fee-for-service basis after a certain number of free calls. This is just another example of the inequity produced by this government's budget cuts since it took power. Nowhere in this budget is there a significant commitment to funding language services for migrants. I call on all governments, state and federal, to accord this a much higher priority in the future.
The third area that requires more targeted money is the area of programs for the disabled. This budget was a do-nothing budget for people with disabilities and their carers. Unmet need in the area of disabilities is estimated to be around $300 million, and this budget allocates only $20 million over four years. The major problems appear to be with the provision of respite care for families, in particular day programs, and the provision of nursing home care for the growing elderly disabled population. Anyone who has looked after a person with a disability knows it is a draining experience, and respite care enables the carer the break they need to continue to provide care and support to their loved one. Sadly, I see these cases in my office regularly.
Within my electorate of Chisholm there is the Oakleigh Centre, a fantastic institution that provides a loving and caring environment for people with disabilities to access services on a daily basis or to live in a residential area. They have numerous problems. A recent letter written to me by the director of the centre says:
3.	 There appears to be a lack of nursing home type beds within the system. There is an increasing elderly cohort of clients/residents within the disability sector and the only 24 hour nursing care available is within the aged care nursing home (and hostel) system. This is satisfactory only to a minor degree and it would be better to create a disability specific nursing home more relevant to the special needs of this group with suitably trained professional staff.
4.	 Associated with the comments above, but as a separate issue, is the increasing care needs in general of residents/clients. Even though nursing home level care may not be required, over time care needs of an individual increase and it is not clear how these are addressed within the current system.
. . .              . . .             . . .
5.	 There is a lack of respite beds within the system. The Oakleigh Centre operates a minimum of three respite beds and cycles a number of residents through them. The families of these residents are able to cope because they do get a period of respite. If the respite beds were not offered, many families who are currently coping would be required to seek permanent placement for their son or daughter. This fact is well acknowledged in the aged care system where service providers are indeed required to operate a minimum number of respite beds, rather than being discouraged from doing so.
. . .              . . .             . . .

7.	 Ageing from a care perspective has already been mentioned, but it also impacts from a retirement perspective as well. It would benefit many clients if they were to ""retire"" from either the Workshop or the ATSS, but retire to what? It is important to identify real alternative options outside of the structure of the Workshop or ATSS, other than condemning the clients to sitting at home looking at the walls.
These are many of the numerous situations coming through my office at the moment. Others come from parents who have children in Kew Cottages. Kew Cottages came to prominence some time back when there was a tragic fire and many of the residents were killed. There have been some improvements in the situation there but not enough. There still are not sufficient staff to manage the numbers of people in residential care there, and many people are spending hours locked in their rooms because there are no other alternatives for them. This is a tragedy.
One of the other areas of disability services not receiving the credit it deserves is the area of employment services. The government has withdrawn funding to the More Intensive and Flexible Services Pilot Program that is currently assisting people with disabilities to enter and re-enter the work force. I have received representations from a local employment provider that is at the cutting edge of employment services for people with disabilities, and I would like to read from that letter:
The recent decision to withdraw funding from the MIFS program raises the issue of access and equity for a significant number of people with a disability wanting to enter/re-enter employment.
Prior to the MIFS program, people with a disability assessed by employment services as not being job ready i.e. requiring further pre-vocational work, had to be turned away, with little chance of gaining any assistance towards their goal of entering employment.
For many of the participants the gains in their personal life and in their employment potential has been enormous. Overall participant and community satisfaction has been overwhelmingly positive with few participants failing to complete the program.
The MIFS program filled the void for these people, giving them the opportunity of achieving their hopes and desires. Without the program there will be no hope.
There is a need that must be addressed in the community, especially when one considers the responsibility that a government and society must assume to accompany the advancements brought about through the de-institutionalisation process.
Strong consideration therefore should be given for the re-instatement of the program . . . 
So whilst my focus today has been on the neglect of funding allocated to disability services, legal aid and translation and migrant settlement, I would now like to add some comments to the debate on the government's tax deal with the Democrats. I doubt there has been a speech in this round of appropriation bills that has not touched upon the vexing issue of the GST. As Labor has said consistently, the 1999-2000 budget squandered the surplus. The initial GST package raised the surplus by $5 million to $7.5 million per year, and this has been increased by at least another $3 billion under the Howard-Democrat deal. The irresponsibility of the government pursuing a GST to the neglect of pursuing policies aimed at restoring employment and investment has also led Treasury to predict that the GST will cause an increase in interest rates.
But today I would like to focus on three aspects of the GST that have a profound impact on my constituents in Chisholm. The effect of the GST on the low and middle income earners was discussed on Tuesday in the MPI raised by the member for Lilley. Pensioners are of course often amongst the poorest people in our community. I find it amazing that, despite the rhetoric spouted by the Australian Democrats, they managed to negotiate a deal worse for pensioners than the concessions sought by Senator Harradine. Senator Harradine rejected a 
 five per cent pension increase linked to male average weekly earnings and other compensation measures worth around $1.5 billion to $2 billion per annum.
Earlier this year, the Democrats referred to the offer to Senator Harradine as a `paltry, inadequate sum'. They also claimed they would be looking for much more from the government after Senator Harradine made his intentions clear. In the end, the Democrats have settled for a four per cent pension increase that is not linked to average weekly earnings. The additional compensation offered to pensioners amounts to just $6 a week, so people who have paid taxes all their life will now be a paltry $6 per week better off under the deal. But they are not actually better off, because this was a compensation measure for the actual impact that the GST is going to be having on these people.
This comes on top of the revelation on examination of ABS expenditure data that 75 per cent of the total weekly budgets of families will be hit by the GST. This is bad news for my electorate, which houses an ageing population. My office has been inundated by residents concerned that their pensions or part pensions will simply not stretch far enough to meet the additional costs of the GST. In suburbs such as Box Hill, Burwood, Ashwood, Oakleigh and Clayton, those on pensions will be the people who will suffer the consequences of this government's obsession with tax.
Another group who has much to fear with the introduction of the GST is self-funded retirees. As most members will concede, self-funded retirees have not traditionally been seen as Labor supporters. Many of them probably voted for the GST. But as this mess has started to unfold, they have become worried. Most self-funded retirees are not wealthy. They have saved all their lives to provide their families with a secure income in their twilight years. Many self-funded retirees say that, despite the fact they have saved through their working lives, they can see that their retirement income will not go far enough. All in this place cry how fantastic the decline in interest rates has been. This is true for the majority but not so self-funded retirees, who know their investments are not returning enough for them to survive on.
You can imagine how concerned they are now knowing that many of the basics in life—electricity bills, phone bills, public transport, clothes and of course the huge array of food—will be subject to the GST and knowing the effect that will have on their lives. It amazes me that the government-Democrats deal has managed to offend so many sections of the Australian community—yet according to the Prime Minister it has been embraced by all; it is their mandate!—whether it be pensioners, self-funded retirees, St Vincent de Paul, the four major banks and Coles Myer in relation to compliance costs and of course the well-renowned commentator on life, the universe and everything, the Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett. All of these groups have been offended by the government's GST deal with the Democrats.
The other group of residents that have surprised me in their attitude to the renegotiated tax package have been small business. Whilst many small business people will admit they were concerned about the compliance cost before the election, they felt, as members of the broader business community, they were honour bound to support it, but that is no longer the case. Small business people in my electorate are saying that they fear the unwieldy application of the tax will drown them in a sea of paperwork. The mess of some food in, some food out and temperature tests is a nightmare, particularly for businesses engaged in small business retail trade. These people, on the whole, have never experienced wholesale sales tax compliance and this is a nightmare they are just waiting to encounter. So saying that the wholesale sales tax comes off for them is just irrelevant.
The Howard-Democrats deal has attempted to stich bandaids on an already messy package. As more and more small businesses wake up to the logistic nightmare that is the GST, we will see them desert the coalition in droves. Small licensed grocers in my electorate, already under siege from a recent change in the Victorian liquor licensing laws, are concerned that the GST will be the end of them. The system will be a nightmare for them to administer—things in and out, too confusing—and they can only see an increase in prices and no hope of competing with larger retailers.
Labor's position on the GST has been unwavering and consistent. We rigorously opposed the GST in 1993 and 1996 and we continue to oppose it in all its various permutations. It is an unnecessary impost on business. It is a job destroyer. It does nothing about investment or innovation. However, by far the most compelling reason for opposing the GST rests in this one point: it will further the gap between the rich and those less fortunate. Whilst the lion's share of tax cuts goes to the top 20 per cent of income earners, groups in need—such as those needing legal aid, language and disability services—will go begging. This budget is about a tax adventure, not securing the living standards of all Australians.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1999-2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Quick, Harry, MP",ALP,1999-06-10,"—I, like all honourable members, am pleased to be able to rise in this place to speak on the appropriation bills, the last for the first century of this federal parliament. These bills give us all the opportunity to raise issues on the impact this budget will have on our constituents. Disappointingly, most of the appropriation speeches can be categorised into the `them and us' speeches. I can understand members opposite using the opportunity to have a go at us and our budgetary mismanagement back in 1996, but to keep on harping about the hole after 3½ years in government, in my mind, shows a really pathetic streak. It was interesting to note the comments of the member for Deakin in his speech, where he stated:
No longer does Labor make any contribution to the political debate. They moan, they point fingers, they feign concern, but in here, where they have the chance, they contribute very little . . . they are `stunt driven, not substance driven' . . .
The member for Parramatta said:
As you wander around Parliament House you see the posters and slogans that members put on the windows of their offices from time to time; posters which are emblematic of their philosophy. One of the most popular posters among those who are drawn from the left of Australian politics seems to include this expression: `We live in a society, not an economy'. This expression is a glib one that rolls off the tongue with comparative ease and sets the maker of the expression up as being a person with a beating heart full of the milk of human kindness and compassion.
These comments and the outburst of the honourable member for Leichhardt yesterday, who did a real Hingis when he said, `Unlike the Australian Labor Party—whose only membership requirement, it would seem, is to be a complete and utter failure in every other facet of life outside of politics,' in my mind do little to enhance the debate about these appropriation bills. I would have thought that, given the opportunity to ramble on for 20 minutes with no real restrictions, members would have used this time to perhaps reflect on what has passed and where we might be going in the new century. But one can dream.
Being one of the last group of speakers in this debate you get the chance to listen to and/or read speeches of previous speakers. Being a member of the Speaker's panel like you, Mr Deputy Speaker Causley, I also get to sit through  quite a few. In putting this speech together, I thought about the constituents I represent and tried to figure out what some of them would make of these bills. What would really grab their attention, make them sit up and think: `At 
 last they've recognised my needs and funded that program,' or `You little beauty, our roads are finally going to be upgraded and there'll be fewer fatal accidents on that stretch of road near my place'?
Like most electorates, mine has a cross-section of Australian society, although with less of an ethnic percentage than many mainland seats. Unless you are a party member or someone who has a real interest in politics, the budget build-up, the broadcasts and newspaper coverage bore most people witless. Most of our punters give it all a cursory glance, try to figure out what immediate benefits they will receive and then switch over to Friends, Dawson's Creek or NYPD Blue. They are not fools. They know from past experience that governments usually take 12 months to implement most new programs. So by the time they receive any tangible benefit they have forgotten the reason for its creation in the first place.
Our constituents have simple needs. Our elderly want real choices in their lives. Most of them have simple pleasures—being able to pop down the street to purchase their groceries, visit the chemist, catch up with friends, withdraw some of their savings from the bank and perhaps buy some new clothes. Most of our elderly, those 70 years of age and over, have done it tough. They have sacrificed a lot to ensure that their children and grandchildren will want for nothing. All these people want is access to transport when they are unable to walk up the street. When they become too frail to do the housework themselves, they want to have someone drop in and clean their home to the cleanliness standard that they have kept up for decades. And they want the security of knowing that they are safe once night falls.
They are pretty simple needs, but look around your electorate and see how poorly we have met these needs. We have let them down very badly. Too many of our elderly live in fear. Their homes are vulnerable and the services they require are few and far between. On limited incomes they are expected to pay from their meagre savings to have some of these services delivered—keeping their once immaculate garden shipshape, cleaning out their gutters prior to the onset of winter, getting in a winter supply of firewood: tasks now beyond them.
Getting around my electorate door knocking as I do to meet people and hear their concerns as we chat on the front doorstep, I often come across just how troubled so many of our elderly people are and just how difficult it is to assist them. Prior to the last election, I came across a state housing group of residents who lived in a five-unit complex—four elderly people in their eighties and one disabled young person. Unfortunately, they had been seen as vulnerable by the antisocial element in the neighbourhood, and over a period of time they had been broken into during the early hours of the morning. Imagine the fear experienced by these frail aged people and this disabled young person as they cringed in their beds as the thieves, waving torches around, ransacked their units. Assistance from the housing services? You've got to be joking. It is not their responsibility to place security locks on windows or install a security door at the front of their unit. Of course these citizens have heaps of money lying around, so why can't they get the job done themselves? My staff, to their credit, decided to give housing services a hard time. Bolt by bolt, window by window, they secured for all these people a secure home—it only took six months! But now these people are safe in their own homes.
As a society, do we really give a toss? No, not unless it is our mother or grandmother. We are like the people in the parable in Luke's gospel, the story of the Good Samaritan. Too many of us cross over to the other side of the road and neglect to render assistance. The poor fools who do assist are so isolated that, like the two men recently who offered their assistance, they 
 are usually killed—glorified in the tabloids and then forgotten by everyone except their immediate families.
I would like to move on to the needs of our young people. Where do we start? A loving, caring, stable family who is able to provide them with a proper foundation would be a great start. We are not fools and we know that families in this age are not coping. Do governments have a role in this process? If so, how and why? How do we ensure that this bureaucratic madness that is government is simplified and organised enough, is caring and benevolent enough, to enable those in need to dip their buckets and draw from their well?
Assuming children have survived intact so far and now enter our school system, what perils do they face? A state system starved for money, administered now by bureaucrats whose understanding of the joys of learning is non-existent. Maintenance of buildings is a joke, class sizes defy belief and many regional superintendents are eunuchs unable or unwilling to tackle `the system' and rectify the obvious deficiencies. The foundation is all important. Yet we hear ad nauseam the platitudes concerning numeracy and literacy standards espoused by academics cast as ministers. I would like to endorse the honourable member for Braddon's comments on the funding of state schools in this federal budget.
It is a responsibility of both levels of government, state and federal. In my mind, only by nominating class sizes to a prescriptive 15 until grade 1, 20 until grade 3, and no more than 25 in grade 6 and only by providing each school over 150 with a full-time librarian, music teacher, phys. ed. and special education teachers will we be able to truthfully say that we are giving each child, irrespective of their socioeconomic background, irrespective of their academic potential, the opportunity to realise their full potential. We have the whole process back to front. We can somehow find bags of money for remedial and interventionist activities when the problems manifest themselves so blatantly in the teenage years when we see kids lying around in the streets, yet when teachers in early childhood classes seek assistance to lessen class sizes, obtain remedial and guidance officers or have other specialist teachers there to provide necessary aid for their children, their demands are met with stony silence from the bureaucrats.
It is interesting to note that I was swamped by calls last week by those involved in the provision of services for those at risk at the sharp end—those dealing with the youths on the street—because I dared to highlight the crazy ways that we as a society are going about trying to deal with this whole problem. It is interesting to note that early intervention is now becoming flavour of the month. I notice with interest Bob Carr's press release of 21 May 1999 entitled `Families first—a new way to help parents' where he states on page 2:
Based on overseas experience, every dollar spent on supporting young families now will save the community seven dollars down the track in policing, health and welfare.
Others facing this dilemma of inadequate funding at the sharp end are obviously people with disabilities and their carers and the carers of frail aged people in our communities. To charge those with disabilities a fee to have someone come in to get them out of bed, something those of us with all our faculties take as an ordinary daily task, is to me a real indictment of our society. Carers payments, despite the increases in this budget, are appallingly inadequate and do not adequately reflect the tireless dedication and compassion of those who undertake this amazing work. During my former life I worked mainly in disadvantaged schools. I can tell you that early intervention backed up by a complete range of expert services when and where you need them was so obviously the most efficient way to go.
I can show you groups of parents throughout my electorate who have decided to take direct action. They are sick and tired of seeing no-one caring about the unmet needs of their children—their children failing to stay in the mainstream, their children isolated and marginalised. It is all too difficult for our current education system and our current education minister. But governments will tell you that, through their many departments, they are providing moneys to strengthen families by providing services to address and alleviate their needs and that the responsibility is also one shared by the states. In my mind, all the glancing through the various budget papers does little to alleviate my concerns that both tiers of government are not responsive to the general needs and aspirations of the people in my electorate. Once again, we see money not being spent at the right place. Carers suffer and those requiring their care are forced to be placed in care, which costs even more to our society's financial bill.
As the previous speaker in this debate mentioned in her speech, people in my electorate are also suffering from the inadequate funding of legal aid in the state of Tasmania. I am fortunate to have a community legal centre across from my office in our shopping centre at Cove Hill and am very much aware of the tremendous work it does to ensure that people in my electorate are fully aware of their legal rights and that they are not painted into a legal corner without adequate options being accorded to them because of their low socioeconomic status.
Like the honourable member for Braddon, who is sitting in the House today, the issue of roads is a very real concern for many in my electorate, especially in the Huon, Channel and Eastern Shore. Unlike the honourable member for Braddon, I do not have Highway No. 1 crossing my electorate, a road that appears to have access to a never ending bag of money. Roads in the Huon and Channel are used to transport export crops—apples, pears and aquacultural products—that contribute greatly to our nation's exports.
We always hear the cry in this place, especially from the mainland states, about the need for infrastructure development, but this cry is usually only seen in light of major economic projects—the big ones, the projects doing so much for our country. In my mind, the regional areas are completely neglected. It was interesting to hear the honourable member for Mallee raise the issue the other week of the need for infrastructure in his electorate. Many of his needs are exactly the same as mine.
I have one real problem in my electorate—the South Arm Highway. Deaths on this road occur with a regularity that defies belief, yet our state and federal governments of all persuasions have failed for years to provide a long-term plan and adequate funding to rectify this deathtrap. I am glad to see an increased allocation of road funding to my state in this budget. I would like to hope that my state Labor colleagues, whom I occasionally give a hard time to, do focus on this issue, not as a pork-barrelling issue and one that enables them to retain government but one that is allocated electorate by electorate to come up with the necessary moneys to start rectifying this highway.
Unlike a lot of speakers, I would like to congratulate the government for many of the positive things that are in this budget, especially in the area of rural health. Quite a deal of my electorate has real needs in the provision of services of GPs and country hospitals, as does the electorate of the member for Braddon. So, in relation to the issue of rural GPs and rural health, I would like to congratulate the government for the way they are tackling that. As a member of the House of Representatives Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs 
 Committee, I would also like to congratulate the government for the increase in funding that has taken place in this budget for Aboriginal health and housing.
Finally, I would like to think that the punters, as I call them in my electorate, do get a real benefit from this budget. I can assure those opposite that I will, over the next couple of years, see that there is some implementation from the mass of budget papers we are bombarded with and that the electors of my electorate do benefit from the many programs that are in these appropriation bills.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1999-2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Ellis, Annette, MP",ALP,1999-06-10,"—The 1999-2000 federal budget has been described as a budget in two parts—a budget with a bitter aftertaste, the introduction of a 10 per cent GST on almost everything. On budget night the government attempted to deliver all the good news—a budget surplus, no new taxes. We all sat through the Treasurer's fairly smug performance. We have heard his rhetoric many times. There is no doubt that the budget trumpets some initiatives, but I believe it manifestly fails to deliver the services and income support that many Australians need. In fact, a significant amount of what was announced in the budget is nothing more than a partial restoration of the funding that the Howard government had savagely removed over the past three years.
In the education area, the budget is short-sighted, unbalanced and unfair. It is short-sighted because, despite the research initiatives in this budget, the Commonwealth's investment in research and innovation will be lower in 1999-2000 than it was in Labor's last year of office. It is unbalanced because the schools initiatives in this budget deliver an extra $210 a year to students in private schools but less than $10 a year to the 70 per cent of children in government schools. While any increase in schools funding is welcomed, it should be done in a fair way and not at the cost of one sector against another.
I am sure that I do not need to remind the government that public schools are the first choice of the majority of Australians and should be adequately funded. I would like to endorse the comments of the previous speaker in his knowledge and past experience in the education area. I fully endorse the comments he made, particularly in relation to the areas of schooling that require additional funding in those early years. The budget is unfair also because it scraps the government's own university equity scholarships. The question my constituents are asking is this: how can we create a clever country when John Howard makes it even harder for the smartest kids from the country and from low income families to get to university? The budget also fails because there is less money for university teaching and no growth in funding for TAFE.
But let us look also at child care, another area of concern to many in my community. The government has provided nothing for child care in this budget. A recent Senate report on child-care funding has found that affordability of care was the biggest problem facing the child-care sector. High fees are driving women out of the work force and increasing pressure on families with young children, yet the budget provides nothing extra to assist families.
Another area of concern to me is the area of disability services, one very close to my heart and to many in this place. The amount of assistance offered by the Commonwealth to people with disabilities is disappointing and only serves to highlight how uncaring and indifferent the Commonwealth feels towards some of those most vulnerable members of our community. By continuing to neglect the needs of people with disabilities, the government is placing these families under extreme pressure and placing heavy financial burdens on a system that obviously cannot cope.
These families deserve to receive the care and the support required. I say at this point in my speech on the appropriation debate that the thing that upsets me the most about government—and, I have to say, any government—delivery of service to those with disability is quite simple: when a family has the misfortune to have a child or someone in their family born or affected by a disability at a later date, they then find themselves having to become an absolute expert in how to weave their way through complicated systems—systems with little or no money, systems where they go for help and find time and time again that they are told, `I'm sorry, but we just can't afford it this year. We may try and get a budget allocation for next year.'
All we need to do is to put ourselves in the places of those people; alternatively, all we need to do is think about how we as a society wish to be seen when we consider the care of these people. My own opinion is that you should not have to go bashing down doors; doors should in fact be opened for you when you are facing a disability yourself or you have a family member who is facing a disability. I implore this government, in fact any government, including one that I would belong to in the future, to really have a far more compassionate way of considering and handling the problems that face people and families who are afflicted with disabilities of any kind.
I would like to now talk about the effect of this budget as I see it on the women in our community. Despite the budget surplus and earlier budget cuts to child care, labour market programs and education, the burden of which falls disproportionately onto women, there are only token initiatives for women in this budget. This budget was an opportunity for the government to redress its earlier mistakes, but it has chosen not to take that opportunity. The available evidence suggests that women are not sharing equally in the benefits of higher economic growth. The result is diminishing employment opportunities, wages falling further behind those of men and declining participation in higher education.
I am concerned that many women are locked out of the work force by high child-care fees and falling employment opportunities. There are many examples in my electorate of women trying to balance their work and family responsibilities but finding their wages significantly diminished after they deduct child-care fees and lose their social security payments. This is an area that must be addressed by government as a matter of urgency. The answer to this is not to brag that there may be more work opportunities, flexible though they may be—that is, part time or casual. That can sometimes be far less economically viable for a family than something secure and permanent.
As I am the member for Canberra, another area of concern to me is the level of confidence in the national capital, both as the national capital and as a community in which many people live. I was very disappointed to note that there was no real sign—no real, heavy sign—of strong confidence in the Canberra community in this budget. After the extraordinary attack on Canberra over the past three budgets, this government has not offered any direct assistance, despite the overflowing coffers of which they boast. Most of the capital works programs included in this budget have already been announced—and I welcome the announcements that are there—or are merely rehashed refurbishments. Maintenance of building stock does not constitute major capital works programs. In fact, much of this work began under the previous government. There are many programs currently under way in this town—refurbishment of older buildings—that actually began their progress through the refurbishment phase under the previous Labor government. I add, almost with boring repetition, that the Prime Minister's decision not to live in the Lodge still continues to be noted by the members of this community.
Looking at funding for the Public Service, I note that Centrelink has been hit with further massive funding cuts, bringing the running total of cuts to $1,084 million in just four years. It is such a big figure, it is almost hard to read it. These cuts have already resulted in a service crisis, with Centrelink's own information showing that 81 per cent of callers do not get through on the telephone, that there are delays of up to three weeks at some offices to get appointments, that customer aggression has unfortunately been measured at a 160 per cent increase and that staff stress has increased by a massive 230 per cent.
In the next financial year, Centrelink will suffer the second biggest staff cut of any federal government agency or department—in total, an extra 872 staff are to go. With further cuts of over $200 million each year for the next four years, I think that, unfortunately, we can expect further reductions in service. Can I say here, Mr Deputy Speaker, that my sympathies in this regard go in equal parts to two sections: (1) the client base of Centrelink; (2) the staff of Centrelink, who are attempting under the most difficult circumstances to do the best they can with reduced numbers, increased pressures and, in some cases, very complicated policy by this government in terms of decisions to deliver to their client base. I plead with the ministers concerned with this area: please do not continue to try to shoot the messenger, and please remember that the community is very good at letting you know what it thinks about the decisions you are taking. You really should hear those messages loud and clear.
I said earlier that the GST was a bitter pill that Australians are expected to swallow. The deal announced between the Howard government and the Australian Democrats over the GST does not make that pill any easier to swallow; in fact, it removes any sugar coating that may have been on it. The GST is still bad news for fairness and equity in the Australian taxation system. The Democrats have been hoodwinked into agreeing to a deal that falls well short of the undertakings they gave to the Australian public at the last election. As a colleague of mine said recently, the Democrats went into those discussions with a handful of aces and came out with a pair of twos—how short they sold themselves and the Australian community.
Unfortunately, low and middle income Australians will pay for the Democrats' surrender as they face a new, regressive 10 per cent tax on many of the essentials of life, except for some items of food. Australia did not have to have this tax. We do not need it and a majority of Australians overwhelmingly still do not want it. I am a little alarmed to see some of the predictions in the press over the last few days of the amount of money that the government may now be considering expending to sell this deal to the community over the next year or so. That money would be much better spent on some of those items I have just addressed.
It is interesting to note that the Senate committees established to inquire into the GST found: (1) the GST would make the poor poorer, hurting families, the elderly and people with disabilities; (2) supposedly GST-free areas like health and child care would in fact face higher costs; (3) the proposed compensation was inadequate because Treasury had relied too much on averages and had failed to consider the real-life spending patterns of low and middle income Australians. The Senate committees also demonstrated enormous gaps in the information presented to the public before the election. They proved each of the three contentions put by Labor—the GST is bad for the economy, bad for jobs and basically unfair.
There has been an abundance of evidence confirming all of these propositions. The Howard-Lees GST requires the same level of scrutiny that the original package received. In many ways, this new tax package is more confusing and inequitable than the original one. Families, pensioners, small businesses, students and superannuants are fully entitled to ask questions 
 about how the new package is going to affect them, and it is fair for them to expect answers to those questions.
Labor would have taken a different approach to framing the budget. We have consistently stated that our success in the global economy demands investment in the future. We believe that nothing short of a quantum leap in the education levels, skills and training of the Australian work force and national resources devoted to new industries will see Australia join the emerging global prosperity. What we need from government is a strategy for a nation making its way in the world and an understanding of the challenge before us and how, together, we can rise to it. Government must also show a commitment to fairness, a belief that none of our fellow citizens will be left behind in our economic progress. Both of these ideas—fairness and progress—demand the same thing. They demand a commitment to a high wage, high skill future and an opportunity for all Australians to share in that future.
I wish to highlight two recent decisions by the government that fail this test. They are at two extremes, but I am sure they illustrate exactly what I am talking about. The first is the decision to cut 15 per cent from the Australian Geological Survey Organisation. I see in today's press that the cuts may be even larger in dollar terms than first thought. AGSO, which is located in an award-winning building, is going to have to take in tenants to help cover the costs of the operations they now have to undertake. This is just ridiculous. AGSO creates jobs for Australians and wealth for this country, supporting our mineral and petroleum export industries, which are worth in excess of $41 billion a year. The decision the government has taken in this budget—a decision, I might add, that was fairly well hidden in those budget papers—will mean the loss of up to 100 jobs, largely scientific jobs of people who are well regarded internationally in the area of geological survey. These are the people who stand to lose their positions in AGSO because of this decision. I cannot understand the government's thinking about this at all.
The second instance I want to touch on is one that I have previously talked about—that is, the Centrelink situation. These billion-dollar cuts have had a destructive effect on service delivery to our community. The government must take responsibility for what I consider to now be a crisis in the area of Centrelink service delivery and provide it with the resources to ensure it can deliver the necessary services in a timely manner to those who depend on that organisation for assistance. The two examples I have given are, at one end of the scale, export possibility—growth in our innovative country; at the other end of the scale is how we see ourselves as a society—how we service those in the society in which we live who may need that hand-up in their time of need. I think they are two very good examples to illustrate the point.
Looking at the record of the government over a number of major policy areas, it is clear that they have a total disregard for the human reality of their decisions. Is the economy there for the community or is the community there for the economy? Are we talking about a balance sheet dominated only by figures or are we talking about a balance sheet which on the other side has the human element—the impact in human social terms of the decisions taken to give you those lovely big black figures on that numbered sheet? Surpluses are worth nothing if they are done without regard to the cost of the human impact on our society. I have a great deal of difficulty coming to grips with this closed mind: as long as we have black figures on a balance sheet with a big surplus, we boast. We do not worry about the disability of people or the education of people or the cuts to scientific organisations. We do not worry about that. I think somehow the balance is wrong.
Very briefly, I would like to take some of the time remaining to make some observations on a few aspects of the government's education agenda. I have already touched on the government's failure to invest in research and innovation and their obsession with the private school system, but I would like to speak a little on the government's higher education policy, in particular their desire to introduce voluntary student unionism. As many members are aware, the universal collection of services and amenities fees and universal membership rights of student organisations have been features of university life for many years. The government have rammed legislation through the House to remove this universal collection.
This legislation has severe financial implications for student organisations. The average compulsory amenities and services fee imposed by state and territory higher education institutions in 1999 is $264. All students benefit from the provision of services and facilities, and I do not believe that the Australian parliament should be encouraging free riding on Australian campuses. I trust that the Senate will review the VSU legislation carefully and come to the decision that it should not be supported.
It is interesting that the government have raised the VSU legislation at this time. There is a view that they are doing it only to divert attention away from their failure to increase higher education funding in this budget, after three years of cuts. There is also a view that this budget was an attempt to divert attention away from the GST. Well, it worked but it only worked for less than 24 hours. It did not take the community or the commentators long to get through the gloss and the glamour and get down to the basic line of this budget. But that 24 hours is longer than it took for the gloss on the GST deal with the Democrats to come off—that actually took about half a day.
Mr Deputy Speaker, it is a pleasure for me to speak on this budget. As the member who spoke before me said, there are some initiatives in this budget that we applaud. I am currently involved in an inquiry to do with Aboriginal health through one of the committees in this place. As I have seen the plight of that situation around the country through the period of that inquiry I have to say that the announcements that have been made in that area particularly have been pleasing to me, but I do encourage the government to start thinking about something more than dollars and black numbers and to start saying to the community that it does understand the pressures and the stresses that family members, individuals and organisations now find themselves under. I sincerely ask the government to think seriously about the social human element of running an economy and not just the economics of it.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1999-2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,1999-06-10,"—It is a pleasure to follow the previous speaker, who always makes an excellent contribution in this chamber. My interest is specifically in the area of the Attorney-General's portfolio, but by way of introduction I note that speaker after speaker for the government spoke of our strong economic position. Indeed, there were numerous boasts of a $5.4 billion surplus. Those speakers—as, I suppose, government members are wont to do—overlooked the years of massive structural change undertaken by the Hawke and Keating governments, which literally opened Australia's borders to the international community. There was massive structural change in the workplace, with the wages accords and the development of enterprise negotiations—albeit through a supervised system through the Industrial Relations Commission, which specifically had the power to enforce good faith bargaining but nonetheless created a situation where, more often than not, trade union leaders were themselves going to various employers and suggesting ways that efficiencies could be achieved.
All these things have created a significant increase in the productivity of the Australian work force. The Prime Minister has stood up in the House and spoken of productivity in recent years. But that increase in productivity does not happen overnight. The benefits we are now seeing with improved structural change in the workplace are the result of the concerted effort of employers, employees, employer organisations and employee organisations over a long period of time. Indeed, the Prime Minister upon obtaining office acknowledged—not in the House but before businessmen—that when he came to power he took over an economy that was structurally sound. Be that as it may, what is the use of having a sound economy if we do not have a just society? A society can only exist as a just society to the extent to which each and every citizen has access to justice, no matter how unpopular their cause, no matter how heinous their crime and no matter how desperate their financial means. If we as a people want to live in a just society, everyone must have equal access to justice.
Despite running up this $5.4 billion surplus, there is no more money in this budget for our struggling legal aid system. That is in the context of a cut by this government over the past four years of something in the order of $230 million from our system. It is much more if you look at the cuts to the human rights area, which also is an advocate for those who are the most vulnerable in our society. In fact, the budget papers show that the Howard government has cut $1.3 million from the legal aid budget in actual terms next financial year. When that is adjusted for inflation, the cut in real terms is closer to $3.36 million. That $3.36 million will see about another 1,680 Australians deprived of access to justice in this financial year. It is not just figures on a balance sheet; we are talking about literally scores of Australians—1,680 Australians—who will be deprived of access to justice. At a time of a large surplus, when this government is prepared to give tax relief for high-roller gamblers, it is disgraceful that we cannot find a bit extra for this important area of financing access to justice for ordinary Australians.
The legal aid cuts are reducing the amount of legal aid for Commonwealth matters, particular matters arising under family law. Recent figures show that more than 2,000 people will miss out on legal aid for a family matter in New South Wales in this year alone. In 1997-98, 9,191 family law applications were approved in New South Wales. This year it is expected that only 7,125 applications will be approved, so we are going backward as the world is going forward into the 21st century. The Attorney-General, Daryl Williams, promised that legal aid cuts would not see a reduction in the number of family law cases funded, and those figures prove that the promise has been broken. Tragically it is occurring even in areas where the court is recommending that children involved in family law proceedings have separate representation. There is now a situation where, despite a judge recommending such representation, it is not occurring because of the absence of legal aid funding. Those figures show that the government has consistently underestimated the need for legal aid generally but specifically in the family law area, which has been most acutely hit.
In 1997-98, for instance, the Howard government provided $13.8 million to New South Wales for family law matters. However, in that year the Legal Aid Commission of New South Wales ended up spending something like $18.9 million on those types of cases. Despite evidence of this additional demand, the Howard government in the following year, 1998-99, provided only $16.98 million. Government figures show that $12.2 million had already been spent by 31 January 1999. If that trend continues, we are going to be looking at something between $20 million and $23 million being spent when only $16.9 million has been provided. 
 If that rate of expenditure continues—which on all accounts it will—then this already deplorable situation is going to get much worse.
But the Attorney-General's Department has admitted in the Senate estimates process that there will be no more money for legal aid in the next four years. In the Senate estimates process the Attorney-General's Department admitted that negotiations on the next triennial funding arrangements for legal aid, which commence on 1 July 2000, would be predicated on there being no overall increase in legal aid funding. As a result, the only discussions will be how to divide up the ever diminishing legal aid dollar between the states and the territories.
Worse still, the officers advised the committee that the Attorney-General, Daryl Williams, proposed to re-establish the expensive criminal cases scheme, but that will have to be funded from the legal aid commissions' own budgets. That scheme is desperately necessary because of the cost of major criminal cases. For instance, just one criminal case in the ACT is occupying something like a quarter of the entire ACT legal aid budget. In New South Wales, the arrest last year of 16 people charged with smuggling drugs is going to present a massive drain on the legal aid system. Some people may say, `Well, if they have been accused of smuggling drugs, and indeed they are foreign nationals, why should they be entitled to legal aid?' But if we apply that principle to, for instance, the two CARE Australia workers arrested in Yugoslavia they would be without justice. We of course say that they, having been charged with criminal offences by Yugoslavia, are entitled to the principles of natural justice. After all, they are principles that soldiers—men and women—from Australia have gone into battle for. If we do not provide access to justice for anyone who faces a significant penalty, we are letting ourselves down as a civilised society.
There are numerous other instances where there is not the emotion of foreign nationals being charged, where Australian citizens have been charged with significant crimes. The directives from the government to the legal aid commissions is to focus priority on those cases to avoid what is being called the Dietrich occurrence. Dietrich was a High Court case. Because Dietrich was unable to obtain access to funding to present his case and there was a significant delay, the High Court determined that the case could not proceed because Dietrich was not able to receive justice. To avoid that occurring the directive has been issued that legal aid commissions must focus upon those criminal case areas. This has diminished the availability of funds for all other areas. The Attorney-General has said, `You have to establish this expensive cases scheme but it is going to have to come out of your overall budget.'
It is also noted from the estimates process that the Attorney-General's Department admitted that the budget papers did include the cut in legal aid funding that we, the Labor Party, have publicly stated has occurred. The admission is quite contrary to denials made at the time by the Attorney-General's office. They should get their act in order to see precisely what has occurred in the area.
There is further evidence that delays in the Family Court system are starting to get out of control. Recent figures obtained by the Labor Party show that at two registries, Brisbane and Parramatta, delays have blown out and are almost completely out of control. In Brisbane, standard track children's matters are now taking an average of more than 142 weeks, that is 2¾ years, from the date of filing to hearing. That is 99 weeks—almost two years—longer than they should and 52 weeks—one year—longer than they did as at 30 June 1998. The position is getting worse, not better. Standard track financial matters have not fared much better. They 
 are now taking 130 weeks—about 2½ years—from the date of filing to hearing. That is 82 weeks longer than they should and 43 weeks longer than they did as at 30 June 1998.
The Parramatta registry in Sydney has also seen dramatic blow-outs in delays. Standard track children's matters are now taking 101 weeks—almost two years—from the date of filing to hearing. That is 58 weeks—over one year—longer than they should and 31 weeks longer than they did as at 30 June 1998. Again, the situation is becoming much worse much more rapidly. Likewise, standard track financial matters in Parramatta are now taking 115 weeks—over two years—from the date of filing to hearing. That is 67 weeks—about 1¼ years—longer than they should and 46 weeks—almost one year—longer than they did as at 30 June 1998.
That is a situation in crisis and delays of this order are simply deplorable. They are a direct consequence of the Howard government's decision to cut legal aid and the resourcing of the Family Court. These delays directly impact on families in crisis, increasing tensions within relationships, leaving issues unresolved and increasing the risk of domestic violence.
The Attorney-General, Daryl Williams, has continued to delay the filling of Family Court vacancies, which has greatly exacerbated this situation. Since taking up office the Attorney-General has been consistently tardy in respect of these vacancies. He has delayed filling every one of the 11 vacancies which have arisen. In total Mr Williams has delayed filling these vacancies for a staggering 60 months. The most recent appointment delayed by Mr Williams saw the vacancy created by the Hon. Justice Eric Baker of the Parramatta registry of the Family Court not filled from 19 January 1999 to 17 May 1999, a delay of almost four months. According to the estimates previously provided by the Law Council of Australia, the delay in filling these vacancies of 60 months has added 587 cases to the Family Court's waiting lists. To simply clear that backlog it would take more than five extra judges sitting for a whole year. That is a delay which could easily have been avoided by the Attorney-General acting as soon as he received notices of intended resignations. With two more vacancies due in the middle of July and at the beginning of August, Mr Williams will have another opportunity to do his job properly but, given the track record of the delay in appointments, I regret that is most unlikely to occur.
The next area of concern is in respect of the government's only attempt to remedy this massive crisis in the Family Court system. They are proposing the creation of a new federal magistrates service. It appears that that service is going to be too cumbersome and too complex. The federal magistrates service will have its own administrative structure which, on our estimates, will cost $8.3 million over the first four years of its operation. If the magistracy had been incorporated into the existing structures of the Family Court and Federal Court that money could have provided for as many as six additional magistrates or five additional judges. It is also clear that not enough magistrates will be appointed to cover the judicial work currently performed by the various types of registrars in the Family Court and Federal Court. A minimum of 35 magistrates would be needed for that to occur.
As a result, we may see people having substantially similar matters heard in different manners and with differing rights of appeal, simply because one case is heard by a magistrate and the other is heard by a registrar. The proposal appears to do little to assist those in rural and regional Australia who are often underserviced by the courts. For these areas, the Labor Party has proposed that a much more efficient and effective approach may be to give those state and territory magistrates who are appropriately qualified and experienced any additional  training to ensure that they have the ability to handle federal matters on a joint commission basis.
Of more concern is the revelation that the 16 new federal magistrates will replace the 19 SES Band 2 registrars working in the Family Court. They are senior public servants and these magistrates will be expected to pick up all of their workload—that is, 16 individuals picking up the workload of 19 existing registrars. In addition, the 16 magistrates will be expected to pick up the work of the Federal Court relating to bankruptcies, actions under part IV of the Trade Practices Act, matters under the Workplace Relations Act, less complex administrative law cases, the whole range of the human rights and discrimination jurisdiction that is going to be referred to the Federal Court as a result of Brandy's case, less complex appeals from the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and, indeed, other Family Court and Federal Court matters. So these 16 magistrates are going to be expected to do the work of 19 SES Band 2 registrars and then some more—these new powers that they will be enforcing and deliberating upon in the Federal Court area.
This will result in a net loss of resources for family law matters, increasing the already massive delays occurring in the Family Court. Further, obviously there are going to be three fewer actual persons hearing Family Court and Federal Court matters but at a staggering cost to the taxpayer of $27.9 million over four years. The whole exercise is a sham that will further deplete the ability of our court system to deliver justice in a timely fashion to ordinary Australians.
The irrationality of this proposal—the irrationality of establishing this entirely new federal magistracy structure—makes one question the motives of the government. Clearly, there have been some vocal interest groups who have been quite vicious in their attacks on the Family Court because they have not been satisfied with the outcomes of their cases, whether in relation to property or child custody. One wonders whether the establishment of this federal magistracy is a sop to those vocal interest groups to say, `You do not have to worry about the Family Court because we have established this different magistracy that you can go to.' But in providing what appears to be a sop to those interest groups, the government has actually reduced the resourcing in the Family Court area. It is going to increase the delays, the tensions and the prospects for domestic violence. In this whole area, the government's approach has been one which can be characterised as penny-wise and pound-foolish, with some significant warning lights as to its motives in establishing this federal magistracy rather than properly resourcing the legal aid system and the court structure.

"Zahra, Christian, MP",ALP,1999-06-10,"—The Howard government regularly tries to pass itself off as a friend to the workers and communities that depend upon the forest and the forest products sector. But it enters into this pretence cynically, knowing that none of its policy prescriptions will bring the job security and value adding that is so desperately needed by the industry. This government parades itself as pro-forestry worker while at the same time introducing regressive industrial relations measures that threaten the job security and working conditions of thousands of forest industry employees. How about a bit of honesty from the government and the Minister for Forestry and Conservation? You are no friend of workers in the forestry sector, Wilson, and you never have been. You just do not have it in you.
The minister has been keen of late to talk about the CFMEU and to parade himself as a good mate of union members in the forest and forest products sector. This represents truly breathtaking deception on his part. This is what Wilson Tuckey really thinks about the working 
 people who make up our trade unions; this is what Wilson Tuckey, the great friend of the trade union movement, said about the waterfront dispute and the government's role in trying to destroy the MUA and put 1,400 workers onto the scrap heap:
We have come up with a pretty simple proposition: maybe someone else should have a go. The farmers say, `We're prepared to do it.' When it came to loading live sheep and the wharfies got involved in a dispute on behalf of the meatworkers, and the farmers said, `We'll go down there and load the sheep,' the first thing that was noticeable was that they loaded the sheep in about a third of the time, if not less.
And the minister, once again displaying his legendary compassion for the sacked waterside workers in his own electorate, had this to say on 8 April last year:
A journalist rang me up and said, `What about the 20 jobs involved?' I said, `Well, what about the million unemployed? What is the social issue?'
The social issue, Minister, is workers being sacked for no other reason than that they belonged to a trade union. Obviously you do not care as much about trade union members as you make out you do, not even those in your own electorate.
Of course, if you take Wilson's dazzling logic about replacing wharfies with farmers to its logical end, if I can call it that, then maybe we could have a huge pool of farm workers available and on stand-by to lower wages and conditions in all sectors of the Australian economy. What utter nonsense!
The minister for forestry's statement is typical of this government's contempt for workers. In previous enlightened statements, the minister has referred to `BLF goons', has described the MUA as `a mob of gangsters', has referred to `a whole period of domination of the Australian industrial scene by unionists' and, in relation to superannuation, said, `The reality is that nobody needs the protection of an award in this matter.' This does not sound like CFMEU policy to me, and it does not seem consistent with the general views of the trade union movement, especially given that the Construction and Building Union Superannuation fund, C+BUS, is the product of the good work done by the former BWIU in obtaining compulsory employer superannuation contributions for its members, and also given that the CFMEU was one of the strongest supporters of the MUA during the bitter waterfront dispute last year. So the Minister for Forestry and Conservation talks about his great support for trade unionists in the forest industry while having been, for a lifetime, an ardent advocate of the destruction of the trade union movement. What a hypocrite!
The forest sector is a hard industry. It is an industry in which occupational health and safety issues need to be taken seriously. It is an industry in which many men and women are injured or killed every year in industrial accidents. Often the only protection that workers in this industry get comes via the CFMEU—a union which I am proud to be a member of and a union which my father was proud to be a member of.
I acknowledge that the CFMEU is crucial to maintaining a safe environment for forest industry workers, but this government targets the CFMEU and aims to destroy it. The CFMEU has been targeted by the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business. The CFMEU is not the sort of union that this government wants around, and it plans on using all of the legislative mechanisms available to it to undermine the work of that trade union. The Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business has mounted repeated attacks on that union, variously describing its actions as `industrial thuggery', claiming in parliament that `the CFMEU is out of touch with reality', and saying that subcontractors needed to be protected from `the ravages of the CFMEU'. This is all part of a very deliberate 
 campaign by the government to destroy the CFMEU, and that campaign will have a very significant impact indeed on those small mills in regional Australia that rely on a strong union to maintain occupational health and safety at acceptable levels.
So while the Minister for Employment, Workplace Relations and Small Business is sharpening the knife against the CFMEU, the Minister for Forestry and Conservation pretends to be a friend to the union, patting it on the back as he looks for the right place to stick the knife in.
The government's view about forest industry workers has been made very clear. We need look no further than the comments made by the Minister for Community Services in June last year. When asked about the closure of the Burnie pulp mill in the electorate of my colleague the honourable member for Braddon, the minister referred to how management had tried to `improve work practices and to get some of the rorts that were put in place and remained in place under the Labor government out of the system'. The Minister for Community Services then went on to say:
Indeed some of the things that were going on in that plant made the MUA look like a work gang.
What a disgusting remark. One hundred and fifty workers lost their jobs at that plant in a region of already high unemployment and this is how the government responds. This type of remark reveals much about the way in which this government views workers in the forestry sector. So no-one should be in any doubt at all about the Howard government's attitude towards trade unions and the workers who belong to them. There should be no doubt about the hatred this government has for the CFMEU in particular.
I can just imagine how many laughs the pretence of the Minister for Forestry and Conservation about his great relationship with the CFMEU gets him in the coalition party room—a party room dominated by members of the New Right and past and present members of the H.R. Nicholls Society, who boil and stew in their hatred of trade unions and workers every minute of every day. I imagine that Wilson's little pro-worker act would be the subject of quite a few jokes amongst his colleagues as they sit around the Melbourne Club or the Adelaide Club discussing new ways to water down industrial relations protection for workers with the likes of Ron Walker and Tony Staley. But if they think they have pulled the wool over the eyes of workers in the forest and forest products sector, then they are sadly mistaken. Workers won't forget who took all the services out of the country towns in which they live. Come the next election, workers won't forget who imposed a 10 per cent GST on so many essentials in their lives.
Workers in the sector know that if the Howard government was serious about the forest and forest products sector it would be doing a lot more about industry policy. Everyone, except obviously this government, understands that if you want to grow the forest sector then you need to invest in it. I don't know why the government has such a passionate hatred of industry plans. In government, Labor produced important plans for a number of key industries, including the dairy and automotive industries, which were great successes. I just wish we had a minister who understood how important it is to produce a forest and forest products industry plan so that in 10 or 15 years time our forest and forest products sector would be significantly larger and much more focused on downstream processing. Instead, all he does is refer ad nauseam to the RFA process. I accept that the RFA process is important, but the RFA process by itself should not constitute the government's entire commitment to this very important sector. There is at best only a limited future for the forestry sector unless this government 
 invests in the sector's potential by working with the industry to devise a sensible industry package that will maximise downstream processing opportunities for the industry in Australia.
Wilson Tuckey wants us all to believe that just by signing off on the RFAs all will be well in the sector and jobs will flow. This bloke is living in cloud-cuckoo-land. He has been hanging around with the likes of Meg Lees and Andrew Murray for way too long. He has actually become one of the fairies at the bottom of the garden. RFAs are not a panacea for the forest and forest products sector. Everyone with half a brain—and that excludes the Minister for Forestry and Conservation, of course—understands this very well. Indeed, this has been made very plain in the Gippsland region over the last few months with the closure of the Swifts Creek timber mill and the resultant loss of 22 jobs and the future of an entire community now in doubt.
The Swifts Creek mill employed 22 workers in a town of just 150 people in the Tambo Valley in East Gippsland. The minister during question time earlier this week sought to draw the attention of the House to the fact that I have been working with the community in Swifts Creek to try to get the government to intervene and require the company, Neville Smith Timber Industries, to process the resource that it takes from the Tambo Valley in the Tambo Valley. It is my very strong belief that the people who live in the Swifts Creek community deserve to get some benefit from the logging of the resource in their own backyard.
The minister, I think, was about to question why I would be involved in helping this community when it is outside of my electorate. Swifts Creek is more than 3½ hours drive east of the eastern boundary of my electorate of McMillan, but it still is in the Gippsland region that my electorate is a part of. While Mr Tuckey might find this a difficult concept to grasp, I actually care enough about forestry workers not to care about whether they happen to be in my electorate or not. These workers and their community need assistance and, if nobody else will give it to them, then I will.
The Swifts Creek mill closure is a perfect example of why the minister's mantra that RFAs solve every problem relating to the forest and forest products sector is so wrong. This is what the BairnsdaleAdvertiser wrote last month about the closure of the Swifts Creek mill. Under the heading `State support call', the BairnsdaleAdvertiser reports as follows:
The Swift's Creek community held the meeting to discuss closure of Neville Smith Timber Industries' sawmill in the town. The meeting aimed at discussing the economic and social impact the closure will have . . . 
The report said that between 100 and 150 people were in attendance, which is nearly the entire population of that town. It went on:
Vince Hurley, representing Neville Smith Timber Industries, said the decision to close the mill was an economic one by the company and did not consider the social and economic impact on the Swift's Creek community.
On the next page the BairnsdaleAdvertiser  writes as follows:
One statement from the floor that reflected the feeling of those present at the meeting was `if timber doesn't benefit the local community and economy, then let's turn it to National Park'.
Local electrical contractor, Stephen Richardson, said the closure of the mill has had a dramatic effect in his business as part of his business was spent on a regular basis at the mill—this has now gone forever.
And further down in the story:
The people of Swift's Creek find it difficult to find comfort looking at the stark face of reality, when in February 1997, in the BairnsdaleAdvertiser , Federal member for Gippsland, Mr Peter McGauran, is 
 quoted as saying, `RFAs restore much needed certainty to the East Gippsland timber industry and provide the basis for new investment and jobs' and `this certainty will also have significant flow-on benefits for East Gippsland communities and other local industries.'
Premier Kennett and Prime Minister John Howard are also quoted in the BairnsdaleAdvertiser  on Monday, 3 February 1997 as saying that the RFA will `give greater certainty of access to timber resources providing the basis for investment in the timber industry and the creation of new jobs'. The truth is that regional forestry agreements by themselves do not deliver job security. The workers at Swifts Creek and the community they live in have found that out the hard way. We need to support this sector with more than just shrill rantings made at the dispatch box. The minister is obviously way out of his depth on these substantial industry development issues. What we need is less hysteria and more serious discussion about the type of industry policy that will most benefit value adding in the forestry sector.
Senate estimates hearings last week revealed quite a bit about the government's commitment to industry policy in the forestry sector. This is an exchange between Labor Senator Shayne Murphy and Mr Rawson from the department:
Mr Rawson: The Wood and Paper Industry Strategy (WAPIS) money terminates in June 2000.
He goes on to state:
It was in order of $26 million over a four year period, so it has been around $6 million per year for the four years and 1999-2000 is the last year of that WAPIS funding.
Note here that the money provided for the Wood and Paper Industry Strategy was provided by the Labor government in 1996. Senator Murphy then asks:
Did I understand you to say that this is the last of the WAPIS money?
Mr Rawson responds:
Yes.
Senator Murphy asks:
And that is the end of that? No more money after that?
Mr Rawson replies:
Not at this stage unless the government comes up with a new program.
Well, Mr Rawson, I suppose we all live in hope.
Many of us are still waiting for the government to get on with creating a fair dinkum wood and paper industry council—and it seems as though this government is determined to avoid doing that at all costs. The simple message here is that Labor was prepared to commit to the wood and paper industry strategy, but this government is not; Labor was prepared to invest in value adding, but this government refuses to do so. On 9 February this year, the shadow minister for forestry and conservation, the honourable member for Reid, placed the following question on the Notice Paper:
(1)	 On what dates and at what locations has the Wood and Paper Industry Forum met since 1 October 1997?
On 31 March, Mr Tuckey—revealing his true level of commitment to the development of an industry plan for the sector—responded:
(1)	 The Wood and Paper Industry Forum has met twice since its establishment was announced on 1 October 1997. The first meeting was held on 30 October 1997 at Parliament House in Canberra. The second was held on 26 February 1998 in Melbourne. 

It has met only twice; the Wood and Paper Industry Forum, which the minister trumpets as his vehicle for developing industry policy, has met only twice. Mr Deputy Speaker, I have to tell you that this does not sound like a very high level of productivity—two meetings in 20 months. I think what we might have to do here is take Wilson's own advice. In March last year, in relation to the government's view that waterfront workers were not efficient enough, this minister said, `Maybe someone else should have a go.' I reckon those wharfies would be a damn sight more efficient than this so-called forum, which has met only twice in 20 months. I am not being critical of anyone involved in the forum; I am sure that they are probably good people. But I am making the point that, if the minister were serious about value adding and industry development, he would get on with establishing a wood and paper industry council, as supported by the CFMEU and the Labor Party.
On the matter of the establishment of this council, the minister need not only take my advice and that of the CFMEU; he should also listen to the advice provided by the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee, chaired by his Liberal colleague from Western Australia Senator Winston Crane. On 25 February this year, under the heading of `Wood and Paper Industry Council', the conclusions and recommendations document of that committee stated:
The Committee heard evidence on the desirability for the establishment of the proposed Wood and Paper Industry Council.
The Committee considers that the Council would be an advantage in promoting better forest management and developing value adding industry.
The Committee concluded that the Government should establish the proposed Wood and Paper Industry Council.
The minister's response to the committee's findings was typically dismissive and within it the suggestion for the development of a wood and paper industry council is non-existent. The minister's media statement that was released on the same day as the Senate report was presented states at the very bottom of the document:
Noting the recommendation that the Government establish the Wood and Paper Industry Council, Mr Tuckey said that the Government supported the establishment of an appropriate and representative consultative body. The final form would be considered by the Government in the context of the Industry Action Agenda that has been initiated with the wood and paper products industry sector . . . 
This was in February, and we are now in June. Where is the wood and paper industry council? Has it been established yet? I think not.
The minister's refusal to develop a comprehensive industry plan for the forest and forest products sector demonstrates his contempt for the workers in this sector and shows that, for all his rhetoric, the minister really has not done anything much at all for the sector. The truth, unfortunately, I fear, is that the Minister for Forestry and Conservation would not know what industry policy was if it reared up in front of him and hit him in the face with an iron bar. This means that workers in the forest and forest products sector face an uncertain future—a future in which, at best, mill closures will continue. And, unfortunately for workers in the sector, opportunities for industry expansion and investment in downstream processing, using new high technology pulp and paper processing and timber manufacturing plants, will be lost. This will mean fewer forestry jobs in regional areas.
I only hope that the minister sees the error of his ways. In the matter of the closure of the Swifts Creek mill, I hope that he has the guts to get in there and do something to help that 
 community. It is not too late, and decisive action taken by the minister could prevent the death of that town. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1999-2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Sciacca, Con, MP",ALP,1999-06-10,"—In rising to speak in the appropriation debate, I will just make a few general comments about the government's budget and strategy and its skiting, if you like, arising from its pride in being able to say that it has a large surplus of something like $5.4 billion. It is all right to be able to say that you have that sort of money in terms of a surplus. But the reality is: at what cost does that surplus come? What has the government cut to get to that situation?
We know that from 1996, when first arriving in this place as a government, those opposite have been cutting virtually everything they could, whether in the area of welfare, education, social services or the Public Service—and the list goes on and on. Eventually they have ended up with this big surplus and they think, `Well, aren't we fantastic; we're not only able to manage the economy but we're also able to accumulate this big surplus.'
Mr Deputy Speaker, I put it to you that that surplus has been achieved only on the backs of ordinary Australian men and women. It has been achieved with cuts in just about every sector of government service. There are stories all around the nation of offices closing down, of there not being sufficient staff, of big long queues when trying to get on to Centrelink and so on. It is just absolutely atrocious and, frankly, disgraceful. But it seems as though, to the Treasurer and the Prime Minister, all this great surplus represents is a reason to skite and boast; it seems as though that is all there is to it for them.
I put it to those in the government that, in fact, if they were to go out and speak to the ordinary person on the street and say, `What do you think about the fact that we have $5.4 million in surplus?' the response would be, `Well, how come it's still tough for us to pay our mortgage, to put food on the table for our kids and send them to school, to give them an education and everything else that one needs to survive?' I think in the end these so-called surpluses can be very illusory and sometimes they are used as straight-out political tools.
What concerns me the most about this budget is that the whole of it is predicated on the introduction of a goods and services tax. We hear about Australia being one of the only nations in the Western world not to have a goods and services tax. Let us have a look at some of the countries that do have a goods and services tax.
When this was first mooted back in 1993, I remember that New Zealand was heralded as the great example of where the goods and services tax had proved so successful. The reality is that the New Zealand economy at the moment is not exactly choofing along as well as would be expected. The goods and services tax has done nothing for that country; in fact, if anything, it has made it go backwards.
We now have the European Commission being most concerned at the effect the value added tax—or whatever they call it over there—on services is having in that it is causing reductions in employment. They are talking about the possibility of winding back the rate of their goods and services tax. We know that in Canada, once this tax had been introduced, the public did not like it. It cost the seats of a lot of the people in that government. In fact, I remember that only a couple of the members of the government in power at the time got back in.
The reality is that it is an outdated and inequitable tax; and I cannot for the life of me understand how this government can be so naive as to want to bring it in at any cost. I think the Australian public is giving the government the message. For the Prime Minister to say that he had a mandate is just ridiculous. The fact is that over 50 per cent of the people voted for 
 the Labor Party. There are probably many reasons as to why the government was able to be returned, albeit with a slender majority, but I certainly do not think one of them was that people wanted the goods and services tax.
One of the, if you like, silent points about the GST has not even been brought out that much yet. I know that the government continues to say that the goods and services tax simply only replaces the wholesale sales tax, and it then goes on to mention a lot of other taxes. But what the government does not say is that, as from 1 July 2000, when this tax will come in, for the first time in this country's history services will be taxed. There is no wholesale sales tax on services; there are no taxes on services at the moment. It seems to me that, when people's minds are focused on the fact that every time they go to a picture show, the movies, the football, or they get a plumber or someone to come in and repair a washing machine it will cost them 10 per cent more, we will find the Australian public even more against this tax than they are at the moment.
I do not think the question of how much the black economy will be affected by all this has been discussed enough since 1993, when I was in parliament before my short sabbatical for a couple of years. We all know that the black economy is there. We all know that there are people who do things for cash. We all know that there are some businesses—I do not know of any personally—that have a few sets of books. At the moment it might be two sets of books—that is, what the business actually takes and what it shows. From now on there will be three sets of books because, as well as evading income tax, their pet hobby will be to evade the goods and services tax.
—Arthur Daley.
—Exactly. For example, let us say that a householder needs to have some renovations done to their house. They get a renovator in and he says, `It's going to cost you $5,000 to do that job.' Are we naive to suggest that now, because of this goods and services tax, the incentive will not be there for an exchange like this to hypothetically take place: tradesman to consumer, `Madam, it is going to cost you $5,000, but you have to pay an extra $500 on top of that because of the goods and services tax.' Says that householder, `That's pretty heavy, isn't it—an extra $500 just to pay this tax?' `Yes,' says the tradesman, `but I'll tell you what, if you give me $4,500 in cash, you don't pay the extra $500, you save $500 and I don't have to pay income tax on the $4,500.'
Anyone who tells you that these sorts of things are not going to happen all the time is either stupid or naive or both, because it is going to happen. What is going to happen in this country in that area is that tax receipts will not be collected to the extent that they think they are going to collect them. In the end it will be a disgusting situation because tax avoidance will become a national sport. Somebody mentioned the Minder, Arthur Daley. We are importing Arthur Daleys from the Minder series into Australia.
I want to raise today in this debate on  Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1999-2000  some of anomalies and some of the bad things that happen as a result of our federal bankruptcy regulations. I would like to share with this chamber the unfortunate story of my constituents Frank and Gina Curcio, whose salutary experience indicates just how crazy our present bankruptcy system is. I am proud to represent the Curcios in this chamber. They are fine, upstanding citizens and decent, warm-hearted people. Frank and Gina have never had a bad debt in their lives. They have worked hard for everything they have today, which makes the 
 story you are about to hear even more amazing and our system even more in urgent need of reform.
The crux of the story is this: Frank and Gina Curcio were declared bankrupt by a court that they had never attended on the basis of a petition that they had never seen which was lodged by a company that they had never dealt with for a debt that they had never incurred in a state where they did not live because Mr Curcio happens, coincidently, to share his name with someone he had never met and to whom he is not related, and no-one involved bothered to check out which Frank Curcio was which. I suppose you could be thoroughly confused at this stage. Now you can start to imagine the torment that the Curcios have been going through for the past 10 months.
It all started when Gina and Frank went to their letterbox on 11 August last year. Amidst the usual letters and brochures was a great wad of papers from the Brisbane chartered accountant firm of Clout and Associates—let me repeat that name for you: Clout and Associates. Amongst these documents was one notifying the Curcios that the Federal Court of Australia had issued a sequestration order against them on 22 July and all their assets had been frozen. It was further demanded that they complete a 21-page statement of affairs—this is it here; it is just unbelievable—or face criminal prosecution. You need to be a lawyer to understand it. That is the first thing. I am a lawyer and I find it—no, I do understand it. I will quote Mrs Gina Curcio from an article that appeared on the front page and page 4 of the Sunday Mail newspaper in Brisbane on 18 April. She said:
The papers were just left in the letterbox . . . When we opened them up we were stunned. Our accountant said he had never seen anything like this in his life and we had better get legal advice.
I am also a lawyer, as I have just mentioned, and I returned to that trade in 1996 after I was sent to the sin bin for a period by the Australian public in my electorate—and I am pleased to be back. But even I, as a lawyer, find this very hard to swallow. Heaven knows what the Curcios went through.
Mr Deputy Speaker, imagine for a moment that you are Frank Curcio of Ormiston in the electorate of Bowman. Without any warning you are faced with a bundle of documents which includes the following threats and demands:
You must take particular note of the restrictions placed upon you now that you are a bankrupt and the penalties for breaches of the Act. You have a duty under the Bankruptcy Act to cooperate with your Trustee in the administration of your estate.
Charming, isn't it? I quote again from the documents:
You should not sell or deal with any of your assets or items of value. Only your Trustee or a secured creditor is able to do so. ""Assets"" include anything of value belonging to you at the date of bankruptcy, together with those obtained by you, or which are given to you before your discharge.
Mr Deputy Speaker, if you were still puzzled, perhaps this would grab your attention:
Failure to provide information [about your income] when requested can result in your bankruptcy being extended for a further five years.
How would you like trying to answer some of these questions:
-	 List other names you have used in the last seven years;
-	 When did you begin having difficulty meeting your debts;
-	 Why are you sure that this is the right date;
-	 List all court actions in which you are currently involved. 

Mrs Curcio said in the Sunday Mail  article:
It has made my hair go white . . . We were so upset we could not sleep. We have had an impeccable credit rating all our lives. I was greatly humiliated. I have never heard of anything like it.
It took the Curcio's solicitor three days to sort out the mess. The bankruptcy involved another Frank Curcio who owed $100,000 in Melbourne. Mr Deputy Speaker, do you want to know how the other Frank Curcio had incurred the debt? He had purchased a luxury yacht and sailed away into the sunset. My Frank Curcio, the Bowman Frank Curcio, would love a luxury yacht, but he does not have one. He has never had one and, unless his lotto numbers come up soon, he will never have one. Mr Frank Curcio of Bowman is a 61-year-old pensioner whose sole income following a work injury some eight or nine years ago is an invalid pension—hardly enough for a luxury yacht.
Like me, the Curcios are proud Australians of Italian heritage. Unlike me, they do not possess any legal training. For them to receive such a demand was an awful experience. With threats made against all their assets, Frank Curcio naturally contacted his bank, the local National Australia Bank, where he had been a customer for years. Even they assumed the worst of the Curcios. I will quote Mrs Curcio once more:
I rang the bank and they said we had been declared bankrupt. I thought our house was going to be sold from under us.
The bank manager said my husband would have to prove it was not him. Frank has suffered a heart attack in March and I was worried the stress would cause another one.
The Curcio's bank accounts were under threat of being frozen so that only one James Taplin of Clout and Associates could release the funds which consisted wholly and entirely of Mr Curcio's invalid pension—hardly a princely sum but, nevertheless, Frank's sole income. In such a crisis, surely a man could expect his own bank manager to support him—I suppose in the old days you could, but you certainly do not seem to be able to get anything out of the banks nowadays, particularly the big four—but not in this case. The Federal Court had everybody bluffed, even though it had nothing to do with Mr Frank Curcio of Bowman.
I hear you ask: how did Clout and Associates send him these papers? This is where the tragic tale of human error descends rapidly into an ugly farce. When the finance company behind the Melbourne Frank Curcio decided to call in their bad debt, they realised they could not find the luxury yacht owner. What did they do? According to Lorraine Smith of Clout and Associates, they adopted a `scattergun' approach—sending it to every Frank Curcio they could find, including two listed on the Internet.
According to Mr John Park of Clout and Associates, as quoted on page 4 of the Sunday Mail newspaper on 18 April this year, `I don't think it was anything that should cause them too much grief.' Mr Park went on to say:
. . . his firm was too busy to send someone out to check the identity of people it targeted and it was standard industry practice to use a `scattergun' approach.
I have to agree with the Sunday Mail  editorial of the same date, which says:
In cases where there is no fixed address, trustees are apparently accustomed to serving papers on several people of the same name, assuming that the ensuing reaction of outrage from innocent people will eventually identify the correct target. This approach is unacceptable and needs to be urgently reviewed.
Clout and Associates sent Frank Curcio a letter of apology last August. Given the circumstances, you would think it would be gracious; it was anything but that. I quote its conclusion:
Given his discussions with [your solicitor], Mr Taplin gave the instructions that [your] account was not to be frozen. I apologise for any inconvenience that my previous correspondence has caused. Should you wish to discuss this matter further, please contact Mr John Park or Ms Lorraine Smith of this office.
Yours faithfully,
F Curcio (A Bankrupt)
DL Clout
Trustee
Even in the letter of apology saying he is not a bankrupt, they still refer to him as `F Curcio (A Bankrupt); DL Clout, Trustee'. It is just unbelievable.
Those few words encapsulate Frank and Gina Curcio's problems. They needed to engage a solicitor to take on Clout and Associates. The National Australia Bank was prepared to freeze their accounts without question, despite their years of loyalty. Loyalty counts for nothing nowadays with banks; all my colleagues in the chamber would probably agree with me on that one.
It was inconvenient that this incident had occurred, nothing more. And the sting is in the tail: D.L. Clout might be a trustee but F. Curcio is a bankrupt by order of the Federal Court. Nothing Clout and Associates have done removes that mark against their name, that stain upon their character. Clout and Associates have finally agreed to pay the Curcios' minor legal fees after three pages of howling condemnation in the Sunday Mail. This is far too little far too late. Had anyone ever tried to contact the Curcios before they were declared bankrupt? Had anyone done that? No.
Gina finally remembered that an investigator had called at their house many months before, possibly a year, inquiring about a payment for a boat. Mr Curcio had shown the investigator his beloved tinny, which he had purchased many, many years before. The investigator also had a photo of the Frank Curcio he was seeking, who looked nothing like my constituent.
One investigator's visit, a tinny instead of a $100,000 yacht, a 61-year-old invalid pensioner instead of a con man whose photo they had—on this alone, the Federal Court was happy to grant a sequestration order against my constituent; on this alone, Clout and Associates demanded control of his life and his assets; and on this alone, the National Australia Bank was prepared to freeze his pension account.
Where stood the burden of proof in the case of Frank Curcio? In case you were still wondering, they finally caught up with the other Frank Curcio, the one with the luxury yacht. But my constituent received a letter of apology from the people who did this to him branding him `F Curcio (A Bankrupt)'. Nothing will take that away. He cannot afford the legal fees to fight to clear his name, as it deserves to be cleared. Let me read from another perspective, that of Michael Petrohilos:
They were both in a state of extreme distress and agitation and remained so while they desperately tried to have the matter sorted out. . . Luckily there were no adverse cardiac outcomes but there is no doubt Mr and Mrs Curcio suffered greatly as a result of these distressing events.
I place more weight on Michael Petrohilos's opinion of the Curcios' condition than I do on the opinion of John Park of Clout and Associates because, you see, Dr Petrohilos is the Curcios' family physician.
When they came to see me, I spoke to them and I was impressed by their candour, but I was also very emotionally moved by the way this had affected them. Lovely people, both of them. They asked me what they could do. As a lawyer, I told them there was not a lot they 
 could do. They did not have a lot of money to fight and sue anyone, but I told them one thing. I said, `The only thing I can do as your member is to bring this up and name these people in the house of parliament where I represent you.' I told them I was going to do that, and today I have done it. I have kept my promise to them. I will make sure that in future, when these sorts of matters come up, I will keep a close eye on them and see if we can reform the position.

"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,1999-06-10,"—The GST has been, since day one, a flawed tax. The underlying rationale and support for the introduction of the original GST package is based on flawed economic thinking and mistaken value judgments by the coalition and now also by the Democrats. The economic reality of the old GST package was that at its core it was a job destroyer. The forecast for jobs under the GST regime ranged depending on the economic model you go by. Figures from Treasury's own economic modelling seem to indicate that job growth from the GST will be insubstantial, if at all, and that the jobs created will not be as a result of the GST but more as a result of the budget surplus and the fiscal injection into the economy. This, however, is the most optimistic of all credible forecasts.
Other economists have argued that the GST will cost jobs—thousands of jobs, in fact. Jobs will be lost in the tourism industry, in the service industry and, in particular, in the bush and in regional Australia, not to mention the jobs that will be lost in Queensland and Tasmania. Therefore, the best assertion the government can make is that, if all goes well and they are right and the economic modelling is right, this tax will not help jobs growth. However, if they are wrong or the other experts are right or even if the government are slightly out in their forecast and estimates, then this tax package will destroy jobs. I know there are a lot of backbenchers on this side who can explain to the Prime Minister how relaxed and comfortable people feel when their job depends on whether the government's economic forecaster got it right! But the quantums really tell very little of the whole story.
The big dilemma with this tax is job shifting—the scenario that means jobs will shrink in certain industries while in other industries they will grow. Were this to occur, the statistical analysis can be viewed as a zero sum equation. But the human factor, as is so often the case, spoils the statistics. The reality will be that most of the people who lose their jobs as a result of this tax will not be automatically employable in the industries that are likely to increase intake as a result of the GST. Might I also add that it would not be in equivalent proportions in any case. Jobs will be lost in a majority of employment sectors, including transport, retail, the electrical industry and tourism, but are likely to be increased in automotive and electrical equipment industries. Therefore, for example, workers at KFC who will get the chop simply because their chickens are chopped will be okay as long as they also have qualifications in electronics, which of course most of them do not.
Might I also add a ticket to another state. This tax is going to hit hardest outside the core manufacturing zone in Australia's south-east. States like Queensland that rely heavily on tourism for jobs will be devastated by this tax. I understand that none of this information is new. I realise that all these facts are well understood by the entire community. It was certainly understood by the Democrats.
The Democrats also understood that this tax is highly regressive, that the GST is a massive slug on low and middle income earners and that the extra revenue raised from this slug is being used to pass on tax cuts to the rich—and passed on at a disproportionate rate. The Democrats knew also that the tax fails to exempt those areas that the government claimed to 
 be exempt. In particular, the Democrats knew that this was a tax on reading and a tax on education. They understood this. They also understood that these flaws are the fundamental faults of the GST.
The Democrats knew all this before they began their negotiations with the government but, instead of going into negotiations with the government determined to support fair and workable tax reform, they went in determined to have a GST. At any cost, they negotiated away the concerns of community, of their party membership and, ultimately, of the senators themselves. What paltry changes the Democrats did receive will mean nothing. Removing fresh, unprocessed food from the GST will go no further towards the desired outcome of this tax from the Democrats' perspective. These changes take none of the pain of the GST away from middle and low income earners. They do nothing to prevent a ridiculous tax imposition on literacy and learning in Australia. These changes will see this package skewed unfairly towards breaks at the top end of town, and they will still see families hurting.
What has changed is the compliance headache for businesses dealing with a billion dollar distraction and the Democrats masquerading as big-time party players and policy makers. The small business migraine will come on every time there is a new product or fresh litigation in the never ending attempt to clarify exemptions. Whilst others in the House have illustrated very effectively the economic impact of these exemptions, it is worth noting that an exemption on fresh, unprocessed food falls well short of the Democrats' promise of the widest possible definition of food. As a result of this, the Democrats have provided very little GST shelter for the household food budget from the GST. Up to one-third of the food budget in low income households will still be GST taxable under the Democrats' amendments and food is one-third of general household expenses.
A submission to the Senate Select Committee on a New Tax System has shown overall levels of food consumption are not greatly affected by rising or falling prices, particularly the food budgets of lower and middle income families. This shows that, inasmuch as the Democrats' amendments were supposed to shield low income earners from the GST and put a little more of the revenue burden on high income earners, it has failed. So then we are left to ask: why exempt food? Why exempt certain types of food? The Democrats had a belief that exempting food would soften the impact of the GST. Well, that has not happened. Also the Democrats have chosen food exemption when other compensation measures would have proven more effective, based on the fact that the Democrats were always determined to have a GST anyway.
It appears the Democrats' policy to exempt certain types of foods was based on some very misguided and out of touch value judgments about the community and the foods people purchase. The Democrats, it seems, believe in taxing processed foods because they are either fast food or a luxury item, or perhaps both. But this is plainly not true. Processed and prepared foods are not junk foods. It remains to be proven by the Democrats or the coalition that the products they have exempted from the GST are nutritionally superior to the many alternative products they have hit with the tax.
I refer most particularly to the situation in which canned foods are GST exempt. I thank the Leader of the Opposition for having already highlighted the ridiculous situation where canned soup is tax free but carton soup is slugged. Think also of salads, such as three-bean mix and the ever popular potato salad: if they are prepared and sold to you in a salad bar set-up, you pay a GST; if you buy them in a can, then they are tax free. The same product, the same food, 
 but wait—the packaging is different, therefore it is taxed. But what is the effect? What is the real difference?
One difference is that the salad bar salads are fresh, therefore they are generally made locally with local ingredients. Tinned food, on the other hand, lasts a long time, time enough in fact to be shipped to Australia from overseas. While at the moment it is the case that most tinned foods contain local product, it is also true that nearly 100 per cent of fresh processed foods are local product, except they cop a GST, while tinned processed foods can be imported from overseas and do not get taxed. Thus the Democrat-Howard GST will prove beneficial for food importers at the expense of local producers.
Who is hurt in this tax madness? The consumer—they have choices taken away from them because they are penalised with tax for choosing the fresh salad option. Neither can it be sustained that they are being encouraged to purchase a product of superior nutritional value. Under a GST, `fresh is best' will be replaced with `fresh is taxed'.
Australia's largest seller of ready to eat fresh products is Mrs Crocket's. It is a Queensland company that employs over 500 staff throughout the eastern coast, including regional Australia. Over 75 per cent of the products it uses are purchased under contract from Australian farms. This company supplies food whole, processed and partly processed. It sells ready to use, ready to heat and ready to eat products. However, under the definition of processed foods, it will have some products taxed and some exempt. But the question is: which ones and how does it define it? Mrs Crocket's is already expecting a six-figure compliance cost in the introduction of this tax. Poorly drafted or ill-defined exemptions will cost it even more in terms of market share.
Local workers who are employed to process these foods do not stand to win; it is their jobs that this tax will take away. The local producers, our farmers who supply these fresh salad products, will not win either as their market shrinks also under this tax bias. `That's okay,' says Meg Lees, `You have to draw the line somewhere.' Well, Labor did. We drew the line months ago when we told the Australian public that we would not, could not, support the GST in any form, and we stuck to that promise. This is the only line that makes any sense at all. It is the line behind which low and middle income earners and business can stand with confidence. It is the line the Democrats should be behind, but it is a fair distance from where they are standing now.
The Democrats cannot justify their exemption of some categories of food from this tax and forcing others to be taxed. If the Democrats believe that taxing processed foods is some sort of luxury tax, then they prove once again how seriously out of touch they really are. It goes beyond the food snobbery and Orwellian pedagogy of the state's authorised brand, the state sanctioned chicken and the new national loaf of bread, although this in itself is taxation gone mad. It goes further than that. It is, I'm afraid, a new and pernicious form of lifestyle snobbery. The concept that the ingredients to make most foods will not be taxed but if you happen to buy the product fully made then it is taxed cannot be supported by any political party that represents the older or poorer in our society or for that matter the ordinary family.
A shepherd's pie is a simple meal. It is nutritious and wholesome. It is the sort of budget meal that most families enjoy from time to time. It can hardly be treated as a luxury item or an item that should be taxed. If you go out and buy the potatoes, mince, flour, milk and fat, you can have a tax-free shepherd's pie. Of course, that is if you can make it yourself. It is a simple process of combining the flour, fat and water to make a pastry dough, kneading the 
 pastry until soft, then rolling and folding until you have a thin sheet of pastry that will then be placed in a greased pie dish. After this, you can begin cooking the savoury mince for the filling of your pie. You then boil the potatoes, mash them and put them on the top of your pie. Put all this in a preheated oven and let it cook for 45 minutes. After about 1½ hours of wholesome, Democrat approved, domestic toiling, you can sit down to a scrumptious tax-free feast.
But just maybe you are one of the great majority who, for a variety of reasons, does not have the capacity to make your own pie. Perhaps because you are a working couple without the time to make a shepherd's pie from scratch, or perhaps you are a young mum doing it a bit tough and you do not have a rolling pin or a baking dish. Maybe you once spent hours making your own meals but due to poor health this is no longer possible or maybe you just make a lousy pie. So what do you do? You go down to the supermarket and you pick up a frozen pie, a low cost nutritious family meal that is simple to prepare. `Well, bad luck for you,' say the Democrats and the government. Under this GST, you have to cop a tax. Because your pie is classed as processed food, it is taxed. You are penalised but, even worse, you are penalised because of your lifestyle.
The distinction between processed foods and unprocessed foods is a value judgment based on out of date values—a fifties notion, that I am sure the government is comfortable in sustaining, of breadwinners, homemakers and white picket fences. If your family does not fit this neat picture, then you cop the tax.
If you can, it is a very satisfying thing to bake your children a birthday cake. You make something nice for the kids and save yourself some GST at the same time. But if you are working every day to pay the bills and on the way home from work you pick up a cake, the Meg Lees/John Howard tax man is going to punish you. For busy families, this is a tax on time. If you can, there is nothing nicer than eating homemade pie straight from the oven. You get to enjoy the pie hot and fresh and save yourself some GST at the same time. But if you have arthritis and cannot mix and roll the pastry, you buy pre-made pastry and the Meg Lees tax man will hit you again. For the infirm, this is a tax on incapacity.
This is the Democrats' GST. This is a tax on choices and a tax on convenience; a tax imposed on families and individuals who do not share the Democrats' out of touch and arrogant assumptions about what is good and proper in family life, what should be encouraged and what should be punished. Like the Democrats' assumption on what is bread and what is chicken, the distinction between processed and unprocessed food is totally arbitrary. As Meg Lees said on national television, `It is just a case of where you draw the line.' She is wrong. What she really means is: `It is just a case of where I draw the line.'
Who decides what is bread and what is not? Not the consumer, not the middle and low income earner; Meg Lees decides. Who decides what is fresh and what is unprocessed and what is a meal rather than part of a meal? Meg Lees does. This is the Meg Lees buffer for low and middle income earners against the GST. She decides where we need exemption from this pervasive tax. Her only answer is to say, `Fresh food.' That is it. Chris Murphy described food exemption as:
. . . a blunt instrument for achieving the equity principle. By comparison, increases in social security benefits and income tax cuts for low income earners are sharper instruments.
If the Democrats wanted to shield low income earners from the effects of a GST, why did they not secure a decent compensation package? Instead of settling for half of a pathetic and paltry 
 sum, why did the Democrats trade off decent compensation for a food exemption that is arbitrary and totally unworkable? Why not let families have the money they need to buy the food they want in a manner that suits their lifestyle? After all, we have managed for this long without the Democrats' guide to good living. Surely we can manage a bit longer.
Why? Because the Democrats know, as we all know, the GST will eventually erode any compensation package provided and, sooner rather than later, low income earners will be back to square one with a GST hanging over their heads forever. But the Democrats should also know this: as surely as the compensation package will be eroded, so too will government support for food exemption. First, they will get their GST with the Democrats' support in the Senate.
Debate interrupted; adjournment proposed and negatived.
—The government will leave the Democrats carrying the can for the compliance costs of the GST. They will tell every confused retailer and consumer that these are the Democrats amendments, this is the Democrats GST and that they created this mess, not the government. Who will support the Democrats on their stance? The minority of Australians who back the GST will support the Democrats. They will be seen only to have corrupted the original tax plan. The vast majority of Australians who oppose the GST will not thank the Democrats for their capitulation. They know that, like Labor, the Greens and Brian Harradine, they could simply have said, `No deal.' The Democrats will find that the ranks of people outside these groups are very thin.
In their efforts to become a big-time political party, the Democrats will become a boutique political organisation with no direction on a dwindling support basis. But do not just take my word for it. Small business has been highly critical of this. All the experts and commentators who so readily supported the government in the original package are also highly critical of this deal. While their motives for a change of heart are different in principle to my position, it is the same criticism that the new tax package is unworkable, that it is too complex and that compliance costs are going to be too high.
Let me give the chamber a few examples. Terry McCrann—no friend of the Labor Party; a long-suffering colleague of the coalition—had this to say in the Telegraph of 9 June 1999 under the headline `Democrats GST is bad, it's bad, it's really, really bad':
So it was comforting to see that some things don't change. The Dems still like to visit and play at the bottom of the garden.
I think that sums it up pretty well. Let me go to the Financial Review  for a quote which, again, is from a long-time supporter of the GST. It says:
Treasury figures indicate a 10 per cent GST would see tourism prices rise by an aggregate 6.7 per cent, dampening demand for domestic tourism, which accounts for 80 per cent of this $61 billion industry.
. . .              . . .             . . .
Tourism employs more than a million Australians. It is labour-intensive, one of this country's fastest-growing economic activities and a field of endeavour in which we enjoy clear advantages over competitors.
But no longer because, under this tax, they will be losers. This tax is a tax on jobs.
What the government have done is a massive con job. In fact, it is the biggest con job ever perpetrated on the Australian public in political history. First, they tell us that a GST or anything like it is completely off the coalition agenda. But, just to be sure, the Prime Minister 
 said these now infamous words: `never, ever'. They then conned the Australian people further by giving no detail of the GST package and the impact it would have until after the election and only after substantial pressure by the opposition for a Senate inquiry. They then convinced business that this was tax reform when it was really just some sort of mere tax change.
They said it was a perfect package. They said it was perfectly simple—that is, until you attempt to read all 284 pages of the original bill. Then, of course, there are the 128 amendments the government have tabled to date. In addition to all the amendments of the Democrat deal which are about to be tabled, there are hundreds of pages of transitional provisions and the administration bill provisions as well. Simple, isn't it? Just try to waffle through all those pages and see where you really end up.
This deal between the government and their new coalition partner, the Democrats, fails all Australians. It fails business. It fails absolutely everybody. The implications, the cost and the complexity of this GST package may be lost on the government and may be lost on the Democrats, but it is not lost on everybody else. People will not forget what this means. People will have long memories. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (No. 1) 1999-2000</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"O'Keefe, Neil, MP",ALP,1999-06-10,"—In the time that has transpired between the introduction of these budget bills in the House, the debate has almost moved on. I feel in some way for government members, having experienced this many times myself in the past. They brought down this budget on budget night and were hailed for all the wonderful things that were in it. Of course, it has sunk beneath the ocean since then. It has been overtaken by the GST debate. It has been overtaken by the proprietary interests of Mr Entsch from North Queensland and so on. The GST debate which my colleague has been so eloquently talking about will go on for the next two years all the way, I believe, to the next federal election.
There were a couple of items in the Treasurer's budget speech which I do not want to allow to slip by without further discussion. That is why I have chosen to say a few words about it during my contribution this afternoon. As I sat there listening to the Treasurer's speech, thinking about the different philosophies of those on the government side and the opposition, I was actually more than surprised by the measures announced on budget night relating to education funding and labour market programs. I say `more than surprised' because I was actually quite sickened by the trends that were being espoused in the philosophy being portrayed.
The points I want to make about this are these. We saw the government making great play of the fact that it was working on a new plan for the funding of non-government schools in Australia and preaching, in particular, about the plan to move to a fairer needs based system for funding private schools. But what we saw built into those plans was a significant shift away from funding of state schools.
It is hugely relevant to this GST debate because I believe the premiers, in their enthusiasm to get hold of the so-called growth tax allocated to them, have been conned. I do not understand why they do not understand that every dollar the federal government makes available to them in future from the proceeds of the GST is a dollar that is currently funded in federal government programs which will not be provided in the future. They will not be getting specific purpose grants for education for their state schools, for their public hospitals and for all the other general purpose funds that are provided at the moment by direct grants from the federal budget.
What in fact the premiers will now be told is, `You all get the GST for that.' We are seeing the very first phase of this in this budget in relation to the cutback in funding for public schools and in the shift of funding going on to encourage the development of more and more private schools as direct competitors to state schools in lots of areas. I regard it as quite sick. The next stage of this has now emerged in Victoria with the Kennett government's announcement of its funding assistance for schools for computers.
The great headlines are `All schools to get computers' but, when you get to the guts of it, it is a grant of $1 from the state government for each $3 that the school raises. In wealthy suburbs and in wealthy private schools where they will not have the slightest problem raising their three bucks, they will get an extra dollar from the government. What we are seeing unfold here is this whole philosophy of not only pushing resources but also advantage and opportunity to the children of the people who can afford to pay.
The other thing I want to expose which was part of the Treasurer's contribution on budget night on this topic is the claim that the government are adjusting in some way the funding for private schools to rebalance a bit the disproportionate amount going to the wealthier schools. They might be doing that, but in the Treasurer's speech was in fact the guarantee that category 1 schools will continue to receive their present funding levels until 2004. So there is a rhetorical claim made that `we are shifting to a needs based Labor style policy in private school funding; oh, by the way, if you are one of the richest schools in Australia don't worry, because it is guaranteed to stay where it is for the next five years'.
I believe this is fraudulent. I believe that when you couple it to the plans being implemented, for instance, by the Victorian state government for the targeting of grants to the schools that can raise the most matching capital—rather than the Labor style needs based policy that worked equally for all schools for a period of 15 years in this country—you are getting a sick shift in national education policy very clearly exposed in this budget; and I intend to continue the campaign on this matter.
The other issue I want to raise in these few comments about the budget—as I mentioned earlier, a lot of my colleagues will focus on a lot of the tax and other issues and I am happy for the debate to go on, and I will be part of it—is that I was also deeply disappointed in the approach taken in the budget to labour market programs. I had been given some hope from some of the information I had received from officers around the place that the government were beginning to understand that people who do not have a job and who need assistance to get back into the work force were going to have to have more resources spent on them. That means more dollars per person per placement. No matter what the government like to claim, when you talk to practitioners in the field, the fact is that these labour market programs are not working. Work for the Dole, as an example, might be popular among some of the constituencies they are trying to appeal to, but the fact is that there are very few people on that program getting jobs off it.
—It isn't a labour market program.
—As my colleague the member for the Northern Territory says, it is not a labour market program. It is not a program that is leading to anything much for the hundreds, if not hundreds of thousands, of young people who are not getting genuine opportunities of the kind they were getting. I mentioned that I was disappointed, because the information that I received was that the briefings that were going to the minister and were being accepted within the government showed that they understood they needed to make a higher allocation 
 per placement to fund better training, better supervision and better actual work placements to create genuine opportunities. That did not come. What came instead was the grand announcement, `We're doubling the number of places for Work for the Dole.' But when you go down into the fine detail, you find that, yes, they might be, but they are not making a single extra dollar available per placement, and that means there will not be one extra element of benefit or advance out of that program.
Last week we saw the true measure of this—the new term `job snobs'. The very people who dreamed up the term `dole bludgers' in the early 1980s, when their programs were failing to place people who were unemployed, have now started to pin people as `job snobs'—`If you don't want to go to the job we've got for you; you're a job snob.' You can see it evolving as the camouflage for programs that simply are not working. I do not think we can allow this to happen without trying to expose it. So I wanted to take these few minutes to digress a little from the tax debate taking place in the context of the budget bills at the moment and put the government on notice that those two particular areas of the disgraceful and sick shift in funding away from public schools and the fact that the states have been sold the GST pup which will be used to cut back a whole lot of general purpose grants that were used for funding areas like public hospitals and state schools have to be exposed and continue to be talked through; and I am putting the government on notice that there is no way they are going to get away with another `dole bludgers' campaign. These programs do not work; people know they do not work and we are going to force them to apply genuine dollars to those people who need assistance. Mr Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Ellis, Annette, MP",ALP,1999-06-10,"—I want to raise the question of the future of the ACT Hospice, which is located on the Acton Peninsula and operated by the Little Company of Mary. As members will be aware, the Acton Peninsula is the site for the development of the new National Museum. In fact, construction is now under way for that project. We need to go back a little in time to understand the situation now facing the ACT Hospice and its community. Acton Peninsula was part of a land swap handing the peninsula over to the Commonwealth, in return for the ACT government receiving control of some land on the Kingston foreshores of Lake Burley Griffin. It is worth noting here that the previous ACT Labor government had excised the hospice site from any consideration in that land swap. When the Carnell Liberal government came to power that decision was reversed, with the hospice site included in the land swap arrangements.
When it was decided to locate the museum project on the Acton Peninsula, the federal government, as I understand it, agreed to allow the hospice to `temporarily continue in operation', with regard to amendment 20 to the National Capital Plan. The Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, Senator Ian Macdonald, in a letter to the ACT Leader of the Opposition, said:
With regard to Amendment 20 of the national capital plan, you should be aware that the exchange of Commonwealth land at Kingston for ACT land on Acton Peninsula is governed by Land Exchange 
 Agreements made on 1 May 1997. This provides, inter alia, for the ACT to have the licence to operate the Hospice.
The ACT Chief Minister signed a licence agreement relating to the hospice on that same day. The licence agreement stipulates that the term commences from the declaration of the premises as national land and terminates on 30 June 1999. This is where the current dilemma becomes stark. The minister for territories has now announced that the Commonwealth will be holding to that date of 30 June and that the hospice will have to move. It appears that no arrangement was made by the ACT government to protect itself from that date. Papers available to date show no consideration by the ACT government to the future of the hospice beyond 30 June in the context of that licence agreement.
The federal minister recently expressed his view that the date held and that discussions are under way with the ACT government to consider the future of the hospice. It appears that the recent budget brought down by the ACT government had no allocation or future estimate listed for the construction of a new hospice. Investigations to date show no firm plans for the location of land to house a new hospice. To add to the concerns, it appears that, on the plans for the national museum, the area within the site is shown as `for further development of the museum'. Where does this leave the patients, staff and families at the hospice? The ACT opposition has been calling for action and decisions on this matter for well over 12 months. The federal minister, Senator Ian Macdonald, last October preferred to accuse the ACT Labor opposition of mischief-making when it raised concerns in relation to this issue. That attitude will not solve the problem.
The general opinion is that ideally the hospice should be allowed to stay where it is permanently—a more ideal location would be hard to find. If, however, the federal government hold firm to their view that the hospice should relocate, then why has a decision been left to this late date? What has the ACT government been doing? Have there been negotiations between the two governments? Where are the forward estimates in the ACT budget to build a new facility? Has land for this facility been identified? What discussions have been held with the ACT Hospice and Palliative Care Society regarding the future of the hospice? In the meantime, the hospice seems to be consigned to at least two years of living in a major construction site, possibly to no avail but to move. It will take at least two years and $3½ million to $4 million to provide a new location and a new building.
At this stage, I can do nothing more than condemn both the ACT and federal governments for this current situation. I urge them both to act honestly and expeditiously and to remove the doubts and uncertainties that currently surround this very important issue. I can assure the federal minister concerned that I intend no mischief-making in bringing this to the attention of this chamber. This is an extremely important issue—one that affects a very vulnerable part of our community. I do not need to go into that detail; we know what service a hospice provides.
This hospice is of world-class standard. We in the ACT are extremely proud of it, and we waited a long time to get it. Now that it is here, let us get the ACT and federal governments together quickly to come to a solution that will serve all people concerned.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Canberra: Australian Capital Territory Hospice</title>,Adjournment,23,1,speech
