"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2004-05-11,"—I rise to speak in the debate on the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill (No. 2) 2004. Senator Conroy would normally deal with this bill but is unavailable due to the budget being handed down tonight. This bill is a further instalment in the legislative response to community concerns about the rising cost of public liability insurance. Since 2002 state and territory governments have engaged in a process of reforming their negligence laws to reduce public liability claims costs. These reforms have included caps on damages, thresholds to prevent the commencement of actions in relation to minor injuries and changes to the limitation period for bringing an action.
Labor have consistently backed the state tort law reform process and called for Commonwealth action to ensure that it is effective. This bill, like the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2003 which the Senate debated in February, is intended to address the possibility that the state tort law reforms could be undermined by forum shopping. Both these bills respond to recommendations of the Ipp inquiry into the law of negligence. There are a number of provisions of the Trade Practices Act that could form the basis of an action for damages for personal injury or death. Concerns have been expressed to government by the insurance industry that if the Trade Practices Act is not amended, plaintiffs will seek to avoid the restrictions imposed by state and territory civil liability laws by framing an action under the Trade Practices Act. At present there is little evidence that the TPA is being used as the basis for personal injury claims. Nevertheless, Labor accept that forum shopping is technically possible. Consequently, Labor have indicated that we will support amendments to the TPA to address this potential consequence. Labor have always stressed, however, that the amendments must be proportionate to the nature of the problem. We have emphasised that there is no case for abolishing fundamental consumer rights which have stood for decades.
In the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2003, which I shall refer to as the 2003 bill, the government sought to remove the ability of consumers and the ACCC to recover damages for personal injury and death sustained as a result of conduct breaching the unfair practices provisions in division 1 of part V of the act. Division 1 includes section 52, which prohibits companies from engaging in misleading and deceptive conduct. Many would argue that this is the most important consumer protection provision in the Trade Practices Act. The Senate took the view that the government's bill went too far. It supported amendments moved by Labor and the Democrats which were based on a proposal made by the ACCC. The amendments aligned damages under division 1 of part V with relevant state and territory civil liability laws. The amendments would have had the effect of deterring forum shopping because they would have ensured that plaintiffs could not recover any more under the TPA than in action based on negligence. Unfortunately, the government did not accept these amendments. 
As a consequence of the government's intransigence, there remains a financial incentive to engage in forum shopping. This bill covers TPA provisions relating to: firstly, unconscionable conduct in part IVA; secondly, supply by a manufacturer or importer of unsatisfactory consumer goods in division 2A of part V; and, thirdly, supply by a manufacturer or importer of defective goods in part VA. Instead of abolishing consumers' rights to seek damages for personal injuries sustained as a result of a breach of these provisions, the bill inserts a damages regime into the TPA. The bill introduces a new part VIB which imposes caps, thresholds and limitations on actions for personal injury. In broad terms, these restrictions are consistent with the approach adopted by the states and territories in their tort law reforms.
I will briefly outline some of the features of this regime. The bill inserts time limits for the commencement of litigation. Proceedings must be instituted within three years of discovering an injury. This limitation is also subject to a long stop provision. Generally speaking, no action for death or injury can be instituted more than 12 years after the act or omission that is alleged to have caused the death or injury. The bill also introduces caps and thresholds in relation to the various heads of damages. Damages for pain and suffering are capped at $250,000. This amount is indexed to the consumer price index. Insurers have indicated that a major factor driving up claims costs has been an increase in the number of small claims. In order to address this issue, the bill inserts a threshold. Damages will not be awarded if the court assesses that the non-economic loss incurred by the plaintiff is less than 15 per cent of the most extreme case.
Labor accept that thresholds are necessary to restore some balance to public liability arrangements. The bill also caps damages for loss of earnings capacity at two times average weekly earnings. Labor do not believe that the framework set out in part VIB is perfect. In some respects it is more restrictive than state law—for example, the cap on general damages is more than $100,000 below the amount that can be recovered under New South Wales and Victorian civil liability laws. Labor believe that it would be preferable to simply align damages under the TPA with state and territory laws, as we proposed in the 2003 bill.
Notwithstanding this view, Labor is prepared to support the framework set out in this bill in order to ensure that the potential for forum shopping is dealt with. In March this year Senator Conroy wrote to the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Senator Coonan, inviting the government to extend part VIB to apply to actions brought under part V of division 1. Labor made this proposal in an attempt to break the impasse in relation to the 2003 bill and to ensure that a consistent approach applied to all provisions under the TPA that may give rise to an action for personal injury damages.
Regrettably, the minister rejected Labor's solution. The government's arguments against the compromise proposal were not convincing. The government argued that the prohibition on misleading and deceptive conduct was never intended to form the basis of an action for personal injury damages. The minister has provided no evidence to support this assertion. Labor believes that the contrary view is strongly supported by the presence of section 4K of the TPA. This section, which was inserted in 1977, makes clear that a reference to loss or damage in the act includes injury. The government also contends that there should be no liability under section 52 for personal injury and death because it is a no-fault provision. By this it means that there is no requirement to prove that a person acted negligently or dishonestly in order for liability to arise under section 52. This argument that section 52 operates unfairly with respect to defendants has been comprehensively rebutted by the ACCC. In fact, ACCC commissioner Ms Jennifer McNeill told the Senate Economics Committee: 
In a situation where a business misleads or deceives a consumer and the consumer suffers damage—in this case, personal injury—as a result, the commission thinks that, as a matter of principle, they should be held accountable and liable for that damage, irrespective of intention.
Ms McNeill said that this was `because it is much more within the control of the business involved whether and how the representations are made; it is not within the control of the consumer whether and how the representations are made'.
In any event, the government's approach to the no-fault provisions is inconsistent. Under the bill we are considering today, the government proposes to allow the recovery of personal injury damages for breach of other no-fault provisions in the act. For example, section 74D of part VA gives consumers the right to bring an action for damages where goods are not of merchantable quality. In proceedings based on section 74D the consumer does not have to show that the manufacturer of the goods knew or should have known that they were flawed. Nevertheless, in this bill the government accepts that a breach of section 74D which causes personal injury should be able to form the basis of an action for damages. Labor does not believe that there is any justification for this inconsistent approach adopted by the government. All provisions of the TPA which could form the basis of an action for personal injury damages should be treated in the same way.
The final argument made by the government is that the Ipp committee recommended the abolition of the right to seek personal injury damages for breach of section 52. The Ipp review terms of reference were very narrow. The committee was specifically instructed to develop and evaluate options to prevent individuals from commencing an action under the TPA. It did not have an open brief. Furthermore, it should be noted that the Ipp review seems to be holy writ only when the government wants it to be. In this bill, for instance, the government inserts a discount rate of five per cent for future economic loss despite the fact that the Ipp review recommended that a three per cent rate apply.
Labor believe that the parliament is entitled to make its own judgment on these matters. We are not convinced that actions for personal injury arising under division 1 of part V should be treated differently from actions for personal injury arising under other parts of the act. In order to ensure that there is a consistent approach to actions for personal injury damages under the act and to deter forum shopping, Labor will move amendments to the bill to extend the application of part VIB. It is therefore hoped that the government will reconsider its opposition to extending the scope of this part of the bill.
Labor has grave doubts about whether the government really wants to develop a balanced and workable solution to the issue of forum shopping. The government has spent the last couple of months engaging in some misleading conduct of its own. It has incorrectly told community groups that failure to pass the 2003 bill is keeping their public liability premiums high. As I am sure the minister knows full well, the provisions of the TPA that we are discussing only apply to corporations engaged in trade or commerce. Consequently, they have virtually no application to the community sector. 
The government has also accused Labor of obstructing attempts to reduce insurance premiums for small business. The reality is that the government must explain to small businesses why it has failed to ensure that the savings already being realised from state tort law reforms are not flowing through to them. The most recent ACCC price monitoring report issued in February showed that insurers are making substantial underwriting profits on public liability business and are set to reap a sizeable windfall. The report indicates that the state tort law reforms have begun to take effect. The ACCC found that claims costs for personal injury and death fell by 14 per cent in the first six months of 2003. Despite the fall in claims costs, insurers have indicated that premiums will continue to rise. At the start of the tort law reform process in 2002, Labor warned the government that unless the ACCC was given the power to ensure that cost savings generated by the reforms were passed on to consumers in the form of lower premiums insurers would simply pocket the savings. Regrettably, this seems to be what is now occurring. Rather than running misleading scare campaigns, the government should act to ensure that consumers benefit from tort law reform—not just the insurance companies.
Before I conclude I would like briefly to canvass some other amendments Labor will be moving in relation to the bill. Labor has been advised that the bill may have an impact on future litigation against companies in the tobacco industry. Without judging the merits of any such action, Labor does not believe that reforms intended to address concerns about public liability premiums were intended to have any impact on the prospects of tobacco litigation. We note that most states have specifically excluded tobacco litigation from their civil liability reforms. In the committee stage, Labor will move amendments to ensure that the caps on damages and the long stop period contained in the bill do not apply in relation to tobacco cases. I will outline these amendments in more detail during the committee stage.
In conclusion, while we will move some amendments, Labor support the objective of this bill. The bill restricts damages under the TPA to ensure that the state and territory reforms are not undermined but, unlike the 2003 bill, it does not abolish fundamental consumer rights. In Labor's view this represents a more proportionate and balanced approach to the problem. The amendments that Labor will move in the committee stage will ensure that this regime applies to the other provisions of the TPA that could form the basis of an action for personal injury. We encourage the government to support these amendments so that the issue of forum shopping can finally be resolved.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INJURIES AND DEATH) BILL (NO. 2) 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-05-11,"—The predecessor of the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill (No. 2) 2004 was dealt with by my colleague Senator Ridgeway, but in his absence this afternoon I will take the bill forward. It is not as if I come to it as of new, in that I am a member of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee that inquired into the provisions of the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2003, which was this bill's predecessor. That committee reported in August 2003. Because this matter has been dealt with before and because we have put our views on record at length before, I do not intend to take up the time of the chamber for the full 20-minute allocation but I do have a number of points I wish to make.
The first is an attack on the fundamental suppositions made in the Ipp review. My belief for a long time has been that if that Ipp panel had been reviewed in court, they would have thrown out some of its findings on the basis that errors of fact were apparent. They should not have come to the conclusion they did because they neither had the evidence to do so nor did they have the facts before them to do so. In that regard, that view of mine has been confirmed this morning when I reread the Bills Digest No. 114. I wish to quote at length from some of the remarks in the early pages of that digest: 
In response to the insurance crisis, the Federal Government, in May 2002, appointed an expert panel of persons to review the operation of the laws of negligence and related provisions in the TPA and state and territory fair trading legislation. The expert panel was directed to recommend changes to personal injury law to solve the insurance crisis.
The terms of reference for the expert panel included the following statement: The award of damages for personal injury has become unaffordable and unsustainable as the principal source of compensation for those injured through the fault of another. It is desirable to examine a method for the reform of the common law with the objective of limiting liability and quantum of damages arising from personal injury and death.
That quote was taken from the review of the law of negligence final report, the Ipp report, September 2002, at page 9. The digest goes on:
From this statement it can be shown that the panel took as a given that the frequency and size of personal injury damages payouts was too large and so changes needed to be made to personal injury laws to wind this back.
There has been debate as to whether or not the expert panel should have started from this point. It has been argued that the limited range of claims statistics that were available at the time the review was being conducted meant that it would have been difficult to draw any conclusions about trends in personal injury claims and hence the appropriateness of the law. Despite this, the expert panel made 61 recommendations which are set out in the Ipp Report, targeted at reforming personal injury laws.
In drawing that conclusion, the digest referred also to the article in the Australian Financial Review on 11 October 2002 titled `Ipp report: long on notions, short on facts'. I hold to that view and so do the Australian Democrats. We think the Ipp report, with respect to these particular recommendations which affect this particular bill, was not justified and has not been validated subsequently. However, the government continues to pursue this.
The minister with responsibility for this area, the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, is herself a barrister. My opinion of lawyers is that they are often very capable and esteemed people, but all of them will carry a brief and are prepared to pursue a brief regardless of the merits of the case opposing it. In my view, this is just one of those instances. The committee inquiry, the views of those examining this issue and the countless critics of this area all indicate that there is no evidence which justifies the provisions of this bill. In a recent letter from Assistant Treasurer Coonan to Senator Ridgeway, she did say that there are three cases which in her view—which I presume therefore reflects the government's view—indicate that the floodgates are about to be opened to litigation in an area of the Trade Practices Act which has been marked by a singular lack of litigation.
She enunciated three cases. These are Johnson v. Golden Circle in December 2003, Kaouna v. Orthosports Pty Ltd and Robbs v. Pathology Services Pty Ltd trading as Mayne Health Laverty Pathology. Three cases do not a flood make. They do not invalidate the remarks I have made. In fact, in my view, the development of jurisprudence in this area is a plus, not a minus. It develops an appropriate reference point by which personal injury and damages can be evaluated. In the Australian Democrat minority report on the provisions of the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2003, Senator Ridgeway and I made a number of remarks in our conclusions. We said that the purpose of the bill—to implement the Ipp recommendations—would prevent any actions being taken or damages being awarded for personal injury and loss resulting from contravention of part V, division 1 of the TPA. We said further that there is no evidence that the TPA has been used as an avenue to bypass existing tort law. However, evidence was put forward which highlighted occasions where consumers could be faced with no avenue for redress if the bill proceeded to abolish a right of action completely under the TPA for personal injury and death. The Australian Consumers Association and the Australian Plaintiff Lawyers Association were not supportive of the bill and preferred that the Senate reject the bill outright. 
I remain to be convinced that this legislation is remotely needed. I will listen to the debate and participate in the committee stage of the debate of the amendments that are before us. But I advise both the government and the opposition that, at this stage, it is my intention to recommend to my party room that we oppose the bill unless my views alter. I would do so because I, and we, believe that the whole campaign to address insurance provisions and damages provisions at law in both the state and the federal arena has often been predicated on insufficient evidence and balance. We think it has been dedicated primarily to restoring the profitability of insurance companies and not to reducing the costs of claims or indeed the restrictive conditions under which many insurance policies operate.
We have seen and debated in the Senate countless examples of people who have never had a claim in decades of operating their business, charitable and sporting activities. We have seen those people's premiums escalate enormously. There has been no quid pro quo. No state or federal government and no minister anywhere in Australia has secured a quid pro quo from the insurance industry. They introduce these reforms, these restraints on consumer and human rights, and in return the insurance industry should actually deliver lower cost premiums and broader provisions in their policies. In fact, the whole exercise has resulted in less access at law and much more profitability to the industry.
That does not mean to say that we are troglodytes. It does not mean to say that we do not recognise that you need to reform the law to ensure bludgers and chancers cannot take advantage of it, but that is why you have judges. That is what jurisprudence is about. That is why you have the whole process of evidence and fact to work through. By and large, Australia, with some peculiar case exceptions, has not been subject to the extraordinary problems that you might expect from some of the hyperbole that I have seen printed and published. In fact, if we have to look at the prime causes of problems in the insurance industry in this country, they most of all relate to the greed of corporate bureaucrats, the mismanagement of major insurance companies and the inability to properly assess risk. They have very little to do with inadequacies in tort or any other law.
The Democrats do not believe that forum shopping has occurred to any extent. We do not believe that the early signs are there that there is going to be a flood of forum shopping resulting from the fact that the Commonwealth law, at least within the Trade Practices Act, remains a little more open and accessible to damages claims than do the tightened state laws. We do not believe that there has been sufficient justification for the large-scale limitations that have been placed on individuals' ability to take legal action in the state law. We do not believe that those state decisions, which we think have been overkill and an overreaction, should be reflected in Commonwealth law at all. You will gather from my remarks that we are not particularly excited about, interested in or pleased by the legislation that is before us. As I said at the outset, subject to what I hear in the debate and the committee process, it is my intention to recommend to my colleagues that we consider opposing the bill outright at the third reading. ",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INJURIES AND DEATH) BILL (NO. 2) 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-05-11,"—I wish to address just one aspect of the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill (No. 2) 2004, and that is that the changes proposed in this bill, whether they were intended or not, will have the very serious effect of limiting the opportunity in Australia for suing the tobacco industry. I am grateful to the Cancer Council of Victoria for their submission, which very clearly outlines the dangers associated with this legislation for action against tobacco companies. In their submission to the inquiry into the proposed legislation they say:
The Bill imposes limits on personal injury damages for non-economic loss (Division 3) on personal injury damages for loss of earning capacity ... and on personal injury damages for gratuitous attendant care services ... provides that no exemplary or aggravated damages may be awarded in respect of death or personal injury ... and introduces new limitation periods.
It is that last point that I most want to draw the Senate's attention to. The effect of the limits on damages and removal of exemplary or aggravated damages is obvious. Again, in the view of the Cancer Council of Victoria:
... there are no policy justifications for such changes insofar as they would apply to claims against the tobacco industry—there are no public liability insurance issues.
But the new limitation periods are very significant. Under the proposal, no claim could be brought more than 12 years following an act or an omission alleged to have caused death or disease—the so-called long-stop period—unless the period is extended by a court. Given that tobacco related disease invariably involves a long latency period, virtually no claim could be brought against the tobacco industry for tobacco related disease without the prior permission of the court. This requirement would deliver an enormous benefit to the tobacco industry.
I would be very surprised if either the Labor Party or the government thought that this was reasonable or that this was, on the part of the government, an intended outcome. This bill is supposed to be about the cost and availability of public liability insurance, not giving the tobacco industry protection against individuals or indeed the government in taking action to recover the many billions of dollars that smoking costs in health effects alone. The regulation impact statement to the first bill says:
The purpose of the Review was to assist governments to address the issue of increasing premiums for, and reduced availability of, public liability insurance. The government has acted to ensure that small business, community groups, sporting groups, recreational service providers and the like can continue to organise public events and conduct their activities.
Without giving a view about the value or otherwise of this bill—as Senator Murray indicates, we will listen to this debate—I think it is fair to say that the Democrats are very much opposed to this bill being used to give the tobacco industry a way out. The tobacco industry does not, of course, hold public liability insurance. Unlike playing football or holding a street stall, smoking is a very dangerous, life-threatening and highly addictive activity. In the United States the tobacco industry agreed to pay the US states around $US246 billion over 25 years from 1998 as result of litigation and, as I understand it, the United States Federal Justice Department is now taking steps to recover even more costs. 
The Democrats would like to see the industry sued in this country, too, for its misleading, deceptive and unconscionable behaviour, for lying to smokers about the harmful effects of its product—taken as directed, I might say—and for plying its product to children. We have pressed the ACCC to take action here very aggressively. The response has been, `We can't afford the legal costs.' If a government agency cannot afford to take legal action against the tobacco industry, then individuals are certainly not going to be able to, even though some have tried and with some success. Of course, the government's reluctance to empower the ACCC through funding is a great disappointment, given that smoking already costs an estimated $670 million a year in smoking related diseases, and that is just in our health system.
Our smoking rates have plateaued after dropping to just under 20 per cent of the population, but 19,000 people still die each year from smoking related disease and many of these people were addicted well before there were warnings on packs and when tobacco companies were allowed to advertise their product. Today there are still people who falsely believe that smoking a mild or a light brand of cigarette will protect their health. The industry continues to deceive consumers. There are still people who were harmed when they were exposed to smoking in utero and as children when smoking was not banned in most public spaces. There are still people who work in hotels and clubs who are being exposed regularly and who inhale other people's smoke. People are taking up smoking at a younger and younger age and more young women are becoming addicted than ever before. The tobacco industry has, in our view, much to answer for and most definitely should not be let off the hook with this legislation. The states have recognised this and it is good that the ALP has drafted an amendment which would exempt tobacco companies. The states have done similarly. They have introduced legislation for the same purpose, but they have excluded tobacco from its reach.
The Cancer Council of Victoria's submission to the bill points out the government's concern that, in the absence of the proposed changes to the Trade Practices Act, the changes to state laws which address public liability insurance problems could be undermined by resort to the act. In fact, the explanatory memorandum for the first bill says:
The Review's recommendations were formulated to ensure that the TPA could not be used to undermine any State and Territory laws in relation to claims for damages for personal injuries or death.
In New South Wales, section 3B(1)(c) of the Civil Liability Act 2002 provides that the act does not apply in respect of:
... civil liability relating to an award of personal injury damages (within the meaning of Part 2) where the injury or death concerned resulted from smoking or other use of tobacco products ...
In Victoria, actions or claims for damages in respect of an injury resulting from smoking or other use of tobacco products or exposure to tobacco smoke are excluded from several parts of the revised Wrongs Act 1958.
In Queensland, section 5(c) of the Civil Liability Act 2003 provides:
This Act does not apply in relation to any civil claim for damages for personal injury if the harm resulting from the breach of duty owed to the claimant is or includes—
	...	...	...
(c) an injury resulting from smoking or other use of tobacco products or exposure to tobacco smoke.
In WA, the Civil Liability Act 2002, as substantially amended by the Civil Liability Amendment Act 2003, again excludes `damages relating to personal injury that resulted from smoking or other use of tobacco products' from several provisions of that act. In Tasmania, section 3B(1)(b) of the Civil Liability Act 2002 provides that the act does not apply to or in respect of civil liability `relating to an award of damages for personal injury or death where the injury or death concerned resulted from smoking or other use of tobacco products'. 
To be absolutely certain that the Trade Practices Act does not undermine those state laws, it is critically important that an amendment is passed in this place and that it is accepted by the government when that goes to the House of Representatives. It would be useful if the minister could indicate if that will be agreed to. To conclude, the Cancer Council of Victoria's submission says:
... if either or both of the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2003 and the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill (No. 2) 2004—
the one we are dealing with here today—
are passed, they ought to be amended so as not to apply to claims arising out of the use of tobacco products. The policy justifications for the proposed changes do not apply in the context of claims against the tobacco industry. Further, given the scale of the harm caused by tobacco both to individuals and to the community, the effect of legislation making litigation against the tobacco industry more difficult may be to fix the community with substantial costs that might otherwise be paid by the tobacco industry and to weaken the role of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth) in regulating the conduct of the tobacco industry.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INJURIES AND DEATH) BILL (NO. 2) 2004</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,1,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2004-05-11,"—I thank honourable senators for their contributions on this important bill, the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill (No. 2) 2004. As the Senate is aware, this bill is part of the national framework to support state and territory reforms to the law of negligence. The approach being taken was developed as a result of extensive consultation and hard work by Australian state and territory governments. It is not the sole initiative of this government but is widely supported by all other governments in Australia, industry and the community more broadly.
The reforms, as I have said, are supported by all jurisdictions and have in fact been applauded not only in Australia but also overseas and in particular by underwriters. As a result, we have seen some capacity come back into the market. In fact, reforms undertaken to implement this framework have begun to make liability insurance more affordable and available to community groups and businesses Australia wide. There was a recent initiative with community care in Australia with major insurers underwriting the availability of insurance to community groups. Indeed, there are other examples that I will get to in the course of the debate.
There is no doubt that Australia was facing a liability insurance market where the cost of cover was rising at the same time as policies were becoming harder and harder to obtain. Some community groups and small businesses in particular simply could not obtain insurance at any price. Since then this government has worked very diligently with state and territory ministers and key stakeholders to develop a national resolution. The bill before the Senate today is a key component in implementing this resolution.
It did not arise out of some fanciful notion of governments or stakeholders. The bill draws on the findings of an expert panel established at the May 2002 ministerial meeting on public liability insurance, chaired by the Hon. Justice David Ipp of the New South Wales Court of Appeal. The panel was established to assist the Australian government and state and territory governments to formulate as far as we could a consistent and principled approach to reforming liability laws. The review concluded that in many cases a cause of action under the act that we are dealing with today—that is, the Trade Practices Act—is a real alternative to a cause of action in negligence. 
Vital reforms by the states and territories of common law negligence could be undermined unless the Commonwealth made complementary changes to the act. We have already seen repeated evidence of this happening. I have already raised with the Senate a couple of cases—at least, I have now raised three cases privately with colleagues—that I have become aware of in the course of this debate over the past weeks and months in the Senate. Those familiar with the impact of law reform in other areas advise me that it generally takes two or more years before the full impact of such loopholes becomes apparent.
These reforms are not the kinds of reforms that are like turning on an electric light, where you get some immediate and measurable response. It takes some time for actuarial certainty to flow through to the way in which risks are assessed and to the way actuaries predict the costs of claims. It would be simply flying in the face of both history and experience for the Senate and indeed for my colleagues, I would have thought, to argue that there is no need to fix an obvious loophole that we now recognise until well after it has been fully exploited. That is what has happened in the past. It is really tantamount to arguing that there is no need to shut a gate before a horse bolts when the horse is standing there ready to go. The risk is already identified and well known.
The expert review clearly and deliberately recommended that the act be amended to prevent claims from being brought forward for personal injury and death under division 1 of part V and to apply rules relating to the quantum of damages and limitation periods to other sections of the act. I am happy to report to the Senate that the state reforms do appear to be working. Australian state and territory governments who have taken action to implement key recommendations of the review now have something to show for our efforts. In the Age this morning there was a story by law reporter Fergus Shiel showing how effective the reforms have been in Victoria. Mr Shiel wrote that `personal injury claims have plummeted' since the introduction of reforms in that state, with the number of personal injury writs down from 4,513 to 60. The problem is we already know this kind of improvement will not be sustained, nor will it be sustainable unless the Trade Practices Act is adequately amended to support the state reforms.
I want to deal very briefly with the differences between the two bills that the Senate has been asked to consider. The Australian government has introduced the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2003. When enacted by this parliament the bill will prevent claims being brought forward for personal injury and death under division 1 of part V. The bill we are actually debating today, the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill (No. 2) 2004, continues this reform agenda and, specifically, will implement recommendations 17 and 21 of the Ipp review. These recommended that the act be amended to apply rules relating to limitation of actions and quantum of damages to personal injury and death claims brought pursuant to an unconscionable conduct claim, which is part IVA; a contravention of the product safety and information provisions, which is division 1A of part V; a supply by a manufacturer or importer of unsatisfactory consumer goods, which is division 2A of part V; or a supply by a manufacturer or importer of defective goods, which is part IVA. 
The approach in this bill of limiting the quantum of damages and establishing a new limitation arrangement for personal injuries and death claims can be distinguished from that taken in the first bill, the Trade Practices Amendment (Personal Injuries and Death) Bill 2003 which prevents claims for damages for personal injuries and death under part V, division 1 of the act. The approach taken in the first government bill reflects the view that the Trade Practices Act was not originally intended to provide causes of action to individuals who suffer personal injury and death as a result of misleading and deceptive conduct in the absence of an element of fault. And that is the nub of the matter—in the absence of an element of fault. Allowing claims to be made under the Trade Practices Act in these circumstances sets it aside from regimes where fault is required, such as those in the state and territory governments. Obviously, if they are not aligned one will undermine the other. 
By contrast, the second government bill takes into account parliament's intent that the provisions relating to product safety and information, claims against manufacturers and importers of goods, and product liability should provide a cause of action to individuals who do suffer personal injury and death. There is a very clear difference in intent. Moreover, it is not necessary to remove personal injury and death claims under part IVA as the element of fault required under these provisions will limit the potential for personal injury and death claims and, in fact, will be aligned with the state and territory tort law regimes on fault.
The government agrees with the Ipp review that limitation on actions and quantum of damages should apply to personal injury and death claims under these parts of the Trade Practices Act. The review panel made a number of specific recommendations on the nature of the limitation periods and quantum of damages that should apply for different heads of damage in relation to personal injury and death claims across all jurisdictions. The bill being debated today will introduce a number of review measures into a new part VIB of the Trade Practices Act. Part VIB will apply these measures to personal injury and death claims brought pursuant to an unconscionable conduct claim, a contravention of the product safety and information provisions, a supply by a manufacturer or importer of unsatisfactory consumer goods or a supply by a manufacturer or importer of defective goods. So there is no suggestion that the government is not cognisant, where parliament intended to provide an action for personal injury and death in relation to certain parts of the act, that they should remain.
Part VIB will establish new limitation periods for claims and thresholds and caps on awards for various heads of damage. The bill will provide a framework for phasing in damages for non-economic loss depending on the severity of an injury, a mechanism for calculating damages for loss of earning capacity and for gratuitous attendant care services. The bill will also introduce a number of other limits on personal injury damages and will clarify the powers of courts in relevant proceedings to approve structured settlements, which is an earlier reform of this government that was supported in the Senate.
The government have chosen to incorporate the review's specific recommendations on limitation periods and quantum of damages into the act rather than referring the courts to the relevant state or territory legislation which, we have come to the view, would be much more complex. This approach, which has the support of other jurisdictions and industry, provides a clear and transparent national benchmark for the limitation of actions and quantum of damages in personal injury and death claims. National benchmarks on these matters will facilitate the implementation of nationally consistent reforms giving effect to the resolutions developed and agreed to by ministers. This approach will provide greater certainty and reduced complexity for insurers and underwriters and minimise the incentive for jurisdiction-shopping behaviour by plaintiffs—because it will not make any difference where you bring your action—whilst maintaining remedies for plaintiffs injured in actionable circumstances. 
In the course of the debate—and I may not have heard all of it—there was a return to a suggestion that insurer profits were really what these reforms were all about, rather than a nationally consistent scheme that will bring the balance back into the way in which risk is allocated and the way in which people are compensated for injuries. On the issue of insurer profits, there are some very important points that I think need to be made. The first is that a profitable insurance sector is absolutely vital for the wellbeing of Australia. If we do not have an insurance sector that is not going to be prey to the kind of problem that HIH faced, we in Australia are not going to be able to allocate and shift risk in the kinds of activities that we conduct, whether they be community activities or large commercial undertakings.
To talk about insurance companies making a profit as if it is some kind of terrible wrong is quite an unsustainable proposition. An insurance sector unable to make a profit is extremely bad news for any community and can lead to withdrawal of capital at best and the failure of companies leaving policyholders high and dry and uncompensated at worst. It is also important to remember that insurance company profits have grown from a very low base—in some cases from significant net losses—and that profits have been at an unsustainably low level for several years. Underwriting profits have been rare for insurers in recent years and when compared to other financial sector operations their return on capital has hardly been outstanding. According to a recent press report that came to my attention, Australia's general insurance providers have achieved a return on equity above 10 per cent only three times since 1994. In the same period the major banks have consistently achieved a return on equity in excess of 15 per cent. But insurance will only be available while investors are willing to provide capital to the industry in the expectation of reasonable returns.
Another point that the Senate should have regard to is that, based on information provided by the Insurance Council of Australia, public liability represents only six per cent of total premium income, which puts the lie to the argument of those trying to directly link law reform to bottom-line profits. However, there is no doubt that the reforms have made public liability insurance more profitable as a line and attracted new capital to the market. Again I would remind the Senate that that is a good outcome for consumers. Just today in the Australian Financial Review there is a report of a plunge in insurance shares because of the pressure on premiums from increased competition. Increased competition is exactly what is needed in this market in the best interests of all Australians, and exactly what the reforms are delivering.
It is extremely disappointing that the Labor Party—I will leave the Democrats out of this—has after some years of virtual silence on this issue now jumped up at the last minute attempting to derail the reforms and please its supporters, no doubt, in some other sectors of the community. Those opposite really do need to be thinking about the interests of the community as a whole.
There was a reference during the debate to the fact that there was no evidence to support the Ipp review's claim that there was no intent in section 52 to allow personal injuries claims. Once again I draw to the Senate's attention the fact that the High Court, in Concrete Constructions against Nelson, held that section 52 was never intended by the parliament to extend to all conduct regardless of its nature, and there is no evidence that I can divine from looking at the parliamentary debates that parliament intended that section 52 extend to cover personal injury and death claims. I suspect that the High Court in the fullness of time, in the absence of this legislation getting through the Senate and putting it beyond doubt, will eventually be asked to affirm this view in the application of section 52 to personal injury claims. 
There are a couple of foreshadowed amendments. In respect of what we might loosely call the `tobacco amendment', I am quite frankly astonished that, although the bill has been before the parliament since 19 February and passed the House on 25 March, Labor, which has foreshadowed the amendment, chose not to circulate its proposed amendment to the government for consideration until I literally got to my feet. I know that from time to time there are comments made about lack of courtesy on the part of the government, but if there was any serious intent on the part of both the Democrats and Labor for the government to have an opportunity to consider this amendment surely it should have been provided in a more timely way. It might have got some support. As it is, it is far too precipitous for me to form a view on my feet as to the desirability of this amendment. As I have said, one would think that if Labor were seriously interested in amending the bill to constructively improve the law—and I acknowledge that that could be possible—it would discuss or at least inform the government of its plans to make amendments.
Without any time to consider this amendment the government is put in a very difficult position by being asked to consider it. The government's amendments were recommended by an expert panel, discussed with states and territories, publicly announced and released and have had a lengthy consideration by the parliament. At least nobody is coming to consider the government's amendments unprepared.
I can say a bit about the existing law reform. On the substance of the amendments that Labor and the Democrats are seeking for special arrangements to be included for individuals who have sustained tobacco related injuries, there may be, as I have said, some basis to consider it. I am no fan of tobacco, I might say. I note that New South Wales has provided a specific exemption from the New South Wales Civil Liability Act 2002 in relation to the award of personal injury damages where the injury or death results from smoking or the use of tobacco products. Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania have some exclusions. Exemptions of this nature are fundamentally civil liability issues and appropriately matters for state and territory law. On the face of it they are not matters for the Commonwealth and the TPA. As I have said, the bill we are debating today introduces national benchmarks on quantum and limitation of actions, and these arrangements will introduce a cap and threshold for the award of general damages. They will not have any effect on the recovery of a variety of other expenses, such as medical expenses.
Back to the main game of today, which is that I am asking the Senate to pass the government's bill, the proposed amendments to the act close a loophole that has been well identified. It is one where there is only a trickle but there will be a flood. Anyone with any familiarity at all with the practice of an actuary will tell you that that is sufficient to have a deleterious and damaging effect on the ability of these very sensible reforms to take effect in the way in which parliament intended.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2004-05-11,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Hill) to questions without notice asked today relating to abuses of human rights of Iraqi prisoners.
The monstrous treatment of Iraqi prisoners that we have seen on our television sets and in newspapers and the mass media since CBS TV broke the story on Thursday, 30 April has been appalling to all fair-minded and decent people. We have to ask the question: what is the significance of these shocking revelations? I think that on the personal level we feel for the fellow human beings who have been made to suffer and, in some cases, die as a result of this appalling and degrading treatment. We feel for their families. We also feel revulsion that US and British uniformed personnel—or, indeed, anyone—could be capable of such acts. 
We must also, I believe, be very concerned about the damage these acts have already caused to the United States and broader Western interests. This damage goes far beyond the impact on the situation in Iraq. It will be felt around the world. This behaviour will fuel the hatred that motivates terrorists. It will reinforce the flawed rationale that they use to justify their acts. It will help them recruit others to the cause. It will add to the ranks of the suicide bombers. It will help them persuade the populations of Islamic countries that their cause is just, that the West is decadent and that it is indeed anti-Islamic. These abuses are of the utmost seriousness, and they must be treated as such. There can be no question that they warrant the resignation of the US Secretary of Defense, Donald Rumsfeld. The more he digs in, the more it will exacerbate the damage that has been done.
The Australian government has to lift its game as well. It is not good enough that today here in question time Senator Hill was unable to explain when and how he first became aware of these abuses, why we were not told of these abuses earlier than we were and what action the government took in response. We have a broad responsibility for all Iraqi prisoners as an occupying power and specific responsibility for the prisoners captured by Australian troops under the Geneva convention. To say that those responsible for these atrocities have let Australia and Australian troops down by their actions is, I think, an understatement. But the government's see-no-evil attitude has let our troops down further. Foreign Minister Downer has said disingenuously that he was aware of the matter in January. Senator Hill was unable to tell us in the Senate today when he was informed of the report of the International Committee of the Red Cross. He has told us that Defence was made aware of this in February but, when asked three or four times in question time today, Senator Hill would not tell the Australian people, would not tell the Senate, when he became aware of this report. That is not good enough.
It stands in stark contrast to what he has told the public on the ABC. Perhaps he was not willing to mislead the parliament and completely expose the fact that if he told the truth here he would stand exposed on what he said on the mass media. It is a totally unbelievable situation. The government, all of us, owe it to the prisoners and owe it to the troops that captured the prisoners to ensure that the Geneva convention has squarely been applied— (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Iraq: Treatment of Prisoners</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2004-05-11,"—Senator Faulkner talks about Australia's responsibility under the Geneva Convention in relation to this matter, implying that in some way Australia is at fault. I made the point during question time that the prisons in Iraq are not run by Australians. The interrogation of prisoners in Iraq is not carried out by Australians. There is no suggestion here that any Australian has misbehaved in relation to these allegations, so why Senator Faulkner wants to drag Australia into this unfortunate circumstance is beyond me—unless, of course, he sees some short-term political benefit in it.
In actual fact the government are also appalled by these events. We are appalled by what we have seen on the television in the last couple of weeks and what we have seen and read in the newspapers. But, our having been appalled, the issue then is whether those who are at fault are taking appropriate action. It seems to us that they are. You can trace this right back to January, when the Pentagon put out a statement. Evidence of alleged abuses was brought before the US administration, those abuses were investigated and those at fault were prosecuted. As has been said by the US administration, if others are found to have abused they will be prosecuted as well. The British government has said exactly the same thing, and of course that is the appropriate response. 
To say the very least, it is unfortunate that what seems to be a small number of individuals have caused considerable damage to the standing of the United States and, to some extent, the United Kingdom. They have caused some damage to the standing of their military forces, which is most unfortunate because their military forces are pledged to uphold, and do uphold, the highest values and standards. Nevertheless, poor behaviour has occurred and it is being responded to appropriately. Not only have the US and Britain acted in relation to the specific allegations but also, as I said in question time, my advice was that when the International Committee of the Red Cross brought to the attention of the occupying powers and to Mr Bremer as head of the CPA that its investigations had indicated problems with the detention system that should be addressed, the report was received positively by Sir Jeremy Greenstock, by General Sanchez and by Mr Bremer and actions were immediately instituted to revise the way in which prisoners were treated within the military jails of Iraq. So, whether those governments are acting on allegations against individuals who should be prosecuted or on allegations of a broader nature about standards that the International Committee of the Red Cross does not regard as satisfactory, that has been responded to positively.
What I regret, apart from the terrible things that have occurred to certain individuals, is the fact that this has significantly undermined the values that we are seeking to take to Iraq. We may have been in Iraq primarily to address the issue of weapons of mass destruction and the threats associated with those but we also wanted the benefit of removing a tyrant whose human rights abuses against the Iraqi people are legendary, including hundreds of thousands illegally killed by him, and we wanted instead to represent a different set of values. This behaviour by a limited number of individuals has significantly diminished our case in that regard. What we need to do now of course is to make ground in nevertheless re-establishing those values to demonstrate that we are committed to helping the Iraqi people in the very difficult task of stabilising the country and passing over the responsibility of government to them.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2004-05-11,"—The minister seems unable to understand why the Labor opposition and, I think, the Australian public regard this as a serious matter for Australia. It is because we are signatories to the Geneva Convention, we take our responsibilities under the convention seriously and we take seriously the agreement that the Australian government—Senator Hill's government—signed with the US and UK governments on the treatment of prisoners captured in Iraq. That document makes it very clear that Australia has an ongoing legal and moral obligation to the prisoners captured.
We know for a fact that the SAS took at least 59 prisoners while involved in their duties inside Iraq. There is no question of accusations or charges against the ADF in this matter. There is no question that the prisoners were handed over in a short time to US or UK forces. The minister's attempt to hide behind the ADF in question time today was very poor and was reminiscent of Minister Downer's performance in the last couple of weeks. The key issue is whether or not prisoners captured by Australia have been treated properly, under the conditions of the Geneva Convention, and what this government has done to ensure that and to take those responsibilities seriously. 
It was really interesting in question time today that Minister Hill refused to answer the question about when he knew about these most serious allegations. He says they are terrible allegations about the behaviour of a few. That is yet to be determined. It is increasingly looking like a systemic problem inside the jailing system in Iraq. We have had the most outrageous allegations about rape, potential murder, assault, degradation and all sorts and forms of abuse, and I think everyone is appalled by those accusations.
These accusations have been around for a long time. Senator Hill admitted today that the government knew in January. How did they know? The Pentagon put out a press release indicating that they were investigating the incidents. Mr Downer has admitted that he knew from that date. Within a couple of days CNN detailed quite serious allegations of abuse of Iraqi prisoners. We also know from what the minister said today and from what Minister Downer said before that they were aware of the Red Cross report, which was quite damning of the treatment of prisoners, back in February of this year. The minister was not clear about whether he got a copy of that report or whether he had seen it. He was disingenuous about what he had seen and when.
I think the reason is that he went on the 7.30 Report on ABC TV on 3 May, last week, and in an interview with Kerry O'Brien basically denied knowing anything about this until such time as it was publicly revealed. I have here the relevant bits of the transcript. Senator Robert Hill, in response to a question from Kerry O'Brien, said:
If this had of come to my knowledge other than through the public domain, I would have made my inquiries and expressed my views.
But it came to me publicly and contemporaneously the response from the US authorities seemed to me to be the appropriate response.
So he did not know about it until it was aired on public television and he did not know about it until he had seen the US response. There is a range of questions in the Hansard which go to his defence and to why he did nothing, because he claims he did not know about it until just before 3 May—at the end of April or early May—when it was on public television and all through the media. This minister did not know about it.
The question you have got to ask is: why didn't Alexander Downer tell him? Is it the case that in fact the defence department did not know? We know that there was a press release from the Pentagon on 16 January. We know the minister says that Defence were aware of it. We know that the Red Cross report was known to the government in February. But here we have on 3 May the minister saying: `Well, I only found out about it when I saw it on the TV. I was shocked but I haven't done anything about it because it was obviously all being handled well by the US and I needn't worry.' This was the tone of the interview he gave to Kerry O'Brien on ABC. Today, when asked three or four times when he knew, he slid, he ducked and he dived but he would not answer the question.
He said he does not want to break with the government's position on this. We want to know, Minister, when you knew and why you did nothing about it. We know you did nothing about it; you have made that very clear. What we do not know now is when you knew. We know the government knew in January. We know the government got the Red Cross report in February. But you told Kerry O'Brien on the ABC on 3 May that you just found out and it was all a terrible surprise to you. Which is true? Were you lying then or are you lying now? They cannot both be true.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",NATS,2004-05-11,"—Like Senator Hill, I could not help but conclude from the questions today that the underlying tone was that there was an attempt by the opposition to pin some blame or some fault, no matter how indirect it may be, upon Australia's involvement with regard to these Iraqi troops. The involvement of Australia in this regard was none at all. Australia has no jurisdiction over the Iraqi prison system. Any prisoners that have come into our custody have in fact been passed over to the controlling powers, to the occupying powers. Regardless of the attempts by the opposition—their yelling and their screaming, their frantic attempts to pin some sort of fault on Australia—we utterly reject that sort of charge. Senator Faulkner came in here and said that we let our troops down with regard to this incident. Not only do we reject that but we say: what could let down our troops in Iraq more than the opposition saying that their role is nothing more than symbolic?
The treatment of the prisoners, from all those that have seen the pictures and read the articles, is to be condemned. There is absolutely no doubt that those responsible should be disciplined and punished, if not court-martialled. It has been a public relations disaster. It has been a setback, particularly in the Arab world, to the cause and the mission—to why we, as part of the coalition of the willing, went into Iraq. It was correct for the President of the United States to apologise to the Arab world and to the president of Jordan. It ought to be stated that this incident was made public by the US, before it even came to media attention. The President said it turned his stomach. So the system is working. This incident was flushed out and will be dealt with.
Listening to the questions—and, indeed, there will be an urgency motion this afternoon—you would think that the opposition were trying to draw some moral equivalence between the former regime and the existing occupying powers. We reject any moral equivalence at all. In fact the government do not back off one bit from our involvement in Iraq, from its beginning to today. We do not back off from our part in the removal of the merciless dictator Saddam Hussein, the wider cause on the war on terror and the wider cause to bring democracy to that country in the heart of the Middle East. We have already seen some knock-on effects from our involvement—that is of course with Libya itself now deciding to cooperate with the right side of the war on terror and to dismantle its weapons of mass destruction. That, fundamentally, is the difference between the approach of the government and the approach of the opposition—the pretenders to government. We will stay and finish the job; they will not. They have never been in favour of this war. They have been anti-American throughout all of this. They seize every opportunity to twist and turn and to attempt to show moral equivalence between the mission and cause of the coalition of the willing and the former regime of Saddam Hussein. We reject any moral equivalence at all.
We should not lose sight of the advances that have already been made in Iraq. Never do they come in here and tell us about the schools and universities that have been opened up, the Marshland Arabs who now have their lands back, the 200 newspapers, the water that has been resupplied, the electricity that has been resupplied, or the fact that the country is functioning better today—even as a war zone and a terrorist zone—than it was under the former regime. Never do you hear them in here talking about the advances. Never do you hear them in here talking about Amnesty International's own report on the former regime: the public beheadings of women and the rape machine that they had in operation. Rather, they try to establish a moral equivalence between the former regime and the occupying powers.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2004-05-11,"—I found Senator Hill's answers at question time today gravely disappointing. They were both inadequate and dissembling. All we got from Senator Hill was evasion and diversion instead of a proper series of answers regarding the shameful behaviour of occupying forces in Iraq. We got the usual coalition hegemony on patriotism, and we have just heard it again from Senator McGauran here: only they are supporting our armed forces overseas. Both Senator Hill and now Senator McGauran went on to imply that Labor is linking the brutal treatment of prisoners with our own armed forces. Nothing could be further from the truth—absolutely untrue. What a strawman argument this is; what a pathetic diversion. We are interested in what action the government took: not what our defence forces did but what action and what reaction to these events the government took.
The treatment of prisoners in Iraq becomes critical when we revisit the reasons for intervention in that country. Paramount amongst the arguments for intervention was Iraq's possession of WMD. Of course, none can be found. Indeed even the arguments for a WMD program are now highly suspect. The second proposition was that Iraq was linked to international terrorist groups, although no evidence was produced at the time and certainly none has been found since. You will notice that no-one mentions that as a reason. There is a third reason: we are now reliant for justification of the intervention in Iraq on the regime change rationale. That is something that the US and the UK put up front at the start. Our government rejected it outright. They only adopted the regime change argument in retrospect when the other two main justifications for intervention disappeared. For regime change to work it must be based not only on creating a new democratic Iraq but also on the example offered by the occupying powers—and occupation is never easy. The widespread publicity of the prisoner abuse has probably spawned more terrorists in the Middle East than any other particular episode that has occurred. This is made worse as the image of cover-up and lack of transparency continues.
It seems from the answers given today that the Australian government has washed its hands of the issue. There is no need for such a toadying response. We can support, as an international citizen, various acts in Iraq for the good but we can remain in a position to critique faults. Why not? We do not have to be silent on faults. We can critique them. The major fault here was not applying the Geneva Convention to either Guantanamo Bay or in fact to Iraq. You did not have to grant prisoners Geneva Convention status; all you had to do was say, `The provisions of the Geneva Convention will apply to these prisoners'—a quite separate concept—and none of these events could have occurred.
The second big problem is the use of contractors—something we do not generally do but something that the Americans have done to make up for shortfalls in their armed services—and here there is very little control. It seems, and I cannot rush to judgment yet, that a lot of the problems that have occurred in Iraq are to do with uniformed personnel responding to the directions of civilian contractors employed by either the Department of Defense in the US or the CIA. 
This government reacted very badly when we pointed out there were certain analogies with Vietnam. I do not think they understood that what we are talking about is the psychology of the Iraqis. Unfortunately, they are adopting a psychology similar to that of many Vietnamese. Instead of this becoming a debate about ideology, it becomes a debate about national liberation. I must say Australia trains its interrogators really well. I saw them in action as late as last Friday training our interrogators. The Geneva Convention applies. All practise interrogations are videoed. There is a doctor, a psychologist and a supervisor always available and observing these things. I hope that training will stand us in good stead well into the future. We do not want the defence minister at question time to look puzzled or defensive or confused on this issue, as he did today. There are moral imperatives here, and what a pity Minister Hill has not risen to the occasion.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2004-05-11,"—I wish to speak on this motion to take note of answers concerning Iraq and I also refer to the fact that Senator Bartlett asked similar questions on behalf of the Democrats today. I join with the Labor Party colleagues who have made comments on this issue, I totally endorse the references to international humanitarian law made by Senator Ray and, as honourable senators would be aware, for this afternoon the Democrats have initiated an urgency debate on this issue. We think one of the most important aspects of this prisoner abuse and torture scandal as far as the federal parliament is concerned is Australia's involvement in the war in Iraq and whether or not we accept responsibility for the atrocities that have occurred under the occupying powers. We will no doubt discuss this further in the urgency debate, but the Democrats strongly believe that our country has a legal and moral obligation to ensure that individuals who are detained under the occupying forces in Iraq are treated with respect for their persons, their honour, their family rights and their religious convictions, practices, manners and customs. We call on the government to ensure that this is the case and to take responsibility for its role. But the government's response so far to the allegations of prisoner abuse has revealed that this government has no consistent story, and again we heard evidence of this in question time today. We have a government that is prepared to say anything to cover its back in relation to this issue.
Looking over the comments made in recent days by the Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, it seems that all of them have different takes on whether or not Australia is indeed an occupying power in Iraq at all. Then there is the issue, highlighted in question time today, as to when the government first became aware of the allegations of prisoner abuse. The Minister for Defence claims that he first became aware of the allegations when he saw the images in the media a few weeks ago, but the foreign affairs minister says that he was aware of the allegations as early as February. There is also evidence coming to light that our Prime Minister may have been aware months ago of evidence provided by Amnesty International that Iraqi prisoners were being abused. The only thing clear in our government's handling of this issue is that confusion reigns. There is no clear evidence of what this government knew and when.
In the criminal justice system, inconsistent stories are interpreted as evidence of lies. The Democrats believe that continuing overwhelming inconsistencies in the statements of different government ministers suggest that, once again, this government is not giving us the entire story. The Australian community has every right to be outraged, angered and saddened, but are we really surprised? Are we really surprised by what happens in war? The only thing that seems to be liberated in war is the worst aspect of human nature, and that includes torturers liberated in war. This is no less the case if the rationale for going to war is to actually stop torture in the first place. In a civilised society there can be no ifs and no buts about the issue of torture. 
Why does the Prime Minister think people went to the streets to protest against war in the first place? We were not quibbling about a few tanks or a few bombs; people protesting against the war were protesting against torture, depravity and all the things that go with it because war always involves torture. War, once embarked upon—with troops at risk and patriotism the big issue—always justifies extreme measures, and torture is one of them. If people do not believe that we have heard excuses, they should listen to Rumsfeld, Gingrich or any of the other apologists. In the last few days they have presented torture as a blip, as the exception. This is an argument that is not good enough because it involves shirking responsibility. If you can abdicate responsibility for a teeny-weeny blip then you can abdicate responsibility for everything that is done in war.
All wars potentially licence evil and liberate the worst in humankind. Those who go to war, those who lead us into war—and, most particularly, those who give us spurious reasons for war—have to take responsibility for what happens in war. There are no buts about it. The images are shocking, depraved and shameful; full stop. There are no buts in this case. They are the consequence of the decision to go to war and our government, as well as other coalition partners, have to acknowledge that. That is exactly what we will be talking about in the urgency debate. It is time this government stopped trying to cover up their own actions and evidence. It is about time they took responsibility as an occupying power, as any other nation involved in this conflict must do.

"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-05-11,"—I move:
That, in the opinion of the Senate the following is a matter of urgency:
The need for the Senate to:
(a)	express its unequivocal opposition to the abuse of persons, including those classified as enemy combatants, in United States (US) detention in Iraq;
(b)	express the view that, given Australia's military participation in the invasion of Iraq, Australia has a legal and moral obligation to ensure that individuals detained by the occupying forces in Iraq are treated with respect for their persons, their honour, their family rights, their religious convictions and practices, their manners and customs;
(c)	call upon the US to at all times treat detainees humanely and provide them with protection, especially against all acts of violence or threats thereof and against insults and public curiosity;
(d)	call upon the US to bring to immediate justice any member of the armed forces who has violated the rights of persons in US detention in Iraq; and
(e)	call upon the Australian Government to immediately cease negotiations with the US for an `Article 98 Agreement' under the Rome Statute, requiring Australia not to surrender US citizens suspected of committing crimes against humanity, to the International Criminal Court for prosecution.
The budget is being handed down tonight and the budget lock-up is taking place, which gives people an opportunity to scrutinise the budget in detail. I have chosen not to go into that at this stage because I believe this matter is extremely urgent and of absolute importance. The Democrats believe the Senate, representing the people of Australia, must take the first available opportunity to formally condemn the abuse, torture and mistreatment of Iraqis detained by the occupying forces in that country. We cannot pretend that we have no responsibility for what is happening in that country. It is a very serious matter, so let us not encounter during this debate the usual smokescreens that this is just some form of anti-Americanism, that this represents some support for Saddam, that this is rerunning the debate on whether we should have gone to war or, even worse, that this is some sort of attack on Australian soldiers. 
On this issue, it does not matter whether you were in favour of or against the war; that has happened for worse or for better—or, some might say, a mix of both. Let us not forget, though, that in addition to this incident over 10,000 people have died as a direct consequence of that war and that they continue to die every day. We, as a country that has forces in Iraq playing a role—we all know that; it has been the subject of extensive debate—are involved in capturing Iraqis and handing them over to our coalition partners for imprisonment. We must therefore ensure that we fulfil our direct responsibility to see that those people are treated properly. Frankly, I just could not believe Senator Hill in question time today suggesting that it was none of our business, that we had no responsibility for what happened to people after we handed them over. That is absurd just as basic decency, let alone in terms of obligations under international law or basic moral obligations.
We must send a clear signal as a house of parliament that we as a nation condemn this sort of treatment of prisoners unequivocally. We owe it to the Iraqi people whose country we have invaded, allegedly on the basis of liberating them. We owe it, even more importantly, to our own defence personnel who are there in Iraq as well as to those who are part of the broader Australian armed forces, so that they know their parliament will say unequivocally, `We will have no truck with this sort of behaviour.' We owe it indeed to the world as a whole to send a clear message, as a sovereign house of parliament, that we will defend and support the rule of law, because that is underlying all of this debate. We have a commitment to law and that commitment must be upheld. We must condemn this behaviour, we must ensure it does not happen again, we must ensure it is not widespread or endemic. It must be properly and openly investigated. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Iraq: Treatment of Prisoners</title>,Matters of Urgency,17,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2004-05-11,"—The opposition will be supporting the urgency motion. What has happened in Abu Ghraib prison is tragic; it is disgusting and it is unforgivable. It has completely undermined the whole Iraq campaign. Those Iraqis who may have been inclined to place their trust in the occupying powers to bring democracy to their battered and suffering country will have great difficulty now, given the gross breaches of human rights and of Islamic law and custom. The democracy espoused by the United States and the other occupying powers has been tarnished. The photos of the naked Iraqi man about to have dogs unleashed on him bring those responsible closer to the moral trough inhabited by Saddam Hussein.
I would like to retrace the emergence of this scandal. On 16 January the US military confirmed that an investigation into allegations of detainee abuse by 17 soldiers at Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad was initiated on 14 January. CNN reported the allegations included: `US military reportedly posing for photographs with partially unclothed Iraqi prisoners' at Abu Ghraib. Three weeks ago, on 28 April, CBS TV revealed photos of US military police stacking naked Iraqi prisoners in a human pyramid, performing simulated sex and with wires positioned that appear to suggest a detainee will be electrocuted if he moves. 
On 3 May a 53-page report by Major General Taguba for Lieutenant General Sanchez was leaked to the New Yorker. It was finished in February and kept secret in the Pentagon. It appears to have been initiated after a US guard turned whistleblower. It reveals numerous instances from October to December 2003 of `sadistic, blatant and wanton criminal abuses'. It further reveals abuses committed by US military police, US intelligence officers and private military contractors. It also notes that a military investigation in November 2003 found `no military police units purposely applying inappropriate confinement practices'. Six days after the release of the photos, on 5 May, Mr Howard made his first public comment:
I condemn that behaviour absolutely and unconditionally.
He failed to comment on Australia's obligations as an occupying power. On 7 May the International Red Cross revealed it had repeatedly complained to the US about the abuse of Iraqi prisoners by US troops throughout 2003. The Pentagon also admitted that at least 10 suspicious deaths of POWs in Afghanistan and Iraq are being investigated. The US Army said it was investigating possible abuses of 42 Iraqi civilians and 35 POWs.
On 9 May one of the seven US soldiers charged with abusing Iraqi prisoners, military police officer Sabrina Harman, said she was acting under direct orders from military intelligence to `make it hell' for inmates before interrogation. Secretary Rumsfeld was in denial. Seymour Hersh in this week's New Yorker stated:
... when Mr Rumsfeld was asked whether the photographs and stories from Abu Ghraib were a setback, he said, `Oh I'm not one for instant history'. By Friday however, with some members of Congress and with editorials calling for his resignation, Rumsfeld testified at length before the Senate and House Committees and apologised for what he said was fundamentally `un-American' ... Rumsfeld said he had not actually looked at any of the Abu Ghraib photographs until some of them appeared in press accounts, and had not reviewed the army's copies until the day before.
Senator Hill's response was similar: that he had only become aware of the situation when press reports appeared. Today he has clarified that what he meant was that he had first seen the photographs when the press reports appeared. He will not say when he first learnt about these abuses. He will not front up and say that.
Foreign Minister Downer has said Australia has no legal responsibility for any of the POWs in Iraq, including those captured by Australia. This completely ignores the fact that Australia, as one of the occupying powers, has obligations towards Iraqi prisoners in general and those taken captive by Australian forces in particular. We know, from Senate estimates, that the SAS was successful in capturing prisoners. All up, Australian troops captured more than 100 Iraqis. Exactly how many we do not know. The obligations for the protection of prisoners are outlined in the third Geneva convention and in the 1977 first optional protocol to the fourth Geneva convention. Article 3 prohibits occupying powers from allowing acts which constitute `outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment'. Furthermore, articles 129 to 131 outline the sanctions to be applied to any grave breach of the convention. John Howard reluctantly stated on 17 April 2003:
We—
that is, Australia—
have the obligation of an occupying power under the Geneva Convention. We, along with the Americans and the British have responsibilities, certainly, and we won't neglect those responsibilities. 
Mr Howard has tried for months to weasel his way out of occupying power status by pointing to the United Nations naming only the US and the UK in UN resolution 1483. But legally this does not wash. Australia's occupying power status is defined by the fact of our invasion and the fact of our continuing military occupation of Iraq—facts which give effect to our obligations under The Hague and Geneva conventions. Mr Howard cannot seriously use a Security Council resolution which turns a blind eye to Australia's involvement in the invasion and occupation.
United Nations Security Council resolution 1483 does not purport to be an exhaustive list of the occupying powers, as it simply notes correspondence received from two of them—the major two. Importantly, the `Authority' referred to in UNSCR 1483 is the Coalition Provisional Authority, the vehicle of the occupying powers for political administration in Iraq, in which Australia has continuing high-level representation. In other words, you cannot pretend not to be an occupying power while having direct representation in the political vehicle of the occupation itself—that is, the CPA.
If Mr Downer, Senator Hill and Mr Howard had had a whiff of information from our representatives in US command or within the authority about the scandalous treatment of prisoners they should have been checking this out. Mr Downer says he actually knew about reports of mistreatment in January. What then did he do? Senator Hill and Mr Howard—belatedly—visited Iraq and had discussions three weeks ago with the interim government and Mr Bremer. Did they ask after our prisoners? Did they raise the human rights abuse allegations? Apparently not.
The abuse and torture of Iraqi prisoners is shameful. It is the worst thing that could have happened to the occupying powers, who need the trust of the Iraqi population in order to restore stability and security. Now with these potent images of brutality the `prestige of the West', which Mr Howard used last week as yet another excuse for the Iraq war, has been severely tarnished. The images of humiliation have been plastered overnight across the faces of allied gravestones at the World War I cemetery in Gaza by furious locals. The stark images have given Osama bin Laden and his followers—the real targets of the war on terror—huge succour.
President Bush's response—to defend Rumsfeld's administration of the Pentagon—is the wrong signal to send. His strong praise of the defence secretary will only further enrage fair-minded Iraqis. As Harlan Ullman, principal author of the `shock and awe' doctrine and a senior adviser for the Centre for International and Strategic Studies, said last night on the 7.30 Report, the pressure for information came from the top. President Bush and Defense Secretary Rumsfeld have to accept some responsibility.
In indicating the opposition's support for this urgency motion, I want to clarify our position in relation to two aspects. Firstly, we would have liked to see the motion directed not only at the United States but at all the occupying powers. The United States is by no means the only country in the dock over the abuse of Iraqi prisoners. There are also allegations of abuse by British forces. Our own government also shares obligations as an occupying power in relation to the humane treatment of all prisoners in Iraq—obligations which, I might add, it is remarkably reluctant to acknowledge.
Secondly, while paragraph (e) of the motion is entirely consistent with the opposition's position on the negotiation with the United States of a so-called article 98 agreement, our preference would have been to keep this issue separate from that of the abuse of Iraqi prisoners. An article 98 agreement would require Australia not to surrender US citizens suspected of committing crimes against humanity to the International Criminal Court for prosecution. The inclusion of this paragraph in the motion before us implies that we are equating the prisoner abuse which is alleged to have occurred in Iraq with crimes against humanity and that we consider that those responsible for the abuse in Iraq should be brought before the International Criminal Court. Such conclusions are, at the least, premature. The allegations of abuse in Iraq have not yet been thoroughly investigated and it is not at all certain that the crimes they may be found guilty of would fall within the definition of `crimes against humanity' and therefore come within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court. It should also be said that the International Criminal Court is only able to take action in the event that the US or other contracting parties are not undertaking disciplinary or remedial action. That is not the case in relation to the allegations of prisoner abuse in Iraq, given that prosecutions are under way. That said, we have no problem with the substance of the motion before the Senate and we will be supporting it. As I have said, what has happened is tragic, it is disgusting and it is unforgivable.

"Macdonald, Sen Sandy",NATS,2004-05-11,"—Nothing I say in connection with opposing the urgency motion condones the inappropriateness of the behaviour documented with respect to the prisoners held by the United States in Iraq. This would never be sanctioned by Australia or by the ADF involved in the war against terror or in rebuilding the peace in Iraq. These unhappy visions will not, however, make Australia cut and run. The defence and security of Australia are contributed to by good order and security in Iraq and the Middle East generally. Australia will continue to support the rebuilding of Iraq, whether it be in training its army or controlling Baghdad airspace. Our troops have the total support of the Australian government and will be funded in tonight's budget well into the future. As reported by the Prime Minister after his visit to Iraq on Anzac Day, their morale is high, their training excellent and they continue to do a very good job on behalf of world peace and on behalf of the Australian government. I can report from personal contact that serving ADF personnel consider that some opposition assertions that the putting of Australians' lives on the line in Iraq is simply symbolic is very offensive to them. Many of us in the community and the Senate would like to dissociate ourselves from those comments.
This isolated and wrong behaviour by a hopefully small group of US service men and women does not alter the fundamentals of the Saddam Hussein regime and the reasons the coalition of the willing rightly took to remove Saddam Hussein from office. This was a destabilising regime. It was horrific to its citizens. It persecuted the majority Shias. It subjugated the Kurds in the north. It was a country in breach of a host of UN resolutions. It had used weapons of mass destruction—gas—against its own citizens and against Iranians in the Iraq-Iran war. As a near neighbour of Pakistan and Afghanistan, it had acted as a haven for terror and had helped finance and give succour to those Palestinian terror groups—particularly Hamas and Hezbollah but also a number of other jihadist groups—determined to destroy the state of Israel by violence of any kind.
There are no videotapes or photographs of Saddam's 200,000 victims, his treatment of women or his failure to educate people. There are no pictures of the mass graves of the tortured victims of his mass destruction. We get a little of what it must have been like in Saddam's regime when we see the way that some of the remnants of the Baath Party brutalised the four American contractors in Fallujah. The perpetrators of these killings are true examples of the Saddam Hussein regime. We must all hope that these people never get control again. 
Admittedly, the new beginning in Iraq is proving much more difficult than any of us would have feared. The remnants of his regime—the foreign jihadists who have been attracted there—want to see Iraq subjugated again, either with a Saddam Hussein look-alike or with an Islamic dictatorship. Neither would be satisfactory. In fact, both would be disastrous, particularly for Iraq but also for the region and the world.
I must say to the Iraqi people that it should not just be America stepping up to the plate and helping with the rebuilding of Iraq; they too must step up to the plate, accept responsibility for building a new Iraq and make a considerable effort to do so. It is difficult for them. Very few of them would have seen a free country before. The Baathists were in power for about 30 years, which means that the great majority of Iraqi citizens have never had the chance to partake of a free and open society.
We must not forget that, despite all the negative publicity coming from Iraq, there have been a number of positives since March last year. The Iraqi governing council is operating and has drafted the most liberal constitution in the Arab world. School attendances are up by over 10 per cent. Many girls are attending school for the first time. Public health funding has increased substantially. Hospitals are all operating, which was not the case before the war. Child immunisation has increased substantially. The historic marshlands have been repopulated by the Marsh Arabs. Drinkable water and electricity supplies have been increased very substantially. The oil is flowing again, obviously with some difficulty, but Iraq's international port has been substantially improved. It will be interesting to senators that before the improvements were made you had to wait for the tide before you could enter with larger ships.
In a national survey by the British firm Oxford Research International, 56 per cent of Iraqis said that their lives were better off than a year ago. The UN High Commission for Refugees, which was expecting two million refugees after the war, has had to close shop because it found that it had no takers. In fact, the population traffic has moved in the opposite direction. Not only are there signs of change in Iraq; there are signs of optimism in the region. Firstly, Gaddafi's Libya realised that the game was up and that to be regarded as an international pariah was not sensible. President Gaddafi has handed over his weapons of mass destruction. Civic movements have grown in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Syria, which would not have happened without the democratisation of Iraq. Overall, the changes in Iraq's society have provided freedom, women's empowerment and knowledge to Iraq's society, which was devastated by Saddam Hussein.
There is a theme of anti-Americanism going through this place—opposite, specifically—and also unfortunately through the Australian community. It is very concerning to me. I will just finish with a short quote from William Shawcross, the well-known British journalist who spoke recently at the Sydney Institute. He said:
The bottom line is this. For all its faults, American commitment and American sacrifice are essential to this world. As in the 20th century, so in the 21st only America has both the power and the optimism to defend the international community against what really are forces of darkness. In this endeavour America needs its allies in the liberal democratic world—for both real and symbolic purposes. Indeed the two often march together. 
I say to our American colleagues and friends: these times are sent to test us. These are difficult times. The visions that we see before us on our television screens are more than embarrassing, and they would be more than embarrassing to decent Americans too. I know they would hope that these things will not happen again. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Iraq: Treatment of Prisoners</title>,Matters of Urgency,17,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-05-11,"—The disgusting and degrading scenes that we have seen coming out of Abu Ghraib prison and that no doubt echo what has happened in a number of other prisons in Afghanistan and elsewhere degrade all of us as human beings—it does not matter whether we are American, Iraqi or Australian. The difficulty of the speech we have just heard is the failure of the people promoting the war and occupation in Iraq to come to grips with the fact that we are all human beings and we all have the ability for great good but the potential for evil as well. The problem goes right to the President of the United States, who has classified humanity into two camps: good and evil. He has repeatedly said that you are in either one or the other and has made the defining line outside his own camp.
I blame the President of the United States for inherently being involved in the problem that we now see. This is a man who has said about human beings, no matter how despicable their behaviour: `We will hunt them down. We will take them out. We will smoke them out,' and so on. Without drawing new lines he has accommodated—as indeed our own Prime Minister has accommodated—pictures of hooded people from our own nation as well as other nations being led in manacles into a prison where they have not been charged, where they have had no legal representation, where against the Geneva convention on many other counts they have also been completely separated and cut off from their kith and kin and loved ones. The problem is that having broken international law and the Geneva convention in one place in full daylight, and supported it, no new line was drawn. Now we are going to have the subordinates brought to trial, and they are being brought swiftly to trial. But the responsibility in some measure goes all the way up the line. When we come to our own country we have to ask: when did Prime Minister Howard and Minister for Foreign Affairs Alexander Downer and indeed Minister Hill, who refused to answer this simple question in question time here just two hours ago, know about the details on the abuse in this prison that was coming from the Red Cross?
—He answered very clearly.
—There are those opposite who will interject and say, `Everybody knew about it.' Let me say this: these gentlemen in government committed our forces into the coalition of the willing, into the camp of President Bush and into Iraq. When they did so they took on responsibility for ensuring that international law and humanity prevailed. I ask members opposite to tell this chamber that Prime Minister Howard did not know about this last January, that he did not know about this months ago. You know that he did, and he did nothing. He knew what was going on and did nothing. So did the Minister for Foreign Affairs. So did the Minister for Defence. They failed this country when they became part of the silence, of the doing nothing.

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2004-05-11,"—May I, firstly, place on record how disturbed I felt and the great disappointment I experienced when I saw the parade of conduct of Iraqi prisoners in American imprisonment in Iraq. This has been a blow and a matter which has caused me great personal distress, as I say, given the ambitions and intentions and objectives that the Australian government joined the coalition of the willing with in going into Iraq to achieve what I believe have been very many good things. 
I want to see the US government now rectify these matters—and I believe that they will. I want to see them prosecute the perpetrators in a clear and transparent fashion, as I believe most government senators and members do, and I believe that will happen. I also want to say that I believe that this conduct is extremely out of character for the United States and for the United States military. I think this has been an aberration and I think it will be arrested quickly and brought to an end and those perpetrators will be prosecuted, court-martialled, as justice would see them processed.
This motion, however, seeks to acknowledge and promote the fallacy of some sort of Australian involvement, legal or moral, in the criminal activity of the perpetrators of this sort of conduct. It is clear that they were on a frolic of their own. We were not involved, notwithstanding that Senator Brown would have you believe that we were there or have some responsibility. That is not the government of Australia. We had no responsibility in this. They were conducting criminal acts. We were not party to those. Senator Brown, for you to insinuate in this chamber that we were part of that is an absolute outrage. That you would impute on the Australian government, which has done so many good things in the recent history of this country, that we would condone or be part of this is just a disgrace. Indeed, it is ironic that Senator Bartlett would bring this motion to this chamber.
I say this in recounting the facts for the benefit of Senator Brown and Senator Bartlett and, indeed, for Senator Faulkner: there was no Australian involvement. Australia is not an occupying power. UN Security Council resolution 1483 designates the United States and the United Kingdom as the occupying powers. Australia is not an occupying power. For Senator Faulkner to insinuate, and to mislead this chamber, that we are is utterly false. I want to put that on record right here and now. Australia did not detain or accept prisoners in Iraq. The Red Cross did not pass its report to the Australian government or to the Australian ADF—we did not get it.
The sad fact here is that notwithstanding Senator Ray's high-minded words, which I want to move towards accepting, the opposition through Senator Faulkner has sought to embroil the Australian government and the Australian Defence Force in this conduct. I say to them, as I said to Senator Brown: that is an outrageous contention and one which I want to reject utterly. The Democrats, of course, suffer from a chronic abhorrence of the United States and anything American. They delight in heaping scorn and derision at the feet of the United States. In Kosovo and Bosnia the United States led the humanitarian team that saved so many lives there. 
I want to talk about Gaddafi. Gaddafi's declaration and handing in of his weapons of mass destruction would not have occurred without the action taken in Iraq led by the United States. I want to talk about the civilian democratic movements that are springing up in Egypt and Syria and Saudi Arabia at the behest and with the assistance of the United States. I want to talk about democratic reform movements throughout the Middle East because of actions that the United States has taken. I want to talk about the 70,000 people that it is estimated would have died in Iraq under Saddam Hussein in 2003 had it not been for the coalition of the willing. I want to talk about the 5,000 children per month that were dying because of sanctions but who now live. I want to talk about the 17 municipal elections that saw democratic candidates elected. 
Before my time runs out I want to talk about the fact that Senator Faulkner stood here and said that this conduct undermines everything we have sought to achieve in Iraq. Let me say this: we have the most magnificent agricultural advisers teaching people in Iraq how to grow crops and horticulture. We have Australian air traffic controllers who are daily seeing tonnes and tonnes of food and relief coming into Iraq so that its people can be fed and their medicines can be administered to them. That is under the command of Wing Commander Cheryl Steele, who I will take this opportunity to say is doing a fantastic job, as are all of our Defence Force personnel in Iraq. I want to talk about our naval training team over there who are training Iraqis to have their own navy. I want to talk about HMAS Stuart that is protecting oil that is being exported to provide vital resources to Iraq.
Senator Faulkner says that this conduct that has been complained of stands to undermine everything we have done in Iraq. Let me tell you one thing: the biggest undermining event that has occurred since we went to war in Iraq was when the Leader of the Opposition said that our commitment was `symbolic'. That is the greatest undermining event that has occurred to us. The Leader of the Opposition delivered to the Australian Defence Force the biggest slap in the face and the most disgraceful and disdainful thing that I have ever heard in this parliament. There is nothing symbolic about men and women of the Australian Defence Force putting their lives on the line for peace and democracy. We have done that throughout the world in so many different theatres, in so many places, in so many peacekeeping operations. For the opposition leader to say publicly that what we are doing is symbolic typifies the superficial, facile capacity of the opposition to come to terms with real, true international responsibility to do the right thing.
The Australian Defence Force have a most magnificent record of commitment and achievement throughout the world, the Middle East particularly, in peacekeeping operations. More power to them. I want to go on record to say that I have no doubt—there is not a single, solitary question in my mind—that had we been in charge these events would not have occurred. We were not in charge. We were not there. It is not our responsibility. But I trust, and want to work hard to see, that the United States arrests this conduct, puts an end to it once and for all, and thoroughly, transparently prosecutes those perpetrators.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Iraq: Treatment of Prisoners</title>,Matters of Urgency,17,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2004-05-11,"—In supporting this motion on behalf of the Australian Labor Party I want to make it clear that we do think that Australia has some responsibilities in this matter. There is no accusation against ADF troops. Quite clearly, the ADF handed over responsibility for prisoners very early. I want to make it clear that this is not about the role of the ADF. Their conduct has not been called into question. That is not the issue here. The government—and Senator Johnston mirrored this as a member of the government—has failed to understand the importance of this issue, understand its significance and admit to and accept Australia's responsibilities. 
This issue of how the Iraqi prisoners have been treated and abused is important for a range of reasons. It is important first of all as a moral question. The whole world has been revolted by what it has now learnt about what has occurred inside the Iraqi prisons. We have been perhaps slow to voice our moral concerns. But it has had a wide range of other impacts. It has certainly undermined the standing of the coalition in Iraq because it has undermined the moral authority that we have sought to bring to Iraq and to justify the coalition's role there. 
We see another example of how this has played out in the Arab world with reports today that the Commonwealth war graves in Gaza have been wrecked and vandalised and in their place have been left images of those Iraqis who were mistreated inside the coalition prisons. That is a sign of the reaction in the Arab world, a sign that this is a much bigger issue than merely the significant enough issue of the mistreatment of those particular prisoners. It is an issue that we all, as citizens of the world, have to take seriously. But it is an issue that Australia must take seriously because we are one of three coalition partners involved in the invasion of Iraq. We were the coalition of the willing. There were only three military forces committed: the US, the UK and Australia. The government has been trying to dance around the question of occupying power et cetera, but it is clear that we have responsibilities as an occupying power. We were one of the three. We therefore have responsibilities in post-war Iraq, responsibilities that have been debated in this chamber on a range of occasions and have been subject to the broader public debate about our role in Iraq.
Clearly, the government accepted those responsibilities at the time because the government signed an arrangement for the transfer of prisoners of war. I tried to get hold of this document during the war and post the war and was not able to get hold of it for some time because the government said that it wanted to seek the authority of the other partners in the coalition—the US and the UK—to make the document available. That document was signed on 23 March 2003 by the United States Central Commander, the air marshal in charge of the UK Command and Brigadier McNarn on behalf of the Australian National Headquarters. That was an arrangement for the transfer of prisoners of war, civil internees and civilian detainees between the forces of the United States of America, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and Australia. It sets out our legal and moral responsibilities for prisoners of war. It envisages the transfer between the UK, the US and Australia of prisoners of war and it sets out a commitment to the Geneva convention.
It sets out ongoing commitments for those powers who have captured Iraqis and detained them even though the actual control of those prisoners may have passed to one of the other powers. I know that Australia, mainly through the SAS, officially took 59 prisoners. The SAS captured those persons while doing the very outstanding work that they performed inside Iraq. Those Iraqi prisoners were immediately handed over, largely to British authorities, for detainment. But we had a legal responsibility for those 59 detainees. There may have been others. My information that I have been available to verify is that we had 59. They were handed over to the US and the UK.
Have we honoured our commitments under this agreement? Have the Australian government on behalf of the Australian people honoured those protocols we signed up to? Those protocols envisage us having an ongoing legal and moral interest in and an obligation to those prisoners of war. The questions we have tried to ask Senator Hill are: what has happened to those prisoners? Have they been treated appropriately? Is he satisfied that they have been treated appropriately? If not, what action has he taken to make sure that they are treated appropriately in the future? It seems to me that it would be very reasonable for us to make sure of that as part of our narrow responsibility for those 59 prisoners. I would argue that as part of the coalition and in our role as an occupying power we have a responsibility generally for prisoners taken, but clearly we have obligations in relation to at least those 59 prisoners. 
The minister has been unable or unwilling to provide answers to those questions. He seems to be in denial about the capture of those prisoners, and he seems to indicate that we have no responsibilities. I do not accept that. It seems too cute by half. I saw the pictures and I have seen the reports of the SAS capturing those prisoners. The government have admitted that we captured them but are saying now that we somehow have no responsibility for them. I find that very hard to believe, particularly in the light of the formal agreement with respect to those prisoners—which the government provided. Even if it were not for that agreement, we as an occupying power and as one of the three powers in the coalition would have a broader obligation to those prisoners to take responsibility for them, to ensure they are treated humanely and to continue to satisfy ourselves that they are treated appropriately. I do not know whether any of the prisoners taken initially by Australia have ended up in the prisons in question or have been subject to mistreatment, but I think that it is reasonable to ask and that it is a reasonable matter for Minister Hill to satisfy himself and the Australian public about.
I make it very clear that there is no suggestion of any mistreatment by ADF personnel. There have been no accusations levelled—there is nothing but praise for the work they have done—but there is a moral obligation on us as an occupying power to take an interest in those prisoners, and in all prisoners, given our role in Iraq. The answers from the government to these concerns have been similar to those given by the governments of the UK and the USA. They have been far too slow and grudging in their responses to these most serious allegations. They have been far too flippant in dealing with what now appears to be a much more systemic abuse of prisoners than was originally thought.
The minister today again tried to talk about the treatment of the few involved in abuse. As allegation after allegation piles on top of the last and as photo after photo and video after video becomes available, it becomes clearer that issues of systemic abuse need to be addressed. There are questions about whether or not this has been authorised at higher levels, about whether or not this has been encouraged or at least condoned and about what action has been taken to deal with those higher up the chain. I am always very concerned when I see a series of privates being prosecuted for offences in a chain of command. That is not the way the military works. I have a great deal of difficulty, as I think many Australians do, swallowing the line that all of this started with a few privates inside the prison. All we are saying is that these are very serious issues. They greatly undermine the moral authority of the coalition inside Iraq. They greatly undermine the moral authority of the US, Australia and the UK in the Arab world. We are going to have to deal with these issues. I was pleased to see Senator Hill today admit the seriousness of concerns about the likely reaction. The deplorable action in relation to the Gaza war graves today was the beginning of the repercussions and highlights the Arab reaction to these most shocking allegations.
I think we need some answers from the Australian government. We have to have some acknowledgement of our responsibility as an occupying power to ensure our reputations as Australians are protected. We must ensure that we get to the bottom of this, that the perpetrators are brought to trial and that we deal adequately and quickly with these most serious allegations. I was very disappointed by Senator Hill's responses today. He said on ABC TV only last week that the first he knew about these events was when there were public revelations on TV only a matter of days before. In recent days we have learnt that in fact the federal government knew of the Red Cross report as early as January this year. It would strike me as very odd if they did not know about the US investigations, given that we have senior military officers attached to the joint command inside Iraq. These are serious issues that the Australian government have to address. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Iraq: Treatment of Prisoners</title>,Matters of Urgency,17,1
"Lightfoot, Sen Ross",LP,2004-05-11,"—I want to express at the beginning of my contribution to the debate on this urgency motion my disgust and feeling of revulsion—I cannot really express adequately my disappointment; it turned my stomach—at seeing those images of the American and, to a lesser degree but still significantly, the United Kingdom forces treating prisoners in such a fashion. It was horrifying, it was disgusting, it was obnoxious and it was woeful. Those behind the malevolence and malignity of this ought to be rightly prosecuted to the fullest possible legal degree. But could I say—not at all in mitigation of that; I am not offering any rebuttal whatsoever for those actions that were taken by the forces of those countries against these prisoners—that I do not see, as is the imputation offered by the other side, that any blame whatsoever can be attributed to the Australian defence forces, the SAS or the Howard government. People of Australia should not feel personal guilt or blame for this grievous, lamentable, invidious and vexatious behaviour by armed services that are not our own.
Australia entered the war in Iraq with the United States and the United Kingdom and with the legal imprimatur of United Nations Security Council resolution 1441. At the end of the war, although not the beginning of the peace, Australia withdrew. United Nations Security Council resolution 1483 was then invoked, with the occupying powers of the United States and the United Kingdom only. For anyone to say that Australia still had a legal responsibility is quite wrong. I understand that an election is coming up. I understand the desperateness on the other side to involve the Australian government and the Australian armed services, particularly the SAS. They come from my home state of Western Australia and did a magnificent job in Iraq. I am sure everyone in this place was proud of them, except those who speak out this afternoon and impute some malevolence on the part of the SAS. Yes, the SAS took prisoners in Iraq, but the vast majority were released and sent home, and they were pleased to be released. On the assessment of senior officers of the SAS, some were detained and handed over for further interrogation, predominantly to the United States but later some to the United Kingdom as well.
Iraq is far better off today than it was at any time during the rule of the Baath Party, particularly under Saddam Hussein. To try and draw some parallel with what the United States and the United Kingdom are doing is quite wrong, mischievous and even nefarious—it is evil. Only a tiny fraction of the 140,000 people who comprise the occupying force of the United States and the 20,000-odd people from the United Kingdom has behaved in such a manner. The vast majority are good and decent people who want to do a job and see Iraq as a democracy, as a free nation, and it is coming. Only a tiny proportion of the country is not secure. The top one-quarter or one-third of the country predominately north of Baghdad is under the control of the Kurds—and particularly their most wonderful leader His Excellency Jalal Talabani—and is going about its peaceful business and rehabilitation. It is trying to recover from the atrocities that Saddam Hussein inflicted upon the Kurdish people. It is looking for more oil and looking to establish a democracy there to live in peace after decades and generations of suffering and after losing hundreds of thousands of its people to weapons of mass destruction. 
This urgency motion and debate—no matter how abhorrent these practices have been in the past, and they are stopping now and the people responsible will be punished; court martials are starting on 19 May—only bring down the good work that is being done not just by the occupying forces of the United States and the United Kingdom but by those good and decent Iraqi people, particularly the Kurds. They are putting their lives back together and want a system of democracy and a federated Iraq where all people from all walks of life and from all different religions—and there are many of them there—can live in peace side by side, can amount to something in their lives and can hopefully one day live a life similar to that which we live in Australia or that which we emulate of the United States, the United Kingdom and other parts of the free world.
I am not pleased with this urgency motion. Yes, I support part (a). No, I do not support parts (b), (c), (d) or (e)—either in part or in full. I am proud to associate myself with all the Australian defence forces, and particularly those brave men who were right out in front—past the pointy part—of the invasion of Iraq last year. They sent back signals that saved many of the lives of our allies. I am proud to be associated with the United Kingdom and the United States. I am not going to let the behaviour of a few people, as abhorrent and as evil as it is, to alter that opinion. They are good people. The coalition of the willing is a good organisation. We will bring nothing but good overall to the Iraqi people. At the end of the day, I hope that people on the other side recant and join our push for a better life for the Iraqi people over time.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2004-05-11,"—My role on behalf of the Democrats, having moved this urgency motion, is to wrap up our views. We brought on this urgency motion because we believe this is a vital issue and one that deserves to be debated in the parliament. We have all seen the sickening pictures of Iraqi prisoners being tortured by military personnel. These are not allegations; there is evidence to substantiate what has gone on. We have heard the confessions of senior US government officials. We have all been appalled and dismayed by what we have seen so far. Indeed, we have been warned that there are more graphic, more horrific images to come. 
At the most basic level this issue is about humanity—acts of torture and abuse are crimes against humanity. They are universally wrong. Regardless of nationality or culture, it is wrong to torture and abuse human beings. These acts display a disregard for human life and human dignity. While I have heard people from every party in this place place on record their abhorrence, I find it extraordinary that we are all willing to talk about these exceptions to the rule but are not willing to acknowledge that human beings—I know Senator Brown acknowledged this—are capable of not only great acts of goodness but horrendous acts as well. 
This debate, whether a bit philosophical or not, is about who takes moral and legal responsibility in this context, because human beings at most are capable of such horrendous acts in wartime and in situations such as war. Anyone who goes into a war situation must understand that, and that includes our leaders who lead us into war for whatever reason, no matter how spurious. Even on the basis of the rationale of trying to prevent torture, leaders have a responsibility to acknowledge that this happens. We cannot dismiss these people, as we have done—as backwoods, trailer trash and no-goods—when we have a responsibility as citizens, as part of humanity, to acknowledge that this takes place. I am sure senators have heard of the 1971 Stanford survey that was done by Professor Zimbardo in which he talked about human ability to be responsible for such acts of sadism and degradation. 
This debate today is about acknowledging that at some point we have to not only denounce these acts but accept legal and moral responsibility when we go into a war situation. The engagement of the occupying powers in these acts has called into question much of the rhetoric we have heard regarding the war in Iraq. From the outset, the British, the US and the Australian governments have cast this war as a battle between good and evil. The initial justification for this war, the weapons of mass destruction, ultimately proved false. Coalition forces have not found evidence of weapons of mass destruction, and let us not forget that this was the only possible legal justification provided by coalition forces for this military action.
I put on record again that the Australian Democrats were among those who did not believe that there was any legal basis for the war. But in the absence of that legal basis for the war coalition leaders tried to make a moral case in favour of military action, arguing for a desperate need for regime change. Like every party in this place, the Democrats did condemn the horrific acts of torture, abuse and murder perpetrated by Saddam Hussein's regime. We did not believe that a controversial war without UN backing was the appropriate way to put an end to that regime. Time has unfortunately proven that these concerns were justified. More than a year later, insecurity and acts of terror continue to thrive within Iraq. The very nations that purported to save the Iraqi people from murder, torture and abuse by Saddam Hussein's regime have in fact seen such acts committed—torture, murder and abuse of Iraqis. We have witnessed a change from one regime which flouts human rights to potentially another.
Since the evidence of prisoner abuse first emerged, Prime Minister Howard has been among those who venture to argue that the abuse inflicted by the occupying forces cannot be compared to the abuse inflicted by Saddam Hussein's regime. There is a grave danger in talking about what is potentially a hierarchy of torture—that some acts or more acceptable than others. It is a dangerous, slippery slope. The children of Iraq have been saved from nothing if they are sexually abused and tortured by saviours. The women of Iraq have not been saved if they have been raped by their liberators. The evidence against US troops includes allegations that a 12-year-old girl was stripped naked and beaten and it is reported that yet to be released images include evidence of US soldiers raping Iraqi prisoners.
I welcome the condemnation of these abuses by the occupying powers. We acknowledge that the US has said that it wants to get the perpetrators, it wants to bring them to justice, yet it is easy sometimes to be cynical about what kind of justice and what the rule of law means when this nation in particular has flagrantly disregarded international humanitarian law. There are two examples of that. Guantanamo Bay is one example where we see a concocting of this new description of enemy combatants in order to get around international humanitarian law and Geneva conventions. The second disregard is the refusal to recognise the International Criminal Court—hence putting the ICC in the motion today—and asking nations to sign a statement that they will not surrender US citizens to the court. The Australian government is currently in negotiations with the US for one of these agreements, which is perhaps ironic given the crucial role that we played, particularly in establishing the ICC; hence the importance of that to this motion. The horrific acts that we have seen committed in Abu Ghraib and elsewhere potentially are exactly the kinds of offences that the ICC was established to deal with. 
We have heard confusion from this government. We have heard different stories as to whether or not we are an occupying power, but at some point leaders who lead us into war have to take responsibility for their actions. I am sure the government knows this, and its attempt to divest its responsibilities for those acts are appalling. Unfortunately, we have not evolved to such a high plane that people giving or taking absolute power over other human beings can be trusted not to exploit it for their own base gratification. We have to acknowledge that war gives awful opportunities to people, and that is why we opposed it in the first place. (Time expired)
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Iraq: Treatment of Prisoners</title>,Matters of Urgency,17,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-05-11,"—I move an amendment on behalf of the Australian Greens:
Omit “should be received by a meeting of the House of Representatives in the House chamber, to which all senators are invited as guests”, substitute “be received by a meeting of senators and members held in the Great Hall of Parliament House, Canberra”.
The Greens have been very strong on this issue throughout. Before President Bush and President Hu visited this parliament and were given the extraordinary privilege of speaking in the House of Representatives to the two chambers of parliament, gathered together but separate, last October, we moved to have both President Bush and President Hu address this parliament in the Great Hall. We believe that should be the future practice and this amendment gives effect to that. We do not believe that this chamber should be put in an ancillary position at the side of the House of Representatives with addresses from visiting heads of state. We believe that the proper process here is for heads of state, who are essentially strangers when they come to this parliament, to address both houses—and indeed other people—in the Great Hall.
The practice that is being recommended by the Procedure Committee is not consistent with the constitutional arrangement whereby the two chambers of this parliament are equal but separate. I reiterate that it was entirely wrong of the Speaker of the House of Representatives—and insofar as the committee finds that the President of this place was complicit—to prohibit Senator Nettle and me from a sitting of the Senate when President Hu visited in October last year. The outcome of that unsatisfactory arrangement and the breach of proper procedure and defence of this chamber and its rights is being compounded by the motion that is now before this parliament. 
We should not be subservient or copycats of arrangements made in other parliaments. I remind senators that the standing orders of this place, and indeed the constitution, indicate that the people who should speak in this chamber are the people elected by the Australian public to this chamber. We have an excellent provision in the Great Hall for receiving other people including the heads of states of the great powers and indeed of any other country. That is where their addresses should be given to the members of parliament and to the people of Australia. These chambers are for the elected representatives of this country.
Joint sittings become impossibly difficult to sort out in terms of which rules of which house are to be applied. I might say that the arrangement that is now being put in place here effectively makes senators subservient to the Speaker of another place when visiting heads of state come to address the parliament. They will of course be addressing the house of assembly and not the parliament, but I would bet right here and now that that truth will not be observed by future prime ministers and future governments. They will be inviting the heads of state not to address the House of Representatives but to address the parliament of Australia.
Under the terms of this motion that will not be the case. Let us make that very clear: they will be addressing the House of Representatives with senators invited to sit at the back with their rights to take place in debate removed and with their rights to represent their constituents in this country removed, as we saw on 23 and 24 October last year. We believe this is a mistake. We believe this is not consistent with the intention of the Constitution or the electors of this parliament. Sure, it may be an arrangement that is satisfactory to other parties within this parliament, but we beg to disagree—and disagree very forcibly. We believe the better arrangement is for such great events as speeches from visiting heads of state to be held in the Great Hall. That is among its ostensible purposes. That is the rightful place for such speeches to be given.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Procedure Committee</title>,Committees,26,1
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2004-05-11,"—This recommendation was the unanimous view of the Procedure Committee but this matter was also referred to the Privileges Committee for consideration, which unanimously endorsed the Procedure Committee report. It does arise out of events of October last year. Senator Brown has alluded to the fact that it is probably almost impossible to write rules for a genuine joint sitting with absolute equality between the two chambers. Senator Brown is wrong when he says the only people who can speak here are those who are elected. I do recall the Governor-General popping in to open parliament every now and then.
—That's constitutionally provided for.
—It is constitutionally provided for, and the House of Representatives members have to come over here and sit up the back and all the rest. I think it is just a balance. If you are going to go ahead with what are called joint sittings, joint meetings or an assemblage of all parliamentarians it is fair enough that those be on the House of Representatives side. I do not know whether Senator Brown will be sitting up the back. I will never know, because I do not go to joint sittings. I went to one in 1991 and I have not been to one since, because I find them the most insufferably boring and tedious events. I do not know how we can really duchess some visiting dignitary by inflicting that on them. That is beyond me, but apparently it does work. If it does work—if we can get an extra trade concession or something else by having a joint meeting—good on them. 
What I am most concerned about is how parliamentary privilege applies. Frankly, I cannot work out any way it can apply to joint sittings as they have been held in the past. It is simply a nightmare. I think the simplest solution that the Labor Party has found is to meet in the House of Representatives and operate under their rules. If I go over tonight and listen to the budget, I go over there in exactly that capacity: I operate under their rules and, if I misbehave, I might be disciplined by them—who knows?
—But it is a meeting of the House and not the—
—It depends how this is going to be purported in future, Senator Brown. If it is going to be purported for a meeting a la the United States Congress, that would be a wrong representation, once we come to these arrangements. It is a meeting to which all parliamentarians are invited—nothing more; nothing less. All those questions of privilege and standing orders disappear because only one set applies, because the meeting is occurring in the House of Representatives. So we disagree with Senator Brown on this matter. We think that the proposal coming out of the Procedure Committee and endorsed by the Privileges Committee is the very simple way of approaching these matters. It is not totally satisfactory. Incidentally, I do not like the idea of meeting in the Great Hall. I do not find it a very attractive place for meetings, frankly. One of the reasons you have these meetings in a parliamentary chamber is the atmospherics.
—You have been there, though, haven't you?
—To the Great Hall?
—Yes. You certainly haven't been to the House of Representatives.
—No, I have never been to the House of Representatives since we have moved up the hill. That is true. And I would have been in the House of Representatives in 1969 but for a deficit of votes in the seat of Henty, where I just missed out by nine per cent, and I am not offended by the fact that I was not elected then. In conclusion, we are not going to agree with the Greens on this matter. I do not say that with any animus at all. We just have a different view of these things. I think that this solution from the Procedure Committee is a simple one—not brilliant but simple and adequate—and I think we will be able to proceed that way in future.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Procedure Committee</title>,Committees,26,1

If they are up the back of the Great Hall, you are unlikely even to be able to see. So, in that respect, I think it is useful work that the Procedure Committee has done in making this recommendation. 
We will support Senator Brown's amendment about the Great Hall because it has been our view for some time that that is the appropriate place. You still have a difficulty here if the House of Representatives or the government—or whoever makes the decision—chooses not to have a head of state address the parliament in whichever chamber. I do not think that has yet been resolved. Do you have to be a country of a certain size before it warrants an invitation to address the chamber? We have not dealt with that very important issue, so we will still get anomalies and difficulties. For that reason, I think our preference would be to stick with the Great Hall. But if that amendment is not passed, we will support this change.

The Greens are strong defenders of private members time; there is too little of it in the Senate. All the crossbench senators, and indeed the opposition, value private members time greatly. Effectively what is being said is that after 4.30 p.m. there are planes to be caught and if you are going back to Western Australia, Tasmania or the Northern Territory—and I understand that—it is much better to do that and not to have a vote in the chamber at that time on Thursday afternoons. I do not accept that. Change the sitting times if we must, but retain the right at all times for a deliberation when matters are being debated, not least during private members time. In my books, it will make private members time after 4.30 p.m. on Thursdays a subsidiary matter to government time. I do not know whether there is another explanation for this. I note that the vote will be put off until the next day of sitting. I believe we should not entertain that. More importantly, the second component of this motion states:
(b)	if objection is made to a motion being taken as a formal motion, a proposal to suspend standing orders to allow the motion to be moved shall not be received by the President and put to the Senate unless 5 senators, including the mover ... indicate support ...
This is another move to repress the increasing diversity of this place. As we know, and we saw it today, urgency motions can only be gotten up when supported by five senators—that means the Labor Party, the coalition or the Democrats. If urgency motions come from the Independents, the Greens or One Nation, unless they can get four people from other parties or four individuals to support them they will never, ever put one up. In fact, I have had one or two in all of my time in this place, and they were successful through the support of either the Democrats or Labor. There is an impediment to urgency motions coming forward from this corner of the house if you do not have more than five members.
The motion before the Senate effectively will extend to formal motions where there is a proposal to suspend standing orders to allow the motion to be moved and debated. You will need five members to support that process. It effectively means that the rest of the Senate will be able to remove consideration and a vote on a motion which may be very important to the individual and a supporter in this place. However, whereas two are required now for a division and for this process, five will be required in future. I cannot support a move to take away existing rights of Independent senators or smaller parties in this place in this way, and that is exactly what this will do. I do not know who will be here after the next election or five elections from now, but I am aware that there is a general tendency by the bigger parties in particular to use numbers to keep newcomers at bay. The simplest expression of that, and it applies right around the country, is to put Independents on the right-hand side of the ballot paper when everybody else goes into a ballot to see what place they get on the ballot paper. As far as Independents are concerned, they are always on the right-hand side; they never, ever get the left-hand column. Therefore, Independents get the donkey vote. Who legislated that? Not the Independents. It was legislated by the big parties of the day in all parliaments in Australia, as far as I am aware, and it is wrong. 
Here we have a proposal to further remove existing powers of Independents and smaller parties of fewer than five members in this place, and I oppose it. It is not fair. There will be all sorts of arguments about time saved and so on. We should have more private members time, and the resort to moving that `a motion being taken as a formal motion, a proposal to suspend standing orders to allow the motion to be moved' is not used frequently. In fact it has been used much less frequently in recent times than five or six years ago. This is a trial, but, as we know, trials are brought in simply to be converted into standing orders a little way down the track. We oppose the motion.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Procedure Committee</title>,Committees,28,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-05-11,"—At the outset I make it clear that I am not speaking in my ministerial capacity and therefore am not seeking to close the debate. I would seek to wear a hat either as a member of the committee or as a private senator, which I can do. Senator Brown, in relation to the 4.30 p.m. provision of part (2)(a) of the motion, we are very happy to have that voted on separately and will be happy to give leave if that is what is required.
Senator Brown, when talking about part (2)(a) of the motion moved by Senator Troeth, mentioned the need for this change. We say quite clearly that of course it is only on a trial basis. It is only for this session. It will, effectively, apply to only three Thursdays, from memory—we have only three sitting weeks in this session—this week's and two other Thursdays. It is being done on that basis because the consensus in the Procedure Committee was that it was a change that we would like to see. We would like to see how it operates and whether the sorts of problems that Senator Brown envisages occur. We would then have the chance to review it in the next set of sittings.
The reason for the 4.30 p.m. cut-off is as Senator Brown has predicted. It is to allow senators the same opportunity that our friends and colleagues in the other place have, and that is to get home to their constituencies at a reasonable time on Thursday evenings. It will enable them to travel to the airport without having to engage in a stressful race. It will enable them to catch aeroplanes that take many of them to the most remote parts of this incredibly large continent. Some go to North Queensland, some go to Queensland, some go to Western Australia—I declare my strong vested interest in that regard—others go to the Northern Territory, as Senator Brown mentioned, and still others go to Tasmania. That is, without any shadow of a doubt, the reason it is being done. There is no secret agenda there. 
We want to ensure that senators can get home to their constituencies on Thursday nights without having to engage in a stressful and sometimes dangerous race to the airport. A lot of highly stressed individuals around Australia and around the world actually die doing that. A lot of people have heart attacks at airports and on the way to airports. There may not be much sympathy out there for politicians rushing to airports, but I think that those of us who spend much of our lives racing to airports know that it is not a good thing to do. So we are seeking to avoid that. 
Currently, the standing order provides, almost identically, that no divisions will be taken after six o'clock. That provision was in fact put there for a similar reason, but the practical reality of airline schedules—and, I think, the practical reality after 14 September 2001, when Ansett effectively collapsed—is that there are fewer services and fewer options to get out of Canberra and travel to one of those far-flung parts of the continent. Six o'clock may have worked relatively well up until 14 September 2001, but there are now simply far fewer flights and far fewer options on Thursday evenings when you are trying to shift a couple of hundred senators and members and many hundreds more staff out of Canberra to destinations around the nation. That is the reason.
I do not think that this diminishes the value of the business that is being conducted in the Senate at the time. A good example is that you can still have votes; it is simply that you cannot have divisions. If something is controversial and needs to be voted on, then the Procedure Committee has come up with a sensible, rational and fair way of dealing with such a contested vote, and that is to have it the next time the Senate sits and everyone is here. I make the point that it does not diminish the quality or the importance of the debate that may be going on after 4.30 p.m. In fact, earlier on a Thursday—at 12.45 p.m.—it is the practice of the Senate to deal with large volumes of government legislation in what is called the non-controversial timeslot. The Senate goes through a process of working out what legislation we can deal with at that time. I make the point that legislation dealt with at that time is no less important; it is simply not legislation that requires anything other than an affirmative vote. We take votes on all of that legislation. The amount of legislation that goes through in that timeslot is quite substantial. I would hazard a guess and say that, on average, it is probably three or four bills every week. Over 20 sitting weeks that is a massive number of bills. That does not mean that those pieces of legislation are less important. So I ask Senator Brown to consider that argument.
In relation to the suspension of standing orders seeking the declaration of a motion as formal, I point out that it is already practice in the Senate that, for an urgency motion to be declared, five senators are required to stand in their places. That is standard, existing Senate practice if you want an urgency motion debated. You need that for matters of public importance as well. So it is not some sort of conspiracy to crack down on Independent senators; it is a process that brings into line existing Senate practice in relation to urgency motions and motions to deal with matters of public importance.
In relation to providing time for private senators' matters or non-government business, I point out that there are very few parts of the Senate schedule where government business is guaranteed. This afternoon is a good example of that. Since the end of question time I do not think we have dealt with any government business. We are now here at 5.36 p.m., and for some hours this afternoon we have been dealing with everything but government business. The Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer has come in to ask about her bill on whatever she is dealing with at the moment. We have told her, Senator Murray and others who are interested to come back in perhaps half an hour when this debate has finished. That is a fact. In many sections of the week, government business time is that amount of time that is left over after we have dealt with everything else. 
I am not saying that the government gets a bad shake out of this place. The reality is that through negotiations and discussion—and, 90 per cent of the time, through very good will on behalf of the opposition, Senator Brown, the Democrats, and Senator Harradine and other Independents—we ensure that we balance business between what the government needs to deal with the legislative program and what other senators need for dealing with formal motions, urgency motions, matters of public importance and even private members' bills on Thursday afternoons. I think that through it all Senator Brown would, if he were fair, say that we strike a reasonable balance in these things, and that is what we seek to do. I commend the Procedure Committee for bringing forward these proposals to amend the standing orders and create some temporary orders for the balance of these sittings—albeit the very shortest sittings in the Senate calendar this year; I think there are only 10 sitting days to go.
 (Senator McLucas)—By way of clarification: we will deal with paragraphs (2)(a) and (2)(b) separately, Senator Brown.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Procedure Committee</title>,Committees,28,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2004-05-11,"—I address myself to both of these issues. It is important for the Senate to understand that the recommendations of the Procedure Committee on the substantive issues in relation to when a division can be called—what time on Thursday afternoons in the first instance—and the procedures relating to formal motions are compromise recommendations. They are issues that the Procedure Committee has been examining for some time, particularly in relation to the question of how to deal with formal motions, and there is recognition by the committee that it is useful in this circumstance for us to recommend that a sessional order apply. The Procedure Committee is not recommending a change to the standing orders at this point; it is recommending temporary orders be put in place.
The first issue is that if a division is called for on Thursday after 4.30 p.m. then that matter be held over until the Senate next sits. I think this is a quite unremarkable change, I really do. Current standing order 57(3) states:
If a division is called for on Thursday after 6 pm, the matter before the Senate shall be adjourned until the next day of sitting at a time fixed by the Senate.
All this temporary sessional order of the Senate does is amend the time of 6 p.m. to 4.30 p.m. My maths might be wrong but I think that means, given that this would apply to the end of the current sittings period, it will be effective for only three sitting weeks—this week and the last two weeks of June, given that we have an estimates fortnight situated between them. We are talking about a proposed temporary order of the Senate to apply for three Thursdays that changes the time of this particular standing order—that is, from 6 p.m. to 4.30 p.m. I do not see this as a radical change; it is a compromise from the Procedure Committee. There is an element of, `Let's have a look at this; let's see how it works for a very limited period of time.' There is an element of the Procedure Committee having another look at it to see if a further sessional order is warranted or, as sometimes happens, proposing the consideration of a change to the Senate standing orders. It is pretty unremarkable, I have got to say. If there is a matter of great moment and dispute that leads to a division being required after 4.30 p.m., it is not as though the division will not happen—it will just not happen then. It will happen, but it just will not happen after 4.30 on the Thursday afternoon. 
—It never happens anyway.
—That is absolutely right, Senator Ray. How often do you actually have a division called for on a Thursday between 4.30 p.m. and 6 p.m.? How often does it occur? It is very, very rare. Let us not turn this into some sort of international incident or claim that it is a massive denial of democratic rights; it is not. But if perchance it does not work, and I think that is rather unlikely, the Procedure Committee can have a look at it in the very near future. I would like to think, given the spirit with which it dealt with this proposal in the first instance, it will come forward with a sensible recommendation.
Having said that about the first of the proposals that have exercised Senator Brown a little, let me now turn to the second one—which I think is a more substantive issue. This goes to the way formal motions are dealt with in this chamber. Every senator in this chamber knows—
—The third one; is that what you're talking about?
—(2)(b).
—Or not to be.
—That is the question. Can we divide on it? Paragraph (2)(b) is a matter of greater substance, and most senators in this chamber know it is also a matter which has concerned the opposition for a considerable period.
One useful thing I think the Procedure Committee has done is produce this report, which gives a valuable history of the way formal motions have developed. Their use has changed since they were included in the first set of Senate standing orders in 1903. It is a massive change; but most of that evolution has occurred over recent years. I think the Senate would be aware that the opposition have been concerned that some motions adopted by the Senate—particularly motions on foreign policy—run the risk of being misunderstood by other sovereign governments. The distinction between the Senate agreeing to a motion and the executive government adopting a position is something that is not well understood. It is a very poor mechanism to adopt. It is a very blunt instrument for us to deal with. 
One of the great weaknesses of these formal notices of motion is that senators are asked to either agree or disagree with formality: you either agree with the motion as it is moved by the senator or you do not. The capacity for amendment is not available to any senator, except on occasions when it occurs by negotiation—and that is a small minority of occasions. You cannot amend it. In some areas the nuances of these motions are important. It does make a difference how motions are worded, and small amendments can make a difference. So it is a blunt instrument. If you agree to formality, you are forced to vote either in favour of it or against it. 
What is the alternative? It is to declare such a motion `not formal'. If you declare such a motion not formal, it is then the right of the senator who has proposed the motion to move a suspension of standing orders—an automatic right. As a result of amendments to the standing orders proposed by me when I was Manager of Government Business in the Senate in the good old days when Labor was in government, those debates on the suspension of standing orders are now limited to half an hour, five minutes per speaker. But it is still a half-hour chunk out of the day. At the end of the day, you determine an issue by voting on whether to suspend standing orders to debate the motion or not. Again, it is an unsatisfactory situation.  
I do not say that this has necessarily been abused by senators. You could say that this mechanism has been abused; I do not say that. This is a mechanism available to senators in the Senate standing orders. There have been absurd congratulatory motions concerning sports men, women and others—some have been for quite significant achievements, but some have been for the odd achievement or the odd issue that was pretty trifling—and the chairs themselves have attempted at times to rule such things out of order. But it is the issue of substance that is of concern to the opposition, and we have argued for a long time that it ought to be of concern to the government, particularly in the area of foreign policy. The government have not shared those concerns. They share them now, but they were not willing to act when the opposition made strenuous attempts after Labor lost government in 1996 to see if we could make some changes to the way this particular provision of the standing orders worked. We were unsuccessful in that. Now there is a broader acceptance, we need to do something about it. 
It is said that this is antidemocratic in some way, that it stifles the voice of minorities in the chamber. I do not think that is true. I do not think a substantive argument can be made to suggest that that is the case. Frankly, if you are unable to get five senators to stand in their place to call on a debate for the suspension of standing orders, you have got Buckley's of getting to 39. That is the truth. That is the hard, bottom line politics of this. If you cannot get five people to stand up in their place to bring on a debate about a matter, what chance have you got, really, of seeing such a thing being carried? At the end of the day, so much of the way this chamber works is by negotiation off chamber—in the margins. That is how it works. Most of these sorts of debates are the exception, not the rule. Most of these sorts of matters are matters of negotiation between whips, between managers and between others—at times even party leaders have some responsibilities in these areas. There are senators in the government and in the opposition responsible for chamber management, and those on the crossbenches also take an active role in chamber management. 
I frankly believe that this is the case on key issues, on priority issues. When a senator believes that something is of sufficient significance that it ought to be brought on for an opportunity to consider whether a formal motion should be agreed to, I am not in much doubt that a senator will not receive support. But it does put a brake on this procedure. It does send a signal to all of us in the Senate that this is a procedure, a mechanism, in the standing orders that has spun out of control over the past number of years. This is an attempt to say, `Is there a sensible, fair and reasonable way of trying to adopt a procedure that is going to work in the best interests of the Senate as a whole?'
I think you can make a very strong argument, by the way, for more dedicated time for non-government business—or general business, as it is described. I believe that in the not too far distant future in this chamber we will hear more arguments presenting that point of view. I think governments of any political persuasion, if they are smart, will say: `This is quite reasonable. If we can dedicate more time to that, it might be a good idea but, on the other hand, let us see if we can dedicate some time to government business.' The point that the Manager of Government Business in the Senate makes about the capacity for government business time to be gobbled up on a pretty regular basis has some truth to it, but there is a quid pro quo in this sort of thing—if you want more general business time with the capacity for non-government senators to debate business in this place, the other side of the ledger is more dedicated time for government business. 
This is the sort of thing we ought to be looking at if we are serious about reform in this chamber. I would commend that to the government, the opposition, the minor parties and the Independents as a way forward in dealing with some of these age-old problems. I believe that, on this particular occasion, the Procedure Committee has taken a pretty balanced view of what is a difficult, growing and quite serious problem. That is where the opposition come from on this matter. We accept that the debate on general business motions—the mechanism of general business notices of motion—has evolved and developed in a way that was never intended. This proposed mechanism, which will apply for about 12 sitting days only, is a start to addressing it. I am all in favour of the Procedure Committee, after it has applied for what will literally be a handful of days, taking a good hard look at how effective it has been, seeing whether it stands the test of scrutiny and applying its mind to how this issue should be addressed in the future. The opposition have identified it as a problem for a long time now. We believe the Procedure Committee has adopted a balanced view; it is a compromise position. I personally believe, as do my colleagues, that it is likely to be an improvement. We certainly believe it is worth testing and trialling for the few remaining weeks of this session. It is for all those reasons—and they are important reasons—that the opposition will support this proposal.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Procedure Committee</title>,Committees,28,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-05-11,"—I rise to indicate that the Democrats will not support the no divisions provision, 2(a), or the formality suspension of standing orders provision, 2(b). I will take 2(b) first so I can respond to Senator Faulkner's remarks. Some figures have just been passed to me. Senator Faulkner said this has spun out of control and that it is a serious problem that needs to be addressed because it was never intended that this procedure be so demanding on the Senate's time. My response is that, in 2002, there were three motions to suspend standing orders. From the records I have, there were more in 1994, 1995 and 1996 than at any other time. There were 10 in 1994, 14 in 1995 and 19 in 1996, so it is hardly a problem that has suddenly emerged as a big issue and a great time waster. I think it is exaggerating the problem, to say the least.
It is a poor solution to what is really a nonexistent problem. The number of senators required to support this measure is totally arbitrary. It has some connection with being in support of an urgency motion or a matter of public importance, but that is all. Otherwise you could just say that it is designed to keep those who cannot muster five senators from doing this. Of course, what we know is that standing orders are suspended largely by the crossbench. I am the whip of the Democrats, and we have seven senators. Even with a lot of forewarning and notice, it can be quite difficult to muster five people into the chamber at one point in time, not because it is difficult to contact them or anything of that sort but because people have other commitments such as meetings they cannot get out of or committee work. There is a whole range of reasons why people find it difficult to get into the chamber at a point in time. Often we have to wait a length of time, so it is also time wasting. I would argue that we need to reform that system. From our point of view, it is an unnecessary barrier to a process that should be available.
You cannot do anything but conclude that this is about the non-Democrat, non-Labor and non-government members of the Senate—those who are Independents or with other parties such as the Greens—and I do not think that is fair. One of the major problems is that we never know when formality will be denied, so it could be there is not the requirement for someone who denies formality to have five people behind them in support of that denial. If we are going to go down this path, maybe that is what should happen. But that has not been considered in this proposal. Maybe that is the compromise Senator Faulkner is talking about, although I must say that I do not remember that being proposed by anybody in the Procedure Committee. 
It is a mechanism which allows us to debate difficult motions, and there is nothing wrong with that. There is no other way of debating motions at the present time. If formality is denied, it ought to be for a good reason and there ought to be an opportunity for people to say what the reason for denial is and for others to have a different view and to express that. It is a democratic process. It is about getting on the record, getting on the Hansard, why it is that this motion is deemed not to be appropriate to vote on at this point in time. It is a poor solution, in our view. The number of people required to suspend standing orders is arbitrary. The point has been made that you are not going to reach 39 if you cannot reach five. If that is the case, why not make the required number 38? That would bring you closer to knowing whether the motion was likely to be supported. Since when has there been a requirement to demonstrate an ability to win a vote before, say, going to a division? Is the next thing going to be that you cannot call a division unless you have five or, again, 38 supporters? That presupposes that everybody has made up their mind at that point in time. It just does not make any sense. One can only conclude that this is a procedural change meant to stop a problem that does not exist.
It is not going to be a trial. It does not matter how many weeks we have. There were only three suspensions in 2002; it may be six months before we have another suspension of standing orders. Should we manufacture one just so that we can see how it works? Is that what we ought to do? I think it is silly to call this a trial. It is not a trial. We are just going to change it, and that is how it will go.
I turn to the issue of not having divisions after 4.30 p.m. on Thursdays. I cannot see any logical reason for this. For some time in this place consideration has been given to those people who have to travel very long distances to get back to their constituents or to their families—which in some cases I think are more important—and pairs have been provided. There have been informal arrangements made in this place. I guarantee that after 4.30 on Thursdays there is not going to be a full complement in this place in any case. That is the arrangement we have been operating under for a very long time. There is no pressing need to suddenly change the rules. Senator Ian Campbell said that this change was not a reflection on the importance of general business. Then I would say: what about we move it? If general business is no less important, then let us shift it to Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday.
As it is, private senators' bills are shoved to the end of the week, and that in itself suggests that they are not as important. They are rarely voted on. Sometimes they are, but only when pressure can be applied by the senator, who is usually from the crossbench. Normally there is some time wasting and there are some deliberate attempts to frustrate the process of this place. The reward is given often informally and usually by the ALP, who say, `We'll allow this to go to the vote,' with agreement from the government. Otherwise it is talked out, as we in this place all know. To say that no lesser importance is being given to general business on a Thursday by not having a vote is a nonsense. It is not clear to me what happens if a vote is taken on the next day of sitting. That next day of sitting may be weeks and weeks later if that Thursday happens to be at the end of a sitting period. How will people remember what the debate was all about, even if the next sitting day is the following Monday? It hardly seems possible that disconnecting the vote from the debate is a democratic step forward. 
Again, it is no real trial. I do not even know if we will have a bill to deal with on the Thursdays remaining in this so-called trial period. No protocol has been established, as I said, for what happens when we do come to the vote. Will there be on the next day of sitting further debate before we have the vote? Who knows? Will the vote be held at the beginning of the day or at the end of the day? How does that all work? It is not at all clear to me. This has just not been thought through.
The other thing about Thursdays is that government members in particular constantly complain about the fact that we have committee meetings during sitting times and at other times between sittings and that we do not take the opportunity to use the Fridays at the end of a sitting week. I do not know how many times I have been lectured about the apparent reluctance of senators to stay over on Thursday nights in order to do what is expected of them—that is, stay here on Fridays and do committee work. The signal being sent is that Fridays are not days on which we expect to work in Canberra.
The Democrats would like to see real reform in this area but not reform that would take away the need for us to be in this place and that would further diminish the importance of this chamber and of attendance in this place. We think real reform should be about making sure that there is more time given in general business to dealing with private senators' bills, that there is no fixed period within which the debate must be completed and that there is an opportunity for the vote to be taken on that legislation so that we can see how both government and opposition members—and other members of the crossbench—will vote. That is a reasonable ask, and we should move to a system which is not just dependent on individual senators making or not making a nuisance of themselves, on informal arrangements that might be a quid pro quo or on deals done over a range of matters that are often not transparent or obvious to the rest of the chamber. That is where we need reform to general business.
In replying to the comments about general business taking up so much time, there is general business and there is general business. We have spent a lot of time this afternoon talking about what is a critically important issue. It might not be government business, but it is about the business of the Senate and it is no less important than dealing with government business. If there is not enough time for government business, let us have that debate. Let us talk about longer sitting times if that is what is necessary. Let us talk about ways in which we can facilitate government legislation. But, as we know, for almost as long as I can remember government business has been put up which is not necessary—either because we have rejected it in the past and are going to reject it again or because the government is not ready. Let us fix those problems so that we have an orderly sitting, particularly at the end of a parliamentary sitting, to deal with government business instead of talking about reform in general business time.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Procedure Committee</title>,Committees,28,1
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2004-05-11,"—I thank Senator Allison for allowing these matters to proceed to debate today because, in the general tradition of the Procedure Committee, unless we have unanimous consent we do not put matters forward. Senator Allison has graciously allowed us to debate these issues here because other members of the committee felt strongly about it, and her dissent was noted in the report quite properly. 
Senator Allison is a bit confused about one thing: the purpose of five people standing in their place. She says that there has hardly been any suspension of standing orders. That is true, but do you want to know why? Because it is a waste of time. Therefore, people allow formality and vote things down just to avoid a whole series of motions for the suspension of standing orders. What this rule does is empower people to challenge the formality of the motion. That is what it is about. Forget the dissembling from Senator Ian Campbell here today that this is just bringing it into line with urgency or MPI motions. We sat through the debate, so we know that is utter rubbish, and why that was put forward here today I have no idea. What we see as a problem in this chamber is an occasional or at times a persistent abuse of the formality process. As Senator Faulkner said, some motions are put up here that should never, ever be considered formally. They are complex and have foreign affairs knock-on complications. They should be challenged, they should be relegated to somewhere else and not determined. That is precisely the reason this particular rule is being introduced. It is a fairly generous one. It does not set the bar too high, but it makes it a little more difficult to grandstand in this place. 
Senator Allison talks about a reduction in democratic rights. If the procedures of this place are abused, all our democratic rights are reduced. That is the problem I have with this. Every time we leave a weakness in the standing orders, it is exploited by minority groups. Sometimes I think that is a good thing; sometimes it is a bad thing. This merely puts a brake on it. And, as we have pointed out, it will be tested over only a few parliamentary days. Senator Allison is quite right, though, when she says that usually when these things are tested they become an inevitability. There is an element of that, and that should be put on the record.
On the question of not having divisions after 4.30 on Thursdays, the reality of this chamber is that, if you do not want to take a vote on Thursday general business, you talk it out. There is nothing we can do about that. Governments often do it; sometimes oppositions do it. Therefore, it is irrelevant to say that we are curbing the rights of senators to have a vote on something. We are not at all. We are probably making it a little more likely. Senator Allison has said—and she might be right—that this may allow too many people to leave the chamber. That is up to the political parties. I have never shot through from here on a Thursday night, and neither has Senator Faulkner. A lot of us stay because we believe it is our duty to stay.
—As do some of us on this side, too.
—We have had only one vacuous contribution from your side, so I am glad you have doubled it, Senator Patterson. That was good of you.
—It wasn't vacuous; it was fact.
—The point being that I do not at all resent my Western Australian, North Queensland or Northern Territory colleagues heading off on a Thursday night, but I as a Victorian do not believe that I should go when the chamber sits potentially to 8.40 at night. 
There have been a number of complaints—mostly from the Greens, the Democrats and other minority groups—that not enough time is devoted to general business. I am sympathetic to that. And herein lies the answer in my view. If we do not have divisions after 4.30, I cannot see any reason why general business—which currently runs between approximately 4.30 and 6 or earlier if we get to it—cannot run through to eight o'clock. This would allow the Labor Party to give up its almost monopoly on general business. I think the Democrats get a run once a year. 
—Once or twice a year.
—Same with the Greens—maybe once a year. It is very hard for us to go back to the other issue and say that, instead of considering this matter formally, you should put it to general business, because if there is no time in general business they are left in a catch-22 position. There is absolutely no reason in these circumstances, with no quorums after 4.30, that we could not run general business through to eight o'clock, then have documents, then have committee reports and then have the adjournment. Then you would be able to sit down and negotiate and say: `I'm sorry, Democrats, but the Labor Party want first crack at this. We want from four o'clock to six o'clock to discuss it. But, by the way, after six o'clock your motion comes up.' Ironically, even though we have not got to a determination position, the no-quorum, no-division rule at 4.30 may in fact greatly increase general business. I am certainly going to raise that proposal—I think I discussed it with Senator Allison informally once—at the next Procedure Committee meeting because I do believe we do not devote enough time to general business matters. 
There is no question that the five people standing in their place rule slightly affects minority parties. The reason is that it was intended to—let us be honest—because we believe they are exploiting standing orders. It is not a massive hurdle to jump, and I hope people take a responsible attitude to it. It will mean that far more formal motions will be challenged and declared not formal, once this temporary standing order comes in. By having this rule as a sessional order, if something goes disastrously wrong with it, at least we can dump it.

"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2004-05-11,"—I move:
(1)	That standing order 61, relating to the consideration of government documents, be amended as set out in the report with immediate effect.
(2)	That the following orders operate as temporary orders until the conclusion of the 2004 June sittings: 
(a)	if a division is called for on Thursday after 4.30 pm, the matter before the Senate shall be adjourned until the next day of sitting at a time fixed by the Senate; and
(b)	if objection is made to a motion being taken as a formal motion, a proposal to suspend standing orders to allow the motion to be moved shall not be received by the President and put to the Senate unless 5 senators, including the mover of the motion, rise in their places to indicate support for the suspension motion.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,28,2
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2004-05-11,"—by leave—Firstly, I would like to suggest that this motion be separated. I put that suggestion forward because I will be voting differently on the two parts of the motion. Secondly, I want to explain why the Greens will be opposing the second part of the motion. We do not believe that any component of the Senate proceedings should be made secondary, which is effectively what this motion does. It means that private members time on Thursday afternoons will be made a matter of no determination if there is a division, whereas at all other times the Senate can make a determination.
The Greens are strong defenders of private members time; there is too little of it in the Senate. All the crossbench senators, and indeed the opposition, value private members time greatly. Effectively what is being said is that after 4.30 p.m. there are planes to be caught and if you are going back to Western Australia, Tasmania or the Northern Territory—and I understand that—it is much better to do that and not to have a vote in the chamber at that time on Thursday afternoons. I do not accept that. Change the sitting times if we must, but retain the right at all times for a deliberation when matters are being debated, not least during private members time. In my books, it will make private members time after 4.30 p.m. on Thursdays a subsidiary matter to government time. I do not know whether there is another explanation for this. I note that the vote will be put off until the next day of sitting. I believe we should not entertain that. More importantly, the second component of this motion states:
(b)	if objection is made to a motion being taken as a formal motion, a proposal to suspend standing orders to allow the motion to be moved shall not be received by the President and put to the Senate unless 5 senators, including the mover ... indicate support ...
This is another move to repress the increasing diversity of this place. As we know, and we saw it today, urgency motions can only be gotten up when supported by five senators—that means the Labor Party, the coalition or the Democrats. If urgency motions come from the Independents, the Greens or One Nation, unless they can get four people from other parties or four individuals to support them they will never, ever put one up. In fact, I have had one or two in all of my time in this place, and they were successful through the support of either the Democrats or Labor. There is an impediment to urgency motions coming forward from this corner of the house if you do not have more than five members.
The motion before the Senate effectively will extend to formal motions where there is a proposal to suspend standing orders to allow the motion to be moved and debated. You will need five members to support that process. It effectively means that the rest of the Senate will be able to remove consideration and a vote on a motion which may be very important to the individual and a supporter in this place. However, whereas two are required now for a division and for this process, five will be required in future. I cannot support a move to take away existing rights of Independent senators or smaller parties in this place in this way, and that is exactly what this will do. I do not know who will be here after the next election or five elections from now, but I am aware that there is a general tendency by the bigger parties in particular to use numbers to keep newcomers at bay. The simplest expression of that, and it applies right around the country, is to put Independents on the right-hand side of the ballot paper when everybody else goes into a ballot to see what place they get on the ballot paper. As far as Independents are concerned, they are always on the right-hand side; they never, ever get the left-hand column. Therefore, Independents get the donkey vote. Who legislated that? Not the Independents. It was legislated by the big parties of the day in all parliaments in Australia, as far as I am aware, and it is wrong. 
Here we have a proposal to further remove existing powers of Independents and smaller parties of fewer than five members in this place, and I oppose it. It is not fair. There will be all sorts of arguments about time saved and so on. We should have more private members time, and the resort to moving that `a motion being taken as a formal motion, a proposal to suspend standing orders to allow the motion to be moved' is not used frequently. In fact it has been used much less frequently in recent times than five or six years ago. This is a trial, but, as we know, trials are brought in simply to be converted into standing orders a little way down the track. We oppose the motion.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,28,2
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2004-05-11,"—At the outset I make it clear that I am not speaking in my ministerial capacity and therefore am not seeking to close the debate. I would seek to wear a hat either as a member of the committee or as a private senator, which I can do. Senator Brown, in relation to the 4.30 p.m. provision of part (2)(a) of the motion, we are very happy to have that voted on separately and will be happy to give leave if that is what is required.
Senator Brown, when talking about part (2)(a) of the motion moved by Senator Troeth, mentioned the need for this change. We say quite clearly that of course it is only on a trial basis. It is only for this session. It will, effectively, apply to only three Thursdays, from memory—we have only three sitting weeks in this session—this week's and two other Thursdays. It is being done on that basis because the consensus in the Procedure Committee was that it was a change that we would like to see. We would like to see how it operates and whether the sorts of problems that Senator Brown envisages occur. We would then have the chance to review it in the next set of sittings.
The reason for the 4.30 p.m. cut-off is as Senator Brown has predicted. It is to allow senators the same opportunity that our friends and colleagues in the other place have, and that is to get home to their constituencies at a reasonable time on Thursday evenings. It will enable them to travel to the airport without having to engage in a stressful race. It will enable them to catch aeroplanes that take many of them to the most remote parts of this incredibly large continent. Some go to North Queensland, some go to Queensland, some go to Western Australia—I declare my strong vested interest in that regard—others go to the Northern Territory, as Senator Brown mentioned, and still others go to Tasmania. That is, without any shadow of a doubt, the reason it is being done. There is no secret agenda there. 
We want to ensure that senators can get home to their constituencies on Thursday nights without having to engage in a stressful and sometimes dangerous race to the airport. A lot of highly stressed individuals around Australia and around the world actually die doing that. A lot of people have heart attacks at airports and on the way to airports. There may not be much sympathy out there for politicians rushing to airports, but I think that those of us who spend much of our lives racing to airports know that it is not a good thing to do. So we are seeking to avoid that. 
Currently, the standing order provides, almost identically, that no divisions will be taken after six o'clock. That provision was in fact put there for a similar reason, but the practical reality of airline schedules—and, I think, the practical reality after 14 September 2001, when Ansett effectively collapsed—is that there are fewer services and fewer options to get out of Canberra and travel to one of those far-flung parts of the continent. Six o'clock may have worked relatively well up until 14 September 2001, but there are now simply far fewer flights and far fewer options on Thursday evenings when you are trying to shift a couple of hundred senators and members and many hundreds more staff out of Canberra to destinations around the nation. That is the reason.
I do not think that this diminishes the value of the business that is being conducted in the Senate at the time. A good example is that you can still have votes; it is simply that you cannot have divisions. If something is controversial and needs to be voted on, then the Procedure Committee has come up with a sensible, rational and fair way of dealing with such a contested vote, and that is to have it the next time the Senate sits and everyone is here. I make the point that it does not diminish the quality or the importance of the debate that may be going on after 4.30 p.m. In fact, earlier on a Thursday—at 12.45 p.m.—it is the practice of the Senate to deal with large volumes of government legislation in what is called the non-controversial timeslot. The Senate goes through a process of working out what legislation we can deal with at that time. I make the point that legislation dealt with at that time is no less important; it is simply not legislation that requires anything other than an affirmative vote. We take votes on all of that legislation. The amount of legislation that goes through in that timeslot is quite substantial. I would hazard a guess and say that, on average, it is probably three or four bills every week. Over 20 sitting weeks that is a massive number of bills. That does not mean that those pieces of legislation are less important. So I ask Senator Brown to consider that argument.
In relation to the suspension of standing orders seeking the declaration of a motion as formal, I point out that it is already practice in the Senate that, for an urgency motion to be declared, five senators are required to stand in their places. That is standard, existing Senate practice if you want an urgency motion debated. You need that for matters of public importance as well. So it is not some sort of conspiracy to crack down on Independent senators; it is a process that brings into line existing Senate practice in relation to urgency motions and motions to deal with matters of public importance.
In relation to providing time for private senators' matters or non-government business, I point out that there are very few parts of the Senate schedule where government business is guaranteed. This afternoon is a good example of that. Since the end of question time I do not think we have dealt with any government business. We are now here at 5.36 p.m., and for some hours this afternoon we have been dealing with everything but government business. The Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer has come in to ask about her bill on whatever she is dealing with at the moment. We have told her, Senator Murray and others who are interested to come back in perhaps half an hour when this debate has finished. That is a fact. In many sections of the week, government business time is that amount of time that is left over after we have dealt with everything else. 
I am not saying that the government gets a bad shake out of this place. The reality is that through negotiations and discussion—and, 90 per cent of the time, through very good will on behalf of the opposition, Senator Brown, the Democrats, and Senator Harradine and other Independents—we ensure that we balance business between what the government needs to deal with the legislative program and what other senators need for dealing with formal motions, urgency motions, matters of public importance and even private members' bills on Thursday afternoons. I think that through it all Senator Brown would, if he were fair, say that we strike a reasonable balance in these things, and that is what we seek to do. I commend the Procedure Committee for bringing forward these proposals to amend the standing orders and create some temporary orders for the balance of these sittings—albeit the very shortest sittings in the Senate calendar this year; I think there are only 10 sitting days to go.
 (Senator McLucas)—By way of clarification: we will deal with paragraphs (2)(a) and (2)(b) separately, Senator Brown.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,28,2
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2004-05-11,"—I address myself to both of these issues. It is important for the Senate to understand that the recommendations of the Procedure Committee on the substantive issues in relation to when a division can be called—what time on Thursday afternoons in the first instance—and the procedures relating to formal motions are compromise recommendations. They are issues that the Procedure Committee has been examining for some time, particularly in relation to the question of how to deal with formal motions, and there is recognition by the committee that it is useful in this circumstance for us to recommend that a sessional order apply. The Procedure Committee is not recommending a change to the standing orders at this point; it is recommending temporary orders be put in place.
The first issue is that if a division is called for on Thursday after 4.30 p.m. then that matter be held over until the Senate next sits. I think this is a quite unremarkable change, I really do. Current standing order 57(3) states:
If a division is called for on Thursday after 6 pm, the matter before the Senate shall be adjourned until the next day of sitting at a time fixed by the Senate.
All this temporary sessional order of the Senate does is amend the time of 6 p.m. to 4.30 p.m. My maths might be wrong but I think that means, given that this would apply to the end of the current sittings period, it will be effective for only three sitting weeks—this week and the last two weeks of June, given that we have an estimates fortnight situated between them. We are talking about a proposed temporary order of the Senate to apply for three Thursdays that changes the time of this particular standing order—that is, from 6 p.m. to 4.30 p.m. I do not see this as a radical change; it is a compromise from the Procedure Committee. There is an element of, `Let's have a look at this; let's see how it works for a very limited period of time.' There is an element of the Procedure Committee having another look at it to see if a further sessional order is warranted or, as sometimes happens, proposing the consideration of a change to the Senate standing orders. It is pretty unremarkable, I have got to say. If there is a matter of great moment and dispute that leads to a division being required after 4.30 p.m., it is not as though the division will not happen—it will just not happen then. It will happen, but it just will not happen after 4.30 on the Thursday afternoon. 
—It never happens anyway.
—That is absolutely right, Senator Ray. How often do you actually have a division called for on a Thursday between 4.30 p.m. and 6 p.m.? How often does it occur? It is very, very rare. Let us not turn this into some sort of international incident or claim that it is a massive denial of democratic rights; it is not. But if perchance it does not work, and I think that is rather unlikely, the Procedure Committee can have a look at it in the very near future. I would like to think, given the spirit with which it dealt with this proposal in the first instance, it will come forward with a sensible recommendation.
Having said that about the first of the proposals that have exercised Senator Brown a little, let me now turn to the second one—which I think is a more substantive issue. This goes to the way formal motions are dealt with in this chamber. Every senator in this chamber knows—
—The third one; is that what you're talking about?
—(2)(b).
—Or not to be.
—That is the question. Can we divide on it? Paragraph (2)(b) is a matter of greater substance, and most senators in this chamber know it is also a matter which has concerned the opposition for a considerable period.
One useful thing I think the Procedure Committee has done is produce this report, which gives a valuable history of the way formal motions have developed. Their use has changed since they were included in the first set of Senate standing orders in 1903. It is a massive change; but most of that evolution has occurred over recent years. I think the Senate would be aware that the opposition have been concerned that some motions adopted by the Senate—particularly motions on foreign policy—run the risk of being misunderstood by other sovereign governments. The distinction between the Senate agreeing to a motion and the executive government adopting a position is something that is not well understood. It is a very poor mechanism to adopt. It is a very blunt instrument for us to deal with. 
One of the great weaknesses of these formal notices of motion is that senators are asked to either agree or disagree with formality: you either agree with the motion as it is moved by the senator or you do not. The capacity for amendment is not available to any senator, except on occasions when it occurs by negotiation—and that is a small minority of occasions. You cannot amend it. In some areas the nuances of these motions are important. It does make a difference how motions are worded, and small amendments can make a difference. So it is a blunt instrument. If you agree to formality, you are forced to vote either in favour of it or against it. 
What is the alternative? It is to declare such a motion `not formal'. If you declare such a motion not formal, it is then the right of the senator who has proposed the motion to move a suspension of standing orders—an automatic right. As a result of amendments to the standing orders proposed by me when I was Manager of Government Business in the Senate in the good old days when Labor was in government, those debates on the suspension of standing orders are now limited to half an hour, five minutes per speaker. But it is still a half-hour chunk out of the day. At the end of the day, you determine an issue by voting on whether to suspend standing orders to debate the motion or not. Again, it is an unsatisfactory situation.  
I do not say that this has necessarily been abused by senators. You could say that this mechanism has been abused; I do not say that. This is a mechanism available to senators in the Senate standing orders. There have been absurd congratulatory motions concerning sports men, women and others—some have been for quite significant achievements, but some have been for the odd achievement or the odd issue that was pretty trifling—and the chairs themselves have attempted at times to rule such things out of order. But it is the issue of substance that is of concern to the opposition, and we have argued for a long time that it ought to be of concern to the government, particularly in the area of foreign policy. The government have not shared those concerns. They share them now, but they were not willing to act when the opposition made strenuous attempts after Labor lost government in 1996 to see if we could make some changes to the way this particular provision of the standing orders worked. We were unsuccessful in that. Now there is a broader acceptance, we need to do something about it. 
It is said that this is antidemocratic in some way, that it stifles the voice of minorities in the chamber. I do not think that is true. I do not think a substantive argument can be made to suggest that that is the case. Frankly, if you are unable to get five senators to stand in their place to call on a debate for the suspension of standing orders, you have got Buckley's of getting to 39. That is the truth. That is the hard, bottom line politics of this. If you cannot get five people to stand up in their place to bring on a debate about a matter, what chance have you got, really, of seeing such a thing being carried? At the end of the day, so much of the way this chamber works is by negotiation off chamber—in the margins. That is how it works. Most of these sorts of debates are the exception, not the rule. Most of these sorts of matters are matters of negotiation between whips, between managers and between others—at times even party leaders have some responsibilities in these areas. There are senators in the government and in the opposition responsible for chamber management, and those on the crossbenches also take an active role in chamber management. 
I frankly believe that this is the case on key issues, on priority issues. When a senator believes that something is of sufficient significance that it ought to be brought on for an opportunity to consider whether a formal motion should be agreed to, I am not in much doubt that a senator will not receive support. But it does put a brake on this procedure. It does send a signal to all of us in the Senate that this is a procedure, a mechanism, in the standing orders that has spun out of control over the past number of years. This is an attempt to say, `Is there a sensible, fair and reasonable way of trying to adopt a procedure that is going to work in the best interests of the Senate as a whole?'
I think you can make a very strong argument, by the way, for more dedicated time for non-government business—or general business, as it is described. I believe that in the not too far distant future in this chamber we will hear more arguments presenting that point of view. I think governments of any political persuasion, if they are smart, will say: `This is quite reasonable. If we can dedicate more time to that, it might be a good idea but, on the other hand, let us see if we can dedicate some time to government business.' The point that the Manager of Government Business in the Senate makes about the capacity for government business time to be gobbled up on a pretty regular basis has some truth to it, but there is a quid pro quo in this sort of thing—if you want more general business time with the capacity for non-government senators to debate business in this place, the other side of the ledger is more dedicated time for government business. 
This is the sort of thing we ought to be looking at if we are serious about reform in this chamber. I would commend that to the government, the opposition, the minor parties and the Independents as a way forward in dealing with some of these age-old problems. I believe that, on this particular occasion, the Procedure Committee has taken a pretty balanced view of what is a difficult, growing and quite serious problem. That is where the opposition come from on this matter. We accept that the debate on general business motions—the mechanism of general business notices of motion—has evolved and developed in a way that was never intended. This proposed mechanism, which will apply for about 12 sitting days only, is a start to addressing it. I am all in favour of the Procedure Committee, after it has applied for what will literally be a handful of days, taking a good hard look at how effective it has been, seeing whether it stands the test of scrutiny and applying its mind to how this issue should be addressed in the future. The opposition have identified it as a problem for a long time now. We believe the Procedure Committee has adopted a balanced view; it is a compromise position. I personally believe, as do my colleagues, that it is likely to be an improvement. We certainly believe it is worth testing and trialling for the few remaining weeks of this session. It is for all those reasons—and they are important reasons—that the opposition will support this proposal.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,28,2
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2004-05-11,"—I rise to indicate that the Democrats will not support the no divisions provision, 2(a), or the formality suspension of standing orders provision, 2(b). I will take 2(b) first so I can respond to Senator Faulkner's remarks. Some figures have just been passed to me. Senator Faulkner said this has spun out of control and that it is a serious problem that needs to be addressed because it was never intended that this procedure be so demanding on the Senate's time. My response is that, in 2002, there were three motions to suspend standing orders. From the records I have, there were more in 1994, 1995 and 1996 than at any other time. There were 10 in 1994, 14 in 1995 and 19 in 1996, so it is hardly a problem that has suddenly emerged as a big issue and a great time waster. I think it is exaggerating the problem, to say the least.
It is a poor solution to what is really a nonexistent problem. The number of senators required to support this measure is totally arbitrary. It has some connection with being in support of an urgency motion or a matter of public importance, but that is all. Otherwise you could just say that it is designed to keep those who cannot muster five senators from doing this. Of course, what we know is that standing orders are suspended largely by the crossbench. I am the whip of the Democrats, and we have seven senators. Even with a lot of forewarning and notice, it can be quite difficult to muster five people into the chamber at one point in time, not because it is difficult to contact them or anything of that sort but because people have other commitments such as meetings they cannot get out of or committee work. There is a whole range of reasons why people find it difficult to get into the chamber at a point in time. Often we have to wait a length of time, so it is also time wasting. I would argue that we need to reform that system. From our point of view, it is an unnecessary barrier to a process that should be available.
You cannot do anything but conclude that this is about the non-Democrat, non-Labor and non-government members of the Senate—those who are Independents or with other parties such as the Greens—and I do not think that is fair. One of the major problems is that we never know when formality will be denied, so it could be there is not the requirement for someone who denies formality to have five people behind them in support of that denial. If we are going to go down this path, maybe that is what should happen. But that has not been considered in this proposal. Maybe that is the compromise Senator Faulkner is talking about, although I must say that I do not remember that being proposed by anybody in the Procedure Committee. 
It is a mechanism which allows us to debate difficult motions, and there is nothing wrong with that. There is no other way of debating motions at the present time. If formality is denied, it ought to be for a good reason and there ought to be an opportunity for people to say what the reason for denial is and for others to have a different view and to express that. It is a democratic process. It is about getting on the record, getting on the Hansard, why it is that this motion is deemed not to be appropriate to vote on at this point in time. It is a poor solution, in our view. The number of people required to suspend standing orders is arbitrary. The point has been made that you are not going to reach 39 if you cannot reach five. If that is the case, why not make the required number 38? That would bring you closer to knowing whether the motion was likely to be supported. Since when has there been a requirement to demonstrate an ability to win a vote before, say, going to a division? Is the next thing going to be that you cannot call a division unless you have five or, again, 38 supporters? That presupposes that everybody has made up their mind at that point in time. It just does not make any sense. One can only conclude that this is a procedural change meant to stop a problem that does not exist.
It is not going to be a trial. It does not matter how many weeks we have. There were only three suspensions in 2002; it may be six months before we have another suspension of standing orders. Should we manufacture one just so that we can see how it works? Is that what we ought to do? I think it is silly to call this a trial. It is not a trial. We are just going to change it, and that is how it will go.
I turn to the issue of not having divisions after 4.30 p.m. on Thursdays. I cannot see any logical reason for this. For some time in this place consideration has been given to those people who have to travel very long distances to get back to their constituents or to their families—which in some cases I think are more important—and pairs have been provided. There have been informal arrangements made in this place. I guarantee that after 4.30 on Thursdays there is not going to be a full complement in this place in any case. That is the arrangement we have been operating under for a very long time. There is no pressing need to suddenly change the rules. Senator Ian Campbell said that this change was not a reflection on the importance of general business. Then I would say: what about we move it? If general business is no less important, then let us shift it to Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday.
As it is, private senators' bills are shoved to the end of the week, and that in itself suggests that they are not as important. They are rarely voted on. Sometimes they are, but only when pressure can be applied by the senator, who is usually from the crossbench. Normally there is some time wasting and there are some deliberate attempts to frustrate the process of this place. The reward is given often informally and usually by the ALP, who say, `We'll allow this to go to the vote,' with agreement from the government. Otherwise it is talked out, as we in this place all know. To say that no lesser importance is being given to general business on a Thursday by not having a vote is a nonsense. It is not clear to me what happens if a vote is taken on the next day of sitting. That next day of sitting may be weeks and weeks later if that Thursday happens to be at the end of a sitting period. How will people remember what the debate was all about, even if the next sitting day is the following Monday? It hardly seems possible that disconnecting the vote from the debate is a democratic step forward. 
Again, it is no real trial. I do not even know if we will have a bill to deal with on the Thursdays remaining in this so-called trial period. No protocol has been established, as I said, for what happens when we do come to the vote. Will there be on the next day of sitting further debate before we have the vote? Who knows? Will the vote be held at the beginning of the day or at the end of the day? How does that all work? It is not at all clear to me. This has just not been thought through.
The other thing about Thursdays is that government members in particular constantly complain about the fact that we have committee meetings during sitting times and at other times between sittings and that we do not take the opportunity to use the Fridays at the end of a sitting week. I do not know how many times I have been lectured about the apparent reluctance of senators to stay over on Thursday nights in order to do what is expected of them—that is, stay here on Fridays and do committee work. The signal being sent is that Fridays are not days on which we expect to work in Canberra.
The Democrats would like to see real reform in this area but not reform that would take away the need for us to be in this place and that would further diminish the importance of this chamber and of attendance in this place. We think real reform should be about making sure that there is more time given in general business to dealing with private senators' bills, that there is no fixed period within which the debate must be completed and that there is an opportunity for the vote to be taken on that legislation so that we can see how both government and opposition members—and other members of the crossbench—will vote. That is a reasonable ask, and we should move to a system which is not just dependent on individual senators making or not making a nuisance of themselves, on informal arrangements that might be a quid pro quo or on deals done over a range of matters that are often not transparent or obvious to the rest of the chamber. That is where we need reform to general business.
In replying to the comments about general business taking up so much time, there is general business and there is general business. We have spent a lot of time this afternoon talking about what is a critically important issue. It might not be government business, but it is about the business of the Senate and it is no less important than dealing with government business. If there is not enough time for government business, let us have that debate. Let us talk about longer sitting times if that is what is necessary. Let us talk about ways in which we can facilitate government legislation. But, as we know, for almost as long as I can remember government business has been put up which is not necessary—either because we have rejected it in the past and are going to reject it again or because the government is not ready. Let us fix those problems so that we have an orderly sitting, particularly at the end of a parliamentary sitting, to deal with government business instead of talking about reform in general business time.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,28,2
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2004-05-11,"—I thank Senator Allison for allowing these matters to proceed to debate today because, in the general tradition of the Procedure Committee, unless we have unanimous consent we do not put matters forward. Senator Allison has graciously allowed us to debate these issues here because other members of the committee felt strongly about it, and her dissent was noted in the report quite properly. 
Senator Allison is a bit confused about one thing: the purpose of five people standing in their place. She says that there has hardly been any suspension of standing orders. That is true, but do you want to know why? Because it is a waste of time. Therefore, people allow formality and vote things down just to avoid a whole series of motions for the suspension of standing orders. What this rule does is empower people to challenge the formality of the motion. That is what it is about. Forget the dissembling from Senator Ian Campbell here today that this is just bringing it into line with urgency or MPI motions. We sat through the debate, so we know that is utter rubbish, and why that was put forward here today I have no idea. What we see as a problem in this chamber is an occasional or at times a persistent abuse of the formality process. As Senator Faulkner said, some motions are put up here that should never, ever be considered formally. They are complex and have foreign affairs knock-on complications. They should be challenged, they should be relegated to somewhere else and not determined. That is precisely the reason this particular rule is being introduced. It is a fairly generous one. It does not set the bar too high, but it makes it a little more difficult to grandstand in this place. 
Senator Allison talks about a reduction in democratic rights. If the procedures of this place are abused, all our democratic rights are reduced. That is the problem I have with this. Every time we leave a weakness in the standing orders, it is exploited by minority groups. Sometimes I think that is a good thing; sometimes it is a bad thing. This merely puts a brake on it. And, as we have pointed out, it will be tested over only a few parliamentary days. Senator Allison is quite right, though, when she says that usually when these things are tested they become an inevitability. There is an element of that, and that should be put on the record.
On the question of not having divisions after 4.30 on Thursdays, the reality of this chamber is that, if you do not want to take a vote on Thursday general business, you talk it out. There is nothing we can do about that. Governments often do it; sometimes oppositions do it. Therefore, it is irrelevant to say that we are curbing the rights of senators to have a vote on something. We are not at all. We are probably making it a little more likely. Senator Allison has said—and she might be right—that this may allow too many people to leave the chamber. That is up to the political parties. I have never shot through from here on a Thursday night, and neither has Senator Faulkner. A lot of us stay because we believe it is our duty to stay.
—As do some of us on this side, too.
—We have had only one vacuous contribution from your side, so I am glad you have doubled it, Senator Patterson. That was good of you.
—It wasn't vacuous; it was fact.
—The point being that I do not at all resent my Western Australian, North Queensland or Northern Territory colleagues heading off on a Thursday night, but I as a Victorian do not believe that I should go when the chamber sits potentially to 8.40 at night. 
There have been a number of complaints—mostly from the Greens, the Democrats and other minority groups—that not enough time is devoted to general business. I am sympathetic to that. And herein lies the answer in my view. If we do not have divisions after 4.30, I cannot see any reason why general business—which currently runs between approximately 4.30 and 6 or earlier if we get to it—cannot run through to eight o'clock. This would allow the Labor Party to give up its almost monopoly on general business. I think the Democrats get a run once a year. 
—Once or twice a year.
—Same with the Greens—maybe once a year. It is very hard for us to go back to the other issue and say that, instead of considering this matter formally, you should put it to general business, because if there is no time in general business they are left in a catch-22 position. There is absolutely no reason in these circumstances, with no quorums after 4.30, that we could not run general business through to eight o'clock, then have documents, then have committee reports and then have the adjournment. Then you would be able to sit down and negotiate and say: `I'm sorry, Democrats, but the Labor Party want first crack at this. We want from four o'clock to six o'clock to discuss it. But, by the way, after six o'clock your motion comes up.' Ironically, even though we have not got to a determination position, the no-quorum, no-division rule at 4.30 may in fact greatly increase general business. I am certainly going to raise that proposal—I think I discussed it with Senator Allison informally once—at the next Procedure Committee meeting because I do believe we do not devote enough time to general business matters. 
There is no question that the five people standing in their place rule slightly affects minority parties. The reason is that it was intended to—let us be honest—because we believe they are exploiting standing orders. It is not a massive hurdle to jump, and I hope people take a responsible attitude to it. It will mean that far more formal motions will be challenged and declared not formal, once this temporary standing order comes in. By having this rule as a sessional order, if something goes disastrously wrong with it, at least we can dump it.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2004-05-11,"—I was going to go straight to the proposed amendment and seek some answers from the minister. I notice Senator Coonan is not here at present. I wanted to ask the minister a question about the effect of clause 87J, which appears on page 9. Clause 87J deals with the effect of minority or incapacity. It states: 
In working out whether the period of 3 years after the date of discoverability, or the long-stop period, has expired, disregard any period during which the plaintiff has been:
(a)	a minor who is not in the custody of a capable parent or guardian; or
(b)	an incapacitated person in respect of whom there is no guardian, and no other person to manage all or part of the person's estate ...
Has the minister considered the essence of my proposed amendment? Does she consider that the amendment I am thinking about moving would not be necessary? The amendment that I am proposing reads:
(3)	Where a court is satisfied that a person is unable to commence a proceeding within 3 years because of factors which prevent the person commencing the proceeding such as:
(a)	the person is a minor; or
(b)	the person is incapacitated; or
(c)	the person is 65 years of age or more;
the court may extend the period of 3 years to 4 years.
My question to the minister is: is that already totally covered by 87J?",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INJURIES AND DEATH) BILL (NO. 2) 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1
"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,2004-05-11,"—I think that Senator Harradine will know that this is not my area of expertise. However, I did come across some of these issues when we were addressing the medical indemnity issue. The senator has referred to two scenarios that he is particularly concerned about. The first scenario was that of a 12-year-old boy who was injured in a surgical procedure. I am advised this type of situation will already be covered by the bill we are debating today. Any period during which there is no guardian or capable parent to bring an action will be disregarded for the purpose of calculating the date of discoverability or long-stop periods. As an additional protection for a period when there is a capable parent or guardian, the date of discoverability will only be determined on the basis of facts that a capable parent or guardian knows or ought to know. If it could not be reasonably determined that an injury had occurred, an element of discoverability would not be met and time for commencing an action would not run.
The second scenario that Senator Harradine has raised was that of a one-month-old child injured in hospital due to negligence. Similar protections, I am advised, would operate for determining the date of discoverability in this situation as I have just outlined. In addition, similar protections would also operate to cover personal injuries and personal injury claims by incapacitated persons during any period without a guardian, assuming of course that the requirements for TPA liability could be met. There are adequate protections in place for each of these groups, assuming they can establish the additional requirements for TPA liability. I will now leave the expert to take over. I am sure you will get much better answers.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INJURIES AND DEATH) BILL (NO. 2) 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,2004-05-11,"—I think Senator Patterson filled the role perfectly. Clause 87J says the period does not start running where:
... an incapacitated person in respect of whom there is no guardian, and no other person to manage all or part of the person's estate, under a law of a State or Territory relating to the protection of incapacitated persons.
Minister, does the statement delivered by Senator Patterson apply to incapacitated persons? ",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (PERSONAL INJURIES AND DEATH) BILL (NO. 2) 2004</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,30,1
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2004-05-11,"—Yes, that situation would apply. The whole scheme of the proposed section is to cover, appropriately, personal injuries claims by incapacitated persons during any period without a guardian. That, of course, assumes that the conditions for liability for the Trade Practices Act could be met. Provided someone could be liable, someone incapacitated will be protected for the period that they do not have a competent person to take action on their behalf.

"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,2004-05-11,"—The budget speech I have just heard has left me speechless.
—Well, what are you making a speech for?
—That is a good point. There was so much pork in it that I feel absolutely full up, and it is very difficult to speak when you are full. There are not many things that surprise me as much as that budget did. I am going to focus on an area where I perhaps have more expertise than I have in some of the other areas that were covered. The area I want to discuss first is the tax cut area. It was obvious from last year's discourse by the Leader of the Opposition, who was then shadow Treasurer, by the Prime Minister and by the Treasurer that big tax cuts were inevitable. It was the Australian Democrats' view that the way to approach tax cuts was to lower the rate and broaden the base. I heard discussion today about lowering the rates for higher and middle income earners, but those higher and middle income earners who benefit from a lower rate for themselves did not have that paid for by broadening the base. The Democrats believe that to address issues of equity in tax you need to begin with low income earners. On that basis we have been arguing for a significant increase in the tax free threshold rate from its present level of over $6,000 to somewhere up to $10,000. I remind the chamber that it would have cost around $18 billion to raise the tax free threshold to $20,000. 
However, the government has not gone that route. So we are faced with a circumstance where the government is going to bring to the Senate a tax cut regime that will need Senate approval. There are only two parties which can make that happen. The Greens will have a lot to say but will have absolutely no effect. I would remind the media that, until 1 July 2005 and even then depending on the outcome of the election this year, the Greens will continue to have no effect on deliberations of this kind. If you look at the Greens record over the last number of years, you will find that they are best characterised by saying no, but whether they say no or yes has been irrelevant in numerical terms, although not irrelevant in political terms. I acknowledge Senator Brown and Senator Nettle as being extremely capable in political terms but in numerical terms on legislation they will be irrelevant not only for this budget but for the next budget. So it is left to Labor and us. If Labor agree with the government's tax cuts recommendation, through it will go. If Labor disagree, it will be up to us, and I can assure the government that we will want more attention paid to low-income earners. It is not that we do not recognise the virtue of assisting middle-income earners, but we think low-income earners have the priority.
In turning to issues of tax and spend, the Democrats believe that the priority for expenditure is on those issues which consumers and voters feel very strongly about, namely health and education. I would note that the budget speech did address new expenditure in both those areas, some of which looked pretty attractive. But the issue for us has always been how we would pay for them. The Democrats have been at pains over many years to be very precise about our ability to pay for matters that are important to the community's needs, and we have not been afraid to put our money where our mouth is. It was the Democrats, with the coalition, who provided what is now nearly $30 billion worth of revenue through the GST. That was opposed, as you would recall, by both the Labor Party and the Greens, yet both parties—like us—demand extra expenditure in health and education. I am absolutely certain that there is no possibility whatsoever that Labor will ever walk away from the GST because of the certain income stream which has been guaranteed for essential expenditure in the states. The Greens, however, have a policy of abolishing the GST.
All these thoughts were brought to my mind by one of those powder puff interviews which it seems Senator Brown often receives these days. In this case it was the Sunday Sunrise interview on Channel 7 by its chief political correspondent, Mark Riley. I know there is no-one in this chamber more capable of combating tough questioning and being able to handle himself—Senator Brown is no baby—but this powder puff interview was quite extraordinary because not only did they fail to elicit the fact that Senator Brown and Senator Nettle cannot influence any of the legislative outcomes which will emerge from the budget but they failed to ask the most basic of questions. Senator Brown, quite rightly, pushed hard for greater expenditure on health, education and other areas. The next question that should have been asked—and was not—was: `How are you going to pay for that?'
There are ways of paying for that. One of the ways the Greens do intend to pay for it is by increasing taxes quite considerably. They opposed the reduction in corporate taxes which Labor and the Democrats supported. Those reductions were accompanied by broadening the base and, as a result, the increase in corporate taxation since that date has been quite extravagant. It has been very, very significant. I do not think the Greens at that time understood that that would be the consequence, and I do not think they understand that if they abolish the GST, as they choose to do, they are going to have to raise direct taxes by the $30 billion that they would so save. So I would expect an interviewer like Mark Riley, who is not inexperienced, to ask a few tough questions like: `You want to do this, that and the other. How are you going to pay for it? What are you going to do? What are your views on taxation? And do you have or are you likely to have the numbers to deliver those outcomes?' I am sure, knowing Senator Brown and his abilities, he would have had an answer for those questions, but those questions were not asked. 
That means that the Democrats and Labor will be left with the choice of determining the Senate view not only for this budget but for the 2005 budget, and on this budget hangs a great deal because it is a huge budget and a very significant expenditure leap for the government. I look forward hopefully to the challenge of negotiating with the Treasurer on these matters—that is, if Labor opens the door and gives us the opportunity to do so.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Budget 2004-05</title>,Adjournment,32,1

The answer read as follows—
SENATOR ALLISON—My question is directed to Senator Campbell, representing the Minister for Health and Ageing.
Is the Minister aware that Parkinson's is the second most common degenerative neurological condition after Alzheimer's, with 40,000 people suffering from the disease? Given the emphasis this government has placed on challenges facing Australia as our population ages, what resources have been made available to people suffering from this disease? Can the minister explain why the state based support groups for Parkinson's sufferers and their carers receive no federal funding, whale for instance, the multiple sclerosis societies, also very worthwhile organisations, do? Can the minister confirm that while MS sufferers receive on average $1,200 in annual funding, sufferers of Parkinson's Disease set just $2?
Supplementary question
I asked the minister to explain why the State based support groups for Parkinson's sufferers and their carers receive no federal funding while, for instance, the multiple sclerosis societies, also very worthwhile organisations, do. Can the minister go back to the question that I ask and explain why there is this difference?
SENATOR IAN CAMPBELL—The Minister for Health and Ageing has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
The Department of Health and Ageing is unaware of any funding being provided to MS Societies through its programs. 
For your information, the Minister for Health and Ageing, the Hon Tony Abbott has approved the establishment of the Neuroscience Consultative Task Force and associated expenditure. This is the Australian Government's main response to the Prime Minister's Science, Engineering and Innovation Council (PMSEIC) Brain and Mind Disorders! Impact of the Neurosciences report.
The report finds that brain and mind disorders pose the highest health, economic and social capital attrition burden to Australia of any disease group. These disorders will require novel means of prevention and cost-effective treatment achieved through intensified cross-disciplinary scientific research in order to understand their biological basis.
The Neuroscience Consultative Task Force will integrate neuroscience and psychiatric research with social science, frontier technologies and industry to help position Australia's scientific capacity to reduce the burden of brain and mind disorders, including Parkinson's disease.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title> Health: Parkinson's Disease</title>,Questions Without Notice,33,1
