Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (11:16):  On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit I present the following reports: Report 436: Review of the 2011-12 Defence Materiel Organisation major projects report; and Report 437: Review of Auditor-General's reports Nos 2 to 10 (2012-13).


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the reports were made parliamentary papers.




Mr OAKESHOTT:
  by leave—The first report I have tabled today is the committee's Review of the 2011-12 Defence Materiel Organisation major projects report. This was the fifth annual major projects report to be produced by the audit office and the DMO. This year's report covers 29 projects with a combined budget of over $47 billion. The committee's aim in reviewing the MPR is to help to maximise transparency and accountability in the Defence acquisition process. The committee has made a range of recommendations directed towards this. Out of courtesy, the committee's deputy chair will shortly seek leave to make some additional comments on this report and its recommendations. I will focus my comments on the review of the Auditor-General's reports on the Indigenous programs.


The committee reviewed three audit reports on government programs and services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians—the second report that I have tabled today. These are important days for Australia as we try to reconcile many issues for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and how Australian public policy does or does not deliver. Want for better is strong, and effort is commendable. Despite more success stories in recent times in service delivery and community empowerment, the frustrations of failure remain unacceptably high.


On reviewing nine reports presented to the parliament by the Auditor-General between August and November 2012 the committee concentrated its detailed scrutiny on an audit of the Australian government coordination arrangements for Indigenous programs. The committee extended the scope of its inquiry to include two other audit reports tabled by the Auditor-General earlier in 2012 which were similarly focused on the delivery of services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. The committee chose to focus on this topic due to: firstly, our responsibility to verify that the large amounts of government spending in this area are efficient and effective; secondly, the need to make sure public policy is helping to empower Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in the best way possible; and, thirdly, the fact that the focus on coordination issues gets to the heart of what needs to be done to improve the availability and accessibility of services for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.


A key message from the committee's review of the three audits was the need for stronger, clearer and more effective leadership across government. This requires a lead agency for Indigenous affairs with authority, and a clear mandate to oversee expenditure, monitor outcomes, define priorities and drive actions at a whole-of-government level. FaHCSIA has made commendable progress recently in approving the level of coordination between government agencies. However, the committee was not convinced that the current arrangements provided the authority needed to drive outcomes as effectively as possible. With this in mind, the committee has recommended that the Prime Minister commission a review of leadership and collaboration arrangements for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, with a goal of strengthening the authority of the lead agency to drive outcomes across departments. The committee has also recommended an explicit, whole-of-government strategy for: capacity development to overcome the current, piecemeal approach to this issue; improvements to the availability of location based data on Indigenous expenditure and outcomes; updates on efforts to measure outcomes in priority remote service delivery communities; and options to be pursued for improving Indigenous representation in decision-making processes.


Of course, what matters most is results. As a nation we are progressing on a long road of correcting open wounds of the past and finding ways to walk together in the future. For all of us, an Australian culture celebrating 40,000 years has so much more strength than one confined to 200-odd years. Finding ways to achieve this under, within and around existing Crown law is our great challenge. I am pleased that there have recently been signs of real progress being made in some areas. Sustained efforts to improve leadership and coordination in Indigenous service delivery will be central to this progress being built upon into the future.


On behalf of the committee I sincerely thank the organisations and individuals who participated in this inquiry for their time and their valuable input. I also thank the committee secretariat once again for its very good work in putting up with all committee MPs. I commend the reports to the House.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (11:22):  by leave—As the chair of the committee has just mentioned, the 2011-12 Major Projects Report was the fifth to be produced by the Defence Materiel Organisation in conjunction with the Australian National Audit Office. Over the past five years, the report has grown into a valuable tool for enhancing the transparency and accessibility of information available on Australia's largest defence projects. The committee's review of the 2011-12 MPR consisted of a public hearing attended by the DMO and the Audit Office, and a range of written questions to the DMO. 


This year's Major Projects Report included the results of a survey of external stakeholders, commissioned by the DMO, on the use by and value of the report. Although the response rate to the survey was low, the results indicate that the MPR is generally seen as a valuable asset for improving the accessibility of information. However, the results also suggest that more can be done to improve the transparency, clarity and accuracy of information in the report. Improving these aspects of the report was the focus of the committee's recommendations in the report tabled today. 


The committee's review also examined the presentation of financial information in the report; project schedule slippage; and DMO governance and business processes. The committee has made recommendations aimed at: supporting the development of meaningful project financial assurance statements; disclosing information on the expenditure of project contingency funds; improving consistency in the application of project 'maturity scores'; and taking a more strategic approach to business systems improvements. 


The committee also examined the issue of enhancing the existing level of public reporting on the DMO's sustainment of capability functions. This is an area I am particularly interested in. Sustainment is expected to take up more than 50 per cent of the DMO's budget in 2013-14, yet the current level of reporting on sustainment is limited to a small amount of high-level performance and expenditure information on the DMO's top 20 sustainment products. Following questions from committee members, the DMO has now agreed to increase its reporting to cover the top 30 sustainment products. However, the committee remains concerned that, while this proposal may increase the breadth of reporting, it does nothing to increase its depth. The committee has recommended that the Department of Defence report back to it, prior to the final sittings of the 43rd Parliament in June, on how it intends to increase the transparency of sustainment information. There are examples, I understand, of other defence agencies throughout the world which provide a greater depth of information on sustainment elements of projects, acknowledging the sensitivity of these areas and the fact that quite often we are in operational environments here and so it is particularly important that we balance those sensitivities with the need for greater transparency.


In closing, I would like to sincerely thank agency representatives who were involved in this inquiry for their cooperative approach in support of the committee's role of scrutinising the spending of public money.

Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (11:26):  I rise on behalf of the shadow Treasurer to speak on this Tax Laws Amendment (2013 Measures No. 1) Bill. The bill has three schedules. Firstly, it seeks to strengthen integrity rules for scrip-for-scrip rollover in relation to small business and other concessions. Secondly, it seeks to provide tax exemption status for certain ex gratia payments for natural disasters. Thirdly, it seeks to extend tax deductibility status to ethics education. In relation to the third schedule the coalition has a number of reservations in relation to the broad drafting, and in the consideration in detail stage we will seek to remove this schedule from the bill. This was foreshadowed yesterday by our shadow Assistant Treasurer, Senator Mathias Cormann.


First, let me deal with the first two schedules. The first schedule seeks to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to ensure that certain integrity rules in the small business concessions and the scrip-for-scrip rollover apply to life insurance companies, superannuation funds and trusts in the same way that they apply to other types of entities. Scrip-for-scrip rollover is where a company is allowed to defer a capital gains tax gain until a later CGT event happens with its shares. The connected entity test in the small business entity provisions ensures that assets and turnover of related entities are taken into account in determining whether the limits for access to the relevant small business concessions have been exceeded. The significant in-common stakeholder tests contained in the CGT scrip-for-scrip rollover are designed to ensure that an entity that has a sufficiently high level of ownership in both the original and acquiring entity cannot use the rollover to defer tax indefinitely on the disposal of the underlying assets of the original entity. 


The changes contained in schedule 1 of this bill seek to ensure that the small business connected entity test and the CGT scrip-for-scrip rollover stakeholder tests apply on the basis of who owns relevant interests in the entity rather than who benefits from those interests. Schedule 1 to this bill ensures that these integrity rules and the capital gains tax provisions more generally are applied as if absolutely entitled beneficiaries, bankrupt individuals, companies in liquidation and security providers are the owners of relevant assets. That is, in these provisions the nominal owners are looked through to the underlying owners of such assets. These changes are largely integrity measures, as the coalition recognises. The scrip-for-scrip rollover integrity provisions that apply to individuals and companies also apply to trusts, superannuation funds and life insurance companies.


Some trusts, superannuation funds and life insurance companies consider the integrity provisions do not apply to them because, as the stakeholders, they own the interest for the benefit of others—that is, the beneficiaries—rather than for their own benefit. The government claims this was never the intended interpretation of the integrity provisions. Following the release of the government's 2013-14 budget, which showed a marked deterioration in budget settings, the coalition announced that we reserve the right to accept all savings put forward in previous budgets that were yet to be legislated. This falls into that category.


The integrity rule changes are retrospective and align with the date these changes were announced—being 10 May 2011—and, from the 2011-12 budget, to transactions that occur from the time of that announcement. The look-through treatment provisions were announced on 8 May 2012 as part of the 2012-13 budget. The look-through treatment provisions, whilst potentially retrospective, do not disadvantage taxpayers as they are optional until the commencement of these provisions. The measures are worth $220 million in additional revenue for the budget over the forward estimates and, as stated at the outset, the coalition will not oppose these changes.


Schedule 2 to the bill also amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to exempt from income tax the disaster income recovery subsidy for people who have lost income as a result of disasters occurring across Australia during the period 3 January this year to 30 September this year. The coalition is of course supportive of the schedule.


Schedule 3 seeks to add a new deductible gift recipient category to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. It seeks to extend tax deductibility to donations to public funds established solely for providing education in ethics in government schools in Australia as an alternative to religious instruction, where the ethics education to be provided is in accordance with state or territory law. Currently, the tax laws contain a deductible gift recipient general category for organisations which provide religious instruction in government schools but there is no category for ethics classes.


As I foreshadowed at the outset, as drafted, the coalition has reservations in relation to this schedule of the bill. As the shadow Assistant Treasurer, Senator Cormann, said yesterday, the coalition has no philosophical objection to ethics classes, but we do not think that it is appropriate at this point that a whole new category be created. The coalition believes that the government's proposal to introduce an entire new general category of deductible gift recipients in relation to ethics education is too rushed—as has often been the case—and too broad.


At present there is one provider of relevant services nationally, Primary Ethics, who provide services in one state only, and that is New South Wales. There is a method available under the current income tax laws now to provide DGR status to that organisation if the government chose to specifically propose the listing of that organisation. Given that there is only one provider who sought such a listing and was rejected by the government, it would seem more appropriate to consider these requests on a case-by-case basis rather than open up a whole new category at this point in time. In this context, the implications of starting a whole new category, instead of approving the one listing requested, need more careful consideration. For that reason, the coalition will move in the consideration in detail stage to excise this schedule from the bill.


In conclusion, as stated at the outset, we will not be opposing the bill. We acknowledge the integrity measures put forward by the government within schedule 1 in relation to the integrity rules for scrip-for-scrip in its application to life insurance companies, superannuation funds and trusts in the same way they apply to other types of entities. We also welcome tax exemption for natural disasters, contained in schedule 2 of this bill. For the reasons that I have outlined, the coalition will be seeking in the consideration in detail stage to move an amendment to remove schedule 3 from the bill.

"Bradbury, David, MP",ALP,2013-05-29,"



Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (11:34):  I would like to thank the member for Casey for his contribution to the Tax Laws Amendment (2013 Measures No. 1) Bill 2013, although I will take issue with a number of the things that he said in his contribution. Schedule 1 amends the income tax law to ensure the stakeholder and connected entity tests work appropriately. Broadly, the connected entity test and stakeholder tests seek to determine whether an entity controls or can influence another entity.


I now turn to subsidy payments made in response to the natural disasters occurring in Queensland, New South Wales and Tasmania during early 2013. In the wake of recent disasters it is important that these payments are tax free. Exempting these payments from tax maximises the value of the payments so that people can get on with the job of cleaning up after the floods and fires. Exempting these payments from tax also ensures consistency with previous disaster relief payments that were also tax exempt. In addition, the tax exemption of all future disaster income recovery subsidy payments for natural disasters occurring up until 30 September 2013 will ensure that such payments receive a consistent tax treatment. From 1 October 2013, the disaster recovery allowance will replace the current disaster income recovery subsidy payment. This will establish a permanent means-tested solution to providing disaster assistance to workers, small business people and farmers who experience a loss of income as a direct result of a future disaster.


Schedule 3 to the bill extends the general deductible gift recipient categories in the gift provisions in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to include public funds established solely for the purpose of providing ethics education in government schools as an alternative to religious instruction where ethics education is in accordance with state or territory law. The amendment will allow taxpayers to claim an income tax deduction for donations made to these funds that are endorsed by the Commissioner of Taxation and will assist these entities in attracting donations.


The opposition has said that they will propose an amendment that removes schedule 3. They prefer an approach whereby every organisation which is seeking deductible gift recipient status to support the provision of ethics classes in government schools would need to apply to be specifically named in the tax laws. This is a complex and time-consuming process involving a parliamentary amendment every time a new organisation is specifically listed. Perhaps that is exactly what the opposition want—to make it harder for new providers of ethics classes in government schools to be established and to obtain donations. Perhaps there is some sort of hidden agenda here. What we are proposing is a better, simpler and more principled way of providing DGR status to eligible organisations. Under our approach, eligible organisations would make an application to the ATO rather than having to try and secure a parliamentary amendment. This will be important as new organisations are established over time to teach ethics classes in government schools. 


The Liberal Party claims to be a party that supports choice, but again they have demonstrated that these are just empty and hollow words with no basis in fact. This announcement that they will be amending the bill to pull this schedule out has one very real impact, and the real impact that it will have is to deny organisations that provide ethics-based instruction in our schools from the ability to raise funds with donations that are tax deductible. That is the principle that is at stake here. It is an important principle, because the organisation that has come to the government seeking that this matter be addressed is Primary Ethics, operating in New South Wales and permitted under New South Wales law to ensure that parents who have children in government schools, who do not wish to participate in scripture-based or religion-based instruction, have the choice. They have the option of allowing their children to participate in ethics-based instruction.


The application made was for specific listing. But one of the key considerations that the government must take into account when considering any application for specific listing is the precedent value of that decision. Indeed, every person that has sat in the Assistant Treasurer's chair in the past, and no doubt every person that will get the opportunity to do so in the future, will know that whilst it is always open to a government to come into this place and to specifically amend division 30 of the Income Tax Act and to specifically identify an organisation, that should be a process of last resort, because obviously the tax act cannot be filled up with every single organisation seeking to have the benefit of DGR status.


I note that the shadow Assistant Treasurer was asked about this on radio today, and before I come to the comments that he made on radio, I make this point. Under division 30 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, we currently have a category available for people to bring forward organisations and obtain the benefit of DGR status, a category that is addressed towards the provision of religious instruction in schools. So any organisation that complies with the requirements of a category can go to the Taxation Commissioner and ask to be endorsed as a DGR entity and from that day forward all of the contributions will be tax deductible. That assists organisations to raise funds. That is already in the law. Indeed, when the New South Wales government took the decision to allow ethics instruction to occur, they made this point: they would not be providing one dollar of assistance to that organisation, Primary Ethics, because no money was provided to religious organisations that were carrying out religious-based instruction in schools. So the New South Wales government took the view—and the former New South Wales government was endorsed by the O'Farrell government when they came into office—that there should not be a different set of rules for religious-based instruction as there are for ethics-based instruction, and that is precisely what we are doing. That is the principle that is at stake and that is the principle that this parliamentary amendment will enshrine.


When the shadow Assistant Treasurer was asked about this on 702 ABC this morning, he said, 'In principle I support that we put ethical education on the same footing as other similar providers, for sure.' If that is his sentiment, he should be supporting this parliamentary amendment, this bill. He should be supporting it because this is not just about Primary Ethics, this is about organisations who are seeking to provide ethics-based instruction in our schools. It is a very tightly and narrowly targeted provision that we are seeking to put into the tax act so that this will not be exploited by organisations willy-nilly. I find it incomprehensible that the opposition can assert that they support that principle of extending the opportunity for ethics-based instruction in our schools, yet they come in here and they are proposing to take a schedule out of this bill, leaving the currently existing organisation, Primary Ethics, without the benefit of DGR status and we know that the organisation has been on the public record saying that the funding arrangements they currently have are threatening their existence. They need this support to continue to be able to provide ethics-based instruction in our schools, and the proposal from the opposition is, 'We do not think that we should deal with it at this point in time.' All of those hardworking volunteers and all of the parents whose children are beneficiaries of the work of Primary Ethics need to understand that what the Liberal Party is proposing is tantamount to bringing to an end the existence of this organisation that is doing some good work in our community and in our schools.


I make the point that if indeed the opposition are committed to supporting the principle that ethics based instruction organisations should be afforded the same treatment as other organisations—that is, religious organisations that currently obtain the benefit of DGR status—then there is absolutely no reason why they should do anything other than support the bill that is before the House. If members opposite have concerns about organisations that they think might be slipped in under this category, then they should detail them. Let us understand what your concerns are. Let there be no doubt that, in taking the course of action you are taking, you will be denying Primary Ethics the ability to obtain DGR status and you will be killing off an organisation that is doing wonderful things in schools in New South Wales.


I look forward to consideration in detail of this bill, because I am eagerly awaiting some indication from the member for Casey of these nefarious organisations that he has concerns about, that he fears might be able to come in under the new category and that would be funded. Which are the organisations that he believes will somehow get the benefit of DGR status that we are not currently aware of? It is very simple: they are organisations that are providing ethics-based instruction.


If the Liberal Party are opposed to ethics-based instruction in our schools, they should just say so. They should not come in here, hiding behind a Mickey Mouse amendment that will effectively kill off an organisation that is doing some fantastic work in our community and in our schools, simply because they have some ideological objection to the work that they are doing. The truth is that, if you go down the path of specific listing, every single ethics based instruction organisation that wants to obtain the benefit of DGR status and that so-called equal treatment—and Senator Cormann said the principle was equal treatment for similar organisations—they need to lobby the government of the day to move an amendment to the law. Those other organisations do not need to do that. It is an administrative process where they go to the tax commissioner and, if their documentation and their bona fides stack up, they get the tick of approval and are a DGR status organisation.


This is just ridiculous and incomprehensible, and I call upon the member for Casey in consideration in detail to detail in full his concerns about which organisations he believes the benefit of DGR status will be extended to and which ones he objects to. If he cannot detail them, then he should withdraw the amendments that he is proposing to move and support the government's bill. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (11:47):  by leave—I move coalition amendments (1) and (2), as circulated in my name, together:


(1) Clause 2, page 2 (table item 4), omit the table item.


(2) Schedule 3, page 11 (lines 1 to 10), omit the Schedule.


As I outlined in my speech on the second reading, the coalition is moving to excise schedule 3 from this bill. Amendments (1) and (2) give effect to that. Let me reiterate a couple of things for the benefit of the shadow Assistant Treasurer, and I will deal with some of the points he made. As he articulated, this legislation seeks to introduce a whole new general category. Currently, there is one provider nationally in Australia and that is Primary Ethics. We note that the explanatory memorandum to the bill provides that New South Wales example as the only one, with no reference to any other state or territory.


As I previously stated, this one provider has sought a listing and it was rejected by the current government. As Senator Cormann outlined yesterday, the coalition has no philosophical objection to ethics classes but did not think it was appropriate that we have this whole new category created at this point without proper consideration of all the issues.


I want to point out a few things to the Assistant Treasurer regarding what he said in his long speech of rebuttal to our position on this. He first said that Mathias Cormann, our shadow Assistant Treasurer, had confirmed that we have no philosophical objection and yet he accused him of having a philosophical objection. The Assistant Treasurer will, quite predictably, cast any aspersions on any scrutiny but, when it comes to his conduct of tax laws amendment bills, he is the Captain Chaos of Assistant Treasurers. We have seen time and time again—and I deal with a lot of these tax laws amendment bills—



Mr Bradbury interjecting—




Mr TONY SMITH:
  I did interrupt you once or twice but, I think, on a tax laws amendment bill—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms O'Neill
):  Order! Please speak through the chair and can we come to the amendments, in particular. 




Mr TONY SMITH:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I am trying to do that, but I would point out that the Assistant Treasurer is interjecting when we are dealing with something as serious as a tax laws amendment bill. I think it would be a lot better for the House and for him if he actually concentrated, instead of yabbering on while we are dealing with the amendments.


I am going to deal with a couple of issues that he raised. I am going to repeat what I said in my speech on the second reading. The coalition think it is more appropriate to consider these requests on a case-by-case basis rather than to open a new category at this point. There is one provider. That one provider has been rejected by the government. This government's track record of getting things wrong in tax laws amendment bills is endless. I deal with a lot of these tax laws amendment bills and, in bill after bill, there are schedules correcting this minister's previous mistakes. He says that if this general category is not created, the one provider—




Mr Bradbury:
  Name them.




Mr TONY SMITH:
  The more you interject—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! Speak through the chair, and the minister will refrain from interrupting.




Mr TONY SMITH:
  Thank you, Deputy Speaker. As to that provider, it is not the case that, if this general category is rejected, that provider cannot be listed; they can be listed on a case-by-case basis; they can come forward to the government.


On this point, the Assistant Treasurer would have you believe that a listing of this nature on the DGR is as rare as a Labor surplus. I dealt with a tax law amendment bill yesterday that listed six organisations. I do not think he knows a lot about tax law but I will say this: he knows, because he introduced the bill, that there would not be a tax law amendment bill—or if there were it would be very rare—that does not list a number of organisations, and we would deal with six, eight or 10 tax law amendment bills each year. Yesterday, just in one day, six were listed. So he should not come into this House with this absolute furphy that because there is one provider seeking listing he has to create a whole new category because it is too hard to list one organisation and it might be too hard for him to list another one in the weeks or months ahead— (Time expired)

Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (11:53):  As I said earlier, there is a principle involved, and the principle is quite simple. It is a principle that Senator Cormann in an interview today confirmed he supports. If he supports the principle, he and his party should support the bill.


If I look in division 30 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, it refers to one of the categories being a public fund established and maintained solely for the purpose of providing religious instruction in government schools in Australia. If the principle is that the same entitlements available to religious instruction in schools should be extended to ethics-based instruction, then it should not matter whether there is one or 1,000 organisations providing ethics-based instruction. As a matter of principle a new category should be established, and that is what we are proposing.


As to this furphy about the specific listing, let me make this point: if the member for Casey is suggesting that the way we deal with all DGR applications is for government to make a case-by-case decision, then presumably he is going to repeal every category that currently exists in the act. We create categories. They are policy decisions that government takes so that you do not have to come into this place and move an amendment to the law to give DGR status to an organisation that fits within certain parameters. We allow that to be done as an administrative matter by the Commissioner of Taxation.


We are achieving equity between organisations. We are determined to do that, because we think that these organisations are doing good work that should be supported. It is a policy decision we have taken: we think that organisations of this sort, provided they tick the boxes and their bona fides are approved by the Commissioner of Taxation, should be able to raise funds that are tax deductible.


If the opposition do not support that principle, fair enough. What that means is: they do not support the principle of providing DGR status to organisations that provide ethics-based instruction in our schools. They should say that. But that is not what Senator Cormann said in his interview today.


We heard all the huff and puff from the member for Casey, but I defy him to tell me about all these tax bills that I have introduced that he reckons have a problem. If there is a problem, the problem is that he votes against these bills when we are trying to crack down on loopholes. Big businesses are ripping money out of the tax system, eroding our base, and shifting profits, and they sit over there, idly, on their hands, allowing multinationals to fleece the Australian tax base. Because, if there is a rort, a rip-off or a loophole, the Liberal Party will be there, holding hands with the exploiters; that is what they do. We are out there cracking down on them. And if the member opposite suggests that somehow the bills that I have brought into this place—




Mr Tony Smith:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. There are two points: (1) the minister is not speaking to the bill; and (2) I ask that he withdraw his last, despicable, accusation that we on this side of the House are siding with—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms O'Neill
):  The member for Casey will take his seat. The minister will withdraw, to assist the House—




Mr BRADBURY:
  I withdraw, to assist the House—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  and return to the amendments.




Mr BRADBURY:
  but the voting record of those opposite is clear for all to see.


I make the point that, if you seriously do not have an objection to organisations offering ethics-based instruction in schools obtaining the benefit of DGR status, then why do you want to make every single organisation that might exist in the future have to go through the hurdles? These processes take months, if not years. This application from Primary Ethics has been in the system for years. And all specific listing applications take a period of time to progress. 


Those opposite say they are the party of deregulation and of removing regulatory burdens. Why on earth must this be a process that the parliament has to deal with on a case-by-case basis? Is the member for Casey honestly suggesting that there is something so insidious about these types of organisations that we should have to scrutinise them in this place one by one? Doesn't he trust the tax commissioner to do that? Frankly, this is ridiculous. For those opposite, it is for whatever ideological reasons, and if it is not ideology it is just their commitment to being negative about everything, because there is absolutely no justification for this ridiculous position that they have taken.


I will just conclude by making this point. If the opposition's amendment gets up, Primary Ethics—the only organisation providing ethics-based instruction in schools in the country—will be denied DGR status. And the opposition have not given any indication of whether or not, in government, they would even provide a specific listing. That, of course, at the very earliest, is not going to be for several months. This organisation needs deductible gift recipient status in order to continue to be viable. To do what you are doing is to destroy Primary Ethics.

Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (11:58):  Let me just reiterate a couple of points. Let me firstly deal with the Assistant Treasurer's broad-ranging, uncontrollable attack on everything the coalition stands for. I think it does him no service at all and just confirms that, when it comes to the detail of these tax law administration bills, he is incapable of clear-headed assessment of these matters; he is certainly incapable of consultation. But I am going to reiterate, for the benefit of the House and if not for his benefit—and I am still hopeful—that we have articulated very clearly that we have no philosophical objection to ethics classes. We have also said that with only one provider in the country it is better these be considered on a case-by-case basis rather than by creating a whole new category at this point in time. I am going to amplify what I said before about the regularity of GDR status listings in tax law administration.



Mr Bradbury interjecting—




Mr TONY SMITH:
  I apologise; I am sorry, Assistant Treasurer. We're concentrating so that's a start! As I said, there were six yesterday. I would guess there would be 30 to 40 each year. Some tax law administration bills have a few; some have a dozen.


As to his point about the one organisation that exists, there is one and it can be considered on a case-by-case basis at this point. We are not going to accept his false motives. We are not going to accept the fact that he will always resort to political attack, rather than look at the specifics of an issue. There is one organisation and it can be considered on a case-by-case basis. Everything he says about the implications of excising this particular schedule is false. He knows that. When he talks about the listing process, he signs off on the bills with the listing and, if I am correct—and he will be able to inform me whether I am correct—I think that new organisation that is up there in the press gallery and is with the universities, The Conversation, was listed this week. Wasn't it, Assistant Treasurer?




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms O'Neill
):  Through the chair if you can, Member for Casey.




Mr TONY SMITH:
  I will assume it was. I think I saw it on the list there yesterday, and that is an organisation that has been running a few months. At this point in time we have made it clear it should be done on a case-by-case basis. I am sorry the minister resorts to false motives. We have made our position clear. It is for those reasons that we have moved to excise this schedule from the bill.

"Smith, Tony, MP",LP,2013-05-29,"



Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (11:26):  I rise on behalf of the shadow Treasurer to speak on this Tax Laws Amendment (2013 Measures No. 1) Bill. The bill has three schedules. Firstly, it seeks to strengthen integrity rules for scrip-for-scrip rollover in relation to small business and other concessions. Secondly, it seeks to provide tax exemption status for certain ex gratia payments for natural disasters. Thirdly, it seeks to extend tax deductibility status to ethics education. In relation to the third schedule the coalition has a number of reservations in relation to the broad drafting, and in the consideration in detail stage we will seek to remove this schedule from the bill. This was foreshadowed yesterday by our shadow Assistant Treasurer, Senator Mathias Cormann.


First, let me deal with the first two schedules. The first schedule seeks to amend the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to ensure that certain integrity rules in the small business concessions and the scrip-for-scrip rollover apply to life insurance companies, superannuation funds and trusts in the same way that they apply to other types of entities. Scrip-for-scrip rollover is where a company is allowed to defer a capital gains tax gain until a later CGT event happens with its shares. The connected entity test in the small business entity provisions ensures that assets and turnover of related entities are taken into account in determining whether the limits for access to the relevant small business concessions have been exceeded. The significant in-common stakeholder tests contained in the CGT scrip-for-scrip rollover are designed to ensure that an entity that has a sufficiently high level of ownership in both the original and acquiring entity cannot use the rollover to defer tax indefinitely on the disposal of the underlying assets of the original entity. 


The changes contained in schedule 1 of this bill seek to ensure that the small business connected entity test and the CGT scrip-for-scrip rollover stakeholder tests apply on the basis of who owns relevant interests in the entity rather than who benefits from those interests. Schedule 1 to this bill ensures that these integrity rules and the capital gains tax provisions more generally are applied as if absolutely entitled beneficiaries, bankrupt individuals, companies in liquidation and security providers are the owners of relevant assets. That is, in these provisions the nominal owners are looked through to the underlying owners of such assets. These changes are largely integrity measures, as the coalition recognises. The scrip-for-scrip rollover integrity provisions that apply to individuals and companies also apply to trusts, superannuation funds and life insurance companies.


Some trusts, superannuation funds and life insurance companies consider the integrity provisions do not apply to them because, as the stakeholders, they own the interest for the benefit of others—that is, the beneficiaries—rather than for their own benefit. The government claims this was never the intended interpretation of the integrity provisions. Following the release of the government's 2013-14 budget, which showed a marked deterioration in budget settings, the coalition announced that we reserve the right to accept all savings put forward in previous budgets that were yet to be legislated. This falls into that category.


The integrity rule changes are retrospective and align with the date these changes were announced—being 10 May 2011—and, from the 2011-12 budget, to transactions that occur from the time of that announcement. The look-through treatment provisions were announced on 8 May 2012 as part of the 2012-13 budget. The look-through treatment provisions, whilst potentially retrospective, do not disadvantage taxpayers as they are optional until the commencement of these provisions. The measures are worth $220 million in additional revenue for the budget over the forward estimates and, as stated at the outset, the coalition will not oppose these changes.


Schedule 2 to the bill also amends the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to exempt from income tax the disaster income recovery subsidy for people who have lost income as a result of disasters occurring across Australia during the period 3 January this year to 30 September this year. The coalition is of course supportive of the schedule.


Schedule 3 seeks to add a new deductible gift recipient category to the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. It seeks to extend tax deductibility to donations to public funds established solely for providing education in ethics in government schools in Australia as an alternative to religious instruction, where the ethics education to be provided is in accordance with state or territory law. Currently, the tax laws contain a deductible gift recipient general category for organisations which provide religious instruction in government schools but there is no category for ethics classes.


As I foreshadowed at the outset, as drafted, the coalition has reservations in relation to this schedule of the bill. As the shadow Assistant Treasurer, Senator Cormann, said yesterday, the coalition has no philosophical objection to ethics classes, but we do not think that it is appropriate at this point that a whole new category be created. The coalition believes that the government's proposal to introduce an entire new general category of deductible gift recipients in relation to ethics education is too rushed—as has often been the case—and too broad.


At present there is one provider of relevant services nationally, Primary Ethics, who provide services in one state only, and that is New South Wales. There is a method available under the current income tax laws now to provide DGR status to that organisation if the government chose to specifically propose the listing of that organisation. Given that there is only one provider who sought such a listing and was rejected by the government, it would seem more appropriate to consider these requests on a case-by-case basis rather than open up a whole new category at this point in time. In this context, the implications of starting a whole new category, instead of approving the one listing requested, need more careful consideration. For that reason, the coalition will move in the consideration in detail stage to excise this schedule from the bill.


In conclusion, as stated at the outset, we will not be opposing the bill. We acknowledge the integrity measures put forward by the government within schedule 1 in relation to the integrity rules for scrip-for-scrip in its application to life insurance companies, superannuation funds and trusts in the same way they apply to other types of entities. We also welcome tax exemption for natural disasters, contained in schedule 2 of this bill. For the reasons that I have outlined, the coalition will be seeking in the consideration in detail stage to move an amendment to remove schedule 3 from the bill.

"Bradbury, David, MP",ALP,2013-05-29,"



Mr BRADBURY
 (Lindsay—Assistant Treasurer and Minister Assisting for Deregulation) (11:34):  I would like to thank the member for Casey for his contribution to the Tax Laws Amendment (2013 Measures No. 1) Bill 2013, although I will take issue with a number of the things that he said in his contribution. Schedule 1 amends the income tax law to ensure the stakeholder and connected entity tests work appropriately. Broadly, the connected entity test and stakeholder tests seek to determine whether an entity controls or can influence another entity.


I now turn to subsidy payments made in response to the natural disasters occurring in Queensland, New South Wales and Tasmania during early 2013. In the wake of recent disasters it is important that these payments are tax free. Exempting these payments from tax maximises the value of the payments so that people can get on with the job of cleaning up after the floods and fires. Exempting these payments from tax also ensures consistency with previous disaster relief payments that were also tax exempt. In addition, the tax exemption of all future disaster income recovery subsidy payments for natural disasters occurring up until 30 September 2013 will ensure that such payments receive a consistent tax treatment. From 1 October 2013, the disaster recovery allowance will replace the current disaster income recovery subsidy payment. This will establish a permanent means-tested solution to providing disaster assistance to workers, small business people and farmers who experience a loss of income as a direct result of a future disaster.


Schedule 3 to the bill extends the general deductible gift recipient categories in the gift provisions in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 to include public funds established solely for the purpose of providing ethics education in government schools as an alternative to religious instruction where ethics education is in accordance with state or territory law. The amendment will allow taxpayers to claim an income tax deduction for donations made to these funds that are endorsed by the Commissioner of Taxation and will assist these entities in attracting donations.


The opposition has said that they will propose an amendment that removes schedule 3. They prefer an approach whereby every organisation which is seeking deductible gift recipient status to support the provision of ethics classes in government schools would need to apply to be specifically named in the tax laws. This is a complex and time-consuming process involving a parliamentary amendment every time a new organisation is specifically listed. Perhaps that is exactly what the opposition want—to make it harder for new providers of ethics classes in government schools to be established and to obtain donations. Perhaps there is some sort of hidden agenda here. What we are proposing is a better, simpler and more principled way of providing DGR status to eligible organisations. Under our approach, eligible organisations would make an application to the ATO rather than having to try and secure a parliamentary amendment. This will be important as new organisations are established over time to teach ethics classes in government schools. 


The Liberal Party claims to be a party that supports choice, but again they have demonstrated that these are just empty and hollow words with no basis in fact. This announcement that they will be amending the bill to pull this schedule out has one very real impact, and the real impact that it will have is to deny organisations that provide ethics-based instruction in our schools from the ability to raise funds with donations that are tax deductible. That is the principle that is at stake here. It is an important principle, because the organisation that has come to the government seeking that this matter be addressed is Primary Ethics, operating in New South Wales and permitted under New South Wales law to ensure that parents who have children in government schools, who do not wish to participate in scripture-based or religion-based instruction, have the choice. They have the option of allowing their children to participate in ethics-based instruction.


The application made was for specific listing. But one of the key considerations that the government must take into account when considering any application for specific listing is the precedent value of that decision. Indeed, every person that has sat in the Assistant Treasurer's chair in the past, and no doubt every person that will get the opportunity to do so in the future, will know that whilst it is always open to a government to come into this place and to specifically amend division 30 of the Income Tax Act and to specifically identify an organisation, that should be a process of last resort, because obviously the tax act cannot be filled up with every single organisation seeking to have the benefit of DGR status.


I note that the shadow Assistant Treasurer was asked about this on radio today, and before I come to the comments that he made on radio, I make this point. Under division 30 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997, we currently have a category available for people to bring forward organisations and obtain the benefit of DGR status, a category that is addressed towards the provision of religious instruction in schools. So any organisation that complies with the requirements of a category can go to the Taxation Commissioner and ask to be endorsed as a DGR entity and from that day forward all of the contributions will be tax deductible. That assists organisations to raise funds. That is already in the law. Indeed, when the New South Wales government took the decision to allow ethics instruction to occur, they made this point: they would not be providing one dollar of assistance to that organisation, Primary Ethics, because no money was provided to religious organisations that were carrying out religious-based instruction in schools. So the New South Wales government took the view—and the former New South Wales government was endorsed by the O'Farrell government when they came into office—that there should not be a different set of rules for religious-based instruction as there are for ethics-based instruction, and that is precisely what we are doing. That is the principle that is at stake and that is the principle that this parliamentary amendment will enshrine.


When the shadow Assistant Treasurer was asked about this on 702 ABC this morning, he said, 'In principle I support that we put ethical education on the same footing as other similar providers, for sure.' If that is his sentiment, he should be supporting this parliamentary amendment, this bill. He should be supporting it because this is not just about Primary Ethics, this is about organisations who are seeking to provide ethics-based instruction in our schools. It is a very tightly and narrowly targeted provision that we are seeking to put into the tax act so that this will not be exploited by organisations willy-nilly. I find it incomprehensible that the opposition can assert that they support that principle of extending the opportunity for ethics-based instruction in our schools, yet they come in here and they are proposing to take a schedule out of this bill, leaving the currently existing organisation, Primary Ethics, without the benefit of DGR status and we know that the organisation has been on the public record saying that the funding arrangements they currently have are threatening their existence. They need this support to continue to be able to provide ethics-based instruction in our schools, and the proposal from the opposition is, 'We do not think that we should deal with it at this point in time.' All of those hardworking volunteers and all of the parents whose children are beneficiaries of the work of Primary Ethics need to understand that what the Liberal Party is proposing is tantamount to bringing to an end the existence of this organisation that is doing some good work in our community and in our schools.


I make the point that if indeed the opposition are committed to supporting the principle that ethics based instruction organisations should be afforded the same treatment as other organisations—that is, religious organisations that currently obtain the benefit of DGR status—then there is absolutely no reason why they should do anything other than support the bill that is before the House. If members opposite have concerns about organisations that they think might be slipped in under this category, then they should detail them. Let us understand what your concerns are. Let there be no doubt that, in taking the course of action you are taking, you will be denying Primary Ethics the ability to obtain DGR status and you will be killing off an organisation that is doing wonderful things in schools in New South Wales.


I look forward to consideration in detail of this bill, because I am eagerly awaiting some indication from the member for Casey of these nefarious organisations that he has concerns about, that he fears might be able to come in under the new category and that would be funded. Which are the organisations that he believes will somehow get the benefit of DGR status that we are not currently aware of? It is very simple: they are organisations that are providing ethics-based instruction.


If the Liberal Party are opposed to ethics-based instruction in our schools, they should just say so. They should not come in here, hiding behind a Mickey Mouse amendment that will effectively kill off an organisation that is doing some fantastic work in our community and in our schools, simply because they have some ideological objection to the work that they are doing. The truth is that, if you go down the path of specific listing, every single ethics based instruction organisation that wants to obtain the benefit of DGR status and that so-called equal treatment—and Senator Cormann said the principle was equal treatment for similar organisations—they need to lobby the government of the day to move an amendment to the law. Those other organisations do not need to do that. It is an administrative process where they go to the tax commissioner and, if their documentation and their bona fides stack up, they get the tick of approval and are a DGR status organisation.


This is just ridiculous and incomprehensible, and I call upon the member for Casey in consideration in detail to detail in full his concerns about which organisations he believes the benefit of DGR status will be extended to and which ones he objects to. If he cannot detail them, then he should withdraw the amendments that he is proposing to move and support the government's bill. I commend the bill to the House.

Ms LEY
 (Farrer) (13:45):  I would like to take this opportunity to present a petition from residents in my electorate of Farrer—more specifically in the far west of New South Wales.




The petition read as follows—



To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives


This petition of the citizens who live in or support the communities of Far West New South Wales, including Broken Hill, Wilcannia, Wentworth, Ivanhoe, Menindee and other centres, draws to the attention of the House of Representatives the critical funding shortfall affecting the Far West Community Legal Centre (FWCLC). The community is concerned that this financial shortfall will result in an acute reduction, or cessation, of localised and outreach legal service provision.


The removal of face-to-face legal services places unnecessary strain on persons already suffering from disadvantage; the removal of such services would be devastating for remote and isolated residents of the Far West.


In order to continue with the provision of such services, the FWCLC seeks recurrent, annual funding of $433,000 as part of the Commonwealth Community Legal Service Program (CLSP).


We therefore ask the House to consider the face-to-face legal needs of the communities of Far West of New South Wales and to pledge that sufficient funding levels are provided for the continuation of appropriate service provision by the Far West Community Legal Centre.


from 772 citizens


Petition received.




Ms LEY:
  These 772 signatures essentially seek to ensure sufficient ongoing funding is provided to the Far West Community Legal Centre for it to perform a vital role in our community. The petition asks us to re-accept a very important right which both the Law Foundation and this parliament already formally recognise, and that is that all persons, regardless of means, have access to high-quality legal services or effective dispute resolution mechanisms to protect their rights and interests.


This right is being taken away by chronic underfunding which is not enough to meet the yearly local demand on the centre's small number of staff. It is a demand which comes from a community ranking among the highest in New South Wales for people living in relative socioeconomic disadvantage. This includes people on a disability support pension or Centrelink benefit, those accessing social housing. It is also a region that suffers from a high percentage of domestic violence.


After writing to the federal Attorney-General in February this year, earlier this month the minister granted a one-off funding injection of $215,000 in order for the legal centre to continue its face-to-face and outreach services. On behalf of our community I want to recognise the Attorney's announcement and thank him for making up the temporary shortfall. This petition, which commenced before that stop-gap funding, asks us to now take the next step—to ensure there is a sufficient combination of Commonwealth and state funding. (Time expired)

Mr MARTIN FERGUSON
 (Batman) (15:00):  I speak on indulgence. I wish to advise the House that I have today informed the leader of my party, the Australian Labor Party, that I will be leaving the parliament at the next election.


Colleagues, this is a personal decision. It is not a decision that I have taken lightly; however, I feel that that the timing is appropriate and in the best interests of my party and my family. It has been an absolute privilege and pleasure to serve as the member for Batman since 2 March 1996. In fact, this is my first and last speech as a backbencher. Up until my resignation from cabinet on 22 March this year I have had the honour and privilege of serving continuously as the shadow minister in a variety of economic portfolios, and as the Minister for Resources and Energy and the Minister for Tourism. I thank the Australian Labor Party and the constituents of Batman for the opportunity, especially the heart and soul of the party: the local branch members who have supported me in my time in this place.


When I look back on my career, firstly at the Miscellaneous Workers Union, then as ACTU president and finally as a member of parliament, my main motivation has been to get Australians into decent, well-paying jobs. This is what the Labor Party means to me: helping those less fortunate in life by providing new jobs and opportunities to achieve a better quality of life. Creating opportunities by working with business is not the same thing as pointless class rhetoric. In essence, we need to grow the pie to share it. As I said in my maiden speech to parliament on 2 May 1996:


The people of the electorate are working people whose priorities for their families are better job opportunities, better housing opportunities, better educational opportunities, better health opportunities and support for the aged.


During the 1980s and 1990s this involved some genuinely tough decisions with people like Simon Crean, Bill Kelty and, of course, Bob Hawke and Paul Keating. We knew the economy had to be restructured, which would involve closing down old industries and creating efficiencies and new opportunities. This meant that jobs were lost in many industries with members that I and other unionists had represented for decades. Colleagues, they were hard decisions to take, but they were taken in the knowledge that they would provide the basis of a better Australia for all of us. Let me tell you, standing at the factory gates with people who had just lost their jobs, all for the greater good of reforming our economy, was not easy.


At the same time, as President of the ACTU I was proud to be involved in negotiating the accord with the Hawke and Keating governments. The accord led to rises in family payments targeting low-income families, higher school retention rates, increased welfare benefits for pensioners, tax cuts for lower- and middle-income workers, compulsory superannuation and proper training for the unemployed based on the all-important principle of a reciprocal obligation. This is a proud legacy for the union movement and for the Labor Party.


On my watch as minister for resources I am proud to have helped facilitate the biggest pipeline investment in our resources sector this country has ever seen. Perhaps more importantly, if we focus our attentions on the fundamentals of attracting further investment, including getting costs under control and achieving regulatory reform, we had the capacity as a nation to secure a second pipeline of investment, especially in the LNG sector, which will set up Australia for the 21st century.


My friends, we have had 21 years of continuous growth in this country, and we as a nation should never forget that. When other countries faced recession during the global financial crisis, Australia continued to grow. In my opinion, this and the apology to the stolen generations are major achievements of Labor governments since 2007. I am also delighted that we are now finally moving towards a national disability scheme, a further chance to look after the less privileged in our society.


Australia's recognition as a member of the G20 is also a fitting recognition of the constructive role we play internationally. It is fair to say that many seek to demonise the resources industry, but we should never forget that it accounts for 60 per cent of our export wealth, wealth that has meant we could take better care of our community, improve the lives of Australians and give opportunities to those who never thought that they could do the things they now do in that sector.


As minister for energy I am proud of the microeconomic reform process I continued to deliver in the energy sector, competition reforms established under the Keating government. I am proud that I have stayed true to the market principles underpinning the sector, delivering an efficient and reliable essential service to the community.


I want to acknowledge the cooperation of fellow energy ministers from the states in supporting me as chair of the ministerial council, where together we set up the next tranche of future energy market reforms that will ensure that the long-term interests of consumers continue to be at the centre of energy market reform. 


While many may be surprised, I am also especially proud of the establishment of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency, ARENA, and the appointment of a highly experienced and talented group of people to sit on its board and invest in deploying and developing Australia's renewable technologies. Our green jobs in the 21st century will be at the high end, focusing on research and development and innovation.


As Minister for Tourism I am also proud of the growth we have achieved in difficult circumstances in Australia's largest services export sector, employing over half a million Australians and directly contributing $35 billion to our economy. Huge market opportunities exist in Asia and it has been a focus of mine to boost investment in the tourism sector so that Australia can capture these opportunities in the future. Tourism 2020 is about that very objective.


I would like to conclude by firstly thanking all the staff and those who support us to make this parliament the wonderful institution it is. Thank you.


Members should also never forget that, irrespective of who is in government, they must properly resource and protect the independence of the Parliamentary Library. It is an exceptionally valuable resource making a major contribution through its research capacity to the strength of our democracy. 


I also make special mention of parliamentary committees. I thoroughly enjoyed participating in a variety of parliamentary committees. They were a great learning opportunity for a young member. It is also where friendships are formed across the political divide.


To my former department, the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism, I personally want to thank you for the invaluable advice you provided me as a minister. We went through a lot together and I have the utmost respect for the department and the quality of the work done by its officials. It was a thankless task.


I have also been fortunate to have wonderful staff and I am pleased to note that some of them are here in the gallery this afternoon, both past and present, ministerial and electorate. My success has been your success and many of you are part of my extended family.


Finally, my parents, Jack and Mary Ferguson, who were here for my swearing-in as a member in 1996, have now passed on. Thank you for the wonderful start you gave me in life and the love and support you gave me throughout my life. My wife Tricia, to Benjamin and Clare and my daughter-in-law Meghan, thank you. As I said in my first speech, life has never been easy with me due to long hours and lengthy periods away from home. The last decade has been especially challenging as Tricia has virtually managed the health challenges of one of our children full-time. I thank her. I thank you, Tricia, Ben and Clare, for your encouragement and support. Without that I would never have been part of the achievement of the labour movement, both industrially and politically, that I have spoken about today. I thank the House for the opportunity.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (15:11):  Speaker, very briefly, on indulgence, I had the opportunity to speak with the member for Batman earlier today and he advised me that he would be making this statement to the House. It has been a privilege to sit and listen to him and to reflect on those times and his contribution to this parliament and to the Australian nation more broadly. Obviously in our own Labor way and on another occasion we will spend time honouring the member for Batman and his service both to the Australian Labor Party and to the trade union movement. But I know personally the sacrifices the member for Batman has made across his working career. I understand the toll that has taken from time to time on his family. I have had the opportunity over these years to meet and know members of his family, to know Tricia, to know Ben and to know Clare, and I know that he will very much value time with them.


From our point of view, he can leave this parliament knowing that he has been a part, indeed a pivotal part, of a number of great Labor achievements—great Labor achievements in the Hawke and Keating modernisation of our economy where the trade union movement was such a willing and such a vital part; great Labor achievements in the period of this government since our election in 2007. When the worst hit in the form of the global financial crisis it was all shoulders to the wheel amongst the Labor team to make sure that we were keeping our economy going, and certainly the member for Batman played his part in that. 


He also has played his part very strongly in harnessing and nurturing our resources sector. I know that that is appreciated both by the companies in that sector and by the thousands of working people who rely on that sector for their living. The member for Batman has had to negotiate some incredibly complex changes in energy policy. I know I have worked with him on some. The level of detail is not for the faint-hearted. But he is respected nationally, including by state energy ministers, for his expertise and for his contribution to Australia's energy security. 


On tourism, such a vital industry which has been under so much pressure given the strength of our Australian dollar, the member for Batman in his very tough-minded way has worked with the industry to chart a very clear course for the future.


So it is a very proud track record of achievement. I am very pleased that the House as a whole had this opportunity to hear the words from the member for Batman. He will obviously go with the thanks of the Labor team. We will make that very clear in our own way but I am glad that we had the opportunity now for the House to make it clear as a whole.



Honourable members: Hear, hear!

"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2013-05-29,"



Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (15:14):  I appreciate the opportunity to say a few words in response to the member for Batman. This House has just heard a heartfelt statement from deep in the Labor tradition. It is a sad day for the parliament, a sad day for the Labor Party and a sad day for the country that someone of the member for Batman's stature is choosing to serve our country in a different capacity.


The member for Batman, if I may say so, is not simply another member of this parliament; he is steeped in this parliament, he is steeped in the traditions of service, he is steeped in the traditions of parliaments around this country. If I may use the phrase, the member for Batman is Labor Party royalty. I have in times past somewhat slightingly referred to the 'hereditary peers' of this parliament. I regret on this occasion that I did so then. I should not have made light of the tradition which the member for Batman represents—the tradition of service to party and country which the member for Batman and his family have represented for several generations.


The member for Batman spoke with considerable emotion. He respects the party he served. I should say from this side of the parliament that we too respect the party he has served. Over the years, the Labor Party has made a monumental contribution to this country. The Labor Party, at its best, has been a nation-building party, and the member for Batman has always harkened to the best traditions of the Australian Labor Party.


I regret that he feels unable to stay in the parliament. I regret that he felt unable to remain in the current government. The government, his party, the parliament and our country will be the poorer for his absence. Well may we shed a tear for things which were, which should be but which are not. From this side of the political trench I salute an honourable opponent and a great Australian.

(1) commends the Government for its four year commitment to provide $50 million to support the global eradication of polio;


(2) notes:


(a) that in February 2012, India was removed from the list of countries where polio remains endemic, proving that eradication strategies are effective when they are fully implemented and that polio can be eradicated even in the toughest circumstances, and there has not been a single reported case of polio in India since January 2011;


(b) that polio eradication should, wherever possible, be part of routine immunisation efforts to improve population immunity for all priority, vaccine preventable childhood illnesses;


(c) that there are now only three countries in the world where polio has never been stopped, namely Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria, and unless the polio program is fully funded and emergency plans are implemented as planned, polio could make a comeback in countries that are currently polio-free;


(d) estimates show that global re-infection over time could result in as many as 200,000 children per year being paralysed;


(e) that the Global Polio Eradication Initiative currently faces a funding shortfall of US$945 million for the full implementation of its 2012‑13 Emergency Action Plan, and this has caused immunisation campaigns to be cancelled or scaled back in 33 countries in Africa and Asia, leaving more children vulnerable to the disease and increasing the risk of the international spread of polio; and


(f) the recent landmark resolution by the Sixty-fifth World Health Assembly declaring the completion of polio eradication, a programmatic emergency for global public health, with member states highlighting the feasibility of eradication in the near-term, while expressing concern at the ongoing funding gap threatening success; and


(3) encourages the Government to continue to support efforts to deliver a polio-free world and to encourage other countries to do likewise.

(b) that polio eradication should, wherever possible, be part of routine immunisation efforts to improve population immunity for all priority, vaccine preventable childhood illnesses;


(c) that there are now only three countries in the world where polio has never been stopped, namely Afghanistan, Pakistan and Nigeria, and unless the polio program is fully funded and emergency plans are implemented as planned, polio could make a comeback in countries that are currently polio-free;


(d) estimates show that global re-infection over time could result in as many as 200,000 children per year being paralysed;


(e) that the Global Polio Eradication Initiative currently faces a funding shortfall of US$945 million for the full implementation of its 2012‑13 Emergency Action Plan, and this has caused immunisation campaigns to be cancelled or scaled back in 33 countries in Africa and Asia, leaving more children vulnerable to the disease and increasing the risk of the international spread of polio; and


(f) the recent landmark resolution by the Sixty-fifth World Health Assembly declaring the completion of polio eradication, a programmatic emergency for global public health, with member states highlighting the feasibility of eradication in the near-term, while expressing concern at the ongoing funding gap threatening success; and


(3) encourages the Government to continue to support efforts to deliver a polio-free world and to encourage other countries to do likewise.

Mr OAKESHOTT
 (Lyne) (15:18):  by leave—I move:


That this House expresses full confidence in the work of Australia’s science community and confirms that it believes that man-made climate change is not a conspiracy or a con, but a real and serious threat to Australia if left unaddressed.


Yesterday was a significant step forward. We finally have on the record both party leaders in this chamber in a bipartisan way expressing full confidence in the science community of Australia and their accepted advice on man-made climate change. At times it has been like pulling teeth—and I fully respect that, within the ranks of both major parties there are differing views—but it is important, if we are going to establish certainty for the future of policy and an economic debate that hangs off those foundations of acceptance of the very best advice from the very best scientists in this country, that this House, regardless of who has the government benches, accepts with confidence the advice that man-made climate change is real.


 


Both party leaders yesterday confirmed their belief in man-made climate change science. But I do raise with some hesitation some taunts that were made during events of yesterday from colleagues around me. When I did raise the opportunity for both leaders to answer the question around the science, two different members threw up the words, 'Ask us when we are in government!' and 'Wait and see when we are in government!' I hope that is not the position held by colleagues in this chamber. I hope that everyone is being fair dinkum about their belief in the science and the science community, their agreements around the minimum targets that have been agreed upon by 2020 and that everyone is being fair dinkum about the different views on economic responses that are coming forward.


Personally, I am sick of public servants and science being picked on, denied and accused, often when they are not in positions to defend themselves—and all for political expediency. Most, if not all, the people in the science community are lifelong committed scientists doing the very best they can in the most objective way they can and falling wherever the facts and the evidence take them. It is not the role of any of us to accuse them of cons or conspiracies but to accept the advice from the vast majority of scientists—the very best we have in the field—and to listen to it, so that when they say, 'Australia, we have a problem,' we should listen very closely to that and then respond.


In my view, we have spent way too much time pretending that the science of climate change is in dispute. We have spent way too much time pretending that the science of climate change is not bipartisan. As we saw clearly in this chamber yesterday in the middle of question time, the Prime Minister and the alternate Prime Minister reached bipartisan agreement on the climate science. By all means, we are going to have a wrestle over economic policy and the response, but there is bipartisanship on the science itself.


So, for anyone wanting to vote sceptically at the ballot box in four months time, I think there is only one option, and that would be the party of my friend next to me—if he were here, my imaginary friend—Bob Katter's Australia Party.



Honourable members interjecting—  



The SPEAKER:  Order! Members will refer to members by their appropriate title.




Mr OAKESHOTT:
  The member for Kennedy. I think that he is the only one in this chamber—what is Peter Slipper's seat?



An honourable member:  Fisher.




Mr OAKESHOTT:
  I am not sure where the member for Fisher stands on all of this, but the member for Kennedy is the only member in this chamber who, I understand, has a policy platform that is sceptical of the science. Everyone else in this chamber is locked and loaded—the science is confirmed. We have got shakings of the head by members whose own party leaders are saying that the science is real. We have members shaking their heads—members who are going to the ballot box with a party platform in response to the science that they are shaking their heads about.




Mr Dutton:
  This is nothing about climate science. It is all about you, as per usual!



The SPEAKER:  Order! The member for Dickson is warned!




Mr OAKESHOTT:
  I hope Hansard has recorded that. I hope Hansard has recorded a senior shadow minister in a rage about bipartisanship on climate science, a position confirmed by their leader yesterday—today there is shaking of heads, rants and interjections. The position of party leaders is clearly not settled within party rooms. That is exactly why I think it is important for this House to call the bluff and see where some bums land when we actually have a vote in confidence on the science community and on the science of man-made climate change. It is real in our minds or it is not. We accept the science or we do not. It is time we actually tested that on the floor of the House and then we will have our arguments around how we respond to that science.


It is wrong to accuse scientists, including a former Australian of the Year only five years ago, of being con artists and wrapped up in some global conspiracy. It is wrong. That should not be Australia in 2013. By all means, argue the toss over policy but, when we go the man, when we go the personality, that is a step too far.


Again I see sneering from the front bench from senior shadow ministers—shaking their heads at a very simple point being made obviously cuts deep.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr OAKESHOTT:
  You can whisper it all you like but, in the end you are going to be asked to vote in confidence for the science of man-made climate change. I would ask you all to consider your positions.



Opposition members interjecting—




Mr OAKESHOTT:
  Again we have further interjections. This should be a fairly simple point that should not have to be made in this chamber. But it is obviously cutting deep into the heart of a position that is being taken to the ballot box—to 'repeal the carbon tax' without telling the full story. That is not a repeal policy, it is a replacement policy. It is a replacement of something that is going to cost taxpayers more. 


A true liberal believes in markets. A shadow minister for the environment would arguably believe in markets. We can get into the economics of that on the back of this debate, but we are talking now about the science and seeing who votes where, who abstains, who has the courage of their convictions—if they have run around electorates saying that this is all a global conspiracy—and seeing how closely linked they are to talkback radio hosts and to billionaires who are sceptical. Let us see how people vote and whether they trust the advice that has been given to them from the vast majority of the very best scientists in Australia.




Mr Keenan:
  Good grief!




Mr OAKESHOTT:
  And, again, we have an interjection, saying, 'Good grief!' I look forward to this vote. On the back of this vote we can then start having a sensible discussion about the replacement policy, which is somehow going to cost less and do more than a market-based approach and which is somehow going to deny the very best of economic advice. It is one that I look forward to on the back of this vote.


The most offensive part of this debate to date is the policy process itself that is being challenged—not about climate science but how we as policymakers develop policy. When it is best delivered in all its forms, surely, regardless of where you start in this chamber, you rely heavily on the very best advice you can find. You rely on the experts in the field. We are kidding ourselves if we run around this chamber, saying, 'We know everything about everything; we are the absolute experts on all topics.' We are not. We are jack-of-all-trades and, in most cases, masters of none. We are generalists in the work that we do but, if we invest in the policy process, we have plenty of resources in the field and expert advice. We rely on that. Sure, we test it on the way through and challenge it but, in the end, if it is solid we do what we can in this chamber to turn that good advice into actual law and legislation. The offensive part of this debate to date is that that has been lost. 


The very best scientists are saying: Australia, we have a problem. They are saying that there is clear evidence of man-made contribution to climate change and climate science. That seems to be denied by too many. At the next level, beyond this vote, we then listen to the very best economists in the field to find a response. We can do nothing. We can say: 'It's all a hoax and a con' and leave it as a risk for future generations. That is one of the options that is a risk too far for this chamber, if we accept the science. 


We could choose another path, which is not actually what we did—that is, to introduce a tax bill through this chamber that is akin to increasing the GST, putting a direct cost on consumers and then using that money to kick money to clean up pollution. That is another model for introducing a carbon tax. Your leader, who was on YouTube talking about carbon tax as a real option, is the only one in this chamber I heard actually talk about a carbon tax as a model that could be a response.


The third option, Shadow Minister, is a market-based response, as per a very good PhD that everyone talks about.




Mr Hunt:
  You twerp, you undergraduate. You are a bleeding idiot and dishonest—




Mr OAKESHOTT:
  You will have a go. A market-based response seeks the lowest cost for the highest return. That is the Liberal philosophy of supporting a market. That was the Liberal approach until 2009. That is what former Treasurer Peter Costello took to cabinet in 2001. That is what former Prime Minister John Howard took to the ballot box in 2007: lowest cost for highest return, a market-based approach.


So here is the test—I do not need the full time—we either vote for it or vote against it. We can hear about all this carbon tax repeal stuff without talking about a replacement plan all you like. But, in the end, the test of this vote is nothing beyond whether you confirm, with confidence from this House, that the science community is right: that Australia has a problem. Let us see where the bums land, from all members of parliament, in support of the very best advice in the science community. Let us stop picking on them, accusing them of being part of a global conspiracy and being part of a con. The advice is real and the question for the House today is whether or not we accept it.

Mr BURKE
 (Watson—Minister for the Arts, Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water and Population and Communities) (15:34):  The motion that is before the House, moved by the member for Lyne, aims to do away with the first part of the argument that sometimes makes its way back and forth through the media and elsewhere in terms of determining what is the view of this House on the science itself. And it accepts that there has been a secondary debate, where one side of the House finds itself backing a market and the other side of the House takes a different view, but this is where we deal upfront with the starting principle of the science of climate change itself.


 There is no doubt in the discussion of responding to climate change and carbon trading as a method that the debate in the public arena has been mixed up with a debate about whether we are responding to anything that is real. The references here go to the different scientific work that has been done generally. I will now talk very specifically about some work that is done by Australian scientists. As part of the role of the environment minister of this country you look after the Antarctic Division. I will never forget—




Mr Hunt:
  You don't have any flights!




Mr BURKE:
  I even offered for the shadow minister to go. The work of our scientists down there is extraordinary and the work that they do with ice cores is probably some of the most telling work that exists in dealing with the science of climate change. Effectively, these ice cores are time capsules for the history of our planet. The depth at which they are found tells us how old they are. The quality of the water particles within them tells us about the temperature of the period and the snowflakes, as they have fallen, have trapped tiny little bubbles which give us an exact time capsule record of what the atmosphere was like at the time.


The story is a simple one and found consistently with ice core records across the globe. It is this: that at the same time that the industrial revolution occurred, the level of carbon in the atmosphere massively increased, by proportion to what would have been natural levels and, at the same time, an increase in temperature. The science of climate change is that simple. People say, 'There have been other periods in our history; you can go to geological records and there were other periods when the globe has got warm.' That is true—it is true that there have been other times when the globe has got warm, but we are talking about a spike, unprecedented, that has coincided exactly with an increase in pollution going into the atmosphere.


I also, on this, refer to an argument offered by some sceptics where they say, 'Actually, carbon dioxide is a completely natural gas.' Most forms of pollution occur, in some way or other, naturally. They are called 'pollution' when you get them in massive concentrations beyond what would occur naturally. That is why we refer to 'carbon pollution'. That is why we refer to carbon dioxide being a pollutant when it is occurring at levels that would not ordinarily be natural. What about when you have an oil spill and you have oil going into the ocean? Oil itself occurs naturally, but the spill means that you get an environmental outcome which would otherwise be unprecedented. In the same way, the fact that carbon dioxide occurs naturally does not change for one minute the fact that we are dealing with a form of pollution when we are dealing with it in these sorts of levels.


There have been a number of members of this House who have chosen, on different occasions, in interviews and elsewhere, and quite publicly, some of them, to have a view that is quite contrary to the contents of this resolution. I hope they vote in accordance and consistent with those views when this comes to a vote in a few moments time. I am noticing a few of them currently are absenting themselves from the chamber, and I will see whether they are here—




Mr Hunt:
  How many are there over there?




Mr Ruddock:
  I can only count one.




Mr BURKE:
  I do not think those opposite understand that, when we are talking about sceptics, you do not find them on this side of the chamber at all. But over there, you could go to the different members, such as the member for Tangney; you could go to the people who have said that the solution to climate change is to use giant shadecloth as a way of dealing with it. People on the other side of the chamber have referred to it as a hoax or have referred to the science of climate change using the term 'crap'. Those opposite—I will go for the full 20 if that is what you want—




Mr Morrison:
  Mr Deputy Speaker Scott, I note the lack of government members on that side of the chamber, and I draw your attention to the state of the House.




The bells having been rung—





The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Mr Vasta! The member for Bonner will return to the chamber. The member for Bonner was in the chamber. You cannot leave during a count for a quorum.


(Quorum formed)




Mr BURKE:
  And, as to those who come in, I just hope that the member for Tangney comes in during the discussion of this. I just hope that those who have gone out into the electorate and who have said that they do oppose the science of climate change have the courage to stand in this parliament and vote the way they say. There are those who have been so brave on talkback radio—who have had all the bravery in the world in being willing to say that they are opposed to the science and that they reckon all of this is rubbish and some global conspiracy. I say to those members of parliament: 'Walk in now,' because now is their chance. Now is their chance to let it be known whether or not they are going to vote the way of their official party platform, or whether they have any integrity in the views that they put out there publicly, because there will be a moment where this is put to a vote on the voices and there are no sceptics on this side of the House. There is no-one on this side of the House who would be voting no. But we will only divide if the sceptics on that side have the courage to be in the room for the vote. It is only if they have the courage to come in and put voice within the parliament to what they have been willing to say outside the parliament that will determine whether or not we have the division. And that is something that they will not be able to hide behind anymore.


I welcome the fact that the member for Lyne has brought this debate on. I welcome the fact that, much to the surprise of many members of the opposition, the Leader of the Opposition decided to grant leave to have this. I welcome the fact that we are able to have the discussion upfront on the science of climate change. To those members of parliament who, up until now, have sought to hide within the parliament but make all sorts of extraordinary claims outside the parliament, I say: if you believe that there is anything that backs up the global conspiracy theory on the science of climate change, walk into this chamber now.

"Hunt, Greg, MP",LP,2013-05-29,"



Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (15:43):  On the positive side, at least we should welcome the fact that the member for Lyne's speech was only 14 minutes this time. Let me be very clear, because it has been the position for a very, very long time: we accept the science, we accept the targets and we accept the need for a market mechanism; we just happen to clearly, absolutely, fundamentally disagree over the choice of those mechanisms. They chose a carbon tax, they chose an emissions trading scheme, they chose to increase electricity prices, they chose to increase gas prices and they chose to increase refrigeration prices but they did not choose to tell the Australian people that that was what they would do. Well, we challenge every member of the ALP to come clean with a very simple proposition: if the coalition does win the trust of the Australian people, if the coalition is given the opportunity to form government, will the members of the ALP respect the mandate given by the Australian people to repeal the carbon tax? That is a very simple test: will the members of the ALP respect the mandate of the Australian people, if we are successful, to repeal the carbon tax?


This is not a debate about science although let me say this: every person in Australia has a right to their views, every person should be able to speak without fear or favour, every person in a democracy should be able to give their views. Now I—and we—come down on a particular side, that there is a case to deal with, but everybody should be able to speak without fear or favour and express their views. That is what democracy is about. If there are members of the ALP who want to clamp down on people's rights to express their views then that is something which they should out themselves on.


So let us go back to a very simple proposition: whilst we agree on the science, we agree on the targets and we agree on the need for markets, we disagree absolutely and fundamentally on their market mechanism of a carbon tax which is the highest in the world and which is about to become the most volatile in the world after 1 July 2015. I do want to make one point about market theory here because we hear a lot of tripe from the government and from some who should know better about that. There are different types of market mechanisms. Three Nobel economics laureates, all of whom accept the science of climate change and all of whom are amongst the world's most pure and most eminent market economists—Finn Kydland, Thomas Schelling and Vernon Smith—ranked 15 different approaches to reducing emissions. Of those 15, there were three carbon tax mechanisms. The 15 included technology and work on forests but the three which they ranked as the worst and least efficient means of addressing the problem were the three forms of the carbon tax and as the price got higher you went from 13 to 14 and to 15. Finn Kydland, Thomas Schelling and Vernon Smith—three of the world's Nobel economics laureates from the last decade and all climate change believers and all pure market economists. So when we hear that there is only one way, perhaps—just perhaps—the government members and the crossbenchers may want to go and speak with three of the world's great Nobel economics laureates. So the answer is very simple: we agreed on the science, we agree on the targets and we agree on the market but we could not disagree more on the choice of market mechanism. For these reasons we are happy to let your motion pass but we will fight right up to election day to take away your carbon tax.

"Windsor, Tony, MP",Ind.,2013-05-29,"



Mr WINDSOR
 (New England) (15:48):  I second the motion of the member for Lyne and support the comments in relation to the scientific community and climate change. I think even thus far this debate has been quite significant and important because it has been allowing people to reaffirm their confidence in the scientific community. One of the great tragedies I think I have experienced in this particular parliament was the way in which we had—and some people in this chamber at the moment, some of whom have just been speaking, participated in this process—persecution of the scientific community.


The one thing that we should be very proud of in a democracy, particularly on the Australian continent, which has a very proud background in terms of scientific contributions on a whole range of levels, is that members of the scientific community are allowed to express their views and not be persecuted as if they were political representatives. Our job is to cop the heat occasionally, both from our own colleagues and from the broader community, and I think we all accept that. But we ask our scientists to go out to look for—and source, as the member for Lyne said—the information. We do not know it all. Some of us may think we do, but we do not know it all and we need people who are prepared to give us their objective information so that we can base decisions upon that information. 


I saw what happened in terms of some of the people who were involved with the Independent Panel on Climate Change. I saw the persecution that went on of some of our people within the scientific community and I know some personally that were bitterly upset with the way in which they were treated. Some people were not prepared for the persecution that took place. I know a lot of it was aided and abetted by the Alan Joneses of this world and some of the nay-sayers who present that soup each morning so people can feel bad by the end of the afternoon. So I know they were out there but there were also people in the political process that were actually encouraging and inciting them and gaining kudos through participation with them.



Mr Schultz interjecting—




Mr WINDSOR:
  I do agree with the member for Hume that there has been a degree of guilt on both sides of the radio microphone.


As to the Prime Minister and the formation of this parliament and whether I am re-elected or not at the next election, one of the proudest things that I will remember about my participation in this parliament will be that I have actually been involved in something that has some long-term significance for Australians and the human race. Some members of this parliament have been so focused on the short term, the short term being the destruction of the government or the parliament of the day within days or weeks. On a continuing basis we have seen this profile gone through that 'It won't last till Christmas,' 'I'll be in the Lodge by Christmas,' 'It won't last for a year ', 'It won't last'. Well, it has lasted. So we have had the continuation of this constant bombardment by some within the parliament, and by many outside it, about this so-called lie that the Prime Minister told.


I have put it on public record before: I went to the last election on the basis of climate change. I proposed legislation in 2008—it was not supported by either side of parliament—that actually had the options of a carbon tax or an emissions trading scheme built into it similar to the English legislation, where there was bipartisan support on this issue. And until the start of this particular parliament, there was bipartisan support of this issue in Australia, and I was very proud of that.


During the Howard years, for instance, there was to be a price on carbon. I think John Howard was obviously aiming to have an emissions trading scheme, but he was aiming to establish the institutional framework. The same applied to Malcolm Turnbull during his term as leader of the Liberal Party. There was a period of time where, to get the institutional framework in place, there would have to be a fixed price on carbon—a fixed price. Now in economic terms, I am sure a Nobel laureate would know, a fixed price essentially means a tax.


Most of the people on the opposition side of the parliament, including the member for Hume, a very good friend of mine, participated in the parliamentary processes and their party processes to support a fixed price on carbon—for one year in one case, I think it was the Howard case, and two years I think in the Turnbull case. But nonetheless it was a fixed price, which was essentially supporting a carbon tax to get the institutional framework in place and then morph that into an emissions trading scheme or a floating price connected to global markets et cetera. This was not a tax. It could be exactly the same price, but technically it was not a tax. That is exactly the same as the current parliament is doing. This fixed-price carbon tax, as people refer to it, will be morphed into an emissions trading scheme and it will engage with the international marketplace. I think that is in July 2015. So we have seen all sides of parliament agree to the same process.


One of the most disappointing things in my view is what we saw when the numbers were so tight in relation to the formation of this parliament. If there is any blame to be handed out about having a price on carbon, I would like to take my share of it because I am proud to have been associated with it. I would like future generations to actually look back as we have, and there are a number of members in here who have looked at the Murray-Darling and participated—I thank the minister at the table, Minister Burke, for his involvement, and I thank the opposition members for their involvement in that committee process that I was involved in as well, and many others in various other forms. What we found was an issue that had been out there for 100 years: majority parliaments were unable to solve it; too much politics, state and federal. We at last engaged in a process, and the opposition and the government of this day should be congratulated for the way in which they addressed that particular process. So in 100 years time people will look back and say: 'Well, at least they addressed it. They may have addressed it a little bit late. They could've addressed it earlier. There were warning signs out there for decades, but at least they've addressed it. It wasn't perfect but it was a start.'


I would like to think that the climate change debate is of a similar nature. It is about the long term. It is not about us. It is not about who the next prime minister is or who the last one was. It is not about whether we are having a tax or a floating price or a fixed price, and that is what the bumper sticker politics has been about here. It is about the long term. It is about future generations. It is about people who have not even been born yet. It is about making a contribution to their futures, to the future generations. It is about the precautionary principle. What if the climate scientists are right? What if they do happen to be right?


I hope the majority of members in this parliament endorse the motion of the member for Lyne, but what if the climate scientists are right and we have done nothing? Do you think it would be cute to be on the Abbott side of the debate, where it is all 'no, no, no' for a short-term advantage so that you can get rid of the Prime Minister and a few other people and take short-term advantage of that? Do you think we will look back and be proud of that particular moment and say: 'We could've done something, but it was more important that we get rid of people, that we persecute people who were involved in the hung parliament. And on the way through, we'll just persecute a few scientists.' We did that with soil science many years ago. The member for Hume may remember that. The member for Groom would remember it too. A lot of the soil scientists were taken out and dispatched because they could not give results in agriculture that were politically saleable in the short term. And what do we have now? Suddenly soil is back on the agenda. Why is it back on the agenda? Because someone said something about humus and organic matter and soil carbon. The shadow minister and the opposition leader have been talking about soil carbon and the relationships with the water cycle and the carbon cycle et cetera and carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. All of those things have suddenly come back into vogue—not because they are particularly interested in them, but because they are different to having a price on carbon. A price because of a statement that the Prime Minister made.


Part of the formation of government process—and I spent time with Ross Garnaut; I spent time with various international people. I actually went to France a few years ago and talked to the IPCC people about the economics of trying to do something about climate change.



Mr Schultz interjecting—




Mr WINDSOR:
  The member for Hume, in one of his classic interjections, is talking about the flatulence of kangaroos. You can hop off now, Alby. I spent time with those various global experts and many other scientists prior to the election. One of the terms and conditions of the formation of government was that this parliament, this government, address climate change. And it is one of the reasons why Tony Abbott was not selected. It is one—it is not the only one, but it is one of the reasons. He was not serious about this particular issue.


With this motion, the member for Lyne is actually finding out who is serious about our scientific community not only on this issue but on many issues where we ask scientists to put in years and years of work and academic research to find out various things that we need to know as a population. I am proud to have put pressure on the Prime Minister. I think the member for Lyne is as well. And there are others in the parliament who put pressure on the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition during that 17-day period to do something constructive about this particular issue. 


If the Prime Minister had had a majority in relation to this issue, she probably would not have had a carbon tax. Institutionally, she would have been required to have one for a period of time to get the economic framework and the financial framework in place. But, after that, it would have morphed into an emissions trading scheme—and, potentially, she could do that today, or within a short period of time, if in fact that was an objective of government. It was a demand of the formation of government that climate change be addressed and that a market focus be part of addressing that particular issue. 


The member for Lyne, myself and others were on the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee that spent many, many months examining how to put the institutional framework et cetera in place. During that time, I argued on a number of causes in terms of agriculture, soil science et cetera and on how to progress some of those issues. Through the various clean energy funds, some of the money has been pumped into soil science, some has been pumped into some biodiversity issues, some has been pumped into encouraging the adoption of no-tillage and various technologies involved in encouraging the development of humus and organic matter in our soils, and some has been pumped into encouraging the water cycle to work more effectively and hence have an impact on atmospheric carbon dioxide. There are a number of things that have come through as a result of this particular parliament.


In my electorate at the moment, we see that the meat-processing sector are taking up some advantages out of the clean energy funds. They are not only reducing their carbon emissions below the carbon taxation levels; they are reducing their unit costs to process the animals. One of the things that was said at the time when all of this came out, 'the dreadful carbon tax', was that we would be uncompetitive internationally in the meat industry and in other sectors of agriculture. That is absolute rubbish. 


The major city in my electorate, Tamworth, is looking at putting in biodigestion processes to grow biomass from its waste material and turn it back into biogas and CO2 for internal glasshouses et cetera. There are win-win situations in this. I am proud and I think we can all be proud of what the scientific community have done to identify what we should do as individuals and as a nation. It is not just us. The question has always been why we should do something when everybody else is doing nothing. That is absolute rubbish as well, and I think Greg Combet has covered that quite well in many of his contributions. The Chinese and the Americans are out there with a whole range of emissions trading schemes and variations on the theme. The shadow minister is correct in saying that there are variations, but let us not denounce our scientific community for the sake of some paltry, short-term political debate. (Time expired)

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2013-05-29,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House, Minister for Infrastructure and Transport and Minister for Regional Development and Local Government) (16:03):  I congratulate the member for Lyne on moving this motion and I want to put on the record my support for the motion. I particularly concur with the comments of the member for New England, who just very clearly articulated why the responsibility to act on climate change is a responsibility of not just this generation but future generations. 


There is the cost of anthropogenic climate change. The cost is due to carbon being emitted into the atmosphere. That has a cost just like other forms of pollution have a cost. And there is a cost from past pollution in an electorate such as mine. For a long period of time, the Cooks River—which I share with the electorates of the member for Watson and the member for Reid—was used to pump rubbish into, because the water was free. The rubbish disappeared, according to some people. They thought it did not have an impact. Along that river, industries such as the sugar mills of Sydney pumped pollution into the atmosphere. That had an impact over a period of time whereby the river became one of the most polluted rivers. The costs of that pollution are now being borne by today's generation, who are spending more money to clean up that river than if an appropriate exercise had occurred then and there had been some foresight in the latter parts of the 19th century and the early parts of the 20th century. I see human induced climate change as a very similar principle. 


The earlier we act the better. We know this. Reports such as the Stern report and all the reports from the United Nations and from every serious economist who has looked at this issue say that the cost of acting now is far less than the cost of delay. Common sense tells you that that is the case. The question is: is climate change happening? Yes, the scientists tell us it is. When there are discussions on this, allegedly about the science, we know that on most scientific questions an overwhelming consensus can be regarded as 80 per cent, 85 per cent or 90 per cent, but on this issue the figure is much higher. You can virtually name the scientists who are sceptical about the impact of carbon pollution on our climate. The question is then the method of action. 


The member for Flinders said that he supports markets, except that he does not. He does not support the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, which was negotiated in the last parliament—negotiation that included the member for Groom, who played an honourable role in that process. 


An agreement was reached between the major political parties about introducing a carbon pollution reduction scheme using a market based mechanism to drive down emissions as the most efficient way to do it. Indeed, not only was the coup in the conservative party room responsible for the fact that that did not get through; on the second occasion some conservatives of principle in the Senate voted with the government in favour of the CPRS. If the Greens political party senators had just got off their seats, walked across and voted to put a price on carbon, we would have had one operating much earlier, but they chose not to. In many ways the CPRS was broader in its impact than the current system that has been adopted by this parliament. For example, it applied in transport in a much wider way.


What we have now though is a system whereby we have a fixed price which will transition to a market based mechanism, using the power of the market to drive down emissions. We know that it is actually working. In the first nine months, emissions in the national electricity market fell by 7.7 per cent. During this same period renewable energy output was up nearly 30 per cent. So it is working. It is doing what we said it would do. What is more, the campaign saying that the coal industry was going to shut, that whole towns like Whyalla and Gladstone were going to disappear off the map, that people would not be able to buy a leg of lamb for their roast dinners on Sundays and that it would have this economic catastrophe has proven by experience, by fact, to be nothing more than a fear campaign.


While it was coming up we saw angry, hostile and violent—both in language and demeanour—campaigns and demonstrations such as occurred out the front of that office, this parliament and my office. I well recall and will never forget the member for Indi speaking at the rally outside my electorate office in Marrickville next to a sign that said 'tolerance is our demise'—in multicultural Marrickville that went down really well!— the coffin that was brought outside my office and the threats and intimidation that occurred outside my office. Fear was being whipped up in the deliberate and misleading campaign that people such as the Leader of the Opposition were prepared to be associated with.


What we have now with this motion is an opportunity for the parliament to confirm that it believes in the science. It is also an opportunity for members, such as the member for Paterson, the member for Durack, the member for Hume and the member for Tangney, to put on the record their opposition to this. It is one thing to say it at a rally out the front, it is one thing to say it at a rally outside my office, it is one thing to say it on the Alan Jones program, but they should come in here and vote on this motion. They should at least have the courage of their convictions. 


There is a lot of nonsense with regard to the alternative plan. Indeed, this week departmental officials told Senate estimates that the Carbon Farming Initiative was expected to achieve just under four million tonnes of emissions reductions. They said that it would produce 85 million tonnes of reduction. Don't worry about the science and what the evidence is before Senate estimates about the impact of their own so-called direct action policy, they will just use magic to deliver 20 times the abatement that is realistically achievable. Based on the latest research by CSIRO, a body of scientists, they would have to reserve up to two-thirds of Australia's entire landmass for their soil carbon magic to achieve the bipartisan emissions targets that are established. 


I note the member for Lyne very clearly indicated in parliament yesterday the bipartisan commitment—five per cent from both sides of the parliament is the commitment. How do you get there? You get there by using market based mechanisms. What concerns me is that not only are there climate change sceptics on the other side of the parliament; there are also market sceptics on the other side of the parliament.


I support the motion moved by the member for Lyne. I think it is quite sad that people who were supporters of the CPRS, such as the member for Flinders, who argued it was going to wreck the economy because the price was too high now are arguing that it appears to be that the price is too low. You cannot have it both ways. What you do is have a market based mechanism that adjusts over time to achieve a positive outcome based upon the science and based upon our responsibility to future generations. I commend the motion to the House.


Question agreed to. 

",HoR,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Climate Change</title>,PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS,13,1
"Morrison, Scott, MP",LP,2013-05-29,"



Mr MORRISON
 (Cook) (16:14):  We have seen this afternoon an attempt by the government and the crossbenchers to delay getting to this matter of public importance because they would rather talk about anything than their own failures in national security. National security is the poor policy cousin within this government. That has been on display today as we have just seen. It has been on display by this Prime Minister when she was Deputy Prime Minister and did not go to National Security Committee meetings, instead sending her bodyguard. Perhaps, when we have been seeking to ask questions of the Prime Minister on these national security matters, given she is unable to understand the questions let alone answer them, we should submit those questions in writing to her bodyguard.


Also, we have seen the Prime Minister today deride the opposition for putting national security on the agenda in this place and holding her government to account for their failures on serious national security matters. This Prime Minister, talking about national security, said the opposition was taking the low road. That is her assessment of having a discussion and a debate and, most importantly, being held to account on national security matters. I think this speaks volumes about the Prime Minister's sense of the importance she places on these matters within her government. National security is just descended in the pecking order of issues that should be under the attention of this government.


There is no greater responsibility of any national government than national security and if the Prime Minister does not believe that that is a topic—national security that she should be asked questions about in this parliament—then she is in the wrong job. But later this year the Australian people will have the opportunity to remedy that. They can put a government in place that will make national security a top priority, as it should be for every national government.


The Prime Minister is oblivious—I think because of her ignorance of these matters and her lack of appreciation of their importance—of the impact and damage that is being done by her own policies. That is no greater than in the area of this Prime Minister's own failings on border protection policy. No area of failure better demonstrates how this government does not work, how their policies do not work, than the impact of their policies on Australia's national security interests.


Every month, more than 3,000 people are turning up illegally by boat to this country—an average of over 2,000 per month this financial year—up from an average of just two per month when Labor came to government all those years ago. Twenty-three thousand people who arrived illegally by boat are now in the system in detention or somewhere else. Nineteen thousand are yet to even be processed, have their asylum applications received or assessed—19,000. By the time we get to the election in September of this year it is likely that we will have in the vicinity of 30,000 people in the system, the vast majority of whom—likely to be over 25,000—will have not had any assessments done on their claims whatsoever. What a legacy caseload that will leave to whoever forms government after the next election! That is no surprise, but I will come to that later.


This government has form on dumping the problems that they cause in one term and passing them off to the other side of an election. Fourteen-and-a-half thousand visas have been denied to people applying offshore in some of the worst places you can imagine because under this government visas have been given to people who arrived illegally by boat. More than 6,000 children have come on boats under this government's policy—a record. And, of course, the record blow-outs in costs have sucked the resources from our national security agencies, whether they be the Australian Federal Police, ASIO, Customs—my colleagues will talk about that today, I am sure. These have gone from $85 million in immigration alone—that is where it started in 2007-08—to $3 billion  on these matters in the budget a few weeks ago for immigration.




Mr Hunt:
  How much?




Mr MORRISON:
  Three thousand million dollars—with blow-outs since 2009-10 of more than $10 billion, and counting and running. Labor's failures here have crashed the detention network—totally crashed it. That was in evidence again last night on the 7:30 program when we were reminded of those incidents on Christmas Island and reminded also of what followed at Villawood. The detention network under this government has become chaotic because, prior to the last election, the then minister, Senator Evans, ignored advice after advice of brewing tension within the detention network. He decided to do nothing, not to expand the detention network, and pushed decisions off to the other side of the election. By the time his successor, Minister Bowen, came to the job it was all too late. Night followed day, and riots followed the inaction of this government.


You might want to understand what happened to those who were involved in those riots, and those who seek to act up, to get a bit of a sense of this government's commitment to national security matters. Minister Bowen said that there had been 'hundreds' of people involved in those riots. He spoke tough at the press conference, saying that the government would use not just the criminal character provisions of section 501 of the immigration act to come down toughly on these people but also the general provisions. You would think out of hundreds of people that this government might have got tough.


This is what happened: of several hundred of those who were involved, 22 were charged and seven were convicted. Of the seven persons convicted, four are in the community having been granted a protection visa—that is pretty tough—one is in the community on a bridging visa E, one is in the community on a removal pending bridging visa, and one has been removed from Australia. Just one person was denied a protection visa because of their involvement and conviction as a result of those riots. Just one! That gives a pretty good idea of where this government sits when it comes to those matters.


After grinding the detention network into the ground and filling it to the brim, this government's next step was to just let people out, not because of any great doubt and compassion, which the government members might pretend when they go to their branch meetings, but because it was full. Left with no other option, in their view, and certainly they were unwilling to countenance the return to the Howard government's measures, they decided simply to let people out.


Since the decision of the government to let people out into the community—at the time they let them out with work rights although we warned the government if they let them out with work rights that would make a bad situation worse—we have gone from an average rate of arrivals over the four years prior to that of 288 per month to now an average of over 1,600 per month. That is what happens when the government decides to continue to weaken the measures and arrangements that are put in place to protect our borders and our national security.


Labor's bridging visa policy is a dumping policy. It is not a compassionate policy. This government is just dumping people into the community, out of sight, out of mind, with virtually no thought attached to that process. People are just dumped out there because there is nowhere else to put them. You might think if you are going to let people out into the community you should probably find out who they are and you should probably find out whether they are a security risk to Australia. In May 2012 in Senate estimates Senator Cash asked a series of questions about how people are assessed before they are released on bridging visas. Senator Cash said:


Do they have preliminary ASIO security clearance? 


Mr Moorhouse, one of the deputy secretaries, said:


Whilst I do not want to go into detail … if we are looking at a temporary or bridging visa for a person—


this is in relation to the ASIO assessment in his words, not mine—


it is a lighter touch.


There are light-touch ASIO assessments for those released into the community under this government because the detention centres are full. They would be in detention centres, as single adult males—and the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship would know this. They would be in detention and not in the community, single adult males who had arrived illegally by boat, if the government had not so badly stuffed up on the borders and let them be overrun and let our detention centres fill to the brim. Being forced into the situation of letting people out, the ASIO assessment that is provided is a 'light touch'. Mr Irvine from ASIO, who was questioned on these matters, said, We check the name against our records.' If someone gives a false name, has a false identity, and they provide that name then that is the check, that is how it is done. That is the light-touch ASIO protection of national security under this government's policies. When you go to the other end of the process—that is only if the government has even referred the matter to ASIO through DIAC—you have DIAC officers making a preliminary assessment as well, based on what has never been precisely clear. We have a light-touch ASIO assessment of people who are put out into the community. 


Why is this a problem for those who have come illegally by boat? Why does this pose a greater risk? I wonder if the government is aware of these figures. Between 2010-11 and 2012-13, the average rate of negative assessments and qualified assessments of people who came by boat as opposed to people who did not come by boat was 20 times higher. The chance of someone getting a qualified or negative ASIO assessment if they have come by boat, as opposed to the other assessments that ASIO conducts through the immigration process is 20 times higher.


You would think with that type of rate, 20 times greater risk, regardless of the actual incidence, you would put a bit more care into the decision and the process. But as usual this government decides to do what it wants to do and does not think through its actions or the consequences. At the end of the day we all end up paying for it one way or the other. 


This is a government that has had a litany of these issues, whether it is Captain Emad who we in this place all remember well. He continues to roam around the world, courtesy of this government. He was let in as a people smuggler and then let out as a people smuggler, with agencies not even speaking to each other and probably ministers not even speaking to each other. Then we have the case of Sayed Ali. When we asked the DIAC officials about him, they know nothing. They do not know anything about this bloke, despite the fact that he was reported in the Australian media. Then we have the red notice issued against a suspected terrorist who was held in a low-security detention facility in Inverbrackie. Then we have the Sri Lankan accused of murdering his girlfriend who was put on a bridging visa under this government. Then we have those who are charged with serious criminal offences and are waiting to go to court, and this minister leaves them in the community. He leaves them in the community with serious criminal charges pending to be addressed in the courts.


This government's attitude and approach to our borders betray a lack of interest. When it comes to our borders and when it comes to our national security, this government's heart is just not in it. It is not serious enough for this government. It is not a core issue. It is not the reason the government is here. It would seem members of the government are here for other reasons. They are certainly not here to protect our borders and they are certainly not here to put national security as the key and first priority of the national government. That is something the Prime Minister has demonstrated and it is something this government has demonstrated by its own actions.


There is an alternative to all of that, and that alternative sits on this side of this House. That alternative is represented by a party that will put back the measures that worked and that this government has rejected. It is an alternative that will actually use section 91W of the Migration Act to deny an outcome for people who we reasonably believe have discarded their documentation. They will not get the benefit of the doubt under a coalition government, but they do under this government. They do under this government because that is this government's view, and the Australian people know it. That is why we have seen myriad failed solutions from this government, whether it is the East Timor solution or the Malaysian people swap. 


I note that at Senate estimates DIAC has confirmed that the Malaysian government has given no indication that it will support the Houston panel recommendations in relation to your own agreement. The Malaysian people swap in its current form has been rejected by the Houston panel. The Malaysian government does not sign up to the change they recommended, so the Malaysian people swap is an excuse to do nothing under this government. This government will do nothing other than blame everyone else for its own lack of interest in national security issues. The solution people are looking for in border protection and national security is an election solution, and it comes on 14 September. (Time expired)

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2013-05-29,"



Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR
 (Gorton—Minister for Immigration and Citizenship) (16:29):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance. Firstly, I can assure the House that I will not be taking lectures on compassion from the member for Cook, who chose to suggest that we should not have allowed a child to go to his father's funeral in Sydney. I will not be taking any lectures from the member for Cook on how we deal with people compassionately. I certainly will not be taking lectures from the opposition on national security when the opposition, for the entire period of this parliamentary term, have done everything they possibly can to avoid listening to the experts in relation to border protection, refugee settlement and diplomacy.


We brought together three eminent Australians—the former Chief of the Australian Defence Force, appointed by the Howard government and, indeed, appointed by our government; the eminent diplomat, the former secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and former High Commissioner of Britain, Michael L'Estrange; and someone who has had over a quarter of a century of understanding in refugee settlement, Paris Aristotle—to come from different perspectives to forge some recommendations so that we could reduce the chances of and deter people endangering their lives by getting on unseaworthy vessels, leading, as we have seen in many cases, to maritime tragedies.


What we would expect from an opposition on matters of national security—if this is a matter of national security, and I believe it is—is a level of bipartisanship that we have not seen to date. For that reason, the Leader of the Opposition will, I believe, go down in history as the most relentlessly negative opposition leader we have ever seen. The opposition leader in this place will do anything and everything if it is in his political interests, and he has shown that time and time again. How can you possibly refute and refuse to accept the experts' evidence on how we should approach these things? Even if there is any doubt on the other side about some of these matters—even if they have some doubts, for example, with respect to the Malaysian arrangement—why would they not allow it to be implemented to see what would happen, given the tragedies we have seen subsequently? 


It seems to me that the opposition will say anything and do anything that is in its own interests. Just as it failed to respond to the experts during the global financial crisis by rejecting decisions made by government, it is now refusing to listen to the experts in relation to this very complex area of public policy; experts like the former Defence Force chief. If as the Immigration minister I have to take advice in relation to these matters I will be taking advice from Angus Houston, not from the member for Cook, if you do not mind.


The problem is that that Leader of the Opposition seems to be taking advice from the member for Cook, and that is a tragedy. We can talk all we like about what we will do with people in our community—and what we have chosen to do in the detention network is ensure people are detained either on bridging visas or in community detention—but, ultimately, we need to find a long-term, sustainable, regional solution to what is a complex problem. The first point of call has to be the Bali process so that we have countries of origin, transit and destination involved. The second is trying innovative approaches like the in-principle agreement we had with Malaysia, so we could see what would happen if we had a capacity to return or transfer arrivals to the transit country.


It is quite extraordinary that the opposition leader effectively says yes to a country that says no—Indonesia—and says no to a country that says yes—Malaysia. Why would he do that? Why, if someone were offered a solution to transfer arrivals to a transit country, would they say no when that country says yes? Why would they say yes to a country like Indonesia that says no to receiving people by returning back the boats? Why would they do that? Because they do not want to see something succeed. What they want to see happen is more boats. What the member for Cook and the opposition leader want to see, as they rub their hands, is more boats arriving in our waters. That is why they have chosen to not accept the recommendations by the expert panel in relation to these matters, including the Malaysia arrangement. It is the height of cynicism and negativity to go down that path.


If this were some simple municipal matter, some small domestic reform or initiative, then that would be something we could perhaps accept in the partisan nature of our parliamentary process. But this is a matter of national interest. This is a national security matter. Yet the opposition leader thinks it is entirely proper that he refuse to accept the way in which the government should proceed as advised by our national security and law enforcement agencies, and by the expert panel convened by this government. This will never be forgotten, I can assure you, Deputy Speaker, by those who will look back and say: 'What an extraordinarily reckless opposition leader. What an extraordinarily dishonest opposition that refuses to accept the advice of those experts.' It is extraordinary behaviour to refuse to accept such advice.


In relation to the other efforts made by the member for Cook to demonise and vilify certain people, to scare our communities by making all sorts of wild allegations about people on bridging visas, this is the lowest of the low we could ever see in this place. When they start to demonise and vilify people and scare our community, we can see this is an opposition that wants to run a fear campaign and frighten our community. I have not forgotten the member for Cook's efforts to scare people by saying we needed a register of people in our community. Notwithstanding the fact that these have gone through identity, security and health assessments, we need a register! I remember Senator Abetz following that commentary by the member for Cook, saying, 'It is not exactly the same as child sex offenders, but we need a register.' Fancy comparing people on bridging visas—in many cases genuine asylum seekers—with sex offenders! That is the level of the debate that has been conducted by the opposition in relation to these matters, and the opposition should collectively hang their heads in shame. It is a disgraceful act, it is a disgraceful form of behaviour. Is it any wonder that there are members opposite who are ashamed of the way the opposition are conducting themselves in relation to these matters. 


This is a very important area of public debate but it goes to what really can be done and what really can be committed to by the opposition. We recall that before the last election the opposition leader had 'Stop the boats' as his slogan; that was his policy. That is all he had and he has had it for three years. But as we get closer to the election and he sees a chance that he may win the election—in fact he is already celebrating that he has won the election—he is trying to work out how he is going to stop the boats with a slogan. How can we stop the boats with a slogan? 



Opposition members interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr S Georganas
):  Order! There are too many interjections on my left, and some members are not in their seats.




Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR:
  What we have watched in recent times is the opposition leader and the member for Cook and indeed the member for Stirling walk away from this commitment. First it was three months. Fran Kelly in 2010 asked the Leader of the Opposition: 'So if you have not stopped them in three months?' He said: 'Oh, I think in three months we will make a very big difference.' Then it was between six and 12 months in October last year when he was asked: 'Can you be more specific? Would that be 12 months or six months?' The opposition leader said, 'Well, within those time frames.' Then it was 'a few months' again on 21 February this year. Then the member for Cook could not say when or how they would stop the boats. He said on 13 March in an interview on 2GB: 'I believe we can get back to the outcome that the Howard government achieved. I do not put any time frames on it and I am not about to. I am not about to make such forecasts. I would like to see it happen as soon as possible.' This is the new slogan of the opposition—it is 'Stop the boats as soon as we possibly can' or 'Stop the boats but I can't put a time frame on it' or 'Stop the boats because we would just like to do so'. The fact is that they have walked away from their slogan because as they get closer to the election they realise they have nothing in place to stop the vessels and they have not listened to the experts and they have not engaged with the region effectively. 


As I talk about engagement with the region, let us think about what the shadow minister, the member for Cook, has done in his dealings with the region. Can you imagine a person who wants to be minister for immigration—although I am told he may not want to be minister for immigration; I hear that he is pleading to get out of the portfolio just in case they win. But just imagine this if we can. Let us imagine that you want to be minister for immigration and you need the region's support. Why don't you fly to a foreign country like Malaysia, stand on Malaysian soil, call a press conference and abuse the reputation of that country? That is effectively what the member for Cook did. He thought, 'What is a good idea? How do I get a regional solution to this regional problem? I think I'll fly to Malaysia, call a press conference and abuse of Malaysian government.' That is effectively what the member for Cook did when he visited Malaysia. 


And what did the opposition leader do in relation to Indonesia? He has got a 'turn back the boats' policy. He meets the president of Indonesia, and does he raise the issue? He did not even ask the question: will you accept turning back the boats? Do you know why he did not ask the question, Deputy Speaker? Because he knows the answer is no. So here you have an opposition leader who says no to the country that is yes and yes to the country that says no. Why does he do that? Because he wants the policy to fail, he wants to see more boats because he works on his base political interests, motivated for personal gain—not motivated in the national interest, motivated for the wrong reasons, for the wrong purposes. Indeed, the opposition has shown its disregard for the national interest the entire time of this parliamentary term.


There must be a point where the opposition has to come clean about its policy, because stopping the boats ain't enough. All the qualifications and inconsistencies they come up with, all the assertions they make, they have absolutely no basis for putting them forward. The member for Stirling talks about stopping the boats. He may say that but you actually have to explain it. Let us think about it. We have no regional architecture in place; we have abused the Malaysian government—



Mr Keenan interjecting—




Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR:
  The member for Stirling will get his go in a minute.



Honourable members interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member for Stirling will have his opportunity. It is far too noisy in this place, from both sides of the chamber. 



Mr Keenan interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Stirling will stop interjecting.




Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR:
  The fact is that this opposition has done everything it possibly can to stymie the expert advice that was provided to the government in order for us to see a reduction in people dying at sea, people coming to our shores, people getting onto vessels in circumstances where they should not. That is the most important element of all. It seems to me that when the consequences are so tragic then it really is incumbent upon the parliament to come together. 


We have had an opportunity on a number of occasions in this parliamentary term for the parliament to come together to reduce the chances of people dying at sea—men, women and children perishing at sea. It seems to me that we can talk about fiscal costs, and they are important, and we can talk about all sorts of costs. But what about the human cost of not stopping these vessels? Therefore, it seems to me entirely proper that the parliament—that is, the opposition and the government—rely upon the expert advice that has been provided to us and try that approach. Even if the opposition in some cases does not agree with all the recommendations or even if the opposition thinks that this may not be entirely effective, why would they not give it a go? This is in the end about not only whether we can protect our borders but whether we can protect people, particularly children, endangering their lives at sea. 


I call upon the opposition to rethink its position in refusing to support eminent Australians' views about these matters. I think it is absolutely critical that we do that. The fear-mongering that is continuing to be conducted by the opposition should cease. It is not leadership to scare the community, it is not leadership to frighten people in their homes, it is not leadership to demonise vulnerable people.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2013-05-29,"



Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (16:44):  Do not wish that on the member for Indi, Mr Deputy Speaker! We have just heard everything that is wrong with the Gillard government. The minister who is actually responsible for doing something about these problems got up for 15 minutes and did nothing more than rant about the opposition's policies. It is not leadership when all you can do is complain about the opposition when you have completely failed to control our borders and when Labor's border protection failures are, without a doubt, their most significant policy failure in the life of this parliament.


This MPI today focuses on the very significant implications for our budget and the significant national security implications of Labor's border protection failures. I want to particularly focus on the national security dimensions, given that the member for Cook has already outlined some of the budgetary problems that are associated with this failure. Firstly, I want to talk about what this is doing to our national security establishment. The national security agencies are the agencies that are tasked with cleaning up Labor's mess. We have got the wrong immigration policies. That is encouraging people smuggling and it is encouraging people to take this dangerous journey, and the national security agencies are the ones that are forced to deal with the consequences. Secondly, I want to talk about what happens when you lose control over who comes here and the fact that undesirable people will seek to take advantage of that.


We have been talking in question time today about ASIO and the cuts that ASIO have had to their budget. This has been confirmed to the opposition by government responses to Senate estimates questions. ASIO have had significant cuts in the life of this government, both the Rudd and the Gillard governments. By this stage they were supposed to have 1,860 people. That was the goal of the Howard government, which was adopted by the Rudd government and was recently abandoned by the Gillard government, who have frozen ASIO staffing at 1,730. This is occurring at a time when ASIO are being asked to make security assessments on the upwards of 42,000 people who have arrived here courtesy of a people smuggler. They have been asked to conduct 34,000 security assessments, and the drain on their resources is enormous.


When people arrive here on a people-smuggling boat the chances of them having identity documentation are very slim, because they are told by the people smugglers to destroy it. So I think people in this chamber can appreciate how difficult it would be to properly establish somebody's identity. In fact, with the resources at their disposal, it is impossible for them to do a comprehensive security assessment on the sheer volume of people who are arriving here, so they do what is called a light-touch assessment. That means that you come in and you say to the Australian authorities, 'My name is Bill Bloggs,' and then they go and check the name 'Bill Bloggs' against their intelligence holdings and they come back and say, 'Well, we don't have anything on Bill Bloggs, so that is all fine.' They do not have the resources at the moment to properly establish someone's identity and they are forced to accept the identity that is given to them by the person who they are supposed to be vetting.


Clearly this is an unsatisfactory situation. It means that there could be people coming to Australia who, quite frankly, we do not want here. Astonishingly, in light of the fact that ASIO's workload has gone up so much and their budget has been cut, one of the budget cuts that was inflicted on them by the Labor Party was a $6.9 million cut to the budget that ASIO have to conduct these security assessments on asylum seekers.


ASIO, our national security establishment, are not alone in being subject to, firstly, very significant cuts by the Labor Party and, secondly, having their resources diverted away from other things that they should be doing to deal with Labor's border protection failures. The Australian Federal Police have been the subject of very significant budget cuts since the Labor Party came to office. In every single budget they have had both funding and personnel cuts—to the point where they are clearly struggling to fulfil their responsibilities, as the Australian public expect of them. At the same time, they are forced to divert an enormous amount of resources to, firstly, tracking down people smugglers and, secondly, dealing with some of the consequences of the fact that we have a detention network that is literally falling apart.


The AFP's public order specialists—basically the federal government's riot squad—have been forced to sit at Christmas Island to deal with any unrest that might occur. That is enormously expensive. To prosecute people smugglers is also enormously difficult and expensive and it takes an enormous amount of Federal Police resources—resources that could of course have been used to go after other criminals rather than people smugglers if that trade had not been reinvigorated by the Labor Party's failed border protection policies.


Customs and Border Protection have been dealt savage blows by the Labor Party since they came to office. Under the Howard government, Customs had 5,850 officers; under the Labor Party, their workforce has been reduced by over 15 per cent and they now have 5,000 officers. Customs have enormous challenges in dealing with the increase in cargo that is coming into Australia and in dealing with the reinvigorated people-smuggling trade through Customs and Border Protection Command. Customs have had to divert an enormous amount of their resources to deal with Labor's border protection crisis, and this has occurred in an agency that has been savagely attacked by the Labor Party for six years—to the point where the opposition has serious concerns about whether Customs have the resources that they require to stop contraband and other goods from coming into Australia.


There are consequences when your national security agencies are having their resources attacked, when they are having their personnel numbers stripped and when they are having to divert an enormous amount of their time and energy to deal with Labor's self-induced border protection crisis. One of those consequences is that it is virtually impossible for the national security establishments to make a sensible judgement about the sheer volume of people who are arriving here and whether they pose a threat to the Australian community.


Under the Labor Party's failed border protection policies, 42,500 people have arrived here illegally. We know that upwards of 60 have failed security assessments and we are hearing now through the media—not through the government, because they refuse to come clean about these things—about particular cases that have caused enormous concern for the opposition.


One case in particular was somebody who was the subject of an Interpol Red Notice, the highest form of alert that the international policing organisation can issue. It is the equivalent of an international arrest warrant. Somebody who arrives in Australia who is the subject of such a notice should have immediately rung alarm bells within both our law and order community and our national security community.


Instead, what happened was that the Labor Party placed him for almost a year in the low-security detention centre at Inverbrackie in the Adelaide Hills, a detention centre they promised the locals nobody remotely dangerous would be placed in. If you are the subject of an Interpol Red Notice, you are a serious person of interest to another law enforcement body, in this case, presumably, the Egyptian government, and you are not somebody who should be appropriately detained within a detention centre that is effectively surrounded by a pool fence.


When the government was alerted to this—and I do not know when they were first aware of this—they kept the guy in Inverbrackie for almost a year. They did not do anything about it until it was raised in a newspaper, and when it was raised in the media they moved this individual to Villawood, which is a higher security environment. It is not even clear that the government was aware of who they were keeping in Inverbrackie until they were alerted by the media, and they have failed to explain why it took the media exposing what had occurred before they took some action to put this person in a more appropriate detention environment.


In the case of another man who has come in via people smugglers, somebody who is accused of murdering his girlfriend, what happened was even worse. He was released into the community on a bridging visa as an accused murderer.



Government members interjecting—




Mr KEENAN:
  Now the government is interjecting, but can anybody seriously stand up on the government side and say that they believe this is an appropriate way to deal with people who are accused of the most serious crimes? I challenge anyone—and the government has a couple of speakers coming up in this debate—to get up and tell the Australian people that there are no other cases like this within the 42,500 people they let into Australia courtesy of people smugglers, because they are failing in their serious responsibility to protect Australia's borders.



Mr Champion interjecting—




Mr KEENAN:
  And there are consequences of that. There are budgetary consequences—over $10 billion blown out and wasted, $10 billion that could have been spent on other priorities for the Australian people—and there are national security consequences, that we have highlighted here today, for our agencies that are already being stripped of resources by the sustained attack on them by the Labor Party since they have come to office.

"Danby, Michael, MP",ALP,2013-05-29,"



Mr DANBY
 (Melbourne Ports—Parliamentary Secretary for the Arts) (16:55):  Since I have been in this parliament, like many other people, I have taken the view that we should treat intelligence matters in a bipartisan way. We all acknowledge that the security services must be allowed to do their work, subject of course to appropriate parliamentary scrutiny, without being made the subject of partisan bickering. Most parliamentarians feel that the security of the Australian people is more important than politics. During the years of the Howard government, we on this side gave steadfast support to the government's changes to our security laws in the wake of the 9-11 attacks and the Bali bombings. We did this despite considerable criticism of the government from the media and academia, who thought we should have opposed those measures. But we took the responsible view and supported them in the national interest.


In contrast today we have heard the intellectually lamentable performance from the member for Cook who conflated the increase in boat arrivals with national security. Of course there is not one person convicted of a major terrorist crime who has arrived in Australia by boat. As part of the bipartisan concern that I think we should evince on security matters, senior members of the opposition are given briefings by the security agencies so that they are fully informed of developments. That privilege afforded to us when we were in opposition is now afforded to the current opposition. The confidentiality of those briefings has always been respected. 


A significant breach of this convention has taken place in recent days. Comments of the shadow Attorney-General, Senator Brandis, appear to reveal information he was given as part of a briefing from ASIO. I am not going to compound that breach by repeating what he said, or by commenting on it. I respect the senator for Queensland, the would-be Attorney-General, a person who would be in charge of our national security, but he ought to know better. In a further breach of the tradition of bipartisanship in national security matters, the opposition in question time yesterday and again today have tried to claim that funding to our national security agencies has been cut under this government. It is easy for an opposition to make these allegations, as it was easy for the member for Stirling to talk about the man who came here from Egypt, based on press cuttings. Does he think the government knows nothing else? Of course they do. But the government cannot respond because it cannot reveal confidential information.


Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition and Senator Brandis should have spoken to the honourable member for Berowra, a former Attorney-General and a man for whom I have a great of respect on security issues despite our other party differences, before they embarked on this reckless course these last two days. Moreover, as the chair of the intelligence committee, the honourable member for Holt said in answer to the own-goal question from the Manager of Opposition Business today, 'The Leader of the Opposition is as unqualified on national security matters as the former member for Werriwa, Mark Latham.' 


The Leader of the Opposition's spurious campaign, the essence of it, can be very easily dealt with, and the Prime Minister dealt with it very effectively yesterday when she explained there had been no cuts to our security services. Since this government came to office, there has in fact been an increase of $18 billion in national security funding. In this budget ASIO gets an increase of $32 million. Since 2007, ASIO's funding has risen by 27 per cent and ASIO's staffing has risen from 1,349 to 1,778, a 32 per cent increase.


I think all members of this House regard this expenditure on security as justified. Since the murder by Jamaah Islamiya of 88 of our fellow Australians in Bali, there have been no successful attacks on mainland Australia. That is to the great credit of the security services and to the non-partisan support for them and their activities by both sides of politics. So the hysteria about national security and alleged decreases in the budget and their effects by the members for Stirling and Cook have no real basis in fact. We in this country are very lucky that there have been no killings of Australians on mainland Australia.


Until my elevation to parliamentary secretary, I was a member of the Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and Security, chaired by the honourable member for Holt. In the years I served on that committee I never heard our able national security agencies say they were unable to fulfil their tasks because of a lack of resources.


Without revealing any of the confidential information that was given to the committee when I was a member of it, I can say that the efficiency of our intelligence services has not been affected by funding considerations. Of course, no government agency can expect a blank cheque in the context of any budget. But this government, like previous governments, has given a very high priority to the safety and security of the Australian people and has funded our agencies accordingly.


 In recent weeks we have seen shocking confirmation of the security challenges facing Western democracies, with a spread of Islamist terrorism: in Boston with the killing of innocent bystanders at the end of the marathon and also a police officer; the cold-blooded murder of a British soldier in the streets of London; and a similar event in France. Fortunately, we have seen no such attacks in Australia. It is not a matter of luck; it is a matter of the highly competent and highly effective response by our national security agencies, funded by this government and previous governments.


Since 2003, there have been 35 prosecutions of terrorist related charges, resulting in 26 convictions. However, it is proper to note that some of those convictions are still subject to appeal. Each of those convictions represented a real threat to our national security, not some of the nonsense that was talked about by the member for Stirling, and they were thwarted by our security services. These security services would not have been able to do that unless they were properly funded, staffed and resourced and, indeed, unless they had people who were there with the spirit of Australia to protect their fellow Australians.


This line of attack from the Leader of the Opposition, in my view, is very hollow when we know that he and his shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for North Sydney, are publicly committed to cutting $70 billion from government spending. If the Leader of the Opposition wants to give a commitment that security agencies will be exempt from Public Service cuts here in Canberra, I would be pleased.


If the Leader of the Opposition wants to be taken seriously on national security, then he will come into this House and direct the honourable member for Wentworth that he will not allow the Chinese telecom Huawei permission, against the explicit advice of the security services—the security services they have been lauding and talking about so effusively over the last few days—to bid for the NBN. The security services of Australia have advised the Australian government and the Australian government has followed their advice that Huawei will not be allowed to bid for the NBN. That is not supported by the opposition spokesman on communications.


If the Leader of the Opposition is really serious about national security and concerned about these kinds of issues, I call on him to follow the advice of the security services and to come into this House and explicitly tell the Australian people that he will follow their advice and not that of the spokesman on communications.


The Leader of the Opposition has also committed himself to sacking 20,000 public servants. Has he given an undertaking that these cuts will not affect the security services? Again, unless he is prepared not to cut ASIO staff, his comments over the last few days on national security will be seen as humbug, because that is what they really are. You cannot cut the security services and promise that you will do that, not offer them any exemptions, and then come into this place and go around the country railing about the effects on national security.


All in all, this has been a sad day for those of us who really care about national security and who have tried to take a bipartisan line on these issues. We have seen the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow Attorney-General play some of the cheapest, most dishonest kinds of politics with these matters. I think it is a disgrace and I think it is harmful to our real national security. I hope that the opposition will pull back from this reckless and irresponsible course and take the counsel of people such as the member for Berowra.

"Christensen, George, MP",Nats,2013-05-29,"



Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson) (17:04):  Threats to national security are very important to any nation. But we are faced with this Labor government that simply cannot grasp the serious nature of the issue that is before us right now.


The Australian people have watched on as the government took a perfectly good solution—the border protection measures that were put in place by the Howard government—and dismantled it. They tore it down. They threw away a perfectly good solution and created for themselves and for the nation a problem, an escalating problem—a problem that is so out of hand that the very issues that were actually raised in this place by way of an MPI a couple of weeks ago pose a serious threat to the Australian public.


The budget, as we all know, is in crisis. The $5 billion border protection blow-outs in the budget, resulting from this government's poorest border policy, are a threat to the Australian people. It is the taxpayers who have to fork out for this waste and this largesse. It is the taxpayers who have to stand by and watch their government open the doors and windows and invite terrorist threats into their country.


Every time someone gains illegal entry into Australia without documentation, without identification, without knowing who these people are and what their background actually is, we open the door to a potential national security threat. When we open the door to two of those unauthorised entries, that threat is doubled. If three illegal entries sneak through the back door, then it is tripled. The reality is that, in the last week alone, 900 security threats entered through the doors. And that is this government's legacy.


Since November 2007, when the term of the last government ended and this government came to power, we have seen over 42,000 illegal immigrants arrive on Australian shores. The population of the Whitsunday Regional Council in my electorate is smaller than that!


The sheer scale of Labor's border protection failure now surpasses the population of most towns in my electorate of Dawson. And people in my electorate have genuine concerns about their country throwing its doors open to economic refugees, to people smugglers, to human traffickers and, potentially, to terrorism threats.


We have had 22,000 illegal arrivals come to this country so far this financial year. That is a figure that the department of immigration has admitted could blow out to 25,000 by 30 June. Yet we have the government pretending in their budget that somehow they are going to get it down to 13,200. That is simply not going to happen. This month is the second consecutive month in which more than 3,000 people have arrived by boat in Australian waters. That is going to continue as long as this government remains in power.


But, as I said, people in my electorate have genuine concerns about this issue and about the potential security threat. And so they should because, in the post 9/11 world, we see airport security getting tighter and tighter and tighter, and we see all of these measures in place, but we see border security, under this government, getting looser and looser and looser.


When I warned of potential security threats to our country when I spoke on the last MPI, it was not just my view. This is what the Australian Federal Police have to say about illegal entrants gaining access to our country. They say it raises serious security and criminal concerns. It raises quarantine and health issues. It costs, obviously, time and money in processing. Most importantly, they say, illegal immigration infringes on Australian sovereignty, giving us less control over our own borders. As I said, they are not my claims; they are statements found on the Australian Federal Police website in relation to people smuggling.


The Gillard Labor government, not content with having the worst border security crisis in the history of our nation because they dismantled the policies that actually worked, are now trying to pull the rug out from under our national security agencies. These are the agencies that are charged with the responsibility of ensuring that those who are coming illegally to our shores do not pose a risk to this nation.


This is what the Labor Party wants to do about those agencies. At the start of this month, on 1 May, there was a report on Radio National headed 'Labor backbenchers pressure government on ASIO assessments' in which we heard:


The Federal Government says it's considering calls by its own backbench for increased scrutiny of the way ASIO makes adverse assessments of asylum seekers.


These guys—and I presume there are some backbenchers over there who are amongst them—are upset because 55 asylum seekers are being detained by ASIO because they are security threats to the country. They want them released into the community. So, far from recognising the security threat to this nation, the Labor Party wants to ignore what our national security agency, ASIO, is saying, and just let them in.




Mr Champion:
  You voted to let them in.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member for Wakefield will have his opportunity in three minutes.




Mr CHRISTENSEN:
  Thank you very much, Mr Deputy Speaker, for defending my honour! The member opposite will get his opportunity. But I have to say that he and every other member of the government ignores the advice of ASIO at its peril.


I am reminded of a story which was printed in The Australian on 4 September 2001. That was fortuitously one week before the infamous 9/11 attack on the World Trade Centre. That report was titled 'Bin Laden code red in Jakarta'. It said:


INDONESIAN and foreign military and government officials are concerned the organisation of notorious international terrorist Osama bin Laden is looking to Indonesia as a potential springboard for terrorist operations.


It quoted the then US Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, James Kelly: 


Mr Kelly said the flow of illegal immigrants from South Asia and the Middle East into Indonesia was a further source of concern. “If it’s easy to move people under strange identities around that’s a capability that terrorists who we know exist can then use.”


That is what he said.


Speaking about these issues, earlier this month the world watched in horror as scenes unfolded in the UK of the brutal slaying of a British soldier in the middle of London. There are two suspects in this barbaric atrocity, Michael Adebowale and Michael Adebolajo, both Muslim converts of African descent. Intelligence agencies warned of copycat attacks. But the intelligence services themselves have actually come under fire over in the UK for allowing these two men to slip through the net in the first place. According to reports, both of those men were on the radar of intelligence agencies but were not considered to be serious security threats.


A similarly revolting attack unfolded earlier in the year at the Boston Marathon where the accused perpetrators were family members of men granted asylum in the US. Russia had strongly opposed the US's decision to grant those people asylum, but America had ignored the warnings.


The Adelaide Advertiser reported yesterday that a suspected terrorist wanted by Interpol had lived in Inverbrackie with his family for about nine months, in a detention centre with the equivalent of a pool security fence. He was able to go out into the community, to go out to the local mosque, I assume, and on trips to the library—that was the level of security around that fellow. We cannot go on ignoring these warnings. We cannot continue to expose our citizens to unnecessary elevated risk.


The Liberal-National coalition has a plan to restore the borders, but I fear that the crisis that this government has created means that we are actually going to have to go much, much further than the Howard government went. 



Mr Champion interjecting—




Mr CHRISTENSEN:
  Adult governments need to take the concerns of their citizens seriously. Adult governments need to take the most important concerns and the important responsibility of national security seriously, because a nation without a border is like a house without walls; a house without walls is not a house, and a nation without borders is not a nation— (Time expired)

"Champion, Nick, MP",ALP,2013-05-29,"



Mr CHAMPION
 (Wakefield) (17:14):  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I apologise for my indulgences taken while you were in the chair. There can be no greater threat to the nation's security than a political party that puts its short-term political interest ahead of the national interest. That is what we have seen from this opposition, who only a year ago came into this House and voted against giving the government the power to do the Malaysian transfer agreement. They sat in this House with the Greens party, over on that side of the chamber, and voted against giving the government the ability to implement the Malaysian transfer agreement that may have prevented people coming through regular maritime arrivals.


This has been a long debate. It has been going on since the seventies. In the seventies you had Mick Young and Ian Macphee—those two fine gentleman of this House—sit down, in the wake of the terrible war in Vietnam and in the wake of 1,700 boat people arriving on our shores, and come to an agreement to bring refugees to our country in a safe way. That was part of bipartisan consensus, and it was a great tribute to Mick Young. The Labor Party at the time could have played the same grubby, short-term politics that the opposition today play. We could have done that, but Mick Young didn't—and Ian Macphee didn't. In the eighties and the nineties the Hawke and Keating governments implemented agreements with countries from which asylum seekers had fled from, like China and the rest, to prevent such arrivals and they implemented mandatory detention. It was the Labor Party which implemented that. It was the Labor Party which first said that we should manage the borders in that way.


Now we come to the noughties, in particular 1999 and 2001. We often hear the opposition crowing, in a sanctimonious way, about how John Howard solved this issue but they neglect to tell you that it is an issue that they presided over. In 1999, when John Howard was Prime Minister, 3,700 people arrived by boat. In the year 2000, when John Howard was Prime Minister, 2,939 people arrived by boat. In 2001, 5,516 people arrived by boat. An issue was resolved on his watch that he presided over.




Mrs Mirabella:
 He resolved it. Bring yourself to that. He stopped the boats.




Mr CHAMPION:
  But here's the thing—I hear the interjections and I am reasonably gracious towards the former Prime Minister—and here is the difference. He had a parliamentary majority, he had an opposition that actually supported him—just like Mick Young and Ian Macphee. But what do we have today? An opposition that puts its own dark partisan interest ahead. They come in here with all this talk about national security and they talk about matters they frankly know nothing about. They are at a dangerous level of ignorance, and ignorance is what we heard from the member for Dawson. We hear this dark partisanship repeated over and over again at this point. We had the member for Stirling come in here and give us a lecture about national security. Last year, in the debate over the Malaysian transfer agreement, he blubbered; he had tears up there at the dispatch box. That is what we had from Joe Hockey, the shadow Treasurer. Now we get this lecture. You cannot have it both ways. You cannot come in here last year and frustrate the government's ability to act by voting with the Greens party in a sickening marriage of convenience—after all the lectures about how the Greens party are evil they came in here and voted with them—and then, a mere eight months later, roll in here with this sort of dark partisanship. It is reminiscent of the reds under the bed. Oh, they're coming to get you!


I will be quite plain with the House. I do not want people arriving by boat to this country. I will be quite plain that zero would be the primary number that I would like, so zero people arriving. I am not against refugees coming to this country and settling appropriately if they are good citizens and if they are good Australians. That is what we have been doing since the fifties. But what I am against is people taking a dangerous journey, a journey that endangers their lives and the lives of ADF personnel and Customs officials. I am against that because frankly we get these issues. That is why I pushed in my party for a long time for mechanisms like the Malaysian transfer agreement. That is why it was so galling and stunning to come into this House and see the Liberal Party, who beat their chests relentlessly about this, go over there and vote with the Greens and frustrate the government's ability to act.


The truth is we will never know what effect the Malaysian transfer agreement might have had. It might have prevented the sorts of arrivals that we had. It might have prevented the 6,000 Sri Lankans who decided to try and come here by boat, of which 1,100 or so have been removed back to Sri Lanka by the government, so sent back home. We do not know what effect the Malaysian transfer agreement might have had. It might have had the effect of dissuading people from making irregular maritime arrivals. I think it is a great misfortune for this country that not only did the opposition vote against it but they have trashed this option by trashing the Malaysian government in the process in their vindictive dark partisanship—




Mr Danby:
  Short-termism.




Mr CHAMPION:
  Yes, short-termism. So they trashed the Malaysian transfer agreement and the option to do transfer agreements with other countries. They trashed that option and trashed a key part of the Bali process. Then what did they do with the expert panel? I can tell you what they did with the expert panel. They said from the outset of the expert panel, 'Well, the expert panel can do what it likes but we'll ignore it. We've got our own solution.' That brings me to their own solution. The minister alluded to this, that they have got one big promise—'We're going to stop the boats. We're going to turn back the boats.'—but I can tell you that this is a very, very dangerous high-risk policy. We had an un-named Navy officer quoted in the Australian on 23 January 2012 saying:


“They'll see us and they'll burn their boats,” … ""They'll do that to stop us repairing them.""


Then we had Vice-Admiral Ray Griggs, the head of the Navy, in Senate estimates—a serious forum—saying:


… there were incidents during these activities, as there have been incidents subsequently, which have been risky. There have been fires lit, there have been attempts to storm the engine compartment of these boats, there have been people jumping in the water and that sort of thing … yes, there are obviously risks involved in this process.


That is a terrible, terrible risk to take. You hear the Navy telling us that this is a dangerous option to pursue and yet Tony Abbott, what is his response? On Sky News on 21 April this year he said:


It's not easy and we've had various naval officers tell us that it is tough, and that people don't always like it.


I'm not saying that it's not difficult, under certain circumstances, it might even be dangerous …


So even the Leader of the Opposition acknowledges that this option might be dangerous. And not just dangerous for asylum seekers, but it is also going to be dangerous for ADF personnel. That is who it is going to be dangerous for. And anybody who has been up and seen the important work that those people do would not put them in danger. And yet that is what the Leader of the Opposition, this armchair general sitting here in Canberra, is going to do. He is going to give them orders to turn back boats to a country that has made it clear—Indonesia has made it clear that it is not amenable to this policy.


So they have trashed every option. They have trashed Malaysia and they are in the process of trashing our relationship with Indonesia. It is a disgrace. We have an opposition that are so brazen. They think they have the election won and they are so brazen that they would come into this House and talk about national security, and in their ignorance display their idiocy—the member for Dawson, who is a fool, displays his ignorance—but the truth is that they use this issue as an incense burner for their vanity and for their lust for office. They will regret it in the long run because in their short-termism they have betrayed the national interest—not betrayed the government, but betrayed the Australian people.

"Griggs, Natasha, MP",CLP,2013-05-29,"



Mrs GRIGGS
 (Solomon) (17:24):  I was just gathering my thoughts as I was listening to the member for Wakefield. I understand he is very emotional and he is upset because his party trashed the Howard government policies that worked, and that has had a significant impact on him because the Labor brand is trashed and it is going to impact on him in his seat come September.


This matter of public importance focuses on national security and the budget. We have heard members on both sides talk about the impacts on the budget and national security. I would like to take a bit of a different stance: I will talk about the budget implications, but I will also talk about my electorate that I proudly represent. I spoke on this issue a couple of weeks ago, and the boats just still keep coming. I guess that is why I thought it was really important that I speak again on this very important issue.


Managing Australia's borders is about balancing the need of those who flee their homes and embark on an often dangerous journey to travel here with the needs of the Australian community, and the detriment that this budget overkill has had on the Australian economy. I have said many times in this place that it is of great concern to me that people smugglers exploit the vulnerable, and I remind the House that the Gillard Labor government is implicit in this because it removed the border protection policies of the former Howard government that were proven to work. The Gillard Labor government has had opportunity after opportunity after opportunity to fix the border protection chaos that this has created, but it has done nothing except continue to give the people smugglers a product to sell.


The Gillard Labor government's policies have left our hardworking border protection, Customs and Defence personnel overworked and understaffed. And we now know that ASIO personnel are also under pressure because there is a backlog of security checks that need to occur because of the spike in arrivals. Earlier today I asked the Prime Minister in question time:


I remind the Prime Minister of the admission yesterday from immigration officials that 63 asylum seekers have escaped from immigration detention in the last year and 25 are still on the run.


And I asked the Prime Minister could she:


… guarantee that all these people had undergone comprehensive ASIO security checks prior to the escape into the community


Well there is probably no surprise here, but there was no direct answer from the Prime Minister—the one who is responsible for laying out the carpet for the people smugglers, giving them a product to sell. But do you know what? The Australian people want answers, and they want this problem that Labor created fixed. They are sick of it.


We now know from Senate estimates that around 25,000 people are expected to arrive here on boats. The member for Wakefield said in his contribution that he wants the boats to stop; he does not want the boats here. We on this side also do not want—we want the boats to stop; we do not want people coming here illegally. As I said, we now expect 25,000 people to arrive here on boats this financial year, and we know already that there have been 148 boats carrying more than 10,000 people this year courtesy of the people smugglers and the Gillard Labor government.


People from my electorate ask me what is the cost, and that is a very good question—one that I think many Australians will be interested to know. The Gillard Labor government's failed border protection policies have cost taxpayers $10 billion, with $5 billion of that $10 billion being spent this year alone. I can only dream of what $10 billion could do in my electorate and my colleagues' electorates. It would just be amazing. Imagine having money to spend on improvements in health, education, community safety, housing and child care. I could do a lot with $10 billion, what about you guys?



Opposition members:  Very much so, yes.




Mrs GRIGGS:
  But instead this money is being spent on a policy that is clearly not working.


Last time I spoke on this issue a couple of weeks ago, I outlined the boats that are targeting the Top End waters. There have been some new arrivals. I think it is only appropriate to give the facts because we like to deal with facts in this place. About 30 minutes after my last speech, there was another boat that arrived in Top End waters. So I will just go through the list again.


On 1 January this year, HMAS Armidale intercepted a boat west of Darwin carrying 43 people. On 28 February, HMAS Launceston intercepted a boat north-west of Darwin carrying 33 people. On 20 March, HMAS Pirie intercepted a boat west-north-west of Darwin carrying 78 people. On 24 March, HMAS Pirie intercepted a boat north-west of Darwin carrying 41 people. On 27 March, HMAS Pirie again intercepted a boat, south-west of Darwin, carrying 147 people. On 3 April, HMAS Bundaberg intercepted a boat north-west of Darwin carrying 41 people. On 9 April, HMAS Ararat intercepted a boat north-west of Darwin carrying 73 people. On 17 April, HMAS Childers intercepted a boat west-south-west of Darwin carrying 78 people. On 21 April, HMAS Maryborough intercepted a boat north-west of Darwin carrying 67 people. On 23 April, ACV Ocean Protector intercepted a boat north-north-east of Darwin carrying 65 people. On 26 April, HMAS Maitland intercepted a boat west-north-west of Darwin carrying 75 people. On 3 May, HMAS Albany intercepted a boat west-north-west of Darwin carrying 160 people. On 4 May, ACV Botany Bay and MV OMS Endurance intercepted a boat north-west of Darwin carrying 105 people. On 13 May, HMAS Glenelg intercepted a boat at Cobourg Peninsula carrying 11 people. On 14 May, ACV Triton intercepted a boat west of Darwin carrying 42 people. And, on 17 May, HMAS Armidale intercepted a boat north-west of Darwin carrying 80 people. That is 16 boats targeting Darwin carrying almost 1,200 people.


On top of these boats, we have another 310 people being transferred to Darwin for processing since 14 May. On 14 May we had 49 people transferred. On 16 May we had two people transferred. On 19 May we had 76 people transferred. On 22 May, 85 people were transferred. On 23 May, 98 people were transferred.


Is it any wonder that Territorians are asking me questions about the cost of the Gillard Labor government's failed border protection policies? It is also the additional pressure that is put on my electorate with the service providers. It is already hard enough to get service providers in the Northern Territory, but having extra people has put pressure on my electorate. We all know very well that every dollar spent on border protection policies is money not being spent on or in our communities. The people of Darwin and Palmerston, in my electorate, are telling me that they are tired of the Gillard Labor government's failed border protection policy. They want it fixed and they want it fixed now.


Let me finish by saying that there is an alternative for the Australian people. We have a choice, and that choice is to vote for the coalition come 14 September because the coalition has a plan, an alternative, to mitigate the disastrous impact that the Gillard Labor government has had on border protection policy. We have stopped the boats before and we will stop them again. The coalition will restore what the Labor Party abandoned, and that was a strong border protection regime developed by the coalition as a priority to protect our nation's borders. The coalition will reintroduce offshore processing of illegal boat arrivals as part of a series of measures to stop the boats and protect our borders. We will prevent this problem by minimising the numbers coming from both initial countries of origin and first asylum countries. We will disrupt the business of people smuggling and intercept the boats when safe to do. (Time expired)

"Symon, Mike, MP",ALP,2013-05-29,"



Mr SYMON
 (Deakin) (17:04):  On behalf of the standing committee on education and employment, I present the committee's advisory report, incorporating a dissenting report, on the Australian Education Bill 2012, together with the minutes of proceedings and evidence received by the committee. 


Ordered that the report be made a parliamentary paper.




Mr SYMON:
  by leave—on 29 November 2012 the House Selection Committee referred the Australian Education Bill for inquiry and report. The reason for the referral was to enable the committee to consult with school communities regarding the development and implementation of the National Plan for School Improvement. The bill articulates the government's aspirations for school education in Australia. It also provides the foundation for a legislative framework that seeks to put an excellent education for every child at the heart of how Australia delivers and funds schooling. 


The purpose of the bill is: to articulate and acknowledge the government's aspirations for schooling; set goals for Australian school education that address those aspirations—namely, to provide an excellent education for all students, to be highly equitable and for Australia to be placed in the top five countries in reading, science and mathematics in quality and equity in recognised international testing by 2025; to commit to a national plan for improving school performance and student outcomes; to itemise the reform directions for a national plan that will achieve the government's aspirations and goals; and, to make agreement to implement a national plan for education authorities a prerequisite for receiving a Commonwealth government funding for schools with grants based on outlined principles.


The bill incorporates core recommendations made by the Gonski review to implement a dollar per student resource standard and various dollar loadings for disadvantage, regardless of the type of school the student attends; and, a National Plan for School Improvement. The inquiry received 53 submissions and conducted public hearings in Canberra, Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne. Evidence was taken from a wide range of stakeholders, including principals, unions, Catholic and independent schools, teachers, parents, educators and academics.


The committee made five recommendations, including that the House pass the bill with the amendments outlined in its advisory report. The explanatory memorandum to the bill stated the government's intent to move amendments to the bill following the conclusion of negotiations with states, territories and the non-government school sector. The two amendments give effect to any funding model agree to and address the legal enforceability of the final act. Stakeholders discussed at length the possible content of the funding formula, and some stakeholders expressed concern regarding clause 10 and the 'legal unenforceability' of the bill.


On the funding formula it must be emphasised that the committee was not tasked with reporting on proposed amendments to the bill. Rather, it was the bill at hand. To enter into speculation on what the government ought to agree is beyond the terms of the referral to the committee and possibly deleterious to the confidential negotiations between the Commonwealth, state and territory governments, and non-government education authorities.


On clause 10 the committee was advised by the DEECD departmental lawyers that this type of provision, whilst not common, is not without precedent and there are examples of similar provisions in other Commonwealth statutes. Moreover, both amendments are likely to occur before the final passage of the bill.


The Australian Education Bill foreshadows fundamental reforms to education in this country—reforms that are overdue and vital to the future of our children and the nation's prosperity. I would like to thank all those who provided evidence to the inquiry; the previous chair of the committee, the member for Kingston; my committee colleagues who participated in the public hearings and report consideration; and the committee secretariat. I commend the report to the House.

Mr RAMSEY
 (Grey) (17:34):  By leave—the coalition members of the committee are in broad support of the aspirational goals of the Australian Education Bill but are of the opinion that it is not good process to recommend to the House that the House of Representatives pass a bill when the committee has not been able to ascertain what implications the final bill will have for Australia.


At the end of the inquiry coalition members were asked to support a recommendation that the bill be passed. It became apparent throughout the inquiry that in fact the bill was incomplete and cannot operate without quite serious amendment, particularly to the last clause, which the chair just referred to, clause 10, which of course says that the bill is non-legally binding.


It occurs to the members of the coalition that to recommend that the House pass a bill when we do not know what the effect of that bill will be—what impact it will have on education, what impact it will have on schools throughout Australia—is reckless. But we are not prepared to recommend that the House not pass the bill. What we suggest is that the bill be returned to the House. The government should make the appropriate amendments to allow that bill to function, and then it should be re-referred to the Standing Committee on Education and Employment to provide some guidance to the House as to whether the bill is likely to function in the way in which the government proclaims that it should.


Quite a number of contributors raised the issue with us that there was a lack of detail. One contributor said that they had 16 different variations of the funding model. The independent schools association of Australia said that they thought it was more like 30. At that stage, they had no idea where the negotiations were likely to settle. Given that we have been finding out more in the press about this process than we actually found out in the committee, it seems to me and to the rest of the coalition members that we should have another chance to review the bill when that negotiation is complete. 


At this stage, this is an aspirational bill and, as I said earlier, the aspirations are in fine order. So I look forward to the ensuing debate that is likely to come—perhaps even in the next few hours—and I look forward to seeing what amendments the government is going to put forward to facilitate the operation of this bill throughout Australia. The schools and the schooling systems in Australia need to know how this bill and the new regime will affect their funding model just for next year, because this is due to be implemented from 1 January 2013. At this stage, unless something has happened behind closed doors in very recent times, I understand there is no certainty at all surrounding those issues. So we look forward to the debate and we look forward to the government's amendments. I hope in the end that we will be able to support them.

"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2013-05-29,"



Ms MACKLIN
 (Jagajaga—Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister for Disability Reform) (18:31):  The Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2013 makes changes to the baby bonus, announced in the 2012-13 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. I will shortly be moving government amendments to add to this bill two measures affecting families that were announced in the 2013 budget package: a more sustainable family payment system.


Since coming to government we have worked hard to modernise the family payment system. We have restructured and improved assistance to deliver more help to low- and middle-income families when the cost of raising children put the most pressure on the family budget. We have delivered Australia's first national paid parental leave scheme and increased the child care rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent of out-of-pocket costs up to $7½ thousand per child per year, the schoolkids bonus to help families with the cost of their children's education, higher payments for families with teenagers to encourage them to stay at school, family payment increases as part of our Household Assistance Package and tax cuts to millions of working families.


We have made responsible decisions over a number of budgets to better target family payments while also delivering record levels of assistance to low- and middle-income families who need it most. The savings from these budget reforms will be redirected to deliver the government's A National Plan for School Improvement to benefit our classrooms, teachers and kids for generations to come.


As announced in the 2012 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, the baby bonus for second and subsequent children who come into a family from 1 July 2013 will be reduced to $3,000 but will continue to be paid at the rate of $5,000 for a family's first child. New family payment arrangements to be introduced through government amendments will mean the baby bonus will cease from 1 March 2014. In place of the baby bonus families who are eligible for family tax benefit part A who are not accessing the paid parental leave scheme will receive an additional loading on their payment to help with the upfront costs of having a new baby. The extra family tax benefit part A payment will be $2,000 for a family's first child and for each child in a multiple birth and $1,000 for second and subsequent children. It will be paid as an initial instalment of $500 with the remainder rolled into normal fortnightly payments over a three-month period. Payments for parents of a stillborn child will be delivered in full as a lump sum.


This decision delivers on a recommendation from the 2010 Australia's Future Tax System Review, known as the Henry review, which found the baby bonus provides more assistance than is necessary to cover the cost associated with the new child and recommended that assistance be restructured when the government delivered a national paid parental leave scheme.


We are also making changes to the work test under the paid parental leave scheme, making it easier for working mothers with children born close together to qualify for parental leave pay for subsequent children. These changes will allow parents to count periods of parental leave pay as work under the work test just as employer-funded parental leave entitlements can be counted under the current rules.


These amendments also reduce the claim period for family assistance lump sum claims. Families choosing to wait until the end of the financial year to claim their family tax benefit or child care benefit entitlements will now have a grace period of one year instead of two years in which to claim. This change will start from the 2012-13 entitlement year, meaning families will have 12 months from the end of that year until 30 June 2014 in which to claim their entitlement. Families will also have one year in which to lodge their tax returns if they are to receive the end-of-year family tax benefit supplement and meet immunisation and health check requirements linked to the end-of-year family tax benefit part A supplement. The vast majority of families already meet the new claim period and will not be affected. Families will be affected by this change only if they wait longer than 12 months to claim family tax benefit or child care benefit for the previous financial year or to lodge their tax return.


Families will be able to access extensions in special circumstances, similar to arrangements for tax returns. This change brings family payment claims periods more into line with time limits for lodging tax returns before penalties may be imposed and with the policy intent of the family assistance program to assist parents with the day-to-day costs of raising children.


The original bill also included minor amendments which were outlined in my second reading speech. The government is pleased that the opposition has decided to support the bill and the amendments. I am surprised that the opposition has expressed opposing views on each of these changes over the course of the last few weeks, but nevertheless I am pleased to see that the amendments will go through. We have seen the shadow minister railing against changes to the baby bonus. He was then rolled by the shadow Treasurer, but then we saw the shadow Treasurer railing against the increase to family tax benefit part A payments for families with newborns before being rolled by the shadow minister.


All of this comes from a party room still being part of an ongoing revolt against their leader's unfair and costly paid parental leave scheme which rewards wealthy women and leaves ordinary women behind. By contrast, this government is making sensible changes to our family payment system to make sure that every Australian gets a fair go, not just those who can afford it. We are making the responsible decisions that will see better schools and DisabilityCare have long-term funding certainty. I commend the bill to the House.

   (a) the individual, or the individual's partner, is a parent of the child on that day; and


   (b) the child is aged less than one on that day; and


   (c) if this subclause were to apply for that day, the individual's Part A rate, disregarding reductions (if any) under clause 5 or 25A of this Schedule and disregarding section 58A and subclauses 38AA(3) and 38AF(3) of this Schedule, would be greater than nil on that day; and


   (d) that day occurs in the period of 13 weeks beginning on the first day that paragraphs (a) to (c) are satisfied; and


   (e) if the individual is, under a law (the registration law) of a State or Territory, responsible (whether alone or jointly) for registering the birth of the child in accordance with the law—the Secretary is notified, or becomes aware, at any time before the end of whichever of the following periods is applicable, that the birth registration requirement is met:


      (i) the first income year after the income year (the relevant income year) in which occurs the last day on which paragraphs (a) to (d) are satisfied;


      (ii) if a further period in respect of the individual's claim for payment of family tax benefit in respect of the child was allowed under paragraph 10(2)(b) of the Family Assistance Administration Act and that claim is for a past period falling within the relevant income year—such further period (if any) as the Secretary allows in special circumstances.


(3) For the purposes of paragraph (2)(e), the birth registration requirement is the requirement that:


   (a) the birth of the child has been registered in accordance with the registration law; or


   (b) the individual, or the individual's partner, has applied to have the birth of the child registered in accordance with the registration law.

      (i) if the person's PPL period is 13 weeks or more—at least 13 weeks of that PPL period; or


      (ii) if the person's PPL period is less than 13 weeks—the whole of that PPL period.

   (a) under this clause, an amount of newborn supplement is added in relation to an individual and an FTB child of the individual for a period of 13 weeks; and

"Andrews, Kevin, MP",LP,2013-05-29,"



Mr ANDREWS
 (Menzies) (18:40):  What the government is effectively doing is reducing the baby bonus from $5,000 to $2,000 for a first child and to $1,000 for second and subsequent children. Technically, the government is abolishing the baby bonus but then introducing a payment under the family tax benefits regime. Effectively, the net result is a reduction from $5,000 to $2,000 for the first child, and from $5,000 to $1,000 for second and subsequent children. In addition to that, the threshold at which the baby bonus cuts out is being reduced under this legislation. This is part of what has been a long-term attack on the baby bonus by the Labor government. In the MYEFO statement on the bill now being amended, the baby bonus was being reduced from $5,000 to $3,000. Before that, we had measures taken by this government to cut the indexation of the baby bonus. This is consistent with the attitude of the government towards the baby bonus.


Why in the space of a month or so has the government decided to reduce it not just to $3,000 but to $2,000 for the first child and to $1,000 for second and subsequent children? The reality is this is about saving money for the government. The savings under this measure add up to about $1.3 billion over the forward estimates. In other words, this government is taking $1.3 billion from Australian families who would otherwise have qualified for the baby bonus. This should more fairly be called the 'Labor debt baby bonus reduction bill'.


I go back to why the coalition introduced the baby bonus in the first place. There is a lot of talk these days about middle-class welfare. The reality is that this measure was introduced as a result of the first Intergenerational Report which said that this country needed to do three things in order to ensure its future prosperity: the country needed to ensure that the population continued to grow; we needed to ensure that participation in the Australian economy was there for as many people as possible; and we needed to increase productivity. Population, participation and productivity were the three key levers for economic prosperity as identified in the Intergenerational Report when it was first released by former Treasurer Mr Costello.


Why is population important? For a couple of reasons. One is that at that stage the fertility rate, the birth rate, in Australia had fallen to 1.7 children per woman on average. The replacement rate is about 2.1. Analysis and research around the world show that when a country's population rate falls to about 1.5 or less it becomes virtually impossible to lift it again. Why is that important? It is not important just for any social private good that comes from having children; it is good for future economic prosperity of a nation. About a quarter of economic growth, not just in Australia but historically across the world, has been shown to come from population growth itself. A country like Australia, which allows its population not to grow and its fertility rate to drop, is therefore in danger, by that measure alone, of reducing its economic growth.


So this is not just a measure, as it is sometimes portrayed, about welfare. This is a measure put in place to ensure that the fertility rate increased and, as a result of this measure, according to experts such as Peter McDonald, the demographer at the Australian National University, this was the main reason the population birth rate jumped from 1.7 to 1.9. It had a positive impact, and that is what this government, in its short-termism of now having to deal with the debt, is putting in jeopardy. It is putting in jeopardy aspects of economic growth in Australia.


This measure is going to most impact upon single-income families. For those families where a partner is in the workforce the parental leave scheme was introduced. Those people who qualify for the parental leave scheme do not qualify for the baby bonus. Some of the funding that was originally there for the baby bonus now goes towards the parental leave scheme. But those on a single income, those with stay-at-home mums, for example, are going to be the ones who cop the brunt of this $1.3 billion decrease in funding to families over the forward estimates.


This is not a measure that the coalition would have taken. The coalition put in place the baby bonus for the very real economic and other reasons which I have briefly outlined in my contribution this evening. We would not have taken this measure, yet we now find ourselves in a very difficult situation. Since this legislation was introduced we find that we have yet another major deficit from the government. We have yet more increase in the Commonwealth debt and, therefore, we have to take a responsible position in relation to these matters. That is why we reluctantly accept these measures. That is why we are not opposing them; not because this is what we would have done had we been in government and had better control over the management of the finances of the Commonwealth of Australia, but because of the very difficult economic situation that this government leaves this country in at this time. For those reasons, we will not oppose these measures.

"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2013-05-29,"



Ms MACKLIN
 (Jagajaga—Minister for Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Minister for Disability Reform) (18:31):  The Family Assistance and Other Legislation Amendment Bill 2013 makes changes to the baby bonus, announced in the 2012-13 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook. I will shortly be moving government amendments to add to this bill two measures affecting families that were announced in the 2013 budget package: a more sustainable family payment system.


Since coming to government we have worked hard to modernise the family payment system. We have restructured and improved assistance to deliver more help to low- and middle-income families when the cost of raising children put the most pressure on the family budget. We have delivered Australia's first national paid parental leave scheme and increased the child care rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent of out-of-pocket costs up to $7½ thousand per child per year, the schoolkids bonus to help families with the cost of their children's education, higher payments for families with teenagers to encourage them to stay at school, family payment increases as part of our Household Assistance Package and tax cuts to millions of working families.


We have made responsible decisions over a number of budgets to better target family payments while also delivering record levels of assistance to low- and middle-income families who need it most. The savings from these budget reforms will be redirected to deliver the government's A National Plan for School Improvement to benefit our classrooms, teachers and kids for generations to come.


As announced in the 2012 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, the baby bonus for second and subsequent children who come into a family from 1 July 2013 will be reduced to $3,000 but will continue to be paid at the rate of $5,000 for a family's first child. New family payment arrangements to be introduced through government amendments will mean the baby bonus will cease from 1 March 2014. In place of the baby bonus families who are eligible for family tax benefit part A who are not accessing the paid parental leave scheme will receive an additional loading on their payment to help with the upfront costs of having a new baby. The extra family tax benefit part A payment will be $2,000 for a family's first child and for each child in a multiple birth and $1,000 for second and subsequent children. It will be paid as an initial instalment of $500 with the remainder rolled into normal fortnightly payments over a three-month period. Payments for parents of a stillborn child will be delivered in full as a lump sum.


This decision delivers on a recommendation from the 2010 Australia's Future Tax System Review, known as the Henry review, which found the baby bonus provides more assistance than is necessary to cover the cost associated with the new child and recommended that assistance be restructured when the government delivered a national paid parental leave scheme.


We are also making changes to the work test under the paid parental leave scheme, making it easier for working mothers with children born close together to qualify for parental leave pay for subsequent children. These changes will allow parents to count periods of parental leave pay as work under the work test just as employer-funded parental leave entitlements can be counted under the current rules.


These amendments also reduce the claim period for family assistance lump sum claims. Families choosing to wait until the end of the financial year to claim their family tax benefit or child care benefit entitlements will now have a grace period of one year instead of two years in which to claim. This change will start from the 2012-13 entitlement year, meaning families will have 12 months from the end of that year until 30 June 2014 in which to claim their entitlement. Families will also have one year in which to lodge their tax returns if they are to receive the end-of-year family tax benefit supplement and meet immunisation and health check requirements linked to the end-of-year family tax benefit part A supplement. The vast majority of families already meet the new claim period and will not be affected. Families will be affected by this change only if they wait longer than 12 months to claim family tax benefit or child care benefit for the previous financial year or to lodge their tax return.


Families will be able to access extensions in special circumstances, similar to arrangements for tax returns. This change brings family payment claims periods more into line with time limits for lodging tax returns before penalties may be imposed and with the policy intent of the family assistance program to assist parents with the day-to-day costs of raising children.


The original bill also included minor amendments which were outlined in my second reading speech. The government is pleased that the opposition has decided to support the bill and the amendments. I am surprised that the opposition has expressed opposing views on each of these changes over the course of the last few weeks, but nevertheless I am pleased to see that the amendments will go through. We have seen the shadow minister railing against changes to the baby bonus. He was then rolled by the shadow Treasurer, but then we saw the shadow Treasurer railing against the increase to family tax benefit part A payments for families with newborns before being rolled by the shadow minister.


All of this comes from a party room still being part of an ongoing revolt against their leader's unfair and costly paid parental leave scheme which rewards wealthy women and leaves ordinary women behind. By contrast, this government is making sensible changes to our family payment system to make sure that every Australian gets a fair go, not just those who can afford it. We are making the responsible decisions that will see better schools and DisabilityCare have long-term funding certainty. I commend the bill to the House.

"Briggs, Jamie, MP",LP,2013-05-29,"



Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayo) (19:00):  Australia is often described as a sporting nation. For a country of 23 million people, we match it with some of the largest countries in the world and in many cases beat them. We are a proud sporting nation. It was therefore a massive shock to the nation when the heads of the five major sporting codes and two ministers stepped out on 7 February this year to release the Crime Commission's report entitled Organised crime and drugs in sport.


At that press conference we were told by the Minister for Home Affairs that 'the use of prohibited substances including peptides, hormones and illicit drugs, is widespread amongst professional athletes'. We were also told that 'organised crime is involved in the distribution of these drugs', which 'exposes players to the risk of being co-opted for match fixing' and that investigations had found at least 'one possible example of' match fixing. The home affairs minister went on to say:




The findings are shocking and they'll disgust Australian sports fans.





…
   …
   …



… we're talking about multiple athletes across a number of codes, we're talking about a number of teams.


He went on to say:


It's cheating, but it's worse than that, it's cheating with the help of criminals.


Not surprisingly, the next day's headlines across the country included: 'Blackest day in Australian Sport'—TheAge; and 'Dirty rotten cheats'—the Herald Sun. If the government's aim was to create a media circus, they had achieved it.


Of course, if there are allegations of criminality or criminal activity in sport then they must be dealt with forcefully. Anyone found to have done the wrong thing should be dealt with by the law. The coalition, however, has long been concerned that the Gillard government saw the Crime Commission report as an opportunity to divert attention away from their political troubles and leadership tensions at the time. Let us remember what was going on at that time. Just a week earlier, two cabinet ministers had decided to resign and, of course, we all knew that the member for Griffith and his allies were circling the Prime Minister. The report was an opportunity to give the Prime Minister some clear air. So the decision was made—presumably by the guru 457 visa holding communications adviser in the Prime Minister's office—to summon all sporting code heads to Canberra and to release the report. The press conference was, for lack of a better word, a farce. Two of the five sports chiefs who attended the conference had been in their jobs for less than a week.


We have now learned through an FOI request that the AFL had not even seen the final ACC report the night before the press conference. In an email to the Minister for Sport's office dated Wednesday, 6 February 2013 at 8.13 pm an ALP official said: 'Are we any closer to seeing a final version of the report and possibly a draft media statement tonight?' This strips bare the chaos and dysfunction of the Gillard government. It is clear that the press conference was arranged in haste—the FOI shows that. It is also clear that the press conference was designed to create a sense of crisis. Why else would they summon the heads of Australia's major sporting codes to a Canberra press conference and have ministers use rhetoric like, 'It's cheating, but it's worse than that, it's cheating with the help of criminals'? Sports minister, Kate Lundy, did her best to weigh in, proclaiming, 'We are well on the way to seeking out and hunting those who will dope and cheat.'


Today we have heard, and read in a report in The Sydney Morning Herald written by Jonathon Swan, that cabinet ministers have criticised the Minister for Home Affairs for using 'overblown rhetoric'. But it also appears that this overblown rhetoric and timing of the report's release have put investigations at risk. We understand that senior police, including one Crime Commission board member, hold serious concerns about the timing of the press conference and the nature of the release. We understand the government's announcement has been described by high-ranking police officers as 'circus-like', 'crazy' and 'with the potential to impact adversely on the broader investigation'.


There is now little doubt that the government put its own interests ahead of Australian sportspeople and their fans, but in doing so, have also put the broader investigation at risk. The Gillard government has damaged Australia's proud sporting reputation, left our athletes guilty by association and potentially put ongoing criminal investigations at risk. This was described as the 'blackest day in Australian sport'. It should now be described as another black day for the Gillard government. I call on the Minister for Home Affairs and the Minister for Sport to apologise to the many thousands of innocent sportspeople they have unfairly smeared and apologise for putting an ongoing investigation at risk simply because their government needed political cover for a drowning Prime Minister.

Mrs MIRABELLA
 (Indi) (19:10):  I rise to speak about an important issue to the community of Corryong in the Upper Murray region of my electorate. Corryong is a town of some 1,300 people. It is by no means one of the smallest communities in my electorate, but it is perhaps the only one without access to SBS television. I have had contact with many locals from the Corryong community who are perplexed about why they do not have access to this government-funded service. It goes without saying that in 2013 you would ordinarily expect a service such as this to be available to all communities regardless of their size. Yet I am told that SBS does not have sufficient funding to guarantee service to towns with a population of fewer than 3,000 people. 


The point is interesting in itself, because there are many towns in my electorate with a population of fewer than 3,000, all of which have access to SBS television. For example, the towns of Bright, Yea, Tallangatta, Bonegilla, Alexandra and Yackandandah, just to name a few—and of course there are many more—all have populations of fewer than 3,000 as at the 2011 census. So it is becoming an increasing source of frustration to my constituents in Corryong, and understandably so.


I first raised this matter in July last year and it was met with enthusiasm of course by locals. I have since written to the communications minister, Stephen Conroy, as well as the Managing Director of SBS, Mr Michael Ebeid. I recently received a response from Mr Ebeid and I am encouraged by his strong interest in expanding SBS services to more rural locations across the country. 


I think this is an important mission for SBS. This is a taxpayer service and it should be readily available to all Australians. It is simply inequitable to deny taxpayers in a small town a service for which they pay, especially when the technology is available at relatively small cost to facilitate this. 


In a response I have received from the minister's office, it has been suggested that the Corryong community should simply make an application for a self-help tower. I do not believe that it is fair or reasonable to expect the Corryong community to take responsibility for the ongoing maintenance of a broadcasting facility when that facility is provided to the rest of Australia without that same responsibility, and particularly when we consider the following fact. The thing that frustrates the Corryong community most is that the basic infrastructure is already in place. The broadcasting tower was recently upgraded to provide for digital signals so the provision of an additional transmitter for SBS would surely not be that difficult or costly. So locals in Corryong quite rightly raise the issue: if the government can provide access to ABC television, surely they can provide the same access to SBS television.


I want to take this opportunity to thank the Managing Director of SBS for his ongoing dialogue with me on this very important matter. I look forward to meeting with Mr Ebeid to discuss this matter further in the near future and I can only hope that Minister Conroy is as enthusiastic to expand SBS coverage as Mr Ebeid is. This is important. It is important not only because my constituents in Corryong have been asking for this important service; it is also important to show our smaller communities across the country that they are not forgotten. So often, it is a case of out of sight, out of mind. The further away that a community or a town is from the capital city in a relevant state, the more isolated they are and out of sight from the authorities. I feel very passionate about my electorate and I feel particularly passionate about standing up for some of the smaller communities.


It is not just about, as some politicians would have it, going to where the big votes are; it is about representing all of the electorate and doing everything you can to fight on their behalf. I tell my constituents in Corryong that I will continue to fight for them, including continuing to fight for them to get SBS coverage, and I look forward to the day when that can happen.

Mr TRUSS
 (Wide Bay—Leader of The Nationals) (09:30):  My electorate was hit by serious flooding in 2011 and 2013. Generally the governments at state and federal level have acted promptly to put emergency assistance in place, and the electorate is very grateful for that. However, a number of anomalies have been identified in the way in which the assistance has been provided. I want to draw attention to some of those today.


Under the guidelines of the Australian government disaster payment, someone must be isolated from or stranded at their principal place of residence for 24 hours. If four or five adults are in that property they can claim between $4,000 and $5,000 if their gas or other utility is not available for a period of 48 hours. Those payments are generous and in 2011 they were also interpreted very liberally. But in the 2013 flood, there seemed to have been a radical change in the way in which the same guidelines were interpreted.


Whole suburbs that were isolated received assistance in the 2011 flood but in this flood there was a very strict interpretation put on isolation on your property. If you could take one step onto your neighbour's property you no longer qualified, even though that neighbour might also have been isolated. They are many examples like that. For instance, Kay Kelly could get onto her neighbour's property but her neighbour was also isolated so to do that was completely valueless. A person on a farm property could have been isolated for weeks but if they could take one step onto their neighbour's property they did not qualify for these benefits. That seems to me to be grossly unfair and needs to be reviewed.


In addition to that there are issues associated with how assistance could be used. For instance, you were able to use the money to repair your shop or to get your business operational but you could not use the money to replant a crop if you received category C assistance. If you got category D assistance, you could. That to me seems to be illogical.


Another problem my electorate faced was that your local government area had to be declared to receive the benefits. I have examples of people living just across the border of a local government area who would have qualified for the benefits but got absolutely nothing because of the fact that their shire was not declared. These sorts of inconsistencies need to be addressed. When there are no pending disasters it is the right time to review these criteria. I think it is time. I wrote to the minister about these issues. He has declined every single one of them even though he expressed sympathy to me on these matters. Now is the time to review these criteria.

Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein) (10:01):  I rise to speak on the International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill 2013. This bill amends the International Monetary Agreements Act 1947 to provide a standing appropriation and authority to borrow for payments to meet drawings made by the International Monetary Fund under a bilateral agreement entered into by Australia and the IMF on 13 October 2012. The loan agreement will come into force following royal assent to the bill. The loan agreement will provide for Australia to lend to the IMF, up to the equivalent of special drawing rights, $4.61 billion, or approximately A$6.8 billion. The bilateral loan shall have a term of two years, extendable by the IMF for up to two additional one-year periods for a maximum total term of four years.


Australia has had a long association with the IMF. It has been a member since 1947, two years after the IMF came into formal existence in 1945. The coalition fully understands that the IMF advances Australia's interest by supporting stability in the global economy. It does this in four ways. First, it promotes international monetary cooperation. Second, it promotes exchange-rate stability and orderly exchange arrangements. Third, it fosters economic growth and employment. Fourth, it provides temporary financial assistance to members, thereby helping to ease balance-of-payments adjustment.


Australia has two current lines of credit with the IMF. The first is its usual quota contribution. This was doubled following a decision by IMF governors in December 2010. The quota commitment increased from just over A$4 billion to A$8 billion in the 2011-12 financial year. The second is the New Arrangements to Borrow. This is a contingent liability of the government to be drawn down on request of the IMF.


Last year the government introduced a bill which made three amendments to Australia's credit arrangements with the IMF. The coalition supported these changes. That bill made three changes. First, it reduced Australia's contingent liability under the New Arrangements to Borrow line of credit by $3.2 billion. However, that reduction was conditional on the doubling of Australia's primary quota from A$4.1 billion to A$8.8 billion. Second, it increased the maximum maturity of the IMF drawings under the NAB from five years to 10 years. Third, it reduced the New Arrangements to Borrow for a period of five years commencing 17 November 2012.


The loan agreement under the bill currently before the House is in addition to the existing facilities. It can only be used by the IMF if the existing quota and New Arrangements to Borrow are insufficient to support its lending to borrowing member countries. The Treasurer announced this new $7 billion commitment in April 2012. It was part of global efforts to enhance the financial backstop against further international volatility.


The proposed agreement is Australia's contribution towards a broad round of global commitments announced at the June 2012 G20 leaders' summit in Los Cabos, Mexico, to temporarily increase the IMF's resources by more than US$450 billion during a period of heightened global financial risks. Other countries who have pledged commitments to date include the United Kingdom, China, France, Germany, Japan, Russia and Indonesia. 


This additional funding facility for the IMF emerged out of the chaos of late 2011, when it looked as if additional financial support would be required to bail out a failing Europe. At that time there was a great deal of fear that the market disquiet about Ireland, Greece and Portugal would spread to other countries in the eurozone. The IMF wanted to be sure it had the resources to handle any crisis.


The trouble was that some of the largest economies had misgivings about providing additional support. The UK Chancellor of the Exchequer said at the time that the UK was prepared to consider additional funds to the IMF, where the funds were used to increase the resources that the IMF makes available to all the countries of the world. But the UK was not prepared to see IMF resources reserved for use only by the eurozone. It was not prepared to contribute to the IMF for the IMF to contribute to the eurozone bailout fund, and the UK made it clear it would not directly contribute money to the eurozone bailout fund.


Elsewhere, the US Deputy National Security Adviser for Strategic Communications, Ben Rhodes, said there were no plans for the United States to provide additional resources to the IMF. China, at the time, tentatively agreed to participate in the European bailout fund but made it clear that such support would come with some fairly hefty strings attached. The first would be that other countries contribute. The second would be the provision of strong guarantees on the safety of the investment. The third might be a request to Europe to stop criticising China's currency policy.


The coalition has always supported the role of the IMF in assisting troubled countries back to financial health and has supported the provision of Australia's share of IMF funds. However, at the time this new facility was first suggested there was debate about the appropriateness of Australia in effect providing support to developed countries who should have had the resources to get their own houses in order. There was also concern that Australia would need to provide any moneys drawn through increasing its own borrowings at a time when the budget was in deep deficit and borrowings were already rising to record highs. The government did not heed these concerns and rushed headlong into promising support, with no consultation with the opposition or the parliament or the Australian people. 


The coalition believes it is important that Australian funds be used by the IMF only as part of its standard arrangements for assisting countries. That would involve the extension of loans to be repaid with interest, only in conjunction with strict plans for returning the countries to financial health. It would not be appropriate for any Australian funds to be put at risk or for funds to be provided without strict performance benchmarks and repayment schedules in place. 


I note that if the additional funds were to be used for specific support for Europe the Australian government has imposed no conditions on the use to which the IMF can put these funds. This is an unfortunate position that we have been put in, when we find that the government, despite record levels of increases in Australia's debt, have taken this decision without consultation with the parliament, the opposition or with the Australian people. There is a simple lesson that must be learned from the current financial stresses in much of the Western world: if debt is the problem the more debt is not the answer. 


The coalition understands this. It is not clear that the government does. The coalition will not oppose this bill; however, we want to place on the record that the government needs to exercise greater caution and prudence before loading Australian taxpayers with further debt to financially support some of the richest countries on the planet.

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (10:09):  I rise to speak on the International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill 2013 and to support the comments made by the member for Goldstein. This bill will see the Australian taxpayer underwrite close to $7 billion worth of funds to the IMF, supposedly as part of the global effort to enhance the financial backstop against further international volatility. This commitment was made in April 2012, at a time when this government had promised that our budget would be returning to surplus. On something like 500 separate occasions the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have given an ironclad commitment  that, come hell or high water, the budget would be returning to surplus. However, we know that that promise has been broken and that that commitment to the Australian people has been dishonoured by this Labor government.


In this current financial year, we see an expected deficit of $19.4 billion. However, this financial year has not yet come to a close, so there is a very good chance that, by the time we close the books at the end of June, we will see the $19.4 billion deficit rise even higher. And here we have the most bizarre and extraordinary spectacle with this bill. Here we are in Australia laden with debt—already with five budget deficits in a row and with a sixth and a seventh  committed to by this government, were they to be re-elected—yet we are going to provide money to an international organisation that produces nothing. They will then loan this money to even more irresponsible countries which have greater debt than we do. Under this bill, we will be borrowing money from countries such as China and lending it to places like Greece, which will use it to pay off the German banks which have financed a generous Greek welfare state. The process and the outcome of such folly cannot be good in the end. 


We need to realise that the only way these indebted countries can lift themselves up is to ensure that they follow the principles of free markets and property rights and encourage entrepreneurial activity. That is the only way they can create the wealth and activity necessary to lift themselves out of their debt crisis and to rein in their reckless spending.


If we are to lend this money to the IMF, we must demand greater accountability. That brings me to one of the loans the IMF is proposing: a $4.8 billion loan which the IMF is currently negotiating with Egypt. The IMF are calling on Egypt to rein back some of their reckless spending and to reduce their debt. I believe the IMF should be doing more than this if they are going to hand the Egyptian government $4.8 billion. Egypt's current problems evolve around lack of security and lack of protection for the Coptic Christian minority. This is why their tourism sector has collapsed and the country is in such strife. This is why investors are staying away from Egypt and why Egypt faces such high interest payments on their borrowings. Only a few short weeks ago, on 4 April, we saw an attack on a Coptic Orthodox Church by a gang of rioters. What was most disturbing was that people dressed in Egyptian police uniforms were filmed joining in and aiding and abetting those rioters. If the IMF is going to loan that money to Egypt, it must make it a condition of those loans that the Egyptian government provide full protection and greater security for the Egyptian Coptic Christian minority. International pressure to protect the Coptic Christian minority in Egypt is the only way that the Egyptian economy has a future. That is where the IMF must play a part, and we here in Australia must demand full accountability from the IMF to make sure that when these loans are being handed out to these indebted countries, countries that have got themselves into trouble through their reckless spending and build-up of debt, they take the steps necessary to actually fix their problems, rather than just continue on the way they are going.


The coalition do not oppose this bill, but we say that we here, as the Australian parliament, must assure greater accountability of the spending of these funds.


Debate adjourned.
