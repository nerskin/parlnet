"Tchen, Sen Tsebin",LP,2002-10-17,"— I give notice that, at the giving of notices on the next day of sitting, I shall withdraw business of the Senate notice of motion No. 1 standing in my name for 11 sitting days after today relating to the disallowance of regulations Nos 65.060 and 65.270 in item 1 of schedule 1 of the Civil Aviation Amendment Regulations 2002 (No. 2), as contained in the Statute Rules 2002 No. 167 made under the Civil Aviation Act 1988. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the committee's correspondence concerning these regulations.
Leave granted.
The correspondence read as follows—
Regulations 65.060 and 65.270 in item [1] of Schedule 1 of the Civil Aviation Amendment Regulations 2002 (No.2), Statutory Rules 2002 No. 167
22 August 2002
The Hon John Anderson MP
Minister for Transport and Regional Services
Parliament House
CANBERRA ACT 2600
Dear Minister
I refer to the Civil Aviation Amendment Regulations 2002 (No. 2), Statutory Rules 2002 No. 167 and make two observations about these Regulations. 
Regulation 65.060 prohibits carrying out an unauthorised flight service function. This is a strict liability offence. It is interesting to compare this with regulation 65.045 which prohibits carrying out an unauthorised air traffic control function. There is a defence to a charge under this regulation where the relevant action was reasonable in the interests of safety of aerial navigation. No comparable defence is supplied for regulation 65.060.
Secondly, paragraph 65.270(1)(d) provides that CASA may cancel or suspend a licence (etc) if the holder “appears not to have the characteristics of personality, and other psychological attributes” that are necessary to carry out the duties of an air traffic controller or flight service officer. It is not clear how this paragraph is to be applied. For example, what criteria are to be used in determining a person's personality characteristics? The Committee would appreciate some clarification of this matter. 
In addition, the Committee has received correspondence concerning the regulation of civil aviation in Australia through the adoption of a Manual of Standards that is not subject to parliamentary scrutiny. The Committee notes that these Standards may be amended from time to time and seeks advice on the steps CASA takes to ensure that interested persons are aware of proposed changes and the impact they will have on them.
The Committee would appreciate your advice on these matters as soon as possible, but before 16 September 2002, to enable it to finalise its consideration of this instrument. Correspondence should be directed to the Chairman, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG 49, Parliament House, Canberra.
Yours sincerely
Tsebin Tchen

Dear Senator Tchen
Thank you for your letter of 22 August 2002 concerning Civil Aviation Amendment Regulations 2002 (No. 2) and Statutory rules 2002 No. 167.
Regulation 65.060—Carrying out of flight service function without authority
The omission of a defence to a charge of carrying out an unauthorised flight service function on the grounds the action was reasonable in the interests of the safety of aerial navigation was an oversight. This omission was not detected prior to making of the Regulation.
I agree that such a defence should be included, and undertake to amend Part 65 accordingly at the earliest opportunity.
Paragraph 65.270(1)(d)—Cancellation of licence on grounds of characteristics of personality and other psychological attributes
It is a requirement for the issue of an Air Traffic Controllers (ATC) licence that the applicant for the licence possesses characteristics of personality and other psychological attributes necessary to carry out the duties of an air traffic controller safely and efficiently.
This condition must be satisfied by the holder of the licence and paragraph 65.270(1)(d) provides the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) with a power to cancel, suspend or vary an ATC licence should its holder fail to meet this condition.
Given the broad spectrum of human psychological behaviour, it was decided not to set out an exclusive list of psychological or personality characteristics that would automatically trigger a suspension or cancellation of an air traffic service licence.
Nevertheless, regulation 65.070(2) provides that alcohol or drug abuse are relevant matters which CASA may take into account in the assessment of an application for an ATC licence, and would also therefore be relevant in the determination of cancellation action under regulation 65.270.
There are however, potentially other behaviours and characteristics, which might be of concern in a person with as critical a safety role as an air traffic controller. Examples may include depression or suicidal tendencies, or obsessive, reckless or impulsive behaviours.
On receipt of information of a licence holder exhibiting serious behavioural problems that potentially affects the safe provision of air traffic services by that person, CASA would consider initiating assessment action. Only suitably qualified personnel, such as medical examiners or clinical psychologists, would conduct such assessments.
CASA would not suspend or cancel a licence for psychological or personality reasons unless it has professional advice indicating that suspension or cancellation is necessary for aviation safety. 
Procedures for amending a Manual of Standards
At the outset, I would like to assure the Committee that amendments to a Manual of Standards (MOS) will be subject to a robust consultation process with persons affected by the proposed changes.
The MOS is a CASA policy document that supports a particular regulation. It contains essential technical standards, specifications and requirements of a non-regulatory nature considered necessary for aviation safety.
CASA has established a procedure for amendments to a MOS, which is documented in the Standards Development and Rule Making Manual, Chapter 12, `Legislative Supporting Material (Procedures)', Section 12.4, `Developing/ Amending a MOS' Amendments to a MOS will be referred to the Office of Regulation Review for Regulation Impact Statement determination.
The magnitude and impact of a proposal for change to a MOS will determine the degree of consultation necessary with the various stakeholders. Generally, consultation on MOS changes will be effected using the Notice of Proposed Change (NPC) process, which will be structured in a similar manner to CASA's current Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) process.
All proposed amendments to a MOS will be exposed to the affected parties via the NPC process, with comment on any proposed changes specifically sought from:
·	industry associations/organisations
·	industry/aviation community
·	unions
·	staff
·	other parties likely to be affected by the changes eg. local authorities, governments, communities etc.
Following the consultation period, all comments received will be considered by a joint CASA/industry evaluation group, disposition actions determined and the MOS duly amended.
The amended master version of the MOS will be published on CASA's website and an amendment service initiated, to ensure all holders of a paper MOS are duly informed and supplied with the changes.
In conclusion, I would like to assure the Committee that amendments to a MOS will only take place after interested persons have been made aware of proposed changes and their impacts.
Yours sincerely

John Anderson",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Presentation</title>,Notices,3,1,speech
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-10-17,"—The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 was introduced into parliament on 21 March this year, one week after the government introduced its five antiterrorism bills. These six bills formed the bulk of the government's legislative response to the challenging security environment post 11 September 2001. Now, following the horrific bombings in Bali on 12 October, terrorist violence is no longer just a threat to Australia; it is a reality. The Australian government must act but not overreact. Our response must be strong, measured, proportionate. Australia's defences against terrorism may need to be strengthened. The Prime Minister has announced a wide-ranging national security review. That is appropriate. For the review to be worth while, it must be based on careful assessment of potential threats, not politically charged rhetoric and alarmist headlines. We must resist the temptation to legislate just to be seen to be acting. 
Now, just three days after the Prime Minister's call for an urgent review of domestic security legislation, we are debating a bill that has been before the parliament since March. Bringing the ASIO bill on for debate today would be prudent if it could somehow help our efforts to track down those responsible for the horrific bombings in Bali. Unfortunately, it will not do that. Make no mistake: the ASIO bill is a controversial bill that will radically change many of the accepted principles of law and policing in Australia. Our most important defences against terrorism are comprehensive and effective laws enforced by properly resourced police, security and intelligence services. ASIO is our most important security and intelligence agency, but Labor is deeply concerned that the secret detention regime proposed by this bill would undermine ASIO's status in the community and its ability to effectively gather intelligence. 
In assessing the government security legislation, Labor has been guided by the desire to protect citizens both from terrorist attack and from attacks on their rights. We have always regarded the laws underpinning our national security as being of the utmost importance. We consider the protection of the democratic rights and liberties of Australian citizens to be equally important. These principles cannot be traded off against one another. We must be vigilant in taking measures to protect the community from terrorist threats. We must be equally vigilant in protecting civil liberties and democratic freedoms. In June 2002 parliament passed tough new antiterrorism legislation. New offences were created with appropriate penalties, including a life sentence for preparing and planning a terrorist act. At the Press Club on 11 September this year, the Prime Minister said he believed that parliament had got the balance right with the five antiterrorism bills passed by the parliament in June. The opposition shares the Prime Minister's view, but Labor also stands ready to consider on its merits any further legislation that the government may wish to bring forward. 
I would like to turn to the specifics of the bill. The Attorney-General began his 23 September opinion piece in the Australian newspaper with a rhetorical question: should ASIO be given new powers to gather information that could avert terrorist attacks on Australia? It was no surprise that the Attorney-General answered yes to that question. But another question must be asked: should ASIO be given unprecedented new powers to detain in secret Australians who are not themselves suspected of any wrongdoing? That is a serious question raised in this legislation, and Labor's answer is no. Labor has voted against the ASIO bill in the House of Representatives because, even with the amendments made in the House, it involves radical departures from established legal and human rights principles. Labor will not support laws that attack the same democratic rights and freedoms we are seeking to protect from terrorism.
Under the amended bill, Australians not suspected of any offence could be detained in secret for questioning by ASIO. They may be detained for up to seven days. ASIO has never had powers of coercion and detention before. This is a proposed regime of detention without charge. A person not suspected of any wrongdoing, but detained because they may possess information possibly relating to terrorism, would have fewer rights than a person arrested by the Federal Police on suspicion of murder or treason. Australians detained by ASIO would not have guaranteed access to legal advice for the first 48 hours of detention. Even then, they would have access to government-approved lawyers. They would not be able to confer in private with their lawyer; they would only be able to do so in the presence of an ASIO officer. ASIO would still have the power to detain children aged 14 to 18 years for questioning. Fourteen- to 18-year-olds are recognised as having criminal responsibility under the criminal law, but this bill is not about dealing with criminal suspects; it is about intelligence collection. It provides for detention without charge. This bill goes further than corresponding legislation in other countries facing terrorist threats, like the United States of America, the United Kingdom and Canada.
Labor does share the concerns of many who have spoken out against this bill: that it may establish part of the apparatus of a police state, and that its provisions would not be out of place in a dictatorship. These are real and legitimate concerns, given the assault upon established legal principle contained in this bill. In assessing the government's other antiterrorism legislation, we have been guided, as I have said many times, by the desire to protect Australians from terrorist attacks and to protect the rights and freedoms of Australian citizens. That is why we insisted on strong and principled amendments to the government's earlier antiterrorism legislation. That is why we do not support the extraordinary and unprecedented measures contained in this bill.
Australia's antiterrorism laws may need further strengthening, but this must be based on careful and realistic assessments of potential threats to Australia and the capacity of our police and intelligence services and agencies to meet them. In this regard, the preliminary findings of the US joint congressional intelligence panel's inquiry into the intelligence warnings prior to the September 11 attacks should be noted. It found that the primary failings of American intelligence agencies were not in the area of intelligence collection or in the area of the adequacy of powers, but failures of analysis. US intelligence and security agencies failed to prevent September 11 not because they lacked coercive powers such as those proposed in the ASIO bill but because they failed to appreciate the significance of the intelligence information which was available to them from a wide variety of sources. 
The Labor Party wants ASIO and the Australian Federal Police to hunt down and deal with the terrorists, but only terrorists. We want to protect peaceful, law-abiding Australians from infringement of their rights. Australia's security and intelligence agencies already have strong capabilities to detect and respond to terrorist threats. ASIO already has extensive intelligence collection powers, including use of telecommunications interception, listening devices, covert searches and inspection of postal articles. ASIO also draws upon intelligence collected overseas by ASIS and the Defence Signals Directorate and through intelligence liaison and sharing arrangements by our major allies the United States, the United Kingdom and many other countries. In addition, the ability of the Federal Police to investigate terrorist activities has been broadened with the enactment of new offences relating to terrorist organisations.
Two parliamentary committees found the ASIO bill would be open to serious abuse. Both described it as one of the most controversial pieces of legislation considered by this parliament in recent years. The Joint Statutory Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD made 15 substantive recommendations intended to go towards making this bill more acceptable. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee did not conduct a detailed inquiry into this bill but reserved its right to do so if the government did not accept all of the joint committee's recommendations. The government's amendments to the bill do not adequately address the concerns of these two committees. The amendments fall well short of what the joint committee considered the minimum necessary for the bill to be acceptable. Even more importantly, the government still proposes that people not suspected of any offence may be detained in secret for up to seven days. In contrast, under the Crimes Act a murder suspect can be detained by police for a maximum of only eight hours. They must then be charged or released. The proposed detention of nonsuspects is extraordinary and unacceptable.
The government also proposes that a person detained by ASIO will not be guaranteed access to a lawyer until after 48 hours. Even then, they would be allowed to consult with a government approved lawyer only while ASIO is listening. We have to ask ourselves: if the United States, which is the main target of terrorists, can allow citizens who are detained to have access to lawyers, why is it proposed to deny Australians this fundamental right? The detention in secret of persons not suspected of any offence is quite alien to our system of justice. Some consider it as being unconstitutional.
Labor will move to refer the ASIO bill to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee to examine alternative ways of enhancing the capacity of our law-enforcement agencies to counter terrorism without compromising civil liberties. The earlier review by the Senate committee reserved the right to examine the bill in detail if the government did not adopt all of the joint committee's recommendations. The government has not done so and I think it is appropriate now for the Senate committee to revisit the matter and explore the alternatives. There has been a claim, and a very unfair one, from the Attorney-General that Labor is toying with this legislation at the expense of national security. We have never done that and we never would. We are not toying with it. Labor's preparedness to deal very seriously with national security legislation was demonstrated for all to see inside this parliament and outside it by our handling of the antiterrorism bills passed by parliament before the winter recess. Our approach was constructive and it was principled. Labor stands ready at all times to consider proposals—any sensible proposals at all—that will help protect Australians and uphold the values that we all hold dear. This bill does not achieve that. I am therefore moving on behalf of the opposition the second reading amendment which has been circulated in my name: 
At the end of the motion, add:
“But the Senate:
(a)	notes with concern that:
(i)	the Government's response to the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD is inadequate;
(ii)	the Government proposes that, for the first time, Australians not suspected of any offence could be detained by ASIO for questioning;
(iii)	the Government proposes those detained by ASIO do not have the right to legal advice for the first 48 hours of their detention;
(iv)	the Government proposes children can be detained by ASIO for questioning; and
(v)	the Government's proposals will significantly change the role of ASIO by giving it powers of coercion and detention, and
(b)	therefore refers the ASIO Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002, together with the following matters, to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee for inquiry and report by 3 December 2002:
(i)	the development of an alternative regime in which questioning to obtain intelligence relating to terrorism is conducted not by ASIO but by the AFP, including appropriate arrangements for detention of terrorist suspects, and questioning of persons not suspected of any offence;
(ii)	the relationship between ASIO and the AFP in the investigation of terrorist activities or offences;
(iii)	the adequacy of Australia's current information and intelligence gathering methods to investigate potential terrorist activities or offences; 
(iv)	recent overseas legislation dealing with the investigation of potential terrorist activities or offences; and
(v)	whether the Bill in its current or amended form is constitutionally sound”.
I commend the opposition's approach to the Senate. ",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2002-10-17,"—I rise today to speak about the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002, which of course we all know was originally proposed as part of the government's legislative response to the tragic events of September 11 last year. The events of this week have of course brought these issues again to the fore.
Can I say at the outset that any response to terrorism must be very carefully thought out. Terrorist attacks over the past year, and particularly over the past week, have been grave and they have changed the world's political landscape quite significantly. Australians have not faced a threat like this before; therefore our responses to this threat must be proportionate to its gravity. They certainly must not be ad hoc and they must not be politically motivated. They must consider what it is they are protecting and find the best way to protect it—not the first way that comes to mind, certainly not the most dramatic way or the most publicity effective way but the best way.
At the outset, the question we must ask is: what is it that our antiterrorism legislation is trying to protect? It is to protect Australian citizens from threats to their lives and their freedom. It is intended to enable Australians to live without being fearful of events that they cannot control and it is to make sure that Australia has the legal provisions for taking part in international efforts to stop terrorism.
The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 is not the best way to achieve any of these protections because it has the capacity to become as great a threat to our democracy as that of terrorism. It goes against the vital principles of the rule of law that keep us safe. People have been saying this since World War II, and even before. Prime Minister Menzies said in 1939:
The greatest tragedy that could overcome a country would be for it to fight a successful war in defence of liberty only to lose its own liberty in the process. 
It is to be expected in a time of crisis in national security that some rights be derogated. But any derogation of citizens' rights must, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, use precise criteria, not confer unfettered discretion on those charged with their execution, be necessary for public safety or order, conform to the principle of proportionality, and be appropriate to achieve protective function and be the least intrusive instrument amongst those which might achieve that protective function.
The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002, as it stands, fails on all these counts. Its criteria are anything but precise and could allow for gross abuses of power. The discretion that is conferred upon ASIO and its prescribed authorities could be described as unfettered, particularly considering the fact that this power is in the arm of the executive and not the judiciary. Prescribed authorities have the power to issue warrants and must be members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. These are non-judicial appointments with fixed terms, and reappointment is determined by the government. In other words, these are political appointments who should not have the power to issue warrants to detain people in secret.
Under the current provisions of the ASIO bill, a person can be detained without having committed an offence. Detention of nonsuspects is unprecedented in Australia and is not permitted under equivalent legislation in the USA, Britain or Canada. This also amounts to arbitrary action by the executive arm of government. Regardless of how much trust we might have in the current government, there must be protection against future possible abuses of power. It is lunacy to set down the provisions that would enable Australia to effectively become a police state—a state like those that we condemn—simply trusting that it would never happen to us.
The fact that detention can be incommunicado and that a person can be denied access to a lawyer for up to 48 hours is also a serious concern. Proposed section 34F(8) states:
A person who has been taken into custody, or detained, under this Division is not permitted to contact, and may be prevented from contacting, anyone at any time while in custody or detention.
Incommunicado detention has been widely condemned as a serious human rights violation that often leads to other abuses. Among the recommendations of the parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD that were not taken up by the government was that the bill be amended to provide for legal representation for people, with a framework for the appointment of security-cleared lawyers. The government proposed an alternative model whereby a person must be provided access to a security-cleared lawyer after 48 hours of detention. This 48-hour period without a lawyer is simply unacceptable, as is the situation of a person being unable to consult with their lawyer, even if he or she is security cleared, without the presence of an ASIO officer. A fundamental principle under international standards requires governments to ensure that all those arrested, detained or imprisoned have the right to communicate with a lawyer in full confidentiality. This 48-hour period without access to a lawyer is an unnecessary provision. There are ways of providing legal representation without compromising an investigation: for example, having a list of independent court appointed lawyers or a list of security-cleared lawyers who can be given immediate access to a detained person. The presence of a neutral third party such as a lawyer places real constraints on the ability of the authorities to treat detainees in any way they want. It is an important safeguard, without which this bill should not be passed.
Proposed section 34 creates offences to do with failing to give information and failing to produce a record or thing as requested by an ASIO officer. The penalty is five years imprisonment. There is a safeguard of sorts in clauses that state that the offences do not apply if the person does not have the information, record or thing. However, the evidential burden is explicitly placed on the defendant. In other words, the onus of proof is reversed. It is up to the accused to prove that they are not guilty of withholding information, which is absolutely contrary to current standards of law in Australia. Linked to this is the right to silence, which is denied to those detained under this legislation. This is vital to the important concept that the prosecution must prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt. 
The committee recommended—and sensibly—that this legislation is not to apply to children under the age of 18. The government has proposed that it will not apply to children under 14 and that children from 14 to 18 years of age can be detained only if they are under suspicion and have a lawyer and a parent or guardian present. This takes no account of the usual distinction under the law in relation to detaining children. Considering the breadth and the extraordinary nature of the new powers proposed to be given under this legislation, the committee also recommended that protocols be developed to govern custody, detention and the interview process and that the act not commence until the protocols are developed and in place. The government has said that the exercise of powers under the act will be delayed until the protocols are in place but that the commencement of the bill will not be delayed. These protocols are vital to ensure that there are standards against which ASIO officers can be measured.
This bill proposes to grant ASIO powers that usually reside in the police force. If ASIO is to be granted police powers, it should be subject to the political and community scrutiny and controls that would apply to any other police force. This would be somewhat difficult in relation to ASIO, considering its primary role as an intelligence-gathering organisation. Community scrutiny and controls would have a worrying impact on the whole secrecy issue. In order to ensure that this legislation is proportionate and appropriate to the threat that we face, there should be, as recommended by the committee, a three-year sunset clause. Without such a clause this bill will not specifically target the current terrorist threat. As George Williams has argued, it will bring about a permanent change to law enforcement in Australia and will entrench the notion that the detention of people who may have useful information is an appropriate tool for the gathering of information about criminal activity. The ASIO bill is not about detaining terrorists; it is about detaining Australians who might have information about terrorist activities. Detention is not the only way to obtain this information and I do not think it is the best way. The United Kingdom's Terrorism Act 2000, for example, imposes on citizens a positive obligation to disclose information which he or she knows or believes might be of material assistance regarding an investigation into terrorist actions.
This legislation would effectively create a shadow legal system, with none of the legal safeguards of our existing one. It looks like an attempt to allow detention that would otherwise be illegal in Australia and to remove the legal remedies that would usually be open to a person detained in this way. We might ask ourselves: to what extent are these provisions necessary to protect Australians from terrorism? Are there sufficient safeguards? Is this the best way? Any response to the threat of terrorism should have human rights as its unifying objective. This debate has polarised security and human rights, which is completely inaccurate. Human rights standards constitute the bare minimum of standards necessary to protect the safety and integrity of individuals from abuses of power. Human rights standards are not simple legal niceties. Security and human rights do not have to be inconsistent. Freedom should be built into our concept of national security. True security should be based on respect for human rights. We should not join terrorists in treating them as dispensable. This is the test of how well we are responding to the threat of terrorism. The real challenge is to create effective legislation that protects our citizens from abuses of their rights. The ASIO bill, as it stands, fails this test.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2002-10-17,"—I rise to speak on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002. Before I set out the arguments that I wish to advance, it is worth noting that, to date, there has been An Advisory Report on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. That committee report provided, at least for the Senate, a good overview of the legislation and the issues that surround the legislation that is being proposed. In the report's second paragraph it says: 
The Bill is one of the most controversial pieces of legislation considered by the Parliament in recent times. The Bill, in its original form, will provide for a person to be detained for up to 48 hours incommunicado, without legal representation and the right to silence removed. If further warrants were issued, a person could be detained indefinitely.
I will talk about the recommendations shortly, but it is worth pausing to consider the implications of this bill and what that paragraph provides. Removing rights that have accrued to people over a long period of time is something that this parliament should not do quickly, lightly or without serious consideration. This matter should not pass through this house without serious comment and proper debate. To assist in understanding, it might be worth while to set out the purpose of the bill, which was `to enhance the Commonwealth's ability to combat terrorism', firstly, by amending the definition of `politically motivated violence' in the ASIO Act 1979 to include terrorism offences and, secondly, by giving ASIO special powers. The idea was to extend ASIO's capacity to obtain intelligence in relation to terrorist organisations which may operate in Australia and could conceivably do horrendous harm. Those are the principles underpinning the legislation. They are perfectly legitimate and good principles that should be pursued and would ordinarily be accepted and agreed to by me and by the Senate. What has occurred with this ASIO bill, though, is that those premises have been dissected and changed so that the thrust of the legislation has changed to include principles that are not really found in the heading. To put the bill in context, when the issue was first mooted ASIO had identified no present threat in Australia. It is also worth considering that ASIO already has extensive powers to investigate terrorism activities.
Going back to the process that brought us here today, on 21 March 2002 the ASIO bill was referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD, as I have already highlighted, and to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, which I will speak about further this morning. The reference to the legal and constitutional committee was to look at the ASIO bill after the parliamentary joint committee had tabled its report, and that is what the legal and constitutional committee considered it would do. As a member of that committee, I recall those circumstances if perhaps not all of the dates that go with them. At that time, during the early part of this year, the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee was considering in the order of 10 other pieces of legislation, principally those dealing with security issues— `terrorism bills', as they are perhaps now colloquially called.
The Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee considered that it would allow the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD to consider the issue of the new ASIO bill first, as is proper and appropriate. The first, practical, reason for this was the amount of work that was already confronting the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. The second reason was that the joint committee was the appropriate place for that bill to go first for proper scrutiny and consideration. I thought the issue could be revisited at a later time, pending the outcome of the joint committee's examination of the ASIO bill. The Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee would not ordinarily rework or go over the contents of another committee's report. That would be considered by many to be an unnecessary exercise that might generally pose a difficulty for some people. For example, it could cover territory that had already been covered, which would be a waste of calling witnesses and an expense and might also give rise to issues relating to changing circumstances or different reflections by witness to the particular committees. Therefore, it is usually sensible to have one committee examine and report. But in this instance a number of matters arose, some more practical and process orientated and some more legal or constitutionally based in relation to the overall issues, so there was some tension about whether or not the bill should be examined jointly. At the end of the day the committee made what I think was the best decision at the time, given the work pressures: that the parliamentary joint committee would examine the report. 
The Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD tabled its bipartisan report in June 2002. It made substantive recommendations designed to improve the operation of the bill, provide a better functioning bill and ensure that a balance was found between people's liberty and security. Those recommendations included:
The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 be amended to include a provision giving the Attorney-General the power, by way of regulation, to nominate an authority that can issue a warrant under the Bill.
On the issue of the period of detention, it provided recommendation 3:
The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 be amended so that the maximum period of detention of a person is no more than 7 days (168 hours), and at the expiry of that period a person must be either charged or released.
The thrust of those amendments was, firstly, to make improvements to the ASIO bill in terms of its procedures, its operation and its effect on the community at large and, secondly, to try to resolve some of the more difficult elements of the bill to ensure that people's liberty was balanced against the security of this nation. There were 15 recommendations. As I understand it, the government's response to that could only be described as extraordinarily poor. As I have said, it was one of the most controversial pieces of legislation considered by this parliament in recent times, and one would have expected the government to deal with the report in a more adequate way than it did.
It seems to me that there are sound reasons for recommending that this bill go to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. Those sound reasons are also supported by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee's consideration of the legislation. Although the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 is the bill's proper title, which is a mouthful, I have been describing it, using shorthand, as the `ASIO bill'. The report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, at paragraph 1.38, said:
In the event that the Government accepts all the PJC's recommendations, the Committee recommends that the Bill, as amended, proceed without further review by this Committee. In the event that the recommendations are not adopted, the Committee reserves the right to revisit its consideration of this Bill.
It was clear—and, I think, instructive—that the conclusion of the report was, in effect, that this legislation requires further and better consideration if the government is not to provide an adequate and fulsome response to the parliamentary joint committee's recommendations and report; it leaves a hole that needs to be filled, an area which requires consideration.
These concerns are not insignificant. It is instructive to go to a number of the submissions that were provided both to the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee and to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. A number of people made, or wished to make, submissions to the Legal and Constitution Legislation Committee about the ASIO bill and, as was proper, we referred them to the parliamentary joint committee for further consideration. It was not a matter that we would then take evidence on and consider. One of those submissions argued that the bill falls into three areas: the process by which special warrants are sought and issued, the execution of the special warrants and offences with respect to those special warrants. Touching on some of those provisions is important to highlight the argument that I have put forward: that the second reading amendment is the best way to proceed with this bill. It is supported by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee report, the parliamentary joint committee's report and—really, by omission—the government's failure to respond fully to the parliamentary joint committee's report.
Touching on some of the issues, the main provisions of the bill—which were highlighted by Senator Kirk earlier but are worthy of touching on again to reinforce the argument that I have put this morning—include item 24, which inserts new division 3, which goes to questioning and the detention power. The way this would work is that the Director-General of Security would be able to seek a warrant from a federal magistrate or a legal member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal that would require a person to appear before a prescribed authority to provide information or to produce documents or things. These reforms would allow ASIO, before a prescribed authority, to question people who were not themselves suspected of terrorist activity but who might have information that might be relevant to ASIO's investigation into politically motivated violence. 
In Australia there are few examples of this mandatory duty to inform—that is, the power to compel disclosure. This generally occurs in response to subpoenas or summonses as part of court processes. So we find that in royal commissions, in powers exercised by ASIC—the Australian Securities and Investments Commission—or in something like the New South Wales ICAC. The duty to provide information may also arise in response to a request or a production notice as a statutory incidence of an executive power, like—and I am not sure all have experienced this—the Taxation Office or Customs may provide. Ordinarily, though, there are various ways to avoid an executive duty to provide information, and these might go to issues such as the relevance of the request or might involve use of the defence of reasonable excuse or self-incrimination. It usually comes with the right to legal representation in a court. What I have set out are really the ordinary processes—although sometimes they are not that ordinary—that would occur.
This bill seeks to introduce an unusual combination of powers in order to address the threat, or potential threat, of international terrorism in Australia. As the bill stands, it essentially gives the law enforcement function of questioning to an intelligence agency—ASIO—and gives the criminal justice function of detention to nonjudicial persons. It removes or permits the suspension of standard procedural guarantees as to the rights of an accused—privileges against self-incrimination, the right to legal representation. As I understand it, immunities are also dabbled with in this bill. These powers overlap with the ordinary criminal justice system. The bill creates, in effect, a system parallel—one with no safeguards in the bill that are visible to me—to the criminal justice system, which is a system that does have safeguards, a system that people are more familiar with and a system that provides a balance between security and the civil liberties of people.
In relation to the compulsion to answer questions, protection in the form of use or derivative use immunity, as I have said, seems to be lacking. In this bill there is a lack of balance between safety and liberty. That is principally where Labor differ with the government. There is a need for the Legal and Constitutional References Committee to examine that balance, to take the reference in the second reading amendment that Senator Faulkner has moved, to examine and hear submissions and to re-examine the ASIO bill in the broader context of both the legal implications and the constitutional issues that I have raised.
In my view, there is an absence of security in the bill. It may be possible to argue that preventive detention is inconsistent with the separation of powers. It would seem logical that if the federal parliament is to have the authority to make laws for administrative detention—and, indeed, preventive detention—it may be necessary to have some protections. Constitutional implications of the ASIO bill have been raised continually by Professor Williams and others, and these also require considered examination. It is not about trying to argue that there are needs to be addressed in the security legislation; it is about examining it to ensure that we have sound, good security legislation that is considered and well thought through.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2002-10-17,"—I rise to speak today on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002. This bill has been described as one of the most controversial pieces of legislation considered by this parliament in recent times. In my first speech in this place, I spoke of my commitment to the protection of civil liberties of Australian citizens against government legislation that seeks to unduly or unnecessarily infringe those fundamental freedoms. 
In this past week, Australians have suffered one of the most tragic and devastating events in our nation's history. Of course, I refer to the bombing of the Sari Club on the Indonesian island of Bali. This tragic event followed just a short time after we remembered the first anniversary of the tragic loss of life in the United States on 11 September 2001. Since the events of September 11, Australia's antiterrorism laws have undergone a much needed update. Before September 11, there were no Commonwealth laws dealing specifically with terrorism; such laws existed only in the Northern Territory. Labor recognised that antiterrorist measures needed to be strengthened. Accordingly, Labor worked with the government to enact appropriate laws. Parliament has now enacted the first round of antiterrorism legislation, following significant amendment by Labor to remove the more draconian provisions of these laws. It cannot be questioned that Australia needs a national legislative response to address terrorist activity. However, new measures must strike an appropriate balance between, on the one hand, national defence and security and, on the other hand, civil liberties and human rights. As Professor George Williams has said, we must not pass laws that undermine the same democratic freedoms we are seeking to protect from terrorism.
The legislation before the chamber today is, as I said, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002, the ASIO bill. In examining this law, it is necessary to ask the fundamental question I posed above—that is, does this law achieve an appropriate balance between national defence and security and civil liberties and human rights? In making this assessment, it should be borne in mind that the protection of national security is not of itself an end. Any diminution of the rule of law or human rights effected by national security legislation must be proportionate to the actual or perceived threat. Professor Williams said:
The case for derogating accepted rights and key elements of our democracy must be fully justified and carefully scrutinised.
Academics and others who have made this assessment of the ASIO bill before us today have concluded that it does not strike an appropriate balance between protection of national security and civil liberties. It is for this reason that Senator Faulkner, on behalf of the opposition, has indicated that the opposition will be supporting the referral of this bill to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee for further examination.
The bill in its current form would authorise the detention of Australians, including children, without charges being laid against them. Australian citizens could be detained by ASIO not because they have engaged in acts of terrorism or are likely to do so but because they may substantially assist the collection of intelligence that is important in relation to a terrorism offence. The bill in its original form would provide that such people could be held without access to legal advice and without the normal right to silence and the right to avoid self-incrimination. A five-year jail term applies for refusing to answer a question, and information may be used in the prosecution of a terrorism offence.
As many other speakers have mentioned, this bill has been referred to two committees of this parliament which have undertaken reports into this bill. There was one report by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD and a second inquiry by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. As other speakers have said, both committees found that in its current form the bill would be open to serious abuse as a consequence of the significant increase in unchecked executive power that this bill will confer.
The joint parliamentary committee found unanimously that the bill would undermine key legal rights and erode the civil liberties that make Australia a leading democracy. Despite this sweeping condemnation of the bill, the committee made only 15 recommendations for amendment to the bill and these were limited to its operational aspects. The committee proposed a number of important amendments, including a seven-day limit on detention, a requirement for representation by security-cleared lawyers of individuals held in detention, and protocols governing detention and interview which will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. Further, it proposed that there be protection against self-incrimination, that anyone under 18 years of age be excluded from interrogation and detention, that there be accountability and reporting measures in relation to warrants issued and, finally, that a three-year sunset clause be inserted. 
The report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee focused on whether the executive can authorise the detention for questioning of someone not suspected of any offence and whether the issuing of such warrants by magistrates is an exercise of judicial or executive power. The Senate committee recommended that the bill not proceed if the government refuses to accept the recommendations of the joint committee to which I referred. Unfortunately the government has indicated that it supports only 10 of the committee's 15 recommendations. Time does not permit me to address all of the joint committee recommendations that were accepted by the government, but I will mention a few of them.
Recommendation 1, which was accepted, aimed to ensure that only federal magistrates issue all warrants and federal judges issue all warrants where detention will exceed 96 hours. The original bill authorised members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to issue warrants. To have permitted members of the AAT to issue warrants would have established a dangerous precedent because such individuals are now appointed for fixed and limited terms and lack the entrenched independence and tenure of judicial officers. Whilst the government has accepted that members of the AAT are not appropriate officers to issue warrants, federal magistrates and judges remain permitted to do so. It has been suggested that this may amount to an unconstitutional conferral of non-judicial powers on a chapter III judicial officer. In the case of Grollo v. Palmer the High Court held that non-judicial powers, such as granting a warrant, can be conferred on a federal judge in his or her personal capacity, but only where the function so conferred is not incompatible either with the judge's performance of his or her judicial functions or with the proper discharge by the judiciary of its responsibilities as an institution exercising judicial power. There are strong arguments that have been made that it is quite probable there would be a successful High Court challenge should this bill be enacted in its current form. The reason for this is arguably that the conferral of such non-judicial powers as the issue of warrants on chapter III officers could well be regarded as incompatible with their exercise of judicial power.
Other joint committee recommendations that the government has accepted are as follows. Recommendation 2 suggests that a provision be included giving the Attorney-General the power, by way of regulation, to nominate an authority that can issue a warrant under the bill. Recommendation 3, which was accepted, is that the maximum period of detention be limited to seven days, after which a person must be released. Recommendation 4 proposes a requirement that the Director-General of ASIO must seek the consent of the Attorney-General before requesting further warrants on a suspect. Recommendation 5 aims to ensure that people are immediately brought before a prescribed authority.
Recommendation 8 is that people be given protection against self-incrimination for the provision of information relating to a terrorism offence. Recommendation 9 suggests the introduction of penalty clauses that will apply to officials who do not comply with the provisions of the bill. Recommendation 11 requires disclosure by ASIO in its declassified reports of the total number of warrants issued under the bill. Recommendation 13 advises that the Director-General of ASIO should notify the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security every time he seeks the minister's consent to a warrant. And, finally, recommendation 15 suggests a requirement that people must be advised that they have the right to seek judicial review of their detention after 24 hours. 
While the measures I have referred to do improve the bill, the government, unfortunately, rejected five of the most important recommendations of the joint committee. I refer firstly to recommendation 6, which is in relation to lawyers. The joint committee recommended that the bill be amended to provide for legal representation for people who are the subject of warrants within a framework for the appointment of security-cleared lawyers. The government has proposed an alternative model whereby a person must be provided with access to a security-cleared lawyer after 48 hours detention. This inevitably raises the question of what is to happen to people who are held during those first 48 hours. The government further proposes that once a person has access to a lawyer they cannot consult privately with that lawyer. Labor believes that the critical first 48-hour period without a lawyer is unacceptable. Even when a person does have access to a lawyer, it is not possible for them to consult privately with them without ASIO representatives being present. This is unacceptable.
Recommendation 7 is about protocols in relation to the custody, detention and interview process. These protocols must be developed before the legislation can proceed. Recommendation 10, in relation to children, is another important recommendation of the committee. The government has proposed that children under the age of 14 not be detained or questioned and that children aged between 14 and 18 only be detained if they are under suspicion and have a lawyer, a parent or a guardian present. The government argues that the age of 14 is appropriate because it corresponds to the age of full criminal responsibility. Labor believes it is inappropriate that government propose the same time periods for detaining children as for adults. In relation to these provisions, Dr Jenny Hocking of Monash University said:
It is extraordinary that a democratic nation adhering to notions of the rule of law can even contemplate the passage of legislation which would permit children to be taken and held incommunicado without their parents' knowledge, let alone consent. That children can be held without suspicion of their involvement in any offence, without legal representation, strip searched and questioned is an appalling proposal and one which has no place in a humane and just society.
Labor considers it abhorrent that children be treated like terrorists. These provisions contravene up to six articles of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. It is wrong to subject children to such laws. Labor wants children excluded from detention under this bill, just as we wish to see all children released from migration detention centres in this country.
Recommendation 12 proposed that a sunset clause be inserted so as to terminate the legislation after three years. The government has opposed this recommendation. Labor agrees with the joint committee, however, that a sunset clause is necessary because it would represent a significant accountability mechanism. It will ensure that there is continued public debate about these provisions and their necessity in future circumstances. As Professor Williams said:
Without such a clause this Bill cannot be seen as a short term immediate response to September 11. It will bring about a permanent change to law-enforcement in Australia and it will entrench the notion that the detention of people who may have useful information is an appropriate tool for the gathering of information about criminal activity.
Labor has two further concerns about the bill. Firstly, we are concerned that it allows for Australian citizens who are not suspected of any criminal activity to be detained. This is a fundamental and unacceptable departure from established legal and human rights principles in this country. These measures go further than equivalent laws in the United States and the United Kingdom—for example, while United States law permits the detention of aliens without charge, it does not allow the detention of its own citizens. Professor Williams has said that this bill would establish the apparatus of a police state and that it would not be out of place in some former dictatorships. If the bill is enacted in its current form, Australians not suspected of any offence could be detained by ASIO for questioning.
Secondly, Labor is concerned that the bill allows people to be questioned by ASIO rather than by a law enforcement agency. ASIO has never had such powers before, nor should it. ASIO already has extensive powers to investigate terrorist activities, including the use of telecommunications interceptions, listening devices and the like. Most fundamentally, the bill does not achieve an appropriate balance between the protection of national security and fundamental civil liberties. The Australian people will not and should not accept the infringements on civil liberties that this bill will effect. As Senator Faulkner said, Labor supports the referral of this bill to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee, of which I am a member. The committee must be given the opportunity to examine alternative ways of enhancing the capacity of our law enforcement agencies to counter terrorism without compromising civil liberties. The government has had more than 12 months to develop laws that will provide appropriate measures to combat terrorism without compromising civil liberties. 
This bill was introduced into the parliament in March. It was debated in the House of Representatives last month. Today the government has brought this bill before the Senate, just five days after the Bali tragedy. This bill has the appearance of a hasty overreaction to the tragedies of September 11 and Bali rather than an appropriate response to the issues facing Australia. We in this chamber and indeed the Australian people have the right to ask how this bill will assist in dealing with the threat of terrorism facing our nation. It is likely that the answer is that the bill may not be particularly helpful.
The bill would confer unprecedented new powers on ASIO that could be used against the Australian people by an unscrupulous government. The powers in this bill may not be used against the Australian people today, tomorrow or even in the next decade, but we cannot speculate about the wisdom and motives of a government or of ASIO in the next decade or beyond. This bill would unduly infringe the civil liberties and fundamental rights of all Australians, and this is why the bill must be referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee for further scrutiny.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,2002-10-17,"—I think it is important in discussing the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 today that we do deal with the issue of timing. It is worth noting for the record that this bill, while it was due to come up in this session, was not scheduled for debate until at least next week. It is fair to ask why it is that all of the legislation proposed for this morning was at the eleventh hour last night removed and replaced with this legislation. While I accept the government's right to schedule its agenda as it chooses, I do think we need to question this. I think it is reasonable to conclude that the government is keen to be seen to be doing something about terrorism in the wake of the appalling tragedy that we have all experienced and witnessed over the last few days, but there is a danger in that. There is a danger in responding to tragic events in a knee-jerk way; there is a danger in exploiting understandable fear, shock and anger by perhaps trying to coerce a parliament in progressing legislation that it might not consider in more peaceful times.
Certainly this event in Bali was appalling and tragic and it does appear that it was an act of terrorism, but it is quite wrong, I think, to exploit the shock, grief and fear that people are feeling. In dealing with legislation of this nature we need cool heads and clear thinking and to address the issues at a time when people are not so focused on understandable anger and concern, not just about terrorism but about instability in the region. For that reason we Democrats will be supporting the Labor proposal that this bill go to committee—and I will talk a little bit more about that later.
The timing of the bill is more symbolic than practical. The sad reality is that the passage of this legislation, if that had eventuated, would have made no difference to the events in Bali. I think it is fair to ask whether any law or laws can stop terrorism, let alone domestic laws that would have no jurisdiction in Indonesia. We must also question why there is a perceived need for it at this time when there is uncertainty around our surveillance powers and surveillance operations—whether that be through questions raised about the SIEVX refugee boat incident, the so-called `children overboard' matter, or more recent questions raised in the last few days about intelligence surrounding prewarnings of the Bali tragedy. 
Following the September 11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, many countries around the world reacted very swiftly with laws—or at least the promise of them—to address terrorism, and they included the United States, Britain and of course Australia. In our jurisdiction we witnessed that through the introduction of a suite of five antiterrorism bills, all of which caused considerable community concern and outcry, largely around the principle of civil liberties and the rights and freedoms that we enjoy. There was a very real and anxious concern overwhelmingly expressed by the organisations and individuals which came before the Senate committee hearing investigating that suite of bills about hastily introducing laws we might regret in the future.
At the end of the day I think it is worth complimenting the government for ultimately accepting significant amendments to that legislation, some of which we Democrats supported. Ultimately we opposed four of those five bills on the grounds that we had deep concerns about the definitions of terrorism and terrorists and the way in which that legislation might be used in the future if it were not more finely tuned. It is worth noting that one of those bills from that suite of five which we did support was in fact a bill entitled `Suppression of Terrorist Bombings'. It is clear that people who came before the committee felt anxious about any loss of civil liberties and that any extraordinary government power which might have been introduced through that legislation could be abused or misused to the detriment of the community.
We were not convinced that the definitions and powers that ultimately were proclaimed—and it is worth noting that the legislation we are talking about only came into effect very recently—were appropriate and adequately allowed for the natural justice which we felt ought to have applied, yet now we find that the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, has said, only in the last 48 hours, that we need to review our domestic antiterrorism laws. I find that quite extraordinary given that they have only very recently been cemented into our legislative framework. I think that was a knee-jerk response to the tragedy of the Bali bombings. It was only two days ago—I think it was Monday—that Senator Faulkner, on behalf of the opposition, asked a question of Senator Vanstone, who was that day representing the Attorney-General, as to what form this review would take: who might be involved, how it might be conducted and what degree of public input would be invited and allowed for. Minister Vanstone, representing the Attorney, was unable to answer that. To be fair, she was just acting in an interim position, given the absence that day of Senator Ellison in Indonesia. But that suggested perhaps that the government, at least as of Monday, had not really given consideration as to exactly how the review would be constructed and conducted.
How can we possibly review legislation that was only very recently proclaimed into law? What possible connection could there be between the slaughter in Indonesia and Australian domestic security measures? We Democrats can support a review but not if that is simply code for reintroducing or attempting to reintroduce some of the more draconian aspects of that suite of antiterrorism bills that were removed in the first instance. I think the Prime Minister has used the words `review the legislation with a view to beefing them up'. If `beefing them up' is code for attempting to reintroduce those aspects which were originally rejected by the Australian community and the parliament, we would have no part of that.
Yet we have a bill before us today which would allow federal authorities to remove someone from the street or their home simply because they think they might be able to provide useful information and not because they are suspected of having committed an offence. In relation to this, Professor George Williams from the University of New South Wales—and it is worth noting that he is one of the nation's better known constitutional academics—has said, `This bill is inconsistent with basic democratic and judicial principles, because no Australian should be detained without a trial or for a bail hearing.' In fact, Professor Williams, who is not noted for his exaggeration, likens the bill to something out of Chile under the regime of Pinochet. 
While that might seem dramatic, it was my experience only yesterday, when discussing this issue on talkback radio in New South Wales, that the radio presenter said to me that this would not happen, that the Australian government would not introduce legislation to allow for the detention of people for up to seven days and that it would not introduce legislation that would ensure that those people would have no right to a lawyer for at least 48 hours. It was all I could do to convince him that that was precisely what the government was doing; yet I was significantly challenged on that point. There seems to be a sense of disbelief, at least in some quarters in the Australian community, that this is the path that the government is travelling on.
In his brief, the Attorney has argued that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 would enhance ASIO's ability to gather intelligence to help prevent and deter terrorism. The Attorney has said that the bill establishes a warrant process to allow ASIO to question a person who may have information relating to a terrorist attack. The bill was introduced into the House of Representatives on 21 March this year and was referred to both the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, Australian Secret Intelligence Service and Defence Signals Directorate. The parliamentary joint committee then reported on 5 June 2002 and the Senate committee reported on 18 June 2002.
The parliamentary joint committee made a number of recommendations for changes to the bill, with which the Senate committee agreed. Worth noting, too, is that the joint committee is a bipartisan committee in the true sense of the word. It has representatives from only the coalition and Labor; there is no crossbench representation on it. Yet, in spite of the fact that government members strongly advocated significant reform, which is sometimes unusual from a committee perspective, the government has agreed to those recommendations, indicating at the time that it understood that compromise was essential, given the community anxiety around the suite of bills which preceded the introduction of the ASIO legislation. The government amendments to the bill responding to the recommendations of the committees were passed by the House of Representatives, and a separate document outlining the government amendments has been provided by the Attorney.
The Attorney has also notified the parliament that in terms of access to legal representation—an issue with which the Democrats have significant concern—all people detained under a warrant will have the right to contact an approved lawyer; that is, a legal practitioner of at least five years standing who has been approved by the Attorney-General following a security clearance. There was considerable concern during community debate and investigation into this issue, and people overwhelmingly believed that anyone detained under this legislation really ought to have the right to legal representation. It seems that a pool of lawyers would be provided to a person detained from which they could choose. The Democrats had some considerable concern around the notion that that may remove accountability and perhaps objectivity. It is a bit like Centrelink or some other government agency providing their own doctor or medical expert to assess a person's eligibility for welfare payments. There can sometimes be a perceived lack of objectivity in those situations. I understand that the Law Council of Australia has expressed enthusiasm on its part for being a part of the process and contributing to the process of vetting and suggesting which lawyers might be appropriate in those situations. On the face of it, that would seem reasonable.
The Attorney has also said that contact between legal representation and those detained may be delayed for up to 48 hours in exceptional circumstances and only in relation to adults. To delay access to a legal practitioner, the Attorney-General must be satisfied that it is likely that a terrorism offence is being or is about to be committed and may have serious consequences. The power to delay access to a lawyer can therefore only be exercised to protect the community from imminent terrorist danger. Then, after 48 hours, all people will have the absolute right to contact an approved lawyer. Lawyers will be subject to special rules during the period their client is subject to a warrant. This is necessary, it is argued, to ensure that the very sensitive information that they would be exposed to is appropriately protected. 
The issue of children was a difficult and sensitive one in relation to community concerns around this bill also. It is worth noting that the bill does not apply to people under the age of 14, although as I understand it that was not originally the case. If the prescribed authority considers that the person brought before it is under 14, it must order that the person be released. We would welcome that. The Attorney-General has argued that there are legitimate reasons for the bill to apply to people between the ages of 14 and 18. I for one would like to be convinced of that before giving consideration to supporting that notion. I do have some problems with the notion of 15-, 16- and 17-year-olds being detained under these circumstances. The Attorney-General has argued that, for example, there are known instances of persons under the age of 18 being actively involved in terrorist activity, including suicide bombings. I understand there is evidence to suggest that that is the case overseas. I am not aware of any suggestions that that is the case domestically. However, the government has recognised the importance of protecting the rights of young people to some degree, and a warrant will only be able to be issued in relation to persons between 14 and 18 years of age in limited cases, and these will be subject to strict safeguards. 
In terms of those safeguards, the Attorney-General has argued that the bill would ensure that the powers are properly exercised. We Democrats would argue that that statement does not stand up to scrutiny on one basic premise, and that is that no safeguard, no objectivity and no accountability can be ensured if a person or persons are being detained for 48 hours with absolutely no access to legal representation and without their family, friends or employer knowing where they are. This is not an aspect of the legislation that we could support. However, we do agree that the proposal by the Labor Party for further committee and community investigation is warranted and welcome. Labor is proposing that the committee to investigate the legislation and report by 3 December should be the Senate's Legal and Constitutional References Committee. I welcome that, being a member of that committee and contributing to it.
Perhaps the two most important aspects of what is being proposed in terms of committee investigation are as follows. The first aspect concerns the potential to develop an alternative regime in which questioning to obtain intelligence perhaps relating to terrorism is conducted not by ASIO—an organisation which never before has had these powers—but by the Australian Federal Police, including appropriate arrangements for detention of terrorist suspects and the questioning of people not suspected of any offence. There is also the question proposed in this amendment by the opposition that we should consider whether the bill in its current form, or perhaps amended, is constitutionally sound. There is some suggestion that elements of it may not be. That too is fully worthy of investigation and I for one would certainly welcome input from Professor George Williams on this matter once again. 
Fundamentally we need to ensure that the community is convinced that there is no secrecy surrounding this legislation, and that the community is convinced that it has appropriate input to discussion and debate around it. The one strong thing that struck me from all of those people that came before the previous committee dealing with the suite of five bills was the gratitude that many hundreds of them felt for simply having the opportunity to have their say on what was very controversial and contentious legislation—to the point where a further hearing was held, I think in Sydney, in a public forum where people could simply get up and speak for two or three minutes to express an opinion and not necessarily engage in debate. We wanted to ensure that everybody who wanted to be heard could be. When you are dealing with espionage or, in this case, an intelligence or, if you like, a spy agency, there are considerable community conspiracy theories surrounding the matter. The only way to alleviate people's anxiety about that is to have openness and transparency. It is appropriate that we engage in further community debate on this, but more appropriate that we encourage submissions and invite comment, and it is imperative that any legislation dealing with this matter in relation to security services has the support of the Australian people, because without that there will be ongoing community concern. Let us alleviate that by engaging in the process.  
We Democrats look forward to the committee process which I hope will eventuate from this. We will contribute to it. We continue to have concerns about the notion of a pool of lawyers being appointed by the government, but we are open-minded about that. We would not, under any circumstances, like to see the situation where any Australian citizen was denied legal representation under such circumstances, let alone for 48 hours. We have ongoing concerns with the notion that 15-, 16- and 17-year-olds might find themselves in this situation. In an overall sense, we are very supportive of appropriate antiterrorism measures. We understand the community concern in this regard, but fundamentally the principle for us is never eroding civil liberties, and ensuring that rights are balanced with responsibilities. Let us not erode our democratic freedoms while trying to protect them.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2002-10-17,"—As I listened to Senator Kirk's speech earlier on this morning, I was struck by what implausible advocates for civil liberties are those who come into this parliament representing parties of the Left. It is never to be forgotten that those who represent the parties of the Left in Australian parliaments have been the apologists for most of—not all of, but most of—the most brutal and oppressive governments of the 20th century. I do not remember reading of Dr Evatt being too fussed with the civil liberties of people in the Soviet Union or eastern Europe. I do not remember Mr Whitlam being too concerned with the civil liberties of people in the Baltic states or in China. I do not remember Dr Jim Cairns being too concerned about the civil liberties of people in Vietnam. I do not remember some of the household gods of the left-wing intelligentsia, like the late Professor Manning Clark, who published that disgraceful book, Meeting Soviet Man, many years ago, being too concerned about the civil liberties of people who suffered under communist regimes. I do not remember any of that.
What I do remember though is that, when one reads the tracts and the doctrines upon which socialism is based, what one reads is an incessant attack on civil liberties as bourgeois false consciousness. That is what socialists say about civil liberties: that civil liberties are bourgeois false consciousness. It is those who represent the parties of the right, those who sit on this side of the chamber, who are concerned about the rights of the individual and who are concerned to limit the power of the state. It is those who sit on the left of the chair, those who come into this parliament to represent parties of the left, who are concerned to glorify the power of the state and to diminish the rights of the individual. So, as I say—and I do not include you in this, Senator Greig; I want to focus myself quite specifically on the Australian Labor Party—whenever one hears Labor Party politicians putting on the mantle of civil liberties one ought to be sceptical, and one ought to consider what they did and what they said in defence of regimes which in the 20th century were among the greatest violators of the rights of their peoples the world has known.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. Senator Brandis has cast a slur of the worst sort upon honourable senators on this side who are members of the Australian Labor Party. He has done so using terms which can only be fairly described as inflammatory and disgraceful to describe our conduct and our attitude. They are terms which—although I concede that that is a matter for debate—are fundamentally untrue. He has referred to the Australian Labor Party. I am an Australian Labor Party senator, and many of those on this side are. The reflections he makes upon us as a collective group are reflections upon us as individual senators too. They are rejected and they should be withdrawn. 
 (Senator Watson)—I do not think Senator Brandis was reflecting on individual senators. I warn Senator Brandis to make sure that he does not reflect on individual senators, but if he is talking generally that is acceptable.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order—
—Is it a further point of order? Because I have responded to that point of order.
—Yes, it is a further point of order given the ruling that you have made. My point of order is that you accept that a reflection upon us as individuals would be unparliamentary and should be withdrawn. I understand that is what you have said?
—That is right.
—As I say, I am a member, and a proud one, of the Australian Labor Party. He has reflected upon my party in the harshest and most unreasonable terms. That can only be regarded by me, and by anyone listening to this debate, as a reflection upon me as well. I take that to be personal and I reject it in the most trenchant manner. Because it is personal, I think you should consider your ruling and rule that those remarks be removed.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. This will be a vigorous debate. I have sat long hours on this side of the chamber and listened to the likes of Senator Cook and his colleagues and the relentless and savage attacks that they make on distinguished Australians such as John Howard and on the Liberal Party. I point out that Senator Cook is notorious for having a glass jaw.
—What is your point of order, Senator Kemp?
—The point of order is that no point of order has been raised by Senator Cook. This is a matter of debate, and the debate should be allowed to continue. I make the point that, if Senator Cook continues to jump to his feet, we will be jumping to our feet during his remarks.
—On a point of order, Mr Acting Deputy President—
—Just a moment, Senator Cook; I will just give a ruling. He cannot reflect on senators individually or collectively, and I do not believe he has done it to date, but I will listen very carefully.
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I now rise on a further point of order. It relates to the remarks made just now by Senator Kemp. As I recall those remarks—and Hansard will be a true and accurate copy of them, so it is a matter of a clear record—
—Please come to the point of order, Senator Cook.
—The point of order is that he said that, should I continue to raise points of order—which I raise conscientiously for the good conduct of this chamber—he will ensure that he raises consistent points of order on me during my remarks, which will follow lately. I take that as a threat that, if I conduct myself in a principled way to defend the standing orders of this chamber, I will be dealt with by a use of the standing orders against me by Senator Kemp. That is a reflection upon me, and you should rule that he withdraw.
—I do not regard that as a reflection; I think it is just part of the robust debate that we are likely to continue to have during this particular debate.
—If that is the ruling then that is the ruling.
—Thank you, Senator Cook. Please continue, Senator Brandis. 
—Mr Acting Deputy President, may I say that I do not make any personal reflection against Senator Cook. My reflections are about the side of politics and the political point of view which the Labor Party represents and which Labor senators represent. I asked the question rhetorically, merely to point out the hypocrisy of Labor politicians representing themselves as champions of civil liberties.
—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I am a Labor politician and I represent myself as a champion of civil liberties. I object to the use of the word `hypocrisy' and I ask him to withdraw it as unparliamentary.
—Senator Brandis, I did not take it that you were referring to a particular senator.
—I do not say these remarks about any nominated or individual senator, no.
—Or senators collectively.
—Or senators collectively?
—Or senators collectively. I am talking about the Australian Labor Party. I do ask rhetorically: if the Australian Labor Party are so concerned about civil liberties, where were the Australian Labor Party when the peoples of eastern Europe and the Baltic States were yearning and striving for their freedom? Where were the Australian Labor Party during the Gulag? Where were the Australian Labor Party during the Great Leap Forward? Where are the Australian Labor Party today when it comes to concern for the rights of people under the diminishing number of communist governments in the world? They were nowhere. They were deafening by their silence. They are condemned by their own neglect of the greatest civil liberties issue in any of our lifetimes. That is why I have scorn and contempt when I hear members of the Australian Labor Party representing themselves as champions of civil liberties—people who come into this place to enlarge the power of the state and diminish the rights of the individual. It is the Liberal Party that is the party of civil liberties, and let that never be forgotten.
I want to deal specifically with some of the aspects of this legislation and, as we know, as always, legislation of this kind involves a balancing exercise. Liberty is a key value of any liberal democracy. Nobody disputes that; that is not an issue.
—Trade it off.
—That is right! There are balances to be struck, Senator Lundy— you are right. One of the other core values of any liberal democracy and one of the core responsibilities of government is the protection of its citizens from harm. Does anybody dispute that one of the fundamental obligations of a government is to protect its citizens from harm? I dispute the proposition that this legislation, in the form which it now takes, having been amended to incorporate most of the recommendations for safeguards that came from the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, goes too far or is a knee-jerk reaction. The particular evil with which we are concerned—that is terrorism—is an evil which we will be successful in meeting only if we anticipate it before it happens. That is why the entire approach that I heard from Senator Kirk and Senator Greig is quite wrong. This legislation is not dealing with the investigation of criminal conduct after the crime has been committed. That is not the point. If the crime has already been committed, it is too late. If the terrorist act has been committed, it is too late. It will have been a failure. The whole point of this legislation is to enable terrorism to be anticipated so that it does not occur. I cannot for the life of me see that there is anything inherently illiberal about that. It seems to me that it is at the very core of a government's responsibility to protect its people from harm. 
Mr Crean last Monday gave a press conference and he said, and he was right in saying so, that one of the lessons of the terrible event last weekend in Bali was that the most effective form of prevention is `having good intelligence about terrorists and their operations'. Those were Mr Crean's words and I am sure nobody in this chamber would disagree with them. The point of this legislation is to enable such intelligence to be derived, to be gathered. I do not agree, with respect, with the view propounded by Senator Greig that there is necessarily something intrinsically wrongful about enabling coercive powers, subject to strict safeguards, to be employed against people who have not and are not suspected of committing a crime if it be the case— 
—Just wait to hear what I have to say, Senator Lundy—if it be the case, and this is the case with which this legislation is concerned, (a) that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person against whom those coercive powers are to be employed has knowledge of an imminent terrorist event and (b) the exercise of those powers is regulated by strict safeguards. If a person in Australia not presently under suspicion of a criminal offence but nevertheless believed on reasonable grounds to be in possession of information which might lead to the apprehension of a terrorist event so that it is anticipated and prevented before it can happen, do you seriously say that there ought to be no capacity to use coercive powers to elicit that information from that person?
—Apparently Senator Lundy does. I do not. If a person is in possession of knowledge which, if communicated to the authorities, might assist in the anticipation and prevention of a terrorist crime, I do not regard it as an unacceptable abridgment or abrogation of civil liberties to enable the coercive power of the state to be used to elicit that information from them so long as the circumstances in which that can be done are protected by appropriate safeguards.
—You are constructing a scenario to suit your purpose. There is no basis in Australian law.
—Senator Lundy, don't you throw civil liberties at the Liberal Party. We are the party of civil liberties and you are the party of apologists for those who have violated civil liberties in the most gross and egregious manner the 20th century has ever seen.
I want to turn to another point that Senator Greig made. Senator Greig made the observation, and he is right, that there is a risk of abuse of power. May I respond by saying two things. First of all, whenever any government authority, particularly an investigative or a policing agency, is vested with power, there is a risk that that power will be abused. That is in the nature of things. It does not follow from that proposition that no power or extended powers should ever be given to investigative agencies. Senator Greig, if you are going to run that argument, you could run it as a critique of every single piece of legislation that this parliament passes—sometimes with the agreement of your party—whereby investigative agencies are given a new power. It is not an argument to say that the power should not exist because it might be abused. Of course it might be; that is in the nature of things. The answer is to ensure that the exercise of the power is hedged and guarded by sufficient protections and safeguards to ensure that that does not happen, and to define the power in the most narrowly focused way to ensure that there is not an extravagant opportunity for abuse. But it is not an argument to say: this is a power; therefore it can be abused and therefore it should not exist. That is a poor argument.
—No-one is saying that.
—That was Senator Greig's argument; and it is wrong. In the time available to me I am going to respond to Senator Kirk's question when she asked rhetorically: how will the bill assist to protect the Australian people from the threat of terrorism? That is what the bill is about. Let me tell you, Mr Acting Deputy President, how it will in a realistic, measured and material way, assist in protecting the people from terrorism. First of all, as I said a moment ago, the bill is about the eliciting of information—the gathering of intelligence. Intelligence is the key tool for the prevention of terrorism. It is not about punishing terrorists; it is about preventing terrorism. The bill provides a warrant procedure whereby information may be elicited in circumstances where presently ASIO is not empowered to elicit that information. To obtain a warrant that can, in exceptional circumstances, authorise ASIO officers to investigate a person believed on reasonable grounds to have knowledge of an imminent terrorist act, an elaborate procedure needs to be engaged in. In the first place, the Director-General of ASIO has to seek the consent of the Attorney-General to apply for the warrant. If that consent is withheld, the process ceases. Secondly, the application must be made to an issuing authority. The issuing authority must be a member of the federal judiciary or another qualified person. 
Before he gives his consent, the Attorney-General is under a statutory obligation to be satisfied on reasonable grounds that the warrant `will substantially assist the collection of intelligence that is important in relation to a terrorism offence' and `that relying on other methods of collecting that intelligence would be ineffective'. Further, if the warrant authorises someone to be taken into custody, the Attorney-General must also be satisfied that the person who it is sought to take into custody:
(i) may alert a person involved in a terrorism offence that the offence is being investigated; or
(ii) may not appear before the prescribed authority; or
(iii) may destroy, damage or alter a record or thing the person may be requested in accordance with the warrant to produce ...
If the warrant concerns a person between the ages of 14 and 18 years, the Attorney-General, in addition to all of those other things, must be satisfied that it is likely that the person will commit, is committing or has committed a terrorist offence. When, but not until, the Attorney-General's consent is given, the Director-General can then apply to an issuing authority for a warrant. At that stage the issuing authority—that is, a member of the federal judiciary—may only issue the warrant if it has been requested in a proper manner and he is `satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the warrant will substantially assist the collection of intelligence that is important in relation to a terrorism offence'. So there are two high thresholds which must be satisfied before a warrant can be issued: first, a reasonable belief on the part of the Attorney-General and, secondly, a reasonable belief on the part of an issuing authority. And before any of that can happen the Director-General of ASIO must arrive at a view that this extraordinary process—because it is an extraordinary process—is necessary.
In respect of people who may be detained without access to legal representation for 48 hours, that is something that can only occur, in the language of the bill, in exceptional circumstances. Those exceptional circumstances are that the relevant issuing authority and the Attorney-General are both satisfied that the power must be exercised to protect the community from imminent terrorist danger. How absurd would it be if you had a situation in which the Australian authorities reasonably believed and persuaded both the Attorney-General and the independent judicial authority that there were reasonable grounds that a terrorist act was imminent and they could be defeated and thwarted by the person suspected of possessing the material information saying, `I am not going to speak until I see a lawyer nominated by me'? It would be the most obvious ruse to enable the very purpose of this legislation to be thwarted and avoided.
I am a lawyer. I take second place to no-one in being concerned about the rights of people to legal representation. It is a very important right. But, like any right, it can be abused. The one circumstance for which provision is made that a person may be held in custody without access to a lawyer for 48 hours is in the extremely narrow case where there is a reasonably held belief of an imminent terrorist act. I do not have any difficulty in accepting that that is a reasonable limitation on that right. Rights do not exist in isolation. They are balanced not only by responsibilities but also by the obligation of governments to protect their people from harm, which is the point at which I commenced. 
There are limitations on existing rights in this legislation—in very narrow circumstances and very carefully hedged in by safeguards. The Attorney-General and the government have been most cooperative in adopting most of the recommendations of the Senate committee to augment and improve those protections. At the end of the day, the question we as senators have to ask ourselves is: is the obligation of government to protect its citizens from harm sufficiently urgent that these limitations are justified?

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2002-10-17,"—Like quite a few senators, I made notes to speak on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 some weeks ago. One of the first things I did was to try to distil the arguments that others, not I, had run against the bill. The first point I made was from those critics that Australia does not face a terrorist attack. I said that this assumption can only be proved wrong with disastrous consequences. I take no joy out of that prescience. But the fact is that we have international obligations. We must try to prevent terrorism wherever it occurs around the globe. It was irrelevant whether Australia was under terrorist threat—we have to take the appropriate action to prevent it anywhere around the globe. I just find it amazing that some of the critics of the antiterrorist legislation are those people who have previously been the most noted internationalists in this parliament and Australian society. Suddenly that internationalism is reversed: just because we may not be under threat, we should do absolutely nothing about it. I think we have an absolute obligation to stamp out terrorism whenever it occurs and against whomever it occurs.
The second argument I have seen run is that existing powers are sufficient to deal with a terrorist threat. That is just not so. The right to silence must be balanced off against the right of innocent people to be protected. Under existing law, suspects could be questioned, but those who are recipients of information, but not participants, could in fact be exempt from questioning. The right to silence has already been abrogated in several other areas of Australian law that are far less serious than this. The third criticism of the legislation in broad is that ASIO will become a secret police unit if these powers were conferred on it. What is proposed are powers to detain, not to arrest or gather evidence.
When you go back to the original bill, we heard no real justification of it from Senator Brandis in his rather hysterical contribution this morning. The original bill that was introduced into this parliament was poorly drafted, insensitive to civil liberties and had the unintended consequence of maximising criticism across the board from all sorts of usual and unusual quarters. Let us go through the weaknesses of that original legislation. First of all, it allowed for the AAT to issue warrants. Most AAT members are not chapter 3 appointments; they do not have permanency. Therefore, they are under some degree of political influence and control. To allow them to issue warrants is not acceptable in the regime of Australian law. It also allowed Federal Court judges to participate as a prescribed authority—almost certainly unconstitutional. Of course, the government has yet again refused to produce its legal advice on this matter. It produces legal advice only where it is unimpeachable and supports it on the matter. One suspects that this advice has not been produced because it is flawed. At no stage has the Attorney-General properly addressed this issue.
The second major weakness in the original legislation was that it allowed for renewable detention on an unlimited basis. Why was there not a limit put on this in the original bill? I did not know that I was living in South Africa in the apartheid era. This is typical of laws of that apartheid regime. Thirdly, poor drafting allowed that loophole to exist between being detained and being questioned immediately. There is only one `immediately' there, so you could have been detained and not questioned for weeks. The clock starts ticking on your 48 hours only when the questioning begins. How in heaven's name did that get past the drafters?
The fourth area is the lack of legal representation. An argument that can be adduced here is that there is not much point in detaining a suspect or a potential recipient of terrorist information if you allow them to contact their local lawyer, who can then place straight into the hands of the terrorist network the fact that they are under suspicion. But the alternative regime that we suggested—that the Bar Council of Australia provide a panel of security cleared lawyers who, from the very first minute, can represent these people—has not been taken up by the government. There is still this 48-hour period with no legal representation. This is just not part of Australian society. The suggestion from the Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD solved this problem—this counteracts the sorts of points made by Senator Brandis today—but it has not been taken up by the government. 
We found a total absence of protocols as to how this questioning should occur. Can you question someone for 48 hours on end? Where do you keep them when you are not questioning them? Do you throw them in the local jail? Not one detail was contained in the legislation. It was assumed that the prescribed authority would in fact detail all of those particular procedures. Now, of course, we have advanced. We now have a commitment from the government not so much that the act will not be proclaimed but that it will not be invoked until protocols have been developed and cleared by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. That is a big improvement and it is to be welcomed.
I suppose the greatest stupidity in this legislation as it was originally produced is that there was no prohibition against self-incrimination. Let us take the classic case of someone who is suspected of having knowledge of a terrorist act. They can admit to that under questioning and face a life sentence; they can refuse to answer questions and get a five-year sentence. Which do you think your suspected terrorist would choose? They would take the five years above life every time. The whole intention of this legislation is not to gather evidence but to glean information to prevent terrorists acts. So why would you not have protected the detainees from self-incrimination?
The original bill would have allowed ASIO to detain and to strip search 10-year-olds. The great defender of civil liberties, Senator Brandis, who is now absent from the chamber, apparently let that go through the party room—that you could strip search 10-year-olds and detain them. Their parents would not have been allowed to know that you had detained them. What do you think would happen to a parent whose kid went missing for 48 hours and who could not be told about it? The compromise they put up is a 14-year-old, yet when you go through all these details with the security agency they can hardly nominate someone under the age of 18 who would ever be affected. That is why seven members of the joint intelligence committee—including four government members—said, `Eighteen and that's it.' But the government just could not accept that.
There was no accountability for the number of warrants to be issued. There is a justifiable case for not listing the number of telephone intercept warrants. We have been through all that in the past. If they are really high, it warns people off; if they are really low, it encourages people to use the phone for those purposes. I understand that argument. But in this case it is absolutely essential that the parliament and the public of Australia know how many of these warrants are issued. For instance, if it were only one or two a year, then a lot of the civil liberties problems we have with this legislation would not be deemed to be so serious. If it were scores or hundreds a year, then we would know that this legislation was being used or abused. The government has come to see sense on that.
One of the worst aspects is that the government has rejected a sunset clause, and this is the sort of legislation that must have a sunset clause. We want to see how it works in practice—remember? The Labor Party did not insist on a sunset clause on the other five antiterrorist bills, because we could see the necessity for them to be an ongoing feature of the Australian legal system. But going into this new and tough territory—you are actually detaining people who have not committed an offence—there must be a sunset clause. A government must have to re-present such legislation within three years to see whether the parliament will certify it.
You might ask why this legislation was so draconian. Was it just a clumsy attempt at wedge politics? We know how enamoured this coalition government is of wedge politics. You only have to look at the asylum seeker issue to understand that. In that area, bipartisanship was deliberately and maliciously destroyed. But it seems to me that this is not a wedge political issue. You have to ask yourself whether, if you were a government intending to play wedge politics, you would give the task to the current Attorney-General, Mr Williams. He is a rather avuncular Tory but a ditherer. Let us face it, he has the killer instinct of a six-day-old blancmange. He could not get a kick in a stampede. So I cannot really believe that this was put forward as a wedge political issue. It is more likely that it was a case of: `We will put forward an extremist bill, we will have it referred to a committee, we will then get a compromise up and the bill will float through.' I think those are the tactics employed here. They are not honest tactics and they are not decent tactics. They have backfired very badly, because the bill was so badly drafted and so extreme in its impingement on civil liberties that it has had more critique and more attention given to it than a balanced bill would have had. 
I understand—and I am ready to be corrected—that we have not yet seen, either in this chamber or in the House of Representatives, the government's official response to the joint intelligence committee's critique of this piece of legislation. I find that disappointing. However, the opposition have been briefed as to the government's official reaction to that committee's 15 recommendations, and we understand that they have basically accepted 10 of the recommendations on this legislation. I think that is a good thing. In two other cases—in regard to the protocols and to the inspector-general's role—they have not accepted the committee's recommendations but what they have counter-proposed is quite acceptable and in some cases better than what the committee could have proffered. I thank the Attorney-General's Department for developing those two proposals on when the protocols kick in and the inspector-general's role.
The three critical areas in which disagreement remains—not between the opposition and the government but between the government and the joint committee—are legal representation, a sunset clause and the age at which the legislation applies. In those three areas the government has not seen sense. Overall, the tone of the government's response is very defensive—bordering on the smarmy. It reflects the hubris of government. One or two recommendations are grudgingly acknowledged, but for different reasons. It is as though they cannot just come out and honestly say, `The original bill was badly flawed and we accept the criticism by the committee.' Throughout, the common strain is: are these matters constitutional? They never properly address that. They do not produce their legal advice to say that the matters are constitutional. We may well find if this bill goes through that it proves, even in its amended form, to be unconstitutional in some parts.
The opposition has provided a second reading amendment that tasks the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee to develop a different regime altogether—to look at whether the AFP, rather than ASIO, should be given powers to detain and question. All I can say to that is good luck. I will keep an open mind on it but I have my doubts as to whether an alternative regime based on Federal Police powers is preferable to one based on ASIO powers. I know that the glitterati of the Melbourne and Sydney legal circles have forgotten the pernicious activities of state special branch police. I have not forgotten. Any sins that have been committed by security agencies in this country, especially in the Cold War days, are nothing when compared to the gross insensitivities to civil liberties committed by special branches operating out of state police forces. I do not want to see the development at a federal level of police forces being given even the sorts of powers that are proposed for ASIO. Conceptually, they have got that wrong. But I will keep an open mind, because you never know—I always acknowledge that there are smarter people around than me and they may well come up with a regime that this parliament could find more acceptable than the nonsense so far put into the legislation by the current Attorney-General.
I want to stress that this is not a delaying tactic. We will get accused of that, of course. The government has been very slow to respond to some of these details. The original timetable put on the joint intelligence committee to report on this ASIO bill was crazy: it only allowed a few days for public submissions; the timetable was just too tight. We ignored it, and we put a resolution to this parliament to extend our terms of reference and time to report. Even then, we had a reporting date of 15 June but we managed through hard work and effort to get the report to the Attorney-General by, I think, 29 May, with the intention of being able to deal with it in the June session. There were negotiations, thank you very much, between the opposition and the government. But what happened to the amendments that we were promised on, I think, 13 different occasions? They never materialised. They were supposed to come in June; they never arrived. So I resent the Labor Party ever being accused of trying to delay this bill. It was the failure to produce government amendments in response to the committee report that delayed consideration of this legislation. 
If this second reading amendment to adjourn the bill to the legal and constitutional committee is successful, the government will claim that we are not genuine in our determination to combat terrorism. This is just standard operating procedure for those who believe that patriotism only exists on the conservative side of politics. We as an opposition have a duty, as do the minor parties in this place, to ensure that this legislation is balanced and decent. If people think they are going to put a gun to our heads and call us unpatriotic because we stand by those principles then so be it. I acknowledge that there will be political gain to the government in that. It is just a pity that they put those sorts of political gains above political decency.
We would never have had to refer this to yet another committee if this legislation had been properly considered in the first instance. I was pleased to see the Prime Minister acknowledge that the five pieces of antiterrorist legislation in the end got the balance right. I think he was right in that; there was a lot of cooperation around this chamber to make sure that the balance was right. But in this legislation it has essentially gone one step too far. On the joint committee we had the duty to improve the legislation, not approve it—that was always going to come later.
The crux of this whole debate and the issue that the Senate committee has got to look at is not so much how suspects are treated but how much the civil liberties of people who are not suspected of a crime but have knowledge of a potential crime—they may not even know that it is a potential crime— can be impinged upon to protect others. It is about where you draw the line. If you come down on the side that only suspects should be dealt with in this way, then you can make the legislation tougher, more stringent and more draconian if you want to. But if the main body of people being affected—and this is what I suspect will happen—will be non-suspects who have potential information, then you have to protect their civil liberties. You have got to give them legal representation, but you do not have to give them their choice of legal representation—we can take it that far.
I wish the Senate committee well. I hope—and I am pretty much assured, given their previous track record—that the Attorney-General's Department will take that inquiry seriously and cooperate with it, as they always have. I am sure, given the enormous cooperation that Dennis Richardson and ASIO have given in the consideration of this legislation, that that committee will be able to report promptly. But, again, I say—and this is only an individual point, not a party point—that I have some doubts about giving these powers to the Federal Police. I do not want to see a British-style special branch developed in Australia. Ironically, I would be more comfortable with ASIO and their reputation over the past decade than I would be with the police force.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Nettle, Sen Kerry",AG,2002-10-17,"—I rise to speak on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002. I start by saying that the Australian Greens believe that now is the time for us to be showing appropriate mourning and grieving for the deaths that occurred in Bali on the weekend. We think it is the time to focus on efforts to find the perpetrators of this tragedy and to carry out a review of security intelligence services. All of these things the government have either begun or indicated they will be doing. 
The Australian Greens do not believe it to be appropriate to be rushing this bill up the government's legislative program. When this legislation was first introduced, it was clearly recognised by the vast majority of society and certainly by the vast majority of parliamentarians in this place as an overreaction to the event of September 11. Since being introduced, this legislation has been sent to two committees: the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD and the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. The joint committee came up with a range of recommendations that the Australian Greens would characterise as tinkering at the edges of an unacceptable bill. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee itself recognised that it had not carried out a rigorous review of this legislation and it simply endorsed the recommendations of the joint committee. There is an important role for the Senate committee to play in examining the detail of this legislation, so the Australian Greens will be supporting the opposition's second reading amendment which proposes to send this amended bill back to that committee.
We must recognise that tinkering at the edges will not improve this legislation. No amendment can alter the fundamental undemocratic character of this legislation, which removes rights that have been enshrined in legal systems around the globe for centuries. The Australian Greens believe we must unequivocally state that no-one should be detained or imprisoned unless suspected of a crime on reasonable grounds or convicted by a court. Even the governments of the United States and the United Kingdom have not gone as far as this legislation in giving their security agencies the power to arrest and detain innocent people not suspected of being involved in any crime. The Australian Greens believe that the existing powers and processes available to the police services and to ASIO under criminal law are adequate to investigate and prosecute any terrorist crimes. The Federal Police can arrest anyone they suspect of committing offences and they can question them for a reasonable time. Anyone who is suspected of being engaged in terrorist crimes is extremely unlikely to be granted bail, so they will be held in custody whilst the investigation proceeds. ASIO can already tap telephones, access computer files and search people's homes. The Greens believe the police and ASIO have the powers and the resources to pursue terrorist crimes.
But this bill would give virtually untrammelled power to ASIO to crack down not only on terrorists but also on ordinary Australians that ASIO say have information that ASIO believe they need. Those people could be friends or family, colleagues, neighbours, doctors or journalists—anyone ASIO believe has information about a person or a group that they allege is involved in terrorism. This bill would enable ASIO to `disappear' these people. That is why eminent constitutional lawyer and academic Professor George Williams, whom others have quoted in this place today, has warned us that this bill will turn ASIO into a secret police force, that this is akin to Pinochet's Chile.
I take this opportunity to go through the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD on this bill as a means of highlighting the fundamental flaws of this bill which cannot be improved by amendment. One of the crucial flaws of this legislation is the intention to give ASIO the power to detain incommunicado people who are suspected of being involved in terrorist activities but who may have information potentially relating to terrorist activities—throwing the net extremely widely. The joint committee has not acknowledged this crucial flaw or suggested a way to amend it, simply because this legislation cannot be amended to remove this flaw; rather, it needs to be rejected outright.
For the first time in Australia's history, this bill intends to give ASIO the power to detain individuals. This extension of ASIO's role from intelligence gathering, by giving it the power to detain, turns it into a secret police force. When this legislation was first introduced, it was designed to empower ASIO to detain people for 48 hours. It then became apparent that—potentially through the hasty drafting of this legislation after September 11—it allowed for an indefinite number of warrants to be issued, effectively allowing for a period of indefinite detention of non-suspects. The joint committee recommended that the period for secret detention of non-suspects should be seven days. It is worth noting that this period of detention which was recommended by the joint committee goes well beyond the original period of detention of 48 hours proposed by the government—assuming, as I do, that the government did not intend for that period of initial detention to be indefinite. 
Another flawed aspect of this bill is the refusal to give detainees access to a lawyer of their choice. Through this amended bill, the government is currently proposing that people detained under this legislation have no access to a lawyer for the first 48 hours of their detention and that no lawyer should be present during the granting of a warrant for their arrest. The government is proposing that, after the initial 48 hours of detention, people detained under this legislation have access only to a lawyer from a small pool of lawyers vetted by ASIO and that any individual able to access a lawyer from this small pool of lawyers cannot consult with that lawyer without having an ASIO officer present. It is hardly the sort of fair process that the Australian public expects.
Originally the bill also proposed that people detained under this act would have no right to silence and no defence of self-incrimination, so a person detained under a warrant may not refuse to give information even if it may incriminate them. The joint committee recommended that, if the bill must remove the right to silence, then a person must have protection against self-incrimination in providing information relating to a terrorist offence. Again, the Australian Greens would hardly argue that this recommendation is sufficient to address civil liberties concerns in Australia.
In its current form, the bill also stipulates that a person must not fail to produce any record or thing requested, and if they do refuse to provide such a record or a thing they face five years imprisonment. Aside from the obvious questions about how you can prove that somebody has failed to provide evidence, to have this kind of proposal applying to non-suspects caught by this legislation is clearly unfair.
This piece of legislation when first introduced allowed for the strip searching of children as young as 10 years of age. The committee recommended that no person under the age of 18 should be questioned or detained under this bill. This was rejected by the government that now wants to see in this amended bill a minimum age of 14 and bring in special provisions for children between the ages of 14 and 18. Another recommendation that the joint committee made with regard to this legislation was that a sunset clause should be put in place. This recommendation has also been rejected by the government.
The committee also recommended that the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security be given the power to suspend an interview being conducted under warrant procedures on the basis of non-compliance with the law or an impropriety occurring. The government also rejected this proposal, preferring to allow the Inspector-General if he or she saw fit to notify a prescribed authority when a breach of the act had occurred and that the prescribed authority could then act after the event if they saw fit. It is hardly an efficient way to deal with a breach of this bill. In particular, its lack of timeliness undermines its efficacy as a safeguard. The fundamental flaws of this legislation simply cannot be amended out. No-one should be detained or imprisoned unless convicted or suspected of a crime on reasonable grounds by a court. I concur with the report of Senator Cooney and Senator Brown in the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee that said:
The appropriate course to take with this legislation is to dispense with it.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2002-10-17,"—I thank the Senate for this opportunity to speak on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 before us today. The bill before the Senate, known widely as the ASIO bill, is an inappropriate overreaction by the federal government. It is inspired by overseas counter-terrorism practices, but it is flawed. We support steps taken to achieve real protection from terrorist attacks. We support the government's initiative to review all of our security arrangements in light of the horrific attacks in Bali. We stand ready to consider any genuine proposals to meet the challenge of terrorist threats, but we do not accept that an appropriate response to terrorist threats is the secret detention of Australian citizens and a denial of natural justice and access to legal counsel. 
In many ways the proposed bill, which aims to give powers to ASIO, is one that many a police state would be envious of and goes further than the legislative response to terrorism by governments that have experienced acts of terrorism on their own soil. The proposed bill is inconsistent with fundamental aspects of the rule of law and with core international human rights obligations. It is lazy legislation and it seeks to meet the threat of terrorism with the removal of fundamental rights and freedoms from its citizens and basically fight fear with legislative fear.
The bill before us in the Senate is amended slightly from its original form after serious concerns were raised by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. However, the bill still remains far too draconian to have this parliament pass it into law. The scope of the bill enables an extraordinarily vast range of persons to be potentially questioned and detained, even if they are not suspected of committing or preparing to commit an act deemed as a terrorist offence. The legislative process that has occurred since the government first proposed to introduce new laws to deal with the threat of terrorism in Australia and to Australian interests overseas raises grave concerns on this side of the chamber.
This is a government that is prepared to support a bill that would allow adults and children to be detained and strip searched. This is a government that is prepared to allow people to be denied access to anyone outside of ASIO while being detained by ASIO. This Attorney-General is prepared to accept that people may be held indefinitely without charges being laid or even the possibility that charges will be laid. The bill proposes to change ASIO as an organisation that operates as a gathering of intelligence agency that feeds the product of that intelligence into agencies which are charged with the responsibility for investigating potential crimes into some sort of secret police with all the powers that come with it—arrest and detention. ASIO would become a law unto itself.
The powers this government is prepared to give ASIO and the Attorney-General rest in too few hands. The process is not open or accountable and it is not open to public or political scrutiny. This undoubtedly would create a problem as ASIO operates as a secret intelligence gathering organisation and its own operations could be put in jeopardy if the amount of scrutiny required to administer such powers were enforced on ASIO. The government has not thought this legislation through. It has taken over 12 months now to propose legislation that would effectively assist intelligence gathering that would stop any potential terrorist threats to Australia or Australian interests overseas and has come up with a bill that can only be described as draconian and bad policy.
The government has accepted, after substantial public concern, that persons detained may have the minister approve a legal practitioner whilst in detention or being questioned by ASIO. In its original form the bill contained no such measures. That is, if a person were to be detained, they would have no access to legal counsel—a detained person would be held incommunicado. Prior to the amended bill, 34F(8) stated:
A person who has been taken into custody, or detained, under this Division is not permitted to contact, and may be prevented from contacting, anyone at any time while in custody or detention.
The government now proposes to insert in schedule 1, item 24, before subsection (4), an amendment that ensures the person being taken into custody for questioning has the ability to contact an approved lawyer at any time when the person is in custody or detention. However—and as always with this government there is a however, and this one is outrageous—the provision to legal counsel may not apply if the minister is satisfied on `reasonable grounds' that it is appropriate in all the circumstances that the person not be permitted to contact a legal adviser. What the Attorney-General has attempted with this amendment is to put a positive spin—some good PR—on an otherwise almost universally condemned bill. But in reality, the intention of the amendment has been undermined by a clause that allows the minister to prevent a person in custody or detention from accessing legal counsel if he or she so wishes. 
The extent of denying Australians fundamental liberties, the deprivation of liberty without charges, through to persons being detained without access to legal counsel or family is an unacceptable standard for any free democracy. Without access to independent legal counsel, proposed section 34J, which is supposed to ensure that a person in custody or detention is treated humanely and is offered respect for human dignity and freedom from inhuman or degrading treatment, is worthless and meaningless. If there is no way in which information about questionable ill-treatment or detention can reach persons or organisations outside of ASIO, there is no practical means to challenge such treatment. The inability of detainees to access legal counsel is in stark contradiction to the UN Human Rights Committee's General Comment on article 7 concerning the prohibition of torture and cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment or punishment. It states:
... To guarantee the effective protection of detained persons ... provisions should ... be made against incommunicado detention ... the protection of the detainee also requires that prompt and regular access be given to doctors and lawyers, and under appropriate supervision when the investigation so requires, to family members.
The proposed bill is clearly in contradiction to those comments. The fact that it took the Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD to raise concerns that the bill in its original form contained no provisions for access to legal counsel demonstrates this government's complete disregard for international law and human rights. As I mentioned earlier, while the government now makes provisions in the bill for a detained person or persons to have access to a prescribed legal practitioner, so too does it contain provisions which seek to dismiss the fundamental, internationally recognised human right of having access to legal counsel while in detention or being questioned, simply on the basis of the minister's discretion.
As I have previously mentioned in this chamber, this government is all too easily prepared to deny its citizens the basic human right of access to legal counsel when being held in detention. The cases of Mr David Hicks and Mr Habib, which I have previously raised in this chamber, demonstrate this position perfectly. Mr Hicks was held in detention in Guantanamo Bay for over nine months before being moved to Camp Delta on 25 May, where he remains. Mr Habib was arrested in Pakistan last year and has been detained in Guantanamo Bay ever since. To date, neither of these two Australians has been charged with any offence under international law, Australian law or US law, yet they remain in detention indefinitely. Since being held in detention, neither Mr Hicks nor Mr Habib has had any access to legal counsel or family members. Is this the situation we want to emulate in Australia: people held in detention without conviction or even charge? Guilt presumed without trial? I do not believe so.
If it is not enough that the government has proposed a bill that allows a person or persons to be detained without charge and without access to legal counsel, the bill also states that the government is content to have a person or persons detained for a period up to 168 hours. The bill as amended states that a direction under proposed section 34F(1) must not result in `a person being detained for a continuous period of more than 168 hours starting when the person first appeared before a prescribed authority'. One hundred and sixty-eight hours is equivalent to seven days, starting from the moment when the person first appears before a prescribed authority for questioning. It would be likely that a person would be detained for some time prior to being questioned; therefore, if the parliament were to pass this bill it would effectively allow ASIO to have a person disappear from all communication and knowledge for a period that exceeds a week. The ability of ASIO to detain a person for such a period without charge is in clear contradiction to the United Nations Human Rights Committee's General Comment on article 9, which requires the prompt appearance before a judicial officer inside a period which does not exceed several days. 
The term `several days' has been defined in cases dealing with such excessive detention. In the case of Jijan v. Ecuador, the Human Rights Committee found a violation where the person was held for five days without being brought before a judge. The European Court of Human Rights found in the case of Brogan v. The United Kingdom that four days and six hours was too long to satisfy the requirement of promptness. I ask the minister and the government what authority they claim to have to disregard these judgments. What is the reasoning for dismissing these judgments? I put it to the government that it has dismissed these judgments for, if it has not, the minister and his staff are failing to adequately examine the legislation's standing within the international community with respect to overseas test cases around these issues.
These judgments recognise that citizens must be afforded their human rights in all circumstances. The UN has found that the term `several days' shall not exceed five days; the European Court of Human Rights found that four days and six hours was too long to satisfy the requirement of promptness. But the Australian government proposes that seven days is acceptable. The opposition says it is not. While these respected institutions have found that between four and five days is an excessive amount of time to hold citizens that have had no charges laid against their names, this government is demonstrating again that it will disregard overseas practices and legislate to the extreme. It is never enough for this government to recognise how law is progressing overseas and to respect that these laws have been tested and ruled upon by respected institutions.
What this bill demonstrates is that the government is all too easily prepared to disregard due process and human rights. The government cannot claim that it is not aware of the erosion of rights and liberties it proposes to advocate. The Attorney-General has effectively admitted that he is satisfied in advocating for such an erosion. In May, the Attorney-General stated, as he attempted to justify advocating such an erosion of rights and liberties:
We believe the community is prepared to make sacrifices of individual civil liberties in order that the community generally is protected from those threats.
This statement, which the Attorney-General made on behalf of the government, demonstrates, as I stated earlier, that the major answer to the threat of terrorist acts that this government is able to arrive at is the removal of rights and civil liberties of Australian citizens.
The Australian Labor Party do not agree that the strangling of civil liberties is acceptable in order to achieve the desired protection—which we support—against acts of terrorism. Those on this side of the chamber will not accept that the `sacrifice', as the minister would put it, of individual civil liberties is satisfactory. Those on this side of the chamber are not alone in that thinking. It was former Prime Minister Menzies who, in his second reading speech when introducing the National Security Act 1939, stated:
... the greatest tragedy that could overcome a country would be for it to fight a successful war in defence of liberty and to lose its own liberty in the process.
The government should think long and hard about those words by one of their own icons. This bill attempts to advocate such a tragedy. It seeks to remove the liberty of individuals in Australia and, in the words of former Prime Minister Menzies, it would be `the greatest tragedy' that a parliament would seek to remove such rights and liberties during the war on terror—a battle which seeks to ensure that individuals are able to appreciate such rights and liberties without the fear of being injured whilst appreciating them.
Academics and community groups have expressed grave concern over the passage of such a bill. Professor George Williams has expressed concern that the ASIO bill would establish part of the apparatus of a police state. Professor Williams has described it as a law that would not be out of place in former dictatorships such as General Pinochet's in Chile. If democracies allow the erosion of fundamental rights that have been accepted as just and fair for many decades by our citizens and for our citizens then we are allowing the tragic events of terrorism to be victorious. I reject this bill and encourage the Senate to reject it. 
Debate (on motion by Senator Coonan) adjourned.",SENATE,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,19,1,speech
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-10-17,"—Thank you, Mr President, and I thank the Senate for its indulgence. The foreign minister, Alexander Downer, and I returned this morning from a two-day visit to Indonesia, where we visited Bali and Jakarta. Key objectives of the visit were to provide reassurance to the victims and their families and thank emergency response personnel, as well as assess the situation on the ground and obtain Indonesian agreement to the establishment of a joint investigative team. As we now know, this mass murder resulted in a loss of life for Australians, Indonesians and many other people of different nationalities. Although early days, it would seem that Australia and Indonesia are the two countries that have suffered the heaviest loss of life. At present, 30 Australians are reported dead and 119 are unaccounted for. We have very serious concerns for these missing Australians.
In Bali, Mr Downer and I met with the Governor of Bali, the Chief of Police and friends and families of the missing and deceased. We met with the directors of the main hospital and morgue in Denpasar and spoke to those who had treated many of the victims. I expressed my sincere gratitude for the amazing effort of the hospitals and volunteers in their care of victims and their families. The hospitals dealt with an emergency that went well beyond their supplies and their capacity. They did more than their best and, without question, with the utmost commitment. Australia has delivered medical supplies to hospitals in Bali and committed $200,000 to the Indonesian Red Cross. Volunteers from the local Australian community in Bali have made an outstanding effort throughout this whole affair, and we met with them and thanked them. In particular, I spoke to a surgeon from Adelaide who was holidaying in Bali with his wife and three children. When he heard of the disaster, he went straight down to the Sari Club and worked there ministering to the injured. As I understand it, he was there for some days. Such were the efforts made by volunteers of all nationalities, but in particular I want to pay tribute to those Australian expats who did such a great job.
Mr Downer's and my visit to the bombsite in Kuta had a lasting impact on us both. On behalf of the government of Australia we laid wreaths to record in some small way a tribute to those who had lost their lives. Yesterday, in Jakarta, we met with the President of Indonesia, Mrs Megawati Sukarnoputri; the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Dr Hassan Wirajuda; my counterpart, the Minister for Justice, Mr Mahendra; and Mr Yudhoyono, the Coordinating Minister for Political and Security Affairs. We expressed our sincere condolences to the people of Indonesia, and in particular to the families of those who had died. It was an aspect felt by both Mr Downer and me that all whom we met in Indonesia, particularly those in the government including President Megawati, were deeply shocked by what had happened. They conveyed to us their condolences on the loss of Australian life and indicated their total commitment to supporting us in finding those guilty of this outrageous act. They also indicated their total support in relation to helping those who had been injured and the families and friends who were still looking for missing ones.
A significant outcome of our visit was the establishment of a joint investigative and intelligence team to investigate the bombing. The Commissioner of the AFP and the Director-General of ASIO have remained in Indonesia to finalise arrangements to ensure that the very best of Australian and Indonesian expertise is applied to this crucial task. We will hold discussions with other countries affected by the incident about contributions that they can make to this investigative team. The agreement has been made possible under the auspices of the Memorandum of Understanding on Combating International Terrorism signed by President Megawati and Prime Minister Howard earlier this year. The joint investigative and intelligence team will build on existing cooperative efforts with Indonesian authorities that have seen 45 Australian Federal Police and other state and territory officers undertake investigative work and, importantly, victim identification work in Bali. 
As the Senate would be aware, within 24 hours Australian law enforcement officers were in Bali to assist the victims of this brutal, unjustified mass murder and to provide assistance to the Indonesian police in their investigation. It is important to remember that this outrageous crime was committed on Indonesian soil. Consequently, Indonesian authorities are responsible for the investigation of this atrocity. The AFP continues to work closely with Indonesian authorities in assisting them with the criminal investigation. I can inform the Senate that we have now a team of police personnel in Bali assisting the Indonesian police with this investigation and that the group currently includes forensic specialists, crime scene investigation officers, search and rescue, specialist victim identification officers, post bomb blast investigators, intelligence officers, general investigators and support staff. The composition of the team is necessarily varied as the task is extremely complex.
Understandably, family and friends are seeking detailed information on the progress of the investigation but, as with many other criminal investigations, to discuss operational detail is not only inappropriate but dangerous, particularly during an investigation of this nature. Likewise, there will be much speculation in the public arena over likely arrests and other issues relating to the investigation. I expect that will continue but, as I have said, to comment on such speculation is detrimental to the investigation. Suffice it to say that during an investigation of this scale hundreds of people will be interviewed, some likely more than once. To draw premature conclusions from the standard process does not assist investigators in pursuit of the truth. Overseas experience has shown that an investigation of this magnitude will not be concluded overnight. We fully expect that this investigation will take some time but we are in it for the long haul and we will not relent in our pursuit of those responsible for this crime.
It is anticipated that the total number of people returning from Bali and having contact with police will be in the thousands. Already, approximately 5,800 questionnaires distributed to returning passengers have been received. The vast amount of information obtained through this process is being collated in conjunction with many other sources of information. The number of inquiries resulting from this process will be extensive and will take time and resources to pursue. The Australian Federal Police is coordinating those inquiries and pursuing all possible leads. The Australian Federal Police is interviewing all those who were present at the scene of the bombings and obtaining items of clothing from them for examination, both in Bali and here in Australia. They are also obtaining and copying the many hundreds of photos and videos taken by tourists in Bali at the time, and those require close examination. In the meantime, the government urges those with information or material relevant to investigations of the Bali bombing to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000. This is a very important means of community assistance in gathering important investigation in relation to this inquiry.
I want to place on record the appreciation of the Commonwealth government in relation to those state and territory police officers who are also serving in Bali in relation to this matter and also to the assistance that we have from the state and territory police who have personnel at the Western Control Centre, which is overseeing this investigation.
The Prime Minister announced yesterday that the Australian government will offer a reward of up to $2 million to encourage the provision of information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible for the terrorist attack in Bali. The terms of offering the reward will be discussed with Indonesian authorities. The investigating authorities are currently focused on identifying victims and collecting and collating a vast quantity of information direct from the crime scene and witnesses. Inquiries are continuing with hospitals in relation to those Australians who returned with injuries. Physical evidence, including clothing, shrapnel and glass taken from those victims is being obtained for examination. This process also requires interviewing doctors and medical staff to ensure that evidentiary processes are followed.  
The focus of the AFP's initial contribution to the Indonesian police investigation into the bomb blasts at Kuta has been at the crime scene and with victim identification. Currently we have 25 AFP members involved in the disaster victim identification process on the ground. There are plans to send further specialists on the first available flights. My last information was that we are looking at another 19 officers who can assist in this regard. Disaster victim identification includes the procedures used to positively identify deceased victims of events such as those bomb blasts which occurred in Bali. Disaster victim identification is primarily the responsibility of the Indonesian authorities and they have appointed a DVI commander who has assumed responsibility for the oversight of this process and repatriation of bodies to Australia and other countries.
The Australian DVI team in Bali has been engaged by the Indonesian commander to assist in identification and crime scene examination processes. Specifically, six members are currently providing assistance with the mortuary. A number of members are also involved in obtaining information from victims' families in Bali, and members have also been assisting in the forensic examination of the bomb scene. In addition, the AFP is establishing a major incident room in Canberra with experts from around Australia to assist with disaster victim identification. This process is an extremely complex one which requires an extremely high level of identity certainty to exist before victims can be released to relatives. Whilst the reuniting of families and victims is a priority, it is essential that there be certainty in this process and that there be no mistakes.
The identification processes must comply with internationally recognised protocols which require positive scientific identification in addition to visual identification by a friend or relative. Unfortunately, but unavoidably, this process takes time, and when one has regard to the injuries and the state of bodies at the mortuary and other aspects this proves to be a very difficult task. We had the example of the Childers backpacker case where there was a fire and some 16 people perished. It was two weeks before those bodies could be released. I urge patience from all those concerned, but we can understand the anxiety of those people who are searching for loved ones who are missing and of those who want to be reunited with them.
I am pleased to advise the Senate that arrangements have been put in place to facilitate the painstaking process of identifying the deceased as quickly as possible by using the Commonwealth's CrimTrac initiative. Under the arrangements, families and relatives of Australians who are presumed killed or missing as a result of the explosion will be able to register missing persons through their state and territory police services. Telephone numbers have been established in each jurisdiction for this purpose. Police will then visit relatives and friends to collect DNA samples to be cross-matched by CrimTrac with DNA data being collected by experts in Bali. This process is one which we believe will provide certainty and which will provide a speedy as possible result in the circumstances.
This has been a great tragedy for not only Australia but also many other countries. On this visit both Mr Downer and I impressed upon Indonesia that we wanted to work closely with that country—and I must say we received the same message in return. We indicated to them that this was as much an attack on Indonesia as on Australia. One only has to see the devastation and impact that this has caused in Bali to realise that. Tragically, this has occurred in a place which many Australians have happy memories of. It has been very much a happy destination over many years for many Australians. That has added to the tragedy of this. There will be an effect felt by the Balinese people, who have been such good friends to Australia. That impact will be felt personally not only through the loss of life but also, unfortunately, through economic aspects.
Again, I want to place on record our thanks to those outstanding volunteers who assisted the work of those consular officials and Defence and emergency personnel who are doing such a great job. I want to acknowledge the great work being done by the Australian Federal Police and other members of police forces from around Australia who are there—expert officers who are assisting in this. I want to acknowledge the cooperation of the Indonesian authorities. I also want to place on record this government's commitment and the commitment of all Australians who want to see those responsible for this outrageous act brought to justice.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-10-17,"—My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Hill. Minister, I refer to the Prime Minister's statement yesterday that he has requested the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security to undertake a review of what information Commonwealth agencies had available to them relating to the Bali bombings. Can I ask what the expected time frame is of Mr Blick's review and whether the minister can provide the Senate with its terms of reference. Will Mr Blick be investigating and reporting on both the nature and the timing of information received as well as what actions resulted from the receipt of that information? Given the clear public interest in this issue, I also ask whether the Inspector-General will be providing a report on this investigation to the parliament, as he did recently in regard to the allegations involving the Defence Signals Directorate.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Indonesia: Terrorist Attacks</title>,Questions Without Notice,25,1,question
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2002-10-17,"—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I appreciate, as I am sure do all senators, that the Prime Minister is in transit to Bali, but I would ask the minister whether he could respond before the Senate adjourns this evening with some of the detailed elements of this question. Minister, given the nature of your answer and the comments that the inspector-general's operation is dealing with security and intelligence agencies, can I also ask on this occasion whether the inspector-general will be authorised to seek information from other agencies such as the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade—in particular, the consular affairs area.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Indonesia: Terrorist Attacks</title>,Questions Without Notice,25,1,question
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2002-10-17,"—I will have to refer parts of the question to the Prime Minister, but in particular I will seek for Senator Faulkner the terms of reference. As I understand it, it is basically open-ended—we will allow Mr Blick to conduct his task without restraints of strict terms of reference. He is to look at the intelligence flow to gauge whether appropriate responses were made. He has the opportunity to look at the source material, the assessments that were based upon the source material, the action that was then taken on, say, travel advice et cetera in relation to the assessments; and to report to the Prime Minister on the outcome. Obviously, the Prime Minister has in mind the issue of ensuring that the intelligence system is working effectively in mind of the future rather than simply an assessment of the past. In other words, it is important in these sad circumstances to realise that the terrorist threat remains, and if there is anything that can be learnt from the experience in terms of intelligence, or lack of intelligence, then we would want that opportunity.
In relation to a report to the parliament, I would envisage that the Prime Minister would be reporting to the parliament and providing as much as Mr Blick's report as he can. Obviously, some parts he may not be able to provide because of the content, but it is important that the Prime Minister does that to the extent that it gives the public confidence in the process that he has adopted. Otherwise, I will see whether the Prime Minister can add further to what I have provided.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Indonesia: Terrorist Attacks</title>,Questions Without Notice,25,1,answer
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2002-10-17,"—Again, I do not have specific advice on that matter, but I would envisage that Mr Blick does. In other words, for his inquiries to be as useful as possible, it seems to me that he would need to cast the net to include the users of the information that is provided. Intelligence is only of value in terms of its use. In looking at lessons that might be learned from this experience, how agencies have used that information seems to me to be important. In relation to how promptly I can provide the information that Senator Faulkner is seeking, I will refer that to the Prime Minister's office and see if there is anything I can table today.

I think Senator Ellison has brought us up to date on the processes that are being adopted for the earliest possible identification and repatriation. The mortuary is now well staffed and includes people whose specialisation is in dealing with disasters of this type.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,2002-10-17,"—I would like to add to an answer I gave earlier to Senator Evans in relation to travel advice. I would like to advise him and the Senate that Mr Downer has today announced a decision to further upgrade our travel advice for Indonesia. The decision was taken on the basis of disturbing new information of generic threats to Australians and Australian interests in Indonesia. As I said, we have been recommending since the Bali atrocity that Australians defer all non-essential travel to Indonesia. We now recommend that all Australians in Indonesia who are concerned about their security should consider departure. In particular, short-term visitors whose presence in Indonesia is non-essential should depart. We urge Australians to exercise extreme caution, particularly in commercial and public areas known to be frequented by foreigners, such as clubs, restaurants, bars, schools, places of worship, outdoor recreation events and tourist areas. The government also strongly advises Australians in Indonesia to monitor carefully developments that might affect their safety. As I indicated to Senator Evans, the government is also revising travel advice notices for a range of other South-East Asian countries to highlight the need for vigilance, given the ongoing risk of terrorist activity.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Indonesia: Terrorist Attacks</title>,Questions Without Notice,28,1,speech
"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2002-10-17,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (Senator Alston) to a question without notice asked by Senator Mackay today relating to Telstra and the use of sealant gel to weatherproof cables.
Senator Alston's description of the reason why the gel had ceased to be used in March 2001—that it had come to the end of its life cycle—was extraordinarily euphemistic. The reality is that this gel is destroying Telstra cables all over Australia. So talking about it coming to the end of its life cycle is somewhat disingenuous. The other thing he said which I thought was interesting is that it is going to cost only $75 million over the next five years to fix. He does not regard that as much money. But Roger Bamber, the New South Wales Managing Director of CountryWide, has confirmed that $187 million has already been set aside. So who is right—the minister talking about $75 million over five years or Mr Bamber, CountryWide, New South Wales, talking about $187 million?
The people who actually work on the network are advising us that there are four to five billion cable joints in the network across Australia and that each one is going to cost around $50 to fix. That is a lot of money. I notice that my colleague Senator McLucas asked, in the Australian, for full disclosure in relation to where these faults are and how much this is going to cost—and well may she, because she comes from Cairns. It rains a lot in Cairns and the problem is that next time it rains a lot in Cairns there is an imminent danger of the network falling apart. Along with my colleague Senator McLucas, I exhort the government to provide us with all the information in relation to this. 
We have already had major discrepancies. We have already had an indication that the government is in total denial in relation to this issue. We have already had evidence that, as a bandaid measure, Telstra technicians are being forced to use plastic bags to try and stop the cables from becoming totally waterlogged and unusable. Mr Deputy President Hogg, you come from a state where it rains a lot and you will have problems. The reality is that this is a disaster waiting to happen and it is not the only one. There are many more which we will reveal and which I think will be revealed by the Estens inquiry and our Senate inquiry as the months progress. 
The reality is that more than 40,000 jobs have been lost from Telstra since 1997. This gel was never tested. That is the problem. The people who used to test products like this have been made redundant. I noticed with interest in the media that the only reason this gel started to be used in the first place was because John Anderson's phone in Gunnedah kept breaking down. It broke down six to seven times, so John Anderson—
—Minister Anderson!
—Minister Anderson put in a call to his mate Minister Alston, who put in a call to his mates at Telstra and all of a sudden this gel appears all over Australia— this gel that actually ends up corroding the network. It is Monty Pythonesque. Then we had the spectacle of poor old Telstra technicians going out pouring out this gel that is in fact corroding the very cables that it is supposed to fix—and they were directed by Telstra not to tell customers what they were doing. In fact one technician was hauled over the coals for explaining that this was a safety measure in terms of waterproofing the cables. This is positively Orwellian. Not only are the circumstances Monty Pythonesque, but the whole thing is Orwellian in terms of its implications. Telstra and the government are in denial. All they want to do is to try and get through the next few months so that they can try and convince the poor old doormats over there in the National Party to say yes to the sale of Telstra, because they have got their mate Dick Estens—a well-known National Party member—chairing the inquiry. But we have our own inquiry, don't we, Senator Lundy? 
—We do indeed.
—That is the Senate inquiry. We had our first hearing last Friday and it was most illuminating. I say to the government that it will be the first of many. People are desperate to come and talk to us in relation to this. We got so much information on one day that I think we have enough for about five question times. So good luck with your PR campaign in terms of selling Telstra, because I do not think you are going to convince one person.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Telstra: Telecommunications Infrastructure</title>,Questions Without Notice,29,1,speech
"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,2002-10-17,"—Having listened to Senator Mackay at length, one could be forgiven for thinking that there was no drought in Australia, because it rains a lot everywhere that she talked about. It rains a lot in Cairns, and she mentioned also that it rains all the time in your area too, Senator Hogg. I do not know too many places in Australia right now where it is raining all the time. As a matter of fact, most of the people that I know are affected by serious drought, so I imagine that the sealant joints in most of those areas are quite safe for a considerable time to come, not that Senator Mackay would be very concerned about the drought that is occurring. It rains in Tasmania every now and then.
We all know, and the government recognises, that access to quality communication services is an important issue for all Australians. It is an important issue for every one of us throughout the whole of the country and, having served on a telecommunications inquiry almost seven years ago, which was called `Telecommunications towards the year 2000', I could tell Senator Mackay—if she were willing to stay—that the state of the infrastructure and the services available to Australians in 1995, when Telstra was wholly government owned, was absolutely appalling. Those in regional and rural Australia in many places could not even access a fax machine. That is what the services were like under a fully government owned Telstra. What have we seen since Telstra has been part-privatised and since it has been asked to act as a corporate business?
—Nothing.
—We have seen nothing, Senator Lundy? Obviously you are too young to have made a telephone call internationally some 20 years ago when, instead of it costing you $5 for half an hour, it used to cost about $3 a minute. But then again, you would be too young to remember those times when Telstra was fully owned by the government. The enormous advances that have been made in Telstra over the past six or seven years cannot be overstated. We have seen the introduction of a far superior infrastructure, even through my area, which is some 170 or 180 kilometres from a metropolitan area. Do not try and tell me, Senator Lundy—or as Senator Mackay would if she were still here—that, because of this `terrible' part-privatisation of Telstra, services have been run down and are not what they used to be, because in fact services are better. I happen to live in one of these places. Services are far better now than they ever were even five years ago. If you took the trouble, Senator Lundy, to move out into the Australian bush, you would actually find out for yourself that services are a lot better. 
To absolutely make sure that quality communication services are available, the government has implemented regulatory safeguards such as the customer service guarantee. The customer service guarantee and the proposed network reliability framework should give comfort to all Australians who are looking for communication services. Senator Lundy may come with all of her modern ideas about the state of services provided by Telstra. If only she could go back a few years, she would really understand. I am old enough to remember party lines. Things have come a long way since then. The telecommunications network was fully government owned at that stage. Under the customer service guarantee, as Senator Lundy is well aware, telephone companies must connect or repair services within a specific time frame, or provide an interim service or pay compensation. It must be done and it is done.  
The NRF, which is going to be introduced on 31 December this year, will bring a new level of monitoring, reporting and, importantly, pre-emptive action and remediation at a network and individual service level. It is all right to come in here crying wolf about what might happen in the event of the sealant not working on some joints in the network around Australia; I think 45 billion joints was the number that was quoted by Senator Mackay. She said that a map ought to be provided of where all these joints were. It would be some map, I can tell you! But Telstra have advised in recent times that the gel continues to be effective on 97 per cent of those joints and the issues relating to the remaining three per cent are already being addressed. Senator Mackay comes in here and cries wolf, all because of her philosophical objection to any further sale of any part of Telstra, when in fact Telstra is currently more than 50 per cent government owned and the faults that she finds in Telstra are occurring while the government still owns a majority of Telstra.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2002-10-17,"—It is my great pleasure to be able to reflect on some of the comments just made by Senator Ferguson. I am very pleased that he raised the issue of quality telecommunications services. He claims that Telstra just keep getting better and better. Hello! Ask a few people out in rural and regional Australia. Ask a few people in outer metropolitan Australia who are struggling to get a decent connection. I would put it to the Senate that Senator Ferguson is too old to understand that people do not just want to use the telephone network for voice calls and for telephony; they want to use the network for Internet connections. This might be a concept that Senator Ferguson is completely unfamiliar with because of his old age—
—Mr Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I will not claim that it is a reflection, but I would remind Senator Lundy that you are never too old to learn but sometimes you are too young to remember.
—You have no point of order, Senator Ferguson.
—That was a very flippant attempt to interject, Senator Ferguson. I put it to you that people want to use this network now for purposes other than a mere voice call. They actually want to use it for some of the more sophisticated services like connecting to the Internet for the transfer of data. What has happened is that, since partial privatisation, Telstra have decided that they are not going to spend very much money at all on their network. They are going to pretend that they are a modern telecommunications company. They are going to pretend, with the help of the minister—who is their chief promoter in the chamber and certainly in public—that they are somehow preparing for the future. The evidence heard at the Senate inquiry and the evidence coming forth to estimates and other inquiries is clearly the opposite. Telstra are not future-proofing their network; they are going backwards at 100 miles an hour. Why? Because they do not want to spend money. They want to fatten up their bottom line in preparation for further privatisation.
This does not serve the interests of Australians. What Australians want is a quality, affordable telecommunications system that provides for their needs in the future and that provides adequate Internet connections, fast enough to make the transfer of data meaningful. What we have here is a government dead set on promoting a Telstra that has been moving backwards at 100 miles an hour. Is it any wonder that we find this incredible situation, where Telstra are effectively using what can only be described as dodgy products to try and make their existing network withstand the pressure of wear and tear—I would suggest standard wear and tear—on what is an ageing network. They are using gel that does not work. They forgot to test it. Why? Because they sacked all the people who were supposed to do that kind of work. They have outsourced a lot of this maintenance to NTL and others, and it is no wonder that Australians are now facing a situation where one good shower of rain, as happened in Albion Park recently, can knock out the network— not just for an hour or two hours but for days, and in this case for over a week. That is because they have pared back the maintenance required on an ageing network. By definition it will need more maintenance as it gets older, while ever it is not replaced, and now the network starts falling over. It is very interesting to see that this issue of sealing the can of gel has emerged now. I make this prediction: as time goes on, issue after issue will be put on the table that will demonstrate Telstra's negligence when it comes to the appropriate and adequate maintenance of our telecommunications system. 
Where does that leave Australians, whether they live in the bush or anywhere else? It leaves them with a degraded service. It means they have a system that does not even provide for basic services these days— take note, Senator Ferguson—for Internet connections. Over a million people in Australia cannot even get some of the faster broadband services like ADSL. Why? Because Telstra put in cost cutting technology designed to save them money while they were fattening up the bottom line in preparation for privatisation. This is not where this country needs to go. We need to be installing infrastructure, and we need to be building infrastructure that is actually going to serve our future social, economic and cultural needs. That is not what this coalition is doing and that is not what Telstra are doing. It will never happen while ever they are pursuing the further privatisation of Telstra in this country.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Telstra: Telecommunications Infrastructure</title>,Questions Without Notice,29,1,speech
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2002-10-17,"—Senator Lundy, you must never have heard of Networking the Nation or the Internet Assistance Program operating in Australia to improve regional telecommunications. I am surprised, because you purport to be someone with a great interest in issues related to telecommunications. Networking the Nation has been an extremely successful program which has greatly enhanced regional telecommunications. The Internet Assistance Program, now operating across the whole of Australia, works to provide advice and support and to increase speeds, where necessary, for users of dial-up Internet services. We, as you know, let a special contract of $150 million to provide Internet data and fast fax access for people in the most remote areas of Australia—a satellite provided service that is the envy of the rest of the world. It is a little unfair, perhaps very unfair, of you to be so critical of a great company which is doing so much for regional Australia, Senator Lundy. It has responded to the outcomes of the Besley report. Telephone services are now installed and repaired. Senator Lundy, please do not go—we would rather you remain to hear the rest of this.
Most of the Besley report findings have been addressed with great effect. Regional telecommunications have greatly improved since the Besley committee went around Australia and took evidence on the level of telecommunications services. To suggest, as Senator Lundy has done, that the company is running down services and not spending money just to fatten up the bottom line so that it will look more attractive as a saleable proposition is just absolute nonsense when one considers how much money has been spent on programs like Networking the Nation and, as I said, the special $150 million program to improve telecommunications in the most remote parts of Australia.
Telstra has also improved mobile phone coverage for around 200 towns around Australia. For example, in Western Australia we have had the Wireless West program which has meant that CDMA has been extended throughout the south-west of Western Australia. Now many of the wheat belt towns which had no access to mobile phone coverage have mobile phone coverage. We have improved mobile phone coverage along the major highways of this country. That is a great improvement in telecommunications services which simply cannot be denied. We are providing a satellite mobile phone handset subsidy of up to $1,100 a unit, and this means that people living in the most absolutely remote areas of Australia can have access to a phone service wherever they are. For example, if Senator Lundy ever decides one July to take a holiday in Western Australia and go down the Canning Stock Route, she will have access—she is back—with the use of a satellite handset. They are just examples of the way in which Telstra has really worked to improve telecommunications around this country since the Besley report was brought down. 
Senator Mackay somewhat cynically referred to the new committee inquiring into telecommunications—the Estens committee—which will report quite soon on the current status of telecommunications in Australia. Mr Estens and his committee are all from regional Australia. They are people who are quite genuine consumers of telecommunications services in the regions. I can say with very little doubt of being wrong that they will report that telecommunications services in Australia have greatly improved and have been significantly enhanced since the time of the Besley report. Telstra will, as the Prime Minister said, be in a position to be sold because— (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Telstra: Telecommunications Infrastructure</title>,Questions Without Notice,29,1,speech
"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2002-10-17,"—I rise to speak on the motion to take note of an answer given by Senator Alston, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, to a question asked by Senator Mackay in relation to this Telstra cabling bungle. In South Australia, as in many communities around Australia, constituents are experiencing already increasing difficulties in the adequacy and reliability of their local telecommunications services. A new blow has come to consumers in the form of these recent revelations of a time bomb in the form of the gel sealant that has been used to patch up, as Senator Lundy was saying, Telstra's already ageing cable network. This 3M gel has been used throughout Telstra's network to seal cable joins in order to weatherproof them. It has been in use since 1997 and cost a staggering $500 million to install. As we have heard, far from protecting the cable, this product in fact erodes and even splits it causing serious faults and outages. Despite early warnings from Telstra workers about this gel causing widespread corrosion of phone wires, the sealant continued to be used until last November. It has also emerged, as we have heard, that there was no extensive testing of the gel done before pouring it onto cables. The reason for this, as Senators Mackay and Lundy pointed out, is staff cuts at Telstra.
The use of the sealant has resulted, as we have heard, in the potential disruption of millions of phone lines around the country, most notably in areas where there is high rainfall. This has all come to light just 10 weeks away from the start of the wet season. There is now such an enormous backlog of work in fixing these problems that Telstra workers have had to resort to using plastic shopping bags to cover cable joints as a temporary measure to protect the lines against the weather. It will cost many millions of dollars to rectify the problems caused by the use of the sealant throughout the Telstra network. Telstra has confirmed that $187 million has already been set aside to fix the problem.
Consumers of Telstra want to know why this has come about. The only answer we can give them is that it has come about because we have had a deterioration in the amount of Telstra's capital resources now being dedicated to reinvestment in the actual infrastructure and the service. Yet the government, in complicity with Telstra management, continues to increase line rentals to try to claw back revenue. Since the federal election in November last year we have witnessed massive increases in line rentals—in the order of $2 to $3 per month in the month of August alone. There is said to be an objective to further increase line rentals to about $30 per month over the next few years. This would mean an increase from $11 per month, which is what the rental was only one or two years ago, to $30. That is a staggering 200 per cent increase in line rental. Whilst this increase may not matter that much to Minister Alston and his colleagues on the other side of the chamber, for a lot of people across Australia those few extra dollars per month really do matter. 
Why is all of this occurring? It is occurring because it seems that the government, in conjunction with Telstra management, as Senator Lundy pointed out, is intent on fattening Telstra's bottom line with the prospect of privatisation down the road. This is what it is all about. The proposed quid pro quo for Telstra consumers was the government's suggestion that local call costs would fall, and of course they have not been delivered. Telstra's own ambition seems to be not to provide core telecommunications services anymore but instead to become a huge telco media player. My colleagues and I on this side want to see Telstra concentrate on its core business. I do not want to continue to have my metropolitan, regional and rural South Australian constituents coming to me with very basic problems about their dealings with Telstra. It is time that Telstra attended to its core business. It is time Telstra dealt with the average needs of telecommunication consumers. That is its core business, that is why it is in business; and that is why the Australian public have invested so heavily in the business. (Time expired)

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2002-10-17,"— by leave—Yesterday there was a debate in the chamber. I appreciate that as the Minister for Justice and Customs was overseas he would not be familiar with that, but the matter arose in response to a letter from the Minister for Education, Science and Training which indicated that, in response to a Senate resolution of 28 August, the government was unable to provide a response to the report entitled Universities in crisis because the matter was with the printer and was being printed. This is a most unorthodox explanation for the failure of a government to respond to a report that, as I understand it, it has had for 13 months now. It is a considerable period of time. I understand that the report was presented to the minister in February or perhaps March this year from the department. I also understand that the matter has been with the Prime Minister since June. We were told yesterday that the government response cannot be tabled because it is at the printers. It strikes me that it would be appropriate if we could inquire of the minister how long the document is likely to stay at the printers, given that it has now taken many months.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2002-10-17,"—The Space Activities Amendment Bill 2002 is designed to support Australia's space industry. It does this by capping at $750 million the amount of insurance required to be provided by the proponents of each space launch. It also provides for the Commonwealth to accept liability for third party Australian nationals above this $750 million for up to $3 billion. As it stands, the Commonwealth is already liable under United Nations conventions for damages to third party foreign nationals, so it is fitting that Australians are to be similarly protected under this bill.
This bill also strengthens the safety test being applied to commercial applicants. The existing legislation provides for a test of risk that is sufficiently low, whereas this amendment makes for the provision of a test of risk that is as low as is reasonably practicable. The bill also provides for a more practical application and assessment process and a lower fee regime for scientific and educational organisations. The government's reasoning behind this is as follows. Activities undertaken by scientific and educational organisations are usually on a one-off basis and do not involve the construction of major infrastructure. It is reasonable that these organisations are subjected to a modified and more suitable licensing regime. It is hard to argue with that. Finally, the bill contains a number of small administrative and technical amendments intended, I am assured, to improve the operation and efficiency of the act. As my colleague in the House of Representatives Dr Emerson stated when this bill was before him, Labor sees no compelling reason to oppose this bill. In fact, if it facilitates innovation and growth of the space industry, it is a positive sign.
We are aware of the proposed amendments that are to be moved by Senator Bartlett of the Australian Democrats. However, Labor will not be supporting these amendments. The Democrats say that some of these amendments are designed to further improve the safety of space launches, but the measures they propose to enact through these amendments appear to be over the top. Labor has been assured that there are suitable measures in place in this bill both to address safety concerns and to cover the liability in relation to such launches. Arguably, the further regulation of space launches entailed in these amendments could unduly impede the operation of our space industry.
The bill reminds me of another space related event that occurred last year. In June of 2001 the then Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, Senator Minchin, announced the government's intention to provide up to $100 million to facilitate the building of a space port on Christmas Island. Quite obviously, the government was keen to support and, indeed, to subsidise an industry which it felt would be of great benefit to Australia. That is why I am quite hopeful that the government will realise the massive potential to Australia of another industry: the information and communications or ICT industry. Australia possesses within its shores some of the best and most innovative ICT small and medium sized businesses in the world. Some of Australia's small to medium sized software developers are particularly strong. Unfortunately—and this is actually a problem— we have many Australian owned SMEs in the ICT industry but few if any large, homegrown enterprises. This is a problem that the government needs to address when it makes policies.
The fact is that although Australians have a reputation for being very big consumers of information and communication technology—in fact many key sectors of our economy, such as manufacturing and education, require this technology to remain competitive—the Australian market for ICT products and services is comparatively small when you look at other markets around the world. Therefore, if our small to medium sized ICT firms are to grow into big firms such as the kind we are used to seeing come out of the United States, they need to be globally orientated—they need to be exporters and they need to be building their size and capacity and thinking and acting globally. This is obviously easier said than done, especially with the coalition government doing very little to support these opportunities for significant growth. The coalition appears to be quite happy to help establish Australia's fledgling space industry—certainly something Labor does not object to—but it does not do much to help these small to medium ICT businesses become medium and large sized ICT businesses that are globally competitive. 
All this government needs to do to promote Australia's ICT industry is to consider how it spends the information technology dollar and look to its own backyard. This is obviously a crucial element of a range of complex policies that are necessary to promote worthy and deserving industries like ICT. On 13 August this year the Australian Financial Review reported that the federal government would spend around $14.6 billion on ICT. I am not sure if it is quite this amount, but I think it is fair to say that it is a very significant expenditure of taxpayers' money. The question is, how much of this money will be spent on Australia's SMEs and how much will go to the same old multinationals, bypassing local businesses at the expense of local sustainable jobs and further blowing out the ICT trade deficit—in other words, creating greater demand for imports of ICT goods and services without supporting companies that could in turn offset that trade deficit by building their own exports.
If past policy is any guide, the answer is not too good. The conscious policy of the coalition has been to favour large foreign owned multinationals over Australia's innovative IT SMEs. This has been, and still is, a disgrace. The coalition like to deny this and make out that they are doing something about it. I note that they have even put together a working group to try to do something about it. However, they have not changed the situation. They are constructing tender processes that they say are improving the situation facing ICT SMEs, but these tender processes continue to discriminate against and make it much harder for Australian SMEs in the following ways. Some of them—and I have seen advertisements to this effect—give only five days for businesses to respond to a tender request. For a very large company with the human resources to redirect and devote to such an exercise, it may be possible. For a small SME with specific expertise, this constitutes a very tangible barrier to participating in that tender. There is also the requirement of onerous and unreasonable professional indemnity commitments, even to an extent that might exceed the requirements of the project.
I have certainly had representations suggesting that, far from streamlining tender processes, employing an endorsed supplier agreement scheme has made it more burdensome for SMEs to participate in tendering for government work. For the many small ICT businesses I have spoken to, these are just some of the barriers they face to competing for, and winning, government tenders. It is often when they are successful as a subcontractor to a multinational that they are handed just enough business to keep their wheels turning, but that gives them very little ability to make the necessary investments in research and development and to keep globally competitive and active in growing their export markets. Many SMEs have told me that they will not bother going through the process of tendering for government work at all. This is a very disturbing situation because, as I have previously stated in this place, some 40 per cent of expenditure on information and communication technologies in this country is in the government market. It is a very important market for these companies.
It is worth while looking for a minute at the coalition's latest efforts to give the appearance that they are interested in helping the ICT sector, published in a press release entitled `Commonwealth Government ICT Procurement and Strategic Industry Development—New Guidelines for Suppliers'. The media statement tells us that the coalition assumes that locally based branches of multinationals equate to local firms. It tells us that local ICT industry development is whatever crumbs these same multinationals that win the juiciest prime contracts choose to toss to Australian SMEs. It tells us that the coalition's guidelines designed to assist Australian industry only apply to contracts over $20 million, thus excluding a great deal of government business. It also tells us that the minimum SME participation requirements are themselves merely trifles—10 per cent of hardware supplies and 20 per cent of services. Finally, the statement adds the following proviso: 
These requirements will be administered flexibly to ensure that tenderers and agencies are not unjustifiably disadvantaged.
So these trifling guidelines, with all their flaws, are not even mandatory. The government or multinational contract winner may be `flexible' if they consider themselves to be disadvantaged.
I remind the Senate that these companies do not want special favours. The domestic ICT sector is incredibly innovative and competitive. These companies are ready, willing and able to fight for work and build their own capability, obviously in their own interests as companies but also in the interests of Australia's long-term economic outlook. They need fair treatment by this government. However, such a straightforward, meaningful and logical approach has so far eluded the coalition, leaving many people in Australia's ICT sector to wonder what the space industry has that they do not. Obviously software is not as exciting as rockets. In the meantime, as I said, Labor do not oppose the attention that this government is paying to the space industry and we will be supporting this bill.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2002-10-17,"—I am always keen to have science issues, and particularly the issue of space, debated in this parliament. For some of us here, it seems like only yesterday that the Space Activities Act was introduced and debated in this place, and I think there are still some issues hanging over from that original debate. Certainly, in some of my amendments on behalf of the Australian Democrats I will reintroduce some changes that I attempted to make when the original legislation was debated and passed in this place.
There are two provisions in the Space Activities Amendment Bill 2002 that are of concern to the Australian Democrats. These are insurance liability provisions. Most of the other amendments the bill makes to the Space Activities Act are relatively minor and technical. The most important of those are the definition of `space' and the tightening of some of the safety standards in the licence application process. There are also a number of issues that this bill raises which are not directly part of the bill but are fundamental to the bill's purpose. These issues have not been addressed through the parliamentary processes thus far.
The first of the two areas of concern is item 31, amending section 48(3). The amendment provides that the company may cap its liability insurance at $750 million. The second area of concern is item 53, which amends the current section 69. This provision provides that the Commonwealth is liable to pay compensation to Australian nationals for damage caused by space activities beyond that covered by insurance set out in section 48 of up to $3 billion. The act does not require that the company bear the entire liability insurance burden and specifically envisages some Commonwealth coverage, although it does not require such coverage, does not indicate how extensive that coverage should be and does not provide any method for apportioning liability exposure between the government and the private company.
As the opposition have pointed out in their second reading debate contributions in the House of Representatives, capping the liability insurance requirements of a private company and providing government guarantees for liability beyond that amount is all very kind, and certainly something the Democrats have pointed out too, but why isn't the same generosity occurring with, for example, sporting clubs or non-government organisations that are facing massive increases in their liability exposure and do not have the capacity to meet those premiums? One answer is that if the government does not indemnify private operators then the cost of space launches will become prohibitive. So there may be a case for government support for the development of an Australian space industry, but it is a case that the government has not made effectively. Indemnification, just like subsidies and grants, should occur in a policy context that is committed to an Australian space industry. 
A second answer could be that every other country with a space program does it, but the Democrats do not consider that really to be an argument at all. We are after world's best practice, obviously, with the regulations and the legislative regime that we produce in this country, especially when we are talking about enhancing and developing our own space industry. Perhaps the final answer will be that the actual risk to the government of ever having to pay anything out is minuscule. That is certainly an argument that we have heard. Is this the criteria, then, for government providing this kind of assistance, or is it that space launching is very big business, representing multinational investment, and the government does not want to jeopardise this industry's development and will therefore foot a significant part of this potential bill?
Do not get me wrong, I find space and space activities to be an extraordinary and exciting area and one that we should be supporting. But I think these issues deserve debate and due consideration, especially when we are talking about taxpayers' dollars and looking at it in a financial context, let alone looking at the issues of the significance of what can happen if things should go wrong. The government has capped not only private liability but its own. It is pretty clear that, although this is a generic bill, this provision is primarily in response to concerns expressed regarding the Christmas Island space base.
To a lesser degree, these concerns also apply to Woomera, in my home state of South Australia. The WA government and the oil industry have indicated that they believe the potential liability risk in relation to launches from Christmas Island could be as high as $25 billion. The government has indicated that it believes the risk to be so low that there is no need to seek coverage to such an amount. On the other hand, it could be argued, of course, that if the risk is so low then why doesn't the government assume an unlimited liability, as most other countries do? After all, the Christmas Island space base is, with Russia, being promoted, facilitated and negotiated by this government. Why won't the government therefore take full responsibility for the risks involved? Who will bear the costs if there is a catastrophic incident— for example, an accident involving offshore oil rigs? Who will bear the cost if gas supplies to Perth are cut—a scenario that both the oil industry and the WA government have raised?
In relation to technology transfer, because obviously this is a significant debate surrounding this legislation and Christmas Island in particular, part of the justification by the Commonwealth for entering into the rocket launch business was the prospect of Australia developing its own space industry. In order for that to happen, there must be agreements with other countries involved in the space industry in Australia that ensure that there will be technology transfer. We want to ensure that transfer of technology to Australia. It is not enough that we are simply a launch pad for other countries. In August last year, when these changes were being introduced and this was being debated for the first time, former Senator Schacht made the following statement regarding the technology transfer:
Two of the four projects envisage the use of Russian launch technology. However, the sensitive and dual use nature of the technology requires agreement between governments to facilitate its release and to ensure control of access. Without a bilateral agreement, the Russian government would not transfer the technology and expertise to Australia, blocking the development of the two space launch projects which are based on Russian systems and depriving Australia of an opportunity to capture a share of the lucrative global satellite market.
The agreement between Australia and the Russian Federation, which, as I have said, was signed on 23 May 2001, provides a legal and organisational framework for the transfer of space technologies, equipment and expertise to the Australian commercial space launch industry. We should all welcome this as we will see the transfer of space technologies from Russia, which has a well-proven record in space technology.
That makes us wonder about media reports, such as the one in April this year, that the Russians were:
... worried about Australia's insistence that customs officials have the right to examine all incoming material ... 
That was a wire story from 15 April 2002. This impediment appears to have been overcome by the time the minister went to Russia. But it is patently clear that an agreement ensuring real technology transfer is a long way off, because if we are having difficulty agreeing on fairly standard inspections—the kinds of inspection regimes you would assume would happen—how far away is an agreement that allows Australian access to Russian rocket technology?
At a recent conference on space, held just over a month ago I think, it was reported to the Australian Democrats that Australia and Russia were negotiating yet another agreement regarding the transfer of technology. So it appears we are going to have multiple agreements but no technology. I hope that, perhaps in the committee stage of this bill, the minister can outline the progress that has been made to date and provide some specifics on that. Of course, in a fashion, this has become one of the hallmarks, unfortunately, of this government—the push for legislation, for approval and for regulation, all of which facilitate, support and even fund projects— while there are a number of fundamental matters that remain unresolved.
We have seen the same problems with, for example, the nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights. The Australian Democrats have just received clarification of answers provided to Democrat questions during the estimates process in June. As some senators may recall, we questioned the status of geotechnical studies that were being carried out at the Christmas Island space base—something I raised in previous debates on this issue in the chamber. At the time, the government made public statements that there was no problem with the location of the space pad and that this had been confirmed by the geotechnical work. Now we have received the following clarification:
Environment Australia has yet to receive sufficient information on structural stability.
Not only is this a case of not getting straightforward answers to questions but, as I recall, we were lampooned at the time but also told that we were incorrect in even raising these questions and these issues for debate. So we are not getting straightforward answers in relation to Australia's space industry—that is, everything from the stability of a proposed site to the status of the technology agreements. We are again finding that work that is critical to any prospect of the viability of a space industry has not been resolved. No-one should make the mistake of thinking that this is not fundamental, because these issues are fundamental. On Christmas Island, for example, we have been locked into a number of decisions, including significant financial commitments without the work being completed, that should have preceded those commitments being made.
While this bill, I acknowledge, is not exclusively about Christmas Island, it is important for us to step back and understand why the Australian government is committing money and resources, and legislation, for example, to a development when even the basic agreements regarding access to technology have not been resolved. It seems quite extraordinary. When the objective of entering into bilateral international agreements is not even likely to be met, why are we proceeding down this path? Perhaps the answer lies in French Guiana, the site of the proposed joint space venture between the French and the Russians. In an article in Space News on 22 July this year, which is thoroughly recommended reading, the Russian space agency commented:
Both projects are at a preliminary stage and we look at both of them with equal interest. We are not favouring one or the other. Financial aspects of projects like these are very important and the devil is in the detail.
The Australian minister claims that the agreement is 90 per cent complete. The Russians seem to have a very different view based on those comments and other feedback. One does not have to read this too closely to begin to understand what is actually happening. The Russians are looking for the best deal—and why not? They are playing off the French against the Australians. It is no surprise, then, that there has been no agreement on technology transfer. It is no surprise that the Australian government portrays the right to conduct customs inspections as a negotiating success. It is also no surprise that the Australian government has injected $100 million into this project and has pushed through the permits and the approvals. We are racing for the bottom. What a surprise this is! After all, Australia is giving, giving, giving when it comes to this arrangement but unfortunately it does not seem that we have anything to show for it. 
In July this year, the Russians were saying that they are not promising anything in particular but they are indicating that we are in fact only at the beginning of the process. So what next? What is required? How much more money? How many more approvals? What is the government's bottom line in order to ensure that we launch something from Christmas Island? But the race to the bottom has a context well beyond Christmas Island. The economic viability of the space industry at the moment is quite tenuous. Expenses are high, there is an oversupply of launch facilities and demand is dropping. That may well change, but in the short term we seem to be promoting an industry at the wrong time if Australia is going to reap the kinds of benefits that this government originally promised. 
I have already circulated amendments to four key areas of this bill. These amendments were tabled on 16 September, so members of the Senate have had adequate time to examine them. I have changed one after very worthy advice from the department—and I thank them for that—in relation to the definition of a toxic material. That amendment should be circulated shortly, I hope. One of the amendments being proposed by the Australian Democrats is designed to ensure that we finalise and undertake the negotiations relating to technology transfer. In those cases where we are entering into bilateral international agreements—that is, before we inject money into construction, before we give permits or finalise an impact assessment—an example of why this may be important is in relation to the insurance cap itself. Australia is effectively guaranteeing the safety of the Russian rockets and technology in assuming liability of up to $3 billion. We have heard the claim that the risk is minimal, so low as to be meaningless in fact, but if we do not have full access to inspect the rockets and the other materials how can we properly assess the risks that we are indemnifying?
This leads me to the second Democrats amendment. The government, with the support of the Productivity Commission, has claimed that this bill does not require a regulatory impact statement because it has no financial implications—that is the rationale. The $3 billion of exposure by the Commonwealth surely needs assessment, particularly in light of the broader debate of current insurance liability concerns. The Democrats accept that the risk is low, although I think in this modern world we wonder about risks, especially when we think of some of the things that we could never have imagined happening which clearly have not only human but economic consequences, such as the events at the World Trade Centre. But we have to accept that even low-risk activities are not no-risk activities.
A regulatory impact statement should look at the effect of a catastrophic event in economic and financial terms. That assessment is deserved. It does not mean the event will happen, of course, but as senators and legislators we have an obligation to understand all the potential consequences of the decisions we make and of the legislation that we pass. An incident could cost up to $25 billion, as has been given to us in estimates from the oil industry and the WA government. We need to find out what the impact of such a catastrophic event would be in terms of the financial stability and activities of the Commonwealth. Until we know that, we should not be passing this legislation; we should not be passing this bill. The Democrats amendment prevents this bill, if it should be passed—and clearly it will be, given the numbers in the Senate—from taking effect until the regulatory impact statement is prepared and tabled. So I hope that the opposition will consider that favourably. It means you can pass the bill but at least provide for a regulatory impact statement to be made under that legislation.
The third of the four Democrats amendments will further address the liability issue. It is an issue that I raised back in 1998 when we were originally debating this bill. As the act is currently written, the liability period is limited, as is the amount. The new liability under this amendment would cover the entire time from the launch until the time the object returns to the surface of the earth. The amendment proposes extending the launch period to cover the existing launch period as well as the time the object is in space and until the object begins a planned re-entry or an event which results in re-entry. Where there is no re-entry, such as when the object is sent out of the earth's orbit, like the Galileo probe for example, the launch period would be open-ended. 
Our final amendment, also derived from an issue I raised back in 1998, seeks to ensure that special assessment and approval provisions apply to launches that involve radioactive and toxic materials. Once again this is a matter of fully understanding and preparing for the risks involved in payloads and materials that are potentially hazardous. There is no doubt that space debris travelling, for example, at 15 kilometres a second represents a dangerous projectile, but those dangers are heightened considerably if there are radioactive or toxic materials present in the payload. It is hard to understand how a proper risk assessment can occur without this information being part of the decision making process.
These amendments are important if Australia's entry into the space industry is going to be best practice, not big business at any cost. We understand that the opposition supported this bill when it went through the House. However, in the time that has passed since then the evidence is mounting that the concerns that these amendments reflect have not been addressed. In fact, they have become more urgent. We urge the government and the opposition to support these measures that will ensure that Australia develops an independent and vibrant space industry.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2002-10-17,"—In considering the Space Activities Amendment Bill 2002 we are told that this piece of legislation aims to overcome a number of deficiencies that were contained in the Space Activities Act 1998 and clarify the operation of space launch sites within Australian jurisdiction. The main elements of the current bill being considered relate to the insurance and capping of liabilities, as referred to by Senator Stott Despoja, in regard to space launches with the Commonwealth also accepting some liability. The bill also includes changes to the risk minimisation test for launches. This change means the applicants for space licences must show that the risk of damage is as low as reasonably practicable. Finally, this bill amends section 8 of the Space Activities Act 1998 to define space as an area beyond 100 kilometres above mean sea level.
The operation of space launch activities is fast becoming a reality with the construction of the Asia Pacific Space Centre, or ASPC, launch facility on Christmas Island. We are told that the ASPC intends that its first launch will take place some time in late 2004. Although this legislation is designed to regulate space activities anywhere within Australian jurisdiction, the reality, I feel, is that the only potential launch site that is likely to be operating within the near future is that belonging to ASPC.
It is clear that the government's approach to ASPC has been to assist in the development of its facilities. The Commonwealth has supplied land and other infrastructure and signed an agreement with the government of Russia concerning the operations proposed by ASPC. All of this is being done for the benefit of Australia. We will enter into the commercial space market with the opening of the ASPC on Christmas Island. But what is this market worth to Australia? The total cost of the project is in the order of $800 million, with the government to receive some $1.5 billion in licence fees over 20 years. We are told that there will be some 300 to 400 jobs in the construction phase, with a total of 550 jobs once the facility is operating. One of the really interesting claims made is that all of this will lead to opportunities for Australians in high-tech jobs associated with the space industry. However, it has to be noted that of the 550 jobs referred to with the launch activities 300 will be Russian—although I do suspect there will be some jobs for Russian translators and in language instruction on Christmas Island as a result. But, as we can see, the majority of the jobs will actually be Russian. 
I have said before in this chamber that I am really concerned about the creation of jobs and, like Senator Lundy, I want to see new jobs created, especially at the high end of the employment sector. This facility has the potential to promise just such jobs. However, I think we have to take note of the following concerns: (1) how competitive would APSC be compared to other players in the market; (2) how large is that total market; (3) what are the risks to other sectors of the economy; and (4) will this project lead to benefits to Australia?
My first concern is that there are a number of issues that need to be addressed regarding the competitiveness of APSC. In fact, if you refer to APSC's submission to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee you notice that the company raises a number of concerns with the bill and how it will impact on its proposed activities. In relation to the amount of third party liability insurance, the bill sets down the second highest rate of required insurance at $US405 million. The European governments, who are also in the space market, only require the European Space Agency to have third party liability insurance to the level of $US53 million. In fact on page 8 of its submission APSC suggests:
... the liability cap be set at a level to support the Australian launch industry by being less than that of Australia's key competitors.
Now when you take into account the relative merits of the APSC operation and that of its main commercial competitor, the European Space Agency, the most significant factor is this one of third party liability insurance. In fact, APSC will be required to pay for insurance at eight times the level of its European competitor. So it could be said that this bill sets out to make Australian launch providers uncompetitive. So we have this situation where the Commonwealth government bent over backwards to assist APSC to get started and now this legislation is going to provide a significant competitive impediment to their operations.
The second concern I mentioned was about the size of the market. One of the factors we are told that works in favour of the APSC approach is that it will be able to launch larger satellites at less cost because of its location close to the equator. Based on APSC information, I understand the launch facility is designed to launch up to 10 vehicles per year. In recent years, however, there has been a dramatic shift in the number of launches undertaken by this industry. In 1999 there were some 70 launches worldwide. In 2000 there were some 80 launches worldwide. But in 2001 only 18 launches took place worldwide.
Obviously this market, like most others, is subject to dramatic fluctuations. In times of global slowdown it would seem that the number of space launches contracts. The other factor that has to be considered, in my view, is that not all launches are of a commercial nature. In any given year there are a number of staffed launches, for example the famous space shuttle and staffed Russian flights. There are also a number of non-commercial satellites placed in orbit each year that would also shrink the size of the market.
In fact, in 2001 we are talking about a marketplace that saw fewer than 10 commercial launches in total. So we have a market that even in boom times is not particularly large. This is a new space industry that is trying to attract new customers. And into this mix we have new legislation that will impose the second highest third party insurance overhead in the entire world.
It seems strange to me that we have the government wanting to encourage this industry to set up in Australia—to the extent that a considerable amount of money is spent on infrastructure and that special conditions are granted—but it then turns around and imposes such a high cost structure. APSC states that Australia will earn $1.5 billion over 20 years from licence fees and, as I have mentioned before, see 550 jobs created. I suspect, however, that this figure and these jobs are dependent on there being 10 launches per year. But maybe we have got this wrong. I think the operation of this bill will need to be closely monitored to ensure that we have not costed APSC out of the market before it even starts. 
The third concern I mentioned was the risk or cost to other sectors of the economy. I, along with all senators in this chamber, and particularly those from Western Australia, was pleased to hear the recent announcement of the natural gas contract with China. As a Western Australian, I was pleased to know that significant levels of business investment and many new jobs will be created in my home state as a consequence. I have also been pleased to note over recent times that the Timor Gap projects, which I am sure Senator Crossin is familiar with, will add significantly to the economies of both Australia and East Timor. 
I make these points in the context of this bill because of the proposed flight paths from the APSC facility on Christmas Island. As I understand it, there are three planned trajectories, depending on the type of orbit that is planned for the satellite. The equatorial flight path runs north-east from Christmas Island passing between Australia, Indonesia and East Timor. At no time, I am told, will this flight path pass closer than 30 kilometres to a coastline. The second flight path designed to place satellites in orbit goes along the moderate inclination path that runs south-east from Christmas Island. 
This launch profile differs in that the ascent is changed to ensure that all of the hardware falls into the ocean. And therein lies the problem. The basic nature of space launches, as I understand it, requires bits of the launch vehicle to fall back to earth. In the case of APSC there are a number of major components that are designed to fall back into the sea, and they are: four strap-on boosters and stage 2 and stage 3 of each vehicle.
This bill is designed to ensure that all of the risks are adequately covered and that risk is minimised. However, one of the factors that needs to be kept in mind is that, in the event of something going wrong, the potential risk to Australian lives and economic interests could be catastrophic. In the event that this hardware falls in the wrong place, a number of significant offshore economic facilities could be in danger. In fact, many of the other submissions that the committee received also made this point.
At this stage I am reasonably satisfied that there are sufficient protections in place and that the space industry is generally an industry with very high safety standards. However, I believe there are two things that need to be done. Firstly, APSC should consult with the operators of all offshore facilities to outline the way that missions will be conducted. Secondly, the government must classify any staffed facility in the vicinity of these flight paths at the highest level under this piece of legislation.
The last concern I raised was whether this would all be of benefit to Australia. I am of the view that the operations outlined by APSC will be of long-term benefit to Australia. This new industry will provide a significant boost to the economic activity of Christmas Island and does provide for some new jobs. The bill also sets out stringent safety requirements that mean that the potential for accidents is quite low.
The major problem confronting this new industry is the depressed state of the market at the moment. If the market turns around over the next two years, prior to the planned first launch in 2004, the only other issue will be the high cost of third-party insurance. I am hopeful that this will not impact on the competitiveness of APSC. However, I believe we should monitor this carefully and be prepared to amend this legislation if it is warranted.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2002-10-17,"—In this debate on the Space Activities Amendment Bill 2002, I will begin by congratulating Senator Webber on her excellent portrayal of APSC operations and the contribution that that company may, or may not, make to this country, particularly the Christmas Island community. I will add some further comments about the impact of the newly acquired space industry on Christmas Island, which, as people would know, comes within the jurisdiction of the Northern Territory and for which I am directly responsible as a senator for that area.
As a number of speakers before me have said, the major amendments in the Space Activities Amendment Bill include the capping at $750 million of the amount of insurance required to be procured by proponents of each launch. The bill also provides for the Commonwealth to accept liability for third-party Australian nationals above the insured amount for up to $3 billion. It is a fact that, under the United Nations convention, the Commonwealth is already liable for damage to foreign third parties, so this bill relates to Australian nationals. The bill also provides for a tightening of the safety test being applied to commercial applicants for instruments. 
The bill also provides for a less onerous application and assessment process and a lower fee regime for scientific and educational organisations. That provision makes some sense in that the argument here is that scientific and educational launches are usually done on a one-off basis and do not involve the construction of major infrastructure, and, for these reasons, such organisations should not, as this bill would propose, be subject to the same licensing requirements as commercial launches.
It has been stated in the lower house and by Senator Lundy, who is responsible for this area in the Senate, that Labor will not be opposing this bill. However, this bill does raise a number of issues that relate to the proposed space activities on Christmas Island. There are also two questions underlying the intent of this bill. The first question concerns this government's priorities in providing insurance cover of more than $3 billion to a commercial operation in respect of the space industry, when over the last nine or 10 months it has been well known that many organisations around Australia, especially sporting organisations, have been struggling to meet their insurance premiums, especially those related to public liability.
During the last few months we have seen a scenario unfold in which organisations around this country have been trying to get the federal government to actually do something to assist them and relieve the situation of the increased costs that they have incurred. Some organisations have come to the point where they have nearly had to close up their operations and cease to exist because of the increased costs in public liability insurance that they are now forced to meet. Yet this government has declined to provide assistance or do anything about it.
Why is it that we have a government which has refused to listen to sporting bodies, small groups, regional show societies and other organisations in their call for assistance with insurance premium increases, but which can respond to big business, to those who are about to enter the space industry and, in this case, assist with insurance payments in relation to space activities?
The second question concerns a situation where this government has managed to provide $100 million in assistance for this project on Christmas Island. We know this money has been found by raiding the contingency reserve. Last year, the Minister for Finance and Administration, John Fahey, actually admitted that the Commonwealth's $100 million contribution to the Christmas Island spaceport was to be withdrawn from the contingency fund, which was funded at $919 million for 2001-02. The contingency reserve is an appropriation of funds for an emergency. It is insurance against risk and it has long been used by governments on both sides to protect the public finances against any such risk or unforeseen expenses.
But of course this government's budgetary position has been, and continues to be, so desperate that it was reduced to raiding its own emergency fund. In fact, I think it was labelled the `rainy day fund' by our opposition spokesperson Lindsay Tanner at the time. The contingency reserve is to provide funding for unexpected expenses. It is not meant to be money used to fund election promises and it is certainly not meant to compensate big businesses for their commercial activities. It is a sad indictment also of the government that at the same time as it has frozen the R&D Start program it sees it as appropriate to give funding for space activities on Christmas Island to a company which has received nothing but criticism since its inception.
I want to talk about that for a moment, because it again reflects an unusual set of priorities—in fact, conflicting priorities—of this government. The R&D Start program is an important program for this country's future. It is meant to assist small and medium-sized enterprises that are engaged in research and development activities. This government has not been able to find the funds to continue with that program for at least the foreseeable future. In fact, the R&D Start program has had all its applications frozen for an indefinite period—or, as the minister would want us to believe, this is not a freeze; it is just that the government is processing no more applications for the time being. In fact, this government has instructed 115 small businesses to withdraw their applications under the R&D Start program in order that the government not be embarrassed by the large number of applications that will not be processed due to the lack of funds and as a result of this freeze. 
The purpose of the legislation before us today, though, is essentially to make it easier for space launch activities in relation to a proposal at Christmas Island. This is a market which is highly competitive, as Senator Webber pointed out, and therefore there must be some question as to whether those activities will in the end be commercially viable. In launching the new $800 million spaceport on Christmas Island in 2001, Minister Minchin at the time said it would establish Australia as a significant player in the satellite launch industry that is currently dominated by the USA, Russia, the European Union and China.
But those in the space industry would say that APSC, the Asia Pacific Space Centre, is in fact targeting a mid-range market for space launches in an area fast disappearing as satellites grow in size and capacity. Executives of the European Space Agency-backed Ariane space consortium warned that APSC is planning to launch satellites that the Americans have already decided are not big enough and that, by the time APSC is operational, satellites will be bigger again. The company also has local competitors, including SpaceLift Australia, which is pushing ahead with plans to launch from Woomera, and United Launch Systems International, which is reassessing its plans to launch from an island off the Queensland coast. However, APSC managing director David Kwon has always maintained that he is confident that the Christmas Island facility would claim critical mass, giving access to about 80 per cent of the market. The company expected to have booked out launch places in 2003 and 2004 by the end of last year—a time line that company stated publicly. But, of course, that time line has now elapsed. It would be interesting to hear from the minister if in fact that has happened.
Let me take this opportunity to once again remind this chamber, as I have done on a number of occasions, that this is the managing director of the same company that bought the Christmas Island resort and announced last year that they would reopen this resort. In fact, a press release put out on 23 June 2001 by Senator Ian Macdonald, who was then the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, stated:
I am also very pleased that Mr David Kwon, APSC's Managing Director, has today announced he will reopen the Christmas Island resort, which means more jobs.
We are now in October 2002 and once again I am not aware of any application for a casino licence before the current minister nor am I aware that there are any plans to reopen this resort other than to make a number of rooms available for people who are travelling to the island on business and who may need a room to stay in overnight. Certainly, there has been no attempt to reopen the resort that people on Christmas Island would remember, either as a casino or as a popular tourist destination. Certainly there has been no attempt to have the resort operating in a way that will provide many jobs for people on the island.
People may remember that, when this government flew to Christmas Island to make the announcement about this space base, there was a severe lack of consultation, as there always is, with people on this island. This announcement was made in August 2001 and this government was criticised for failing to consult the community adequately. The community has been worried, and remains worried, about the negative social and environmental impacts that this space activity will have on the community and the environment. In fact, in an article in the Sydney Morning Herald on 25 June 2001 by Tom Allard on behalf of AAP entitled `Manna from the heavens as we join space race', it is noted: 
... a freelance environmental consultant used by the Asia Pacific Space Centre, Mr Warren Nicholls, said the environmental impact statement for the launch centre was “shoddy”.
`The water supply on the island is a critical issue and if there was any spill either while transporting stuff there or during the launch it could go straight into the water supply—in which case the island's finished,' he said.
Noise from rocket launches was the main threat to fragile species and a noise demonstration by APSC was `hopeless...just a joke'.
He went on to say:
`Where you have so many species that are endemic to the island, you have to be extra careful.'
Christmas Island has been likened to the Galapagos Islands. It has an absolutely unique environmental culture in both its fauna and flora. It is true that the residents of Christmas Island remain quite concerned about the impact of the space base on their island. When I was there earlier this year, concerns were raised with me about the issue of noise pollution from the space base and the impact of hydrozene fuel and what that would mean if it were ever to get into the water on the island. The island residents were not aware of any contingency plan in the event of an accident. On 23 May 2001, a space agreement between Russia and the federal government was established to ensure that there was a formal framework of cooperation between our two countries. But there was no such formal arrangement made between the residents of Christmas Island and this government to ensure that they fully understood and comprehended what the new space activity centre and its operations would mean for them. There have been no open forums or public consultations with the people on Christmas Island. An advisory committee has been set up by the Administrator on Christmas Island and there are a couple or maybe just one representative from the Christmas Island Shire Council on the advisory council. Consultation has been extremely inadequate. 
This is a government that still fails to take seriously the views of the elected representatives on Christmas Island through the shire council. This is a government that makes a profound habit of making decisions about developments on Christmas Island without full and proper consultation with the residents concerned. In fact, the Public Works Committee report, which was handed down on 27 August, relates to the further development needed on the island for the space base to go ahead. It made the specific recommendation that the government should undertake better and more adequate consultation with the residents on the island. At the beginning of chapter 3 of the report, it states: 
In submissions and at the public hearing, the Shire of Christmas Island, and Christmas Island Phosphates—
which is the major mining company on the island—
indicated that consultations with them had not been sufficient and were concerned that their views had not been adequately addressed.
So there is still a problem on Christmas Island about the lack of consultation between this government, organisations, the duly elected representatives through the shire council and the broader population and residents on the island. This is an issue that I have raised in this chamber time and time again, and it is an issue that is still ignored by the government.
The Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on Public Works went to Christmas Island and conducted an inquiry into the infrastructure that would be needed to deal with improvements on the island in order to get the space base up and running. The report that the committee handed down some months ago specifically deals with the improvements to Christmas Island Airport—in particular, the extension of the airport runway 460 metres north and 90 metres south. Without the proposed airport upgrade, the Asia Pacific Space Centre's operations cannot proceed. In other words, a longer runway and improved facilities are required at the airport in order to accommodate and maintain what will be needed for this space centre.
On 9 August last year, the Department of Transport and Regional Services referred a similar proposal to the committee. That reference lapsed as a result of the parliament being prorogued prior to the election last year. That reference included the additional port on the east coast and a new link road from the east coast to Lily Beach Road to enable the rockets to be transported up the hill to the southern section of the island where they will be launched. It is interesting to note that neither of these projects were ever considered by the Public Works Committee, as was, of course, the proposed immigration processing or detention centre on Christmas Island. It was a decision by the House of Representatives that that particular public works not be subject to scrutiny and, therefore, once again the community on Christmas Island were denied the opportunity to be consulted about the construction of this centre. Christmas Island has long needed a larger and better airport. There is no doubt about that; and, therefore, this upgrade is most welcome. The airport upgrade will provide improved services for the island community and may encourage the development of tourism, which it has always been said should be a key or major industry for the island economy. 
I want to highlight a number of issues mentioned in the report. There is the lack of emergency services at the airport, including fire tenders and the associated vehicle storage facilities. There is a need for the department of territories to approach the Civil Aviation Authority and immediately request that these services be provided at the airport. Finally, I want to acknowledge a recommendation in the Public Works Committee report and endorse the fact that this government needs to consider the impact of the current development on the island. The Public Works Committee has called for a social impact study to be conducted, and that recommendation should not only be seriously considered but also taken up and implemented by the government. There will be a major impact on the local community not only from the operation and development of the space base but also from a whole range of other industries that are developing on the island, of which not least in importance will be the detention centre. This is a small community and there is a need to have a social impact study conducted.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2002-10-17,"—I thank honourable senators for their contributions to the second reading debate. The Space Activities Amendment Bill 2002 amends the Space Activities Act 1998. The bill implements new arrangements relating to liability, insurance and safety that will provide greater protection to the public, to industries underlying flight paths and to other strategic economic assets such as Australia's oil and gas facilities. These new measures will mean that Australia's space insurance and liability regime is more consistent with international practice.
The proposed amendments will require proponents undertaking launch activities to procure insurance for each launch of up to a defined maximum probable loss or $750 million, whichever is the lesser. By this bill, the Commonwealth will provide greater protection to Australian nationals by accepting liability of up to $3 billion in excess of the amount covered by insurance for damage to Australian life and property caused by Australian launch operations. The Commonwealth is already liable for damages to foreign nationals under international law. This bill will also apply a stronger test of risk to space launch activities. The new test requires the risk to be as low as reasonably practicable—or ALARP. Adoption of the ALARP principle will ensure that applicants for authorisations under the act demonstrate that they have achieved the lowest practicable risk within the bounds of reasonable cost.
In addition to the new liability, insurance and safety measures, the amendments provide for new arrangements to license the space launch activities of scientific and educational organisations, thereby promoting the development of space science expertise in Australia and increasing opportunities for nonprofit scientific and educational organisations to engage in space science research. These new arrangements will provide for an alternative application processing fee structure which is less onerous and better suited to the modest scale and limited risk associated with scientific and educational launches and returns. The bill also implements a number of minor administrative and technical amendments, including defining the point at which the act becomes effective, clarifying the fee regime and making provision for an annual review of a space licence. These amendments will improve the overall operation and efficiency of the act. 
During the second reading contributions there was some criticism of the Christmas Island project. This legislation is of general application and is not project specific. However, as one person described it to me, it is one small step for the Senate to take, but it will be a giant leap for Christmas Island.
—You have been waiting for that, haven't you?
—I have been waiting for that, Senator Lundy. It is a very good line from one of my staff members. I confess that I did not think of it, but I thought that it was a very good line.
—Look at the mess on Christmas Island!
—Even Senator Stott Despoja has sufficient grace to laugh at that, Senator Crossin. But let us move on. The original act established a licensing regime to regulate space launch and re-entry activities from Australia and overseas launches of space objects in which Australian nationals have an ownership interest. It ensures that space launch activities will only be undertaken where the applicant has presented a strong case to demonstrate the safety of the proposed activities. The act also ensures that such activities do not compromise Australia's foreign policy obligations or national security, that procedures to protect the environment are in place and that the Commonwealth complies with its obligations under United Nations conventions.
Passage of the bill will ensure that the Australian space safety regime is amongst the most stringent in the world and that our insurance and liability arrangements are appropriate to the needs of space launch activities in Australia. The bill also facilitates the development of Australia's space industry by improving and enhancing the regulatory framework needed to create a competitive environment, to protect research into space science technology and to encourage private investment in emerging space launch and research projects. I commend the bill to the Senate.
Question agreed to.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>SPACE ACTIVITIES AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,33,1,speech
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2002-10-17,"— The bill before us, the Research Agencies Legislation Amendment Bill 2002, seeks to amend two pieces of legislation, the Australian Institute of Marine Science Act and the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Act. It essentially provides mechanisms whereby there can be greater autonomy by the agencies in terms of commercialisation and a reduction in ministerial supervision of them. There are a number of other minor matters that the bill attends to but I do not believe these are of particular importance compared to the more substantive issue of the government's commercialisation policies for these agencies, so I will be seeking to spend some time on that issue today.
On 20 September this year the Minister for Science, Mr McGauran, and his two colleagues Senator Patterson and Dr Nelson, released a report on Australia's comparative record of commercialisation of public sector R&D, and they tried to do that in the context of the international scene. When they were launching this report, the troika of ministers essentially put a brave face on what really is a very poor record of Australian research and development. The report, the National Survey of Research Commercialisation, was undertaken by the Australian Research Council, the CSIRO and the National Health and Medical Research Council. 
For all the hype that was presented by these three ministers, the report on commercialisation basically said that Australia's performance in commercialisation of R&D was poor compared with other developing countries. As Mr McGauran said in his media release, there was a need to `improve our record of commercialising public sector research'.  
This is an occasion when I would agree with the minister. He could not be more correct. Australia urgently needs to improve its record in this area, a record that—as measured by a number of indicators—has worsened significantly under the Howard government. For instance, business expenditure on research and development—an index which I think is widely known—has dropped since 1995 from a peak of 0.86 per cent of GDP to 0.64 per cent in 2000. While there has been a small growth in 2001, I think the overall trend is reflected in a decline.
The BERD measure had been improved steadily under Labor throughout the 1980s, particularly as a result of the taxation policies that were pursued with regard to concessions to companies for research and development. The other index, the gross expenditure on research and development, the GERD, has also fallen under this government and is languishing at about 1.53 per cent of GDP compared with a peak of 1.66 per cent four years ago. In terms of the OECD comparisons, Australia has slipped from 11th in world competitiveness to 13th in just two years. Ireland, Finland and Sweden do better.
Just recently we saw the Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies, FASTS, produce a report, Australian science: investing in the future. I understand that Mr McGauran in fact launched this publication, so that would give it some authority I would have thought. The FASTS paper had, in my judgment, a lot to commend it, not least its emphasis on the shortcomings of the current government's approach to science policy. The minister had to acknowledge the status quo was deficient. He said:
The Government is committed to identifying and addressing impediments to the optimum performance of research in Australia, and addressing the challenges these issues pose.
The greatest impediment faced by research agencies in this country in regard to the development of research and development is government policy itself. The Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies said:
The fundamental issue is the lack of a genuine whole-of-government national approach.
Professor Chris Fells said:
We need a national vision for science. The Howard government lacks the crucial underlying elements in its policies, and Australia is paying the price.
We have a situation where, in response, the minister said he was confident a long-term strategy `would emerge'—that was in the Australian on Wednesday, 25 September, this year.
The government acknowledges it does not have a national strategy. It says it will `emerge'. Frankly, I find that an extraordinary proposition. As a country we sit almost at the bottom of the list of similar developed countries when it comes to availability of venture capital, especially in a high-risk early stage capital that is so essential for making sure that we translate research into jobs. The government has no clear strategy to deal with this particular problem. The research and development Start program has stalled due to too much interest from industry. The willingness to innovate is out there but the support from the government itself is now lacking. 
The centrepiece of the government's policy is Backing Australia's Ability. This set of initiatives was, I think, generally welcomed at the time, because it was seen to be an attempt by the government to at least put some of the money back in that it had taken out of the research community. We all know that the bulk of that money was back-ended— that is, it was loaded up for the tail end of quite a protracted period of time. It was in fact too little too late. Most of the funds were back-loaded until the end of that five-year funding cycle so very little has been seen from it since the time of its announcement. 
At the same time as the launch of the FASTS policy paper, Minister McGauran announced that this government was reviewing the contents of the Backing Australia's Ability package and that he was prepared to `cull programs if necessary'. The government is essentially on the back foot when it comes to research policy and I think the minister's comments are indicative of the government's failure. We have seen other organisations such as the Australian Vice Chancellors Committee, the Australian Industry Group and the Business Council of Australia—all peak bodies—indicating that the government has acted poorly in this area and has failed the challenges faced by this country when it comes to research policy. Minister McGauran shot himself in the foot when he agreed to launch the FASTS paper on 23 September. It is not often that we find a minister prepared—and I say he is very generous—to go out there and welcome a paper that is so fundamentally critical of his government's approach and its inaction. 
The commercialisation issue is an important one—it goes right across the research sector. In relation to AIMS in particular, the bill allows for the agency to borrow money and in turn to lend money for wholly or partly owned subsidiaries now to be known as `associated companies'. Although such transactions would require the approval of the Minister for Finance and Administration, the opposition has concerns about the way that these new provisions would act in practice and the potential to place Commonwealth funds at risk. This is particularly true when the institute's interest in the company concerned is not a controlling interest. The marine institute does not have the power formally to ensure that its funds are secure.
It is quite clear, within the public sector and the university sector in particular, that there is no research agency undertaking the commercialisation of research and doing it well. Particularly in the university sector, all too often we have seen relatively inexperienced commercial managers get their fingers burnt. We have seen bureaucrats and others, unused to the commercial environment, become involved in businesses and make mistakes—sometimes very costly mistakes. I am sure that when we get around to seeing it, the government's response to the report entitled Universities in crisis will detail their concerns about the failure of a whole series of corporate arms of universities to fulfil their obligations in this regard. Many universities have lost money in ill-conceived business dealings.
The Victorian Auditor-General has expressed concern about the lack of transparency and accountability for public funds associated with subsidiaries in business dealings of universities in that state. The state government in Victoria has taken these concerns seriously and has announced a range of measures designed to tighten up reporting requirements and to ensure public accountability for these ventures and activities. Collectively, we ought now to learn from some of these mistakes. The Commonwealth must ensure that, in loosening the financial and regulatory regimes surrounding commercial ventures, whether it be for ANSTO or for AIMS, it does not produce a situation where these mistakes can be repeated. In fact, we want to make sure that we do not throw the baby out with the bathwater. Too little regulation can create a situation where public resources are expended on agencies and potentially placed at risk.
The Business Council of Australia, in a paper contributing to Dr Nelson's higher education review and released on 24 September, had similar concerns. I emphasise that many of the positions taken by the Business Council of Australia are positions that we as an opposition strongly disagree with. Their concerns, however, about research commercialisation are matters that I think should be noted. In their paper they say:
International experience indicates a practical limit on the proportion of university revenue that can be generated from commercial activities in research and consultancy—a limit of less than ten per cent.
Beyond that point, universities would have to expose themselves to significant financial risk.
The same issues are relevant when it comes to publicly funded research agencies. We have seen the effects of too enthusiastic an approach to commercialisation with regard to the CSIRO. I know that this bill does not directly concern the CSIRO but the impact can be demonstrated if we are not careful. We see, for instance, that in the CSIRO's land and water division 26 scientists and technicians have recently been told they are losing their jobs. We know that 100 positions in the CSIRO will go between the middle and the end of the year. This is directly related to CSIRO management's concerns about their budgetary situation as a result of the failure to meet external earnings targets.  
We know that the government has abolished external earnings targets with regard to the CSIRO, ANSTO and AIMS but, nonetheless, management within those agencies maintains that approach as part of a commercialisation strategy. The sackings have targeted scientific and other staff who work in core areas of the division. This undermines the CSIRO's capacity to undertake its core function—that is, public interest research. In areas such as salinity and land and water conservation there could be no more basic a proposition for the CSIRO. I ask whether or not such an example would not also apply to other agencies such as ANSTO and AIMS. Beyond the issue of financial risk, there is the possibility that public agencies' core responsibilities will be moved from the functions for which they have been created; namely, the provision of public interest research. 
We have a further problem with regard to the failure of the government to fund these agencies effectively and appropriately. Part of the difficulty is built into the very indexation arrangements that apply to these agencies. Recently, I made my concern known about the differences in the indexation arrangements that occur. For instance, the indexation of funding for schools is 5.9 per cent, for higher education it is 2.2 per cent, for vocational education it is 1.6 per cent, for ANSTO it is 2.9 per cent, for CSIRO it is 2.6 per cent and for AIMS it is 2.6 per cent. I am certain that the management and the people who work in ANSTO would be delighted to have access to the same level of indexation as other divisions of the Department of Education, Science and Training in terms of the programs that they are operating. I am sure the same would apply to the marine institute: they would be delighted to have access to the same level of indexation that the other agencies have.
The opposition have a number of other concerns about this bill and they are spelt out in the second reading amendment. The opposition are not seeking to deny passage of this bill; we will be supporting it. However, we want to place on the record our concern at the government's failure to develop and set in place a coherent, national, all-of-government approach to research and development policy and, in particular, a national strategy on commercialisation. We believe that there should be a nationally consistent intellectual property and public research management policy. All of these things are currently lacking. Further, we seek to ensure that the commercial arrangements set in place for ANSTO and AIMS recognise that the policy responsibility for publicly funded research and for the funding of public-good research remains with the Commonwealth, and that commercially generated funds should supplement, rather than replace, public funding.
All too often, the impact is exactly the opposite. Research agencies are told, `You are to go out and make money on the side, and you are to use privately generated income to replace public funding.' By this means, the government is able to abrogate its responsibilities. The impact of that, of course, is to change the profile of many of our research agencies, be they the marine institute, the CSIRO, ANSTO or universities. The impact of that is also to undermine the quality of the programs that are run by those agencies, because the reporting requirements then shift to the stock exchange and away from where one would normally expect them to go: to the community of scholars, in terms of the research that is being undertaken; and to the community at large, in terms of the public interest research that is undertaken.
Our further concerns go to ensuring that the financial management of commercial ventures undertaken by ANSTO and AIMS are soundly based, well informed and open to public scrutiny. I have no doubt that, as a direct consequence of increasing commercialisation, we will see an increase in government claims that we cannot have access to information from these agencies because it is commercial-in-confidence.
We also want to make sure that public assets are not put at risk through these changes. We want to ensure that the financial accountability, probity and reporting requirements of commercial ventures and associated companies of the agencies maintain a rigorous standard which is comparable to those applying to the parent agencies. We have seen too many examples of lax standards. ICAC recently brought down a report on universities in New South Wales. The issue of corruption is becoming all too pronounced within the education system as a direct result of people seeking to secure funding external to government sources and cutting corners in the process. The opposition also want to make sure that the core missions and public resources of the agencies are not compromised or undermined by their commercial activities. 
While the government will seek the passage of this bill today, it is important to highlight some of these concerns. I will want to hear, in the committee stage, what action the government is taking to ensure protections on these matters. I move:
At the end of the motion, add:
“But the Senate:
(a)	condemns the Government for its failure to develop and set in place a coherent, national, all-of-government approach to research and development policy, and in particular a national strategy for commercialisation, including a nationally consistent Intellectual Property and public research management policy;
(b)	calls upon the Government to ensure that:
(i)	commercial arrangements set in place for ANSTO and AIMS recognise that policy responsibility for publicly-funded research, and for funding public-good research, remains with the Commonwealth and that commercially generated funds should supplement, rather than replace, public funding;
(ii)	safeguards are put in place to ensure that the financial management of commercial ventures undertaken by ANSTO and AIMS is soundly based, well informed and open to public scrutiny;
(iii)	public assets are not put at risk in the agencies' commercial ventures;
(iv)	financial accountability, probity and reporting requirements with regard to commercial ventures and associated companies of the two agencies are of a rigorous standard, comparable as far as possible to those applying to the parent agencies themselves; and
(v)	the core missions and public resources of the agencies are not compromised or undermined by their commercial activities”.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH AGENCIES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,34,1,speech
"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2002-10-17,"—To facilitate the passage of the Research Agencies Legislation Amendment Bill 2002 and to enable the minister to make a contribution I will keep my remarks brief. The bill amends the Australian Institute of Marine Science Act 1972 and the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Act 1987 to encourage AIMS and ANSTO to commercialise their intellectual property. It is consistent with a key theme in Backing Australia's Ability—that is, to remove barriers to commercialising government-funded research.
AIMS and ANSTO are currently allowed to undertake commercial activities, but the agencies have limits on the size of contracts they can enter into without ministerial approval: $100,000 and $1 million respectively. In addition, neither can commercialise IP developed as a by-product of their core activities—that is, they cannot commercialise non-marine and non-nuclear IP. The Democrats have longstanding concerns with Australia's participation in the nuclear cycle. However, for the record I stress that this bill only goes to developing ANSTO's non-nuclear intellectual property. The bill increases thresholds for ministerial approval— to $1 million and $5 million respectively— and broadens functions to allow for the commercialisation of non-marine and non-nuclear IP.
The Australian Democrats will support this bill; however, it does raise some broad policy concerns. In particular, the Senate report to which Senator Carr referred, Universities in crisis, and various reports by state auditors-general have raised concerns about inadequate accountability and governance arrangements and practices in universities, raising more general concerns about the role of government research agencies. I acknowledge that finding the right balance between providing flexibility to important, publicly funded institutions and insisting on proper constraints and governance requirements does require good judgment and, of course, good and clear policy. However, such concerns are legitimate, and for this reason we will be considering favourably the opposition's second reading amendment. I am not sure how long ago it was circulated, but I will certainly be considering it. 
—Quite a while.
—Okay, quite a while. I would have liked more consideration of some of the amendments that the Democrats moved on important issues in the previous debate, but I will not reflect on a view of the Senate.
—I did not handle that bill.
—I know you did not, Senator Carr. I know your commitment to these and other issues, and that is why I enjoy working with you on them. The second policy issue that this bill raises is that successful commercialisation may give a future government a warrant to reduce government funding. There is a clear precedent for this in the way that universities have been forced to find additional private income to cover the cuts imposed on them by the Howard government since it came to office in 1996. The important point about this shift from public to private sources of funding is that in universities private funding does not replace public funding; it goes to quite different activities, including marketing and the recruitment of international fee-paying students, and it does not replace the public funding of teaching, learning and research, notably in the enabling disciplines of physics, chemistry, mathematics, philosophy, languages and history. The third policy issue is that these measures may encourage ANSTO and AIMS to concentrate on non-core research functions. The last issue is that commercialisation always involves a risk. In the event of poor decisions or plain bad luck, there may be adverse exposure or financial implications.
These concerns are valid, reasonable and highly plausible, and I trust that AIMS and ANSTO will consider them seriously and carefully. However, it should be clearly understood that AIMS and ANSTO are subject to public scrutiny and accountability mechanisms, as covered by the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 and, moreover, are subject to ANAO audit. I am not aware of systematic failings of the CAC Act framework, and of course the work of the ANAO is highly respected, particularly by the Australian Democrats.
In my view, none of the concerns warrant opposition or substantial amendment to the legislation before us, and that is why we will be supporting it. In addition, it is worth while acknowledging that there are sound economic reasons to encourage commercialisation of IP. The Democrats will be supporting the legislation before us. Senator Carr, I have read your amendment; I was just wondering when it was circulated. The Australian Democrats will be supporting the opposition on that second reading amendment today. Given Senator Carr's reference to science and the debate we have just had in relation to science and indeed the FASTS document, which is a very impressive document, to save time I am not going to mention it in any more detail. With the indulgence of the Senate, I do want to pay tribute to the women of WISENET, the Women in Science Enquiry Network, who are constantly debating these issues. I spoke to them about the Research Agencies Legislation Amendment Bill 2002 today, as a matter of fact, when I addressed them at a luncheon on women in science issues. With that indulgence, I conclude the remarks of the Australian Democrats in the hope that we can facilitate the passage of this legislation this afternoon.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Thank you, Senator Stott Despoja. The amendment that you referred to was circulated yesterday.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH AGENCIES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,34,1,speech
"Troeth, Sen Judith",LP,2002-10-17,"— I should say at the outset of the government's response to the second reading debate on the Research Agencies Legislation Amendment Bill 2002 that the government does not accept the opposition's condemnation of its supposed failure to develop and set in place a coherent, national, all-of-government approach to research and development policy. The Labor Party might still be searching for a research and development policy, but the government does have a comprehensive policy for science and innovation and, as Senator Carr correctly remarked, it is called Backing Australia's Ability. But that is only the latest in a series of major measures introduced by this government to boost research, innovation and commercialisation. Perhaps the opposition needs a history lesson on this. 
Since 1996 we have established extremely sound economic foundations, a range of research and innovation initiatives and a forward-looking innovation policy, which is backed up by a substantial financial commitment. The Investing for Growth statement, which was released in December 1997, increased support for business innovation by providing $1.26 billion over four years from the year 1998-1999. The government's response to The virtuous cycle, the report of the Health and Medical Research Strategic Review, injected a further $614 million into health and medical research over six years from 1999, which doubles the National Health and Medical Research Council's annual budget by the year 2005. Again, the National Innovation Summit, convened by the government and the Business Council in February 2000; the subsequent Innovation Summit Implementation Group report on innovation, Unlocking the future; and the Chief Scientist's review of the effectiveness of Australia's science, engineering and technology base were all fundamental in developing Backing Australia's Ability.
We are just 18 months into that program, which is a five-year plan to rebuild our capabilities in science, technology and engineering. It is a significant milestone for innovation and science in Australia which extends our ability in strategic research; enhances our ability to create innovation driven companies, jobs, new products and services; and ensures that all Australians will gain maximum benefit. It brings together the largest group of measures to foster innovation ever assembled by an Australian government. It crosses five portfolios and it represents a whole-of-government approach to science and innovation, which we regard as crucial in building our national prosperity. To do that we are working cooperatively with industry and the scientific community to make the role of science and innovation a key priority, given the enormous contribution that it makes to the quality of life that we enjoy, and we are seeing the results of our efforts.
In response to Senator Carr's comparison of Australia's efforts in the OECD, I should point out that government financing of research and development in Australia is around 0.70 per cent of GDP. This is comfortably above the OECD average of around 0.65 per cent of GDP and up there with the heavyweight OECD economies of the USA with 0.74 per cent, Japan with 0.58 per cent and Germany with 0.78 per cent. We are continuing to build on that momentum. We have put in place $5.1 billion in support of science and innovation in the year 2002-03—an increase of 5.8 per cent on the previous year and the highest amount ever spent by the government on supporting science and technology.
The range of government spending across all portfolios will generate ideas, stimulate creative research, produce skilled people and provide the essential infrastructure necessary to build our strength as an innovative nation. We continue to set the pace in policy settings for science and innovation. The government remain focused on commercialisation. In particular, the Backing Australia's Ability initiative provides $79 million in pre-seed funding to take proposals to the venture capital ready stage. There are many other ways in which I could respond to Senator Carr's remarks, but I simply wish to say that we will not be accepting his second reading amendment.
Question agreed to.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—I remind honourable senators that, under a sessional order agreed to on 20 June 2002, after the second reading I shall call the minister to move the third reading unless any senator requires that the bill be considered in the Committee of the Whole. 
—Mr Acting Deputy President, on that point, given the time, I will not pursue the question in the committee stage. There are some matters I will have to take up in estimates hearings.
—Thank you, Senator Carr.
Original question, as amended, agreed to.
Bill read a second time.",SENATE,<title>RESEARCH AGENCIES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,34,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2002-10-17,"—I would like to speak to the report from AusAid, the Australian government's overseas aid program. The report makes a lot of good statements about the importance of poverty reduction. I think it is particularly appropriate to note that—as many senators would be aware, but perhaps not others outside this place—a petition was presented outside Parliament House today by the National Coalition Against Poverty to a group of parliamentarians, including the Independent member for Calare, Mr Andren. The petition had many thousands of signatures—I think, off the top of my head, that there were about 50,000 Australians calling for a royal commission into poverty, obviously focused on poverty in Australia. As part of that presentation, there was a very good speech made by Professor Julian Disney about poverty levels around the world as well as different issues of poverty in Australia. The conclusion of this document, I think, makes a good point in that it says that aid is a central component of Australia's foreign policy and national interest—it is and so too is the need for better prosperity in the Asia-Pacific region that Australia is a part of. 
The Democrats have argued strongly— and even more so since the tragic events of the weekend—that we must increase our focus on the countries in our region. Part of that is assisting them with issues of prosperity, governance and opportunity. Poverty is not just about lack of money but also about lack of opportunity—whether it is in housing or other areas. The Democrats asked in question time earlier this week whether the government would now consider increasing its aid or changing the direction of its aid. Unfortunately, I think the answer given by the minister was fairly dismissive of the point that the Democrats were making. 
I do not think there is much doubt that if you can increase prosperity overall in a region you will increase the opportunity for a society to address issues of extremism and violence and the prospect of such movements gaining greater numbers of adherents. It is true that some of the leaders of some of these terrorist groups are not poor—they have stacks of money—but their ability to gain greater numbers of adherents is often linked to levels of poverty in their region. It is not the sole factor but it is obviously a key factor and I do not think that it can be, or should be, denied. Assisting greater prosperity and stability in our region is in Australia's national interest and it highlights again one reason, among so many others, that aid is so crucial. 
The report outlines world poverty by region and in the East Asia and Pacific region there are over 250 million people in poverty. Those are people living on $US1 a day, so it is a pretty tight definition of what determines poverty. In Indonesia a huge percentage of that country's population live on less than $US1 per day. I do not think Australians understand, sometimes, the level of poverty and the nature of life for large numbers of people who live in our neighbourhood. That is why aid is so important and that is why it is so disappointing that Australia's overall aid contribution continues to be so poor. 
This report suggests that our aid levels have increased. Australia's aid as a ratio of gross national income is estimated at 0.25 per cent—one quarter of one per cent. Astonishingly, that has continued to drop. It has dropped from over 0.3 per cent in the 1980s to 0.25 per cent now. Despite that, this report has the audacity to say that the government continues to support the UN's 0.7 per cent target. I do not know how you can support the target whilst getting further and further away from it, particularly when a number of other countries, European countries in particular, are much closer to it and a number of them are over it. Some of the northern Scandinavian countries are at, or near, or aiming for, one per cent.  
So, fundamentally, the level that we put into aid is a scandal. It must be addressed. We are talking about investing in prosperity in our region and around the world. As the report says, that is in our national interest as well as in the interests of humanity around the globe. It must be given greater priority. If one looks at some of the issues behind the tragedy of the weekend, one will see that the need to provide better assistance to our brothers and sisters around the world who are in need is important.

"Barnett, Sen Guy",LP,2002-10-17,"—I rise to support a US free trade agreement for Australia and emphasise the fact that this will benefit this country. The drought is very serious and is having implications for rural and regional communities and others right throughout Australia. It is estimated that the cost to the community could be $4 billion. It is also estimated that the merits of a US-Australia free trade agreement could deliver benefits to this country in the order of $4 billion each year. Why should the US spend $180 billion over the next 10 years to subsidise its farmers? There is no good reason. In fact it is a tragic outcome for Australian farmers, who by world standards are amongst the most efficient. The US administration and members of Congress support free trade in principle, but they are protectionists in practice, especially in a Congressional election year such as 2002. 
During my time in 1986 and 1987 working in a US law firm in Washington DC on behalf of Australian trade and agricultural interests, $26 billion a year in subsidies was paid to US farmers under their US farm legislation. Strong lobbying by the US farm sector has maintained its protectionist and nationalistic approach, as exemplified by the recent passage of the US Farm Bill 2002. The Republicans control the House of Representatives, the Democrats control the Senate and both parties are fighting for the votes of the powerful farm lobby in advance of their Congressional elections on 5 November.
The President has now obtained trade promotion authority from the US Congress, enabling him to negotiate bilateral arrangements with other countries, including this free trade agreement with Australia. As the Prime Minister argued so well during his visit to Washington DC some months ago, a free trade agreement with Australia can deliver benefits to both countries. It is vital that negotiations on the terms and conditions of this agreement get under way as soon as possible, and I understand that that is now occurring. Based on discussions with our embassy officials and the Australian Ambassador to the US, Michael Thawley, during my recent visit in June, I am confident that we are in a good position to act swiftly. It is hoped that a free trade agreement can be finalised by the end of 2004. Our exporters will benefit, especially our farming community.
Beef is Australia's single largest export to the US and was worth over $A1.7 billion in 2001. This is followed by passenger motor vehicle exports of $591 million and alcoholic beverage exports of $552 million. Imports from the US are dominated by telecommunications equipment at $1 billion and aircraft and aircraft parts at $1.7 billion. A 378,000 metric tonne quota was imposed on Australian beef exports to the USA, and this quota was exceeded for the first time in 2001. Having met with Meat and Livestock Australia representatives in Washington DC, it is clear that not a lot can be done in the short term to gain concessions from the US regarding quotas. Beef exports to the US in excess of the quota incur a 26.4 per cent tariff, making the export of Australian-manufactured beef for US consumption uneconomic.
The Meat and Livestock Australia representation in Washington DC is a credit to the Australian industry, as they implement a professional lobbying regime. I met with them on my recent visits; they really are professional and should be commended. In my view, it is time for other Australian industry representatives and business organisations to take MLA's lead and to have representation in our second largest export market—the home of over one-third of Australia's investment inflow, which amounts to $215 billion. The US is also the host of over 50 per cent of Australia's direct investment overseas.
I would like to specifically focus on the subject of poppies, because it is such an important commodity for Tasmania. The US is an important market for the Australian licit opiate industry—the poppy industry. In 1981 the US introduced the so-called 80-20 rule, which stipulates that at least 80 per cent of narcotic raw material imports must be sourced from traditional suppliers such as India and Turkey. Australia competes with other countries such as Yugoslavia, France, Poland and Hungary for the 20 per cent balance of the US import demands.
I met with the US Drug Enforcement Administration, the DEA, who confirmed that thebaine, an opium poppy derivative which Tasmania produces in some quantity, would not be counted within the 20 per cent component. This is good news for the Tasmanian poppy industry, as the DEA confirmed that such an arrangement will remain in place until at least 2005. Tasmanian exports of thebaine account for about 35 tonnes of the annual US thebaine imports of 65 tonnes. The US government acknowledges that Australia and specifically Tasmania maintain the highest standards of security. 
I commend the Tasmanian poppy industry, the Poppy Control Advisory Board and all those associated with the industry in Tasmania for having such a commendation passed upon that industry by the US administration. I want to also commend specifically the two processing factories in Tasmania. Firstly, there is Glaxo, at Westbury—which is near my home town of Hagley, in northern Tasmania—employing well over 100 people. That factory is owned by GSK—Glaxo Smith Kline. The second facility, near Ulverstone, is Tasmanian Alkaloids, owned by the company Johnson & Johnson. They make an important contribution to the Tasmanian industry, and I would certainly be encouraging them to consider other downstream processing activities and options for those particular activities.
Finally, I would like to congratulate the Australian government and specifically Mark Vaile, as Minister for Trade, and also the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Warren Truss, on the efforts that they are undertaking to pursue this US free trade agreement. I would also like to specifically congratulate our Prime Minister, the Hon. John Howard, who worked so hard and was so well recognised during his time in Washington DC, when he addressed both houses of the US Congress and had one-on-one meetings with the President, the Secretary of State and many other dignitaries in the administration. He was indeed honoured in many ways—and rightfully so. The Bush administration went out of its way to honour our Prime Minister. So I would like to pay those compliments and pass on those congratulations. I urge our government to continue with haste and professionalism to pursue a US free trade agreement with Australia. Finally, I want to commend the ambassador, Michael Thawley, his operatives and his support staff at the embassy in Washington DC, and also those working in the various consulates throughout the USA to achieve these objectives, for the good work that they do.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>United States Free Trade Agreement</title>,Adjournment,38,1,speech

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2002-10-17,"—The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:
(1)	(a) & (b) There are three headcounts per day conducted at meal times for the convenience of detainees. During these headcounts, detainees are required to show their identity cards. In addition, a maximum of two further headcounts are conducted at random times. For security purposes, it is necessary for these checks to be random.
From time to time, where there are concerns about health or wellbeing of individuals, detainees will be placed on an observation routine in addition to normal head count procedures. In some instance, detainees are accommodated in observation rooms for that purpose, in others they will remain in general accommodation but staff will be required to check on their wellbeing at specific intervals, for example, 15 minute or half-hourly observations.
(2)	Records solely relating to headcounts are not kept. Times of headcounts are logged in the Australasian Correctional Management (ACM) Shift Supervisor's handbook. The ACM Shift Supervisor's handbook is a hand written continuous document and therefore, may not be useful for the purposes of answering this question. However, should you wish to see a copy of selected days, the Department can arrange to have copies forwarded to you.
(3)	This information is highly sensitive, confidential and private information and is therefore not appropriate to provide in this format. However, I am prepared to supply this information in a private briefing.
(4)	Any use of medication in Immigration Detention Facilities must be prescribed by appropriate medical professionals in accordance with the relevant Australian medical and legal requirements.
There is a provision in the Migration Regulations allowing for the use of reasonable force, including the use of sedation, for the purpose of giving non-consensual medical treatment to a detainee where:
·	the medical treatment is authorised by the Secretary;
·	the Secretary is acting on the written advice of a medical practitioner; and
·	the Secretary has formed the opinion that a detainee needs medical treatment because there is a serious risk to their life or health. 
(5)	A nurse administers the medication during the day and a Supervisor takes on this role throughout the evening as required. If a detainee refuses to take medication, a note is made in their file and the matter is pursued by the medical staff.
(6)	(a)	Incident reports, medical records and statistical data regarding incidents of self harm attempts are maintained. Self harm is described as self inflicted injury or the act of causing harm to oneself (includes cutting of body parts, voluntary starvation, etc).
(b)	Records of self harm attempts are highly sensitive, confidential and private and are therefore not appropriate to provide in this format. It can, however, be supplied in a private briefing.
(7)	There is no limit on the number of blankets that can be issued by ACM to a detainee at any one time.
(8)	Detainees are permitted to receive and use additional blankets from visitors. Detainees are permitted two additional blankets each. The quantity is limited to facilitate storage arrangements when blankets are not in use.
(9)	There had been problems with the heating system which resulted in some areas of the centre being affected. There was a period of two days in May when the heating pumps failed and the heating system was not operational.
(10)	(a)	 The heating is now fully operational.
(b)	The heating takes time to warm up, so once it has been turned on at the start of the cold weather, it remains on 24 hours a day until it is turned off at the end of the cold weather. The temperature is controlled by thermostats.
The heating is operational in all areas of the centre except the bathrooms, the recreational room and three family rooms. The three family rooms have oil filled column heaters.
Further to your question, there were several faults with the heating system during the period of 18-27 August 2002. All detainees were offered additional blankets.
The heating system is the original piped hot water system. The system is nearing the end of its economic life and has required regular maintenance during this winter. Options for replacement or refurbishment are being considered as part of the asset management plan for the centre.
(11)	Most areas in the facility have doors, including the interview, short stay, observation, education, TV, laundry rooms, dormitories, toilets and family rooms and associated ensuites. Some of these have privacy locks, such as the toilets and family rooms.
The male shower blocks have cubicles with lockable doors. The female shower blocks have external doors and curtains for each cubicle.
One of the six-person dormitories has a door. The remaining sleeping accommodation comprises partitioned dormitories with two double bunks within each partitioned area. The partitioned areas do not have doors.
(12)	The Immigration Detention Standards and the agreement between the Government and the Services Provider outline dignity and privacy requirements. Each detainee is required to be treated with respect and dignity and all information about detainees is treated in confidence. Information beyond that reasonably required for the detention of the individual and for the effective planning and supervision and the management of the detention facility is not collected or retained.
(13)	All ACM Detention Officers and Correctional Officers complete Certificate III which is a nationally accredited program at Pre-Service Level. The Pre-Service Training consists of five core modules: the Organisation, Communication, Safety and Security, Offender Management and Occupational Health and Safety.
In the case of Correctional Officers, emphasis is placed on the Corrections Act, prisoner's rights and the relevant state legislation.
In the case of Detention Officers, emphasis is placed on the immigration context including multicultural awareness, torture and trauma, Immigration Detention Standards and Migration Legislation.
If Correctional Officers move to work in a Detention Centre, they undertake a 40 hour Bridging Program to cover the above areas and obtain a Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (DIMIA) specific orientation. In addition, all Detention Officers undertake 40 hours refresher training annually, which includes updating technical skills, communicating effectively with detainees, conflict resolution and cross-cultural awareness. 
(14)	Complaints may be made directly to the Services Provider or to DIMIA, either in person or in writing. Confidentiality is maintained at all times. Detainees may also make complaints to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (HREOC) and the Commonwealth Ombudsman.
(15)	At the time of your visit, there was no limit on the group size for women and children using the grassed area. Only six males were permitted access to the grassed area at any one time. This was put in place for security and operational reasons, as there were some operational difficulties with the fence, which was recently installed.
A review of the situation was conducted and groups of 25 detainees are able to access the area at any one time. The grassed area is available twice a day (one period in the morning and one in the afternoon - timing depends on detainee preferences) with two Detention Officers present.
(16)	ACM has arranged for the mother to accompany her children to kindergarten except on occasions when escort officers are continuing on to another location.
(17)	This information is highly sensitive, confidential and private and is therefore not appropriate to provide in this format. It can, however, be supplied in a private briefing.
(18)	The detainee diagnosed with tuberculosis was removed from Australia in December 2001.
(19)	The Department reports all notifiable diseases to Health Services Australia who instruct all appropriate action, which was followed.
(20)	The Department reports all notifiable diseases to Health Services Australia who instruct all appropriate action, which was followed.
(21)	Cut flowers are permitted at the centre.
(22)	There is no rule that prevents visitors from taking notebooks and pencils into the visits area. These items can be given to detainees via the Services Provider.
(23)	A copy of the rules that apply for visitors to the Maribyrnong IDC is at Document A below.
(24)	The Detention Services Provider is required to provide visitor access in accordance with the ministerial direction under the Migration Act 1958 - Direction No. 20: Powers concerning the entry of visitors to immigration detention centres and the centre `Operating Manual'.
(25)	Recreational activities are organised, taking into consideration the interests of the population, the availability of people to conduct the activities and the infrastructure of the centre. As a result, available activities are frequently changing. A schedule of recreational activities for June 2002 is provided at Document B below.
(26)	There are no “rules” with regard to birthing mothers. However, pregnant women are required to give birth in the local hospital and have access to prenatal classes. All cases are assessed individually.
(27)	The most recent birth at the centre was Saturday 15 June 2002. There were no other children in the family.
(28)	The treating specialist has not recommended skin grafts for this person.
(29)	(a)	Fire drills are carried out periodically but not to any set timetable and follow the Metropolitan Fire Brigade guidelines (Victoria). There have been two fire drills conducted this year. The first fire drill took place on 27 March 2002 and the second on 30 August 2002.
(b)	Records of the fire drills conducted at the Maribyrnong IDC are not always kept. A copy of the incident report detailing the fire drill conducted on 30 August 2002 is provided at Document C below.
(30)-(32)	The Department is not aware of a written log of claims developed by detainees during a recent hunger strike. However, during a meeting between detainees and DIMIA, detainees raised a number of issues with the DIMIA representative, which were addressed during the meeting.
·	Due to inaccessibility of the kitchen during the evening, can detainees take food and Coca Cola into their rooms?
Detainees are permitted to take snacks into their rooms on the condition that the food will fit into the plastic airtight containers which will be supplied by the kitchen. A maximum of six sealed cans of Coca Cola or one 2 litre bottle is also permitted in rooms. 
·	When will the drain in the courtyard be cleaned?
Detainees were informed that DIMIA would arrange for the drain to be cleaned within the week. This issue is now resolved.
·	Why did it take one week for the washing machine to be repaired?
The repairer was waiting for spare parts. The machine is now working properly.
·	Detainees often make requests and suggestions to the Operations Manager and nothing happens.
It was suggested to detainees that they select three detainee representatives who will attend the weekly meeting. The representatives were requested to supply a list of questions to management the day before the meeting so that management could be in a position to respond. The detainees were happy with the suggestion which has now been initiated.
·	When would access to the grassed area commence?
Detainees were informed that there have been concerns with the security of the area and once the new security fence was operational, access to the courtyard would commence. Women and children commenced using the area on 14 May 2002. Males commenced using the area on 21 May 2002.
·	Why have some visitors been banned?
Detainees were advised that visitors are subject to rules and should these rules be broken, visitors would be banned. When visitors have been banned, they are required to sign an undertaking that they will abide by the rules and access is regranted.
·	Can toys be placed in the visits area?
Detainees were informed that this issue would be revisited as the toys previously in the visits area had been destroyed. Crayons and paper are now provided.
·	The quality of food is poor and there has been a lack in water supply.
A meeting with the Kitchen Manager took place following this issue being raised. The lack of water supply was the result of a burst water main. Both issues have been resolved.
·	Can a coffee vending machine and microwave be installed in the games room to alleviate mess?
Detainees were informed that this would not be appropriate, as there would be OH&S concerns with reheating food incorrectly and due to the high level of vandalism, companies would not supply further coffee machines. Detainees were also advised that they needed to be responsible for helping to keep this area clean.
·	Can ACM Managers be available to talk with detainees each day?
Detainees were advised that this would not be possible due to the work pressures of the ACM Managers. However, detainees can approach a Manager when they are walking through the centre as well as submitting a request form.
·	Some services are not available from telephones and can there be some clarification about who can read detainee faxes?
The telephone problems are a result of services provided by Telstra. Telstra was contacted and these problems have been rectified. Detainees were informed that an ACM Officer checks the fax machine and only reads the address.
·	Some detainees have not been provided with the detainee booklet.
Detainees are provided with the booklet at induction. Further copies can be obtained from the Property Officer.
·	Detainees are having difficulty accessing doctors after hours.
Detainees were informed that they are required to see the nurse in the first instance.
·	Can Detainee Representative Meetings be held more frequently with less representatives to ensure that matters are resolved quickly?
Detainee Representative Meetings are held once a week with three detainee representatives present. 
(33)	(a) & (b) Security strap wire is a term used for all barbed security wire (this includes, razor wire, tiger tape, etc). On arrival at the centre, detainees are issued with the booklet and have the contents explained to them. The booklet is available in a variety of languages and interpreters are used if necessary.
The ACM booklet states,
“You should also note that there is in place in certain areas security strap wire which can cause injury if contacted.
Contact with the security strap wire will result in injury”
(34)	While not a requirement under the Act, Departmental procedures state that a detained non-citizen should be informed they are liable for the costs of detention and removal from Australia. The contents of the form setting out the advice should be explained to the non-citizen through an interpreter, if necessary. There are separate processes and forms for those who have held a visa at some stage, that is, compliance cases, and for those who have arrived unlawfully without a visa (unauthorised air and boat arrivals).
During the period of detention, the non-citizen may be provided with an update of the debt incurred. At the conclusion of the period of detention, a final notice of the detention debt and removal costs (if applicable) may be served on the non-citizen. A person may remain liable for detention costs even if ultimately allowed to remain in Australia lawfully. This depends on the class of visa granted - see question 37.
(35)	The Form `Your Detention' (Document D below) is provided to people who have held a visa at some stage within 24 hours of being detained. It is available in several languages.
The form `Notice of Detention Costs Incurred' (Document E below) is provided to detainees when leaving the centre with the exception of those who receive certain types of visas.
(36)	The Department does not record debts at the level of accommodation charges or at the level of individual detention centre charges. The revenue recorded is for all centres for all debts to be recovered under the Migration Act 1958. The debt recorded for the financial year 2000-01 was $11.2 million. $263,301.00 was paid in 2000-01. This includes amounts for accommodation, fares, escorts and other minor costs eg passports.
(37)	Departmental policy is that recovery action for the debt will not be pursued where:
·	a person has been granted refugee status; or
·	a non-citizen was reasonably suspected of being unlawfully present in Australia, was detained, but later was found to have been lawfully present; or
·	a s200 deportee was detained, but the deportation order was revoked; or
·	extenuating circumstances.
Although debts are not pursued, they are not normally formally waived. The formal approval for debt waiver is a matter for the Department of Finance and Administration. In some circumstances, individual applicants may seek a waiver of their debt but each case must be determined on its own merits.
