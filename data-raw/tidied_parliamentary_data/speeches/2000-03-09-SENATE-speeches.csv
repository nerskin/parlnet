"Calvert, Sen Paul",LP,2000-03-09,"—On behalf of Senator Coonan and the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, I give notice that 15 sitting days after today Senator Coonan will move that the Northern Prawn Fishery Amendment Management Plan 1999 No. NPF02, made under subsection 20(1) of the Fisheries Management Act 1991, be disallowed. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a short summary of the matters raised by the committee.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
Northern Prawn Fishery Amendment Management Plan 1999 (No NPF 02) made under subsection 20(1) of the Fisheries Management Act 1991
The amendment to the Plan changes the method of controlling fishing in the Fishery from one based on boat dimensions to one based on catching capacity.
The Committee sought advice from the Minister on the following matters:
whether it is more appropriate for this matter to be dealt with by parliamentary enactment rather than regulation;
the extent to which, as indicated in the Regulation Impact Statement, some fishers will be more proportionally disadvantaged than others and the impact on the viability of their fishing operations;
the extent of the consultation process, including the participation of individual fishers; and
whether the Plan may trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties and, in particular, whether the instrument which affects a person's livelihood and ability to carry on a business is fair.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Presentation</title>,Notices,0,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-03-09,"—I give notice that on the next day of sitting I shall move: 
That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (7) of standing order 111 not apply to the Timor Gap Treaty (Transitional Arrangements) Bill 2000 allowing it to be considered during this period of sittings. 
I also table a statement of reasons justifying the need for this bill to be considered during this sittings and seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
STATEMENT OF REASONS FOR INTRODUCTION AND PASSAGE IN THE 2000 AUTUMN SITTINGS
TIMOR GAP TREATY (TRANSITIONAL ARRANGEMENTS) BILL
The purpose of the Timor Gap Treaty (Transitional Arrangements) Bill is to enable amendment of the Petroleum (Australia-Indonesia Zone of Cooperation) Act 1990 and related Acts (listed below) to reflect the change in Australia's Treaty partner from Indonesia to the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET). Although there has been a change in Treaty partner, the rights and obligations under the Treaty remain the same. In most cases, the amendments will be relatively minor. However, some amendments will be more extensive, for example, those relating to the application of the criminal law.
Acts needing consequential amendment are:
Crimes at Sea Act 1979
Crimes at Sea Act 2000
Customs Act 1901
Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986
Income Tax Assessment Act 1936
Migration Act 1958
Passenger Movement Charge Act 1978
Passenger Movement Charge Collection Act 1978 
Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967
Quarantine Act 1908
Workplace Relations Act 1996
Reasons for the urgency
Indonesia does not have sovereign rights in the area covered by the Timor Gap Treaty following the establishment by the United Nations, on 26 October 1999, of the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET) as the overall legislative and executive authority in East Timor. Thus, in order for petroleum operations in the Zone of Cooperation to continue, it was necessary to transfer Indonesia's rights and obligations under the Timor Gap Treaty to UNTAET, acting on behalf of East Timor. In addition, it was important to effectively maintain the current Treaty provisions in order to secure continued petroleum industry investment in the Timor Gap Zone of Cooperation.
UNTAET agreed to become the treaty partner with Australia on 10 February, following approval by the Federal Executive Council to enter into the Agreement. The arrangements will apply retrospectively from 26 October 1999. Importantly, all the rights and obligations under the Treaty with Indonesia remained the same when the UNTAET/Australia Treaty came into force.
It is the Government's normal practice to have necessary legislation in place before a treaty comes into force. This was not possible in the case of the Agreement between Australia and UNTAET. There was an urgent need for the Treaty to enter into force to provide continuity and certainty for existing and future commercial operators in the Zone of Cooperation, as well as to provide an early flow of revenue to UNTAET. This need outweighed any benefits from delaying the entry into force of the new Agreement to allow time for passage of the relevant legislation. Enactment will contribute further to investor certainty, including through the provisions validating actions of the Ministerial Council and the Joint Authority since 26 October 1999. It will also enable the continuing application to activities in the Zone of a range of Australian taxation, customs, immigration, crime and quarantine laws.

"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2000-03-09,"—I would ideally like to be able to quote speeches made by the opposition whip, Senator Kerry O'Brien, on 10 March, 31 March, 29 September, 30 September, 12 October and 23 November of last year where the opposition made very clear what has developed as a strong policy—and Senator Brown would be very well aware of this policy of the opposition—which is to not pass detailed foreign policy motions through the Senate unless they have unanimous support. I think that is the policy. I am sure Senator O'Brien will be able to elucidate on this tactical or strategic decision of the opposition in this chamber.
The opposition have made it clear on at least six occasions in the last 12 months that they will not support motions of a detailed foreign policy nature to pass through this chamber with what is effectively a tick and a flick and have refused Senator Brown on at least five of those six occasions formality for those motions. I am not sure how Senator Brown will now vote in relation to what is a very detailed motion put forward by Senator Cook to be dealt with by formality, a motion that—to use the Australian Labor Party opposition's position on this issue—is far more appropriate to be debated in detail on a Thursday afternoon. I would imagine this is by far the most suitable time, where you do get at least a couple of hours usually to get detailed debates where senators can contribute to what is without any doubt—we will not disagree with Senator Cook on this issue—an issue that remains one of the most important to face mankind, as it has for really all of the years since the late 1940s.
I have got detailed briefing notes on the coalition's position on the detail of the motion, but it is inappropriate on the actual suspension motion itself to go into that. But I think the Senate deserves an explanation by certainly the government whip.
—Opposition.
—The opposition whip; I do not think the government whip would be capable of explaining the 180 degree turn. 
—I could have a go at it.
—There may be a good explanation, which we are happy to hear. There may well be a good explanation—I genuinely look forward to hearing that—as to why the Australian Labor Party would seem to be contradicting a policy that has been clearly stated in this chamber on at least six occasions that I have been able to find at short notice. So that is why we would oppose the time of the chamber being taken up with a debate not only on the motion but also on the suspension motion, particularly when it could have easily been nominated as a general business item for this afternoon.",SENATE,<title>NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY REVIEW CONFERENCE</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1,speech
"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-03-09,"—I would like to respond to the invitation from the Manager of Government Business in the Senate, Senator Campbell. Senator Campbell has been in this place much longer than I have and I presume understands the forms of this place better, given that he is Manager of Government Business. I presume he would therefore know that a general business motion is not debated as a matter of formality. Whilst I agree with part of his recitation as to our policy, what he should understand is that we do not have a means of guaranteeing that this matter will actually be voted upon expeditiously unless we go through the process of asking for formality, as has been done this morning. The fact that the government has denied formality allows for it to be debated. But where we are seeking to pursue a motion it is entirely consistent with our policy to ask that it be debated. The government has denied formality. It will be debated. It is a foreign affairs motion. So there is absolutely nothing inconsistent with the actions this morning and our stated policy.
I understood that the government would oppose this motion today and Senator Cook has proceeded to the point that we are now at in seeking suspension. I will not detail the reasons for urgency, because I do not understand that the urgency motion is in fact opposed; I am simply responding to Senator Campbell's request for me to detail our position. As I have explained, this is absolutely consistent with Labor's position in relation to foreign affairs motions.",SENATE,<title>NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY REVIEW CONFERENCE</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2000-03-09,"—Labor is muddle-headed and is back to front over its policy of discussing matters which have international flavour or import. It does persistently block me and Democrats members when we bring forward matters such as West Papua, Tibet, Burma and so on, but here we have a matter of international importance which Labor wants debated, and I am going to support it because when they lapse from doing the wrong thing into doing the right thing they deserve to get support. But it is important that Labor reviews its position regarding the debate on foreign affairs and matters of international importance, which are all important things for the Senate to debate. The last thing that needs to be said about this is it is very high-handed of Labor to believe that it should be able to debate matters like this when it wants to but other members of the Senate should not be able to. That is inconsistent and it is wrong.",SENATE,<title>NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY REVIEW CONFERENCE</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,5,1,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2000-03-09,"—Many people have been quoted in this debate today, but the authoritative source on the Labor Party's attitude was a statement made by John Faulkner. Because all the subsequent debates have been shorthanded debates, no-one has gone back to the basic tenets that we laid out at that stage. The basic tenet was that we did not believe motions on foreign affairs criticising sovereign nations should go through undebated. Senator Brown has listed several here today, all of which may be good causes but all of which are motions going to the behaviour of other governments. For this chamber to carry those motions with that debate is untenable. Yes, we did take the stand. The government, of course, basically agrees with us, but we had to take the initiative—they would not. That is basically the fact—we had to do it. But at that time, as I recall, John Faulkner pointed out that motions recognising anniversaries, international conferences and treaties would be exempted. If you look at the record, they have been exempted. The only difficulty with this motion is that it probably covers them both a little, although it does not directly interfere with or directly criticise actions of sovereign governments. If it did it, we acknowledge that it would have to be debated in full. 
We are not saying that we will not move such motions as Senator Brown has been talking about. We will not have those motions requested to be declared formal without debate. This motion,  however, falls into a different category. It acknowledges treaties and what is happening in the UN and it reaffirms previously stated views. As such, it does qualify on the grounds that we have put it forward. So I repeat: our attitude to debating foreign affairs matters in this chamber is that if they involve serious matters, especially to do with criticism of other governments—which usually means that we send them our resolution and they respond—they must be debated. It is not that they should not be put through and that they should not be carried: it is that they should be debated in this chamber. But we always support motions relating to treaties, United Nations activities and anniversaries reaffirming what has previously been carried in this chamber. What we, of course, often have here is `stuntism'—that is, motions moved every day of the week because someone has `limelightitis'. That is what we want to head off.
We want to head off the half-hour gratis debate by grandstanders which has nothing to do with urgency but everything to do with the substance of the motion. That is why we took this particular position. It is wasting the Senate's time and also misrepresenting the Senate's position when the resolution does go overseas. Not everyone overseas understands the Byzantine nature of this place. They take us more seriously than we do. When the Senate carries a motion they think, `Gosh, this impinges on our relationship with Australia.' That misunderstands the relationship between the parliament and the executive. That is why we resist some of these motions and why we will not allow the devices of the Senate to be misused. But do not misrepresent our original position. It is not the position put in shorthand explanations in suspension debates; it was the original statement of principle that Senator Faulkner put down in this chamber. This motion happens to be consistent with that statement. The only difficulty and grey area with such a long motion is that you can pick a line or two out that maybe just switches over into the other category. But, overwhelmingly, it fits the category of resolutions that Senator Faulkner put down. In any event, we are not going to be abrogating our principles today. It was not declared formal, so it now meets all our criteria and let's get on with the debate.

"Schacht, Sen Chris",ALP,2000-03-09,"—I have three minutes to conclude my remarks from yesterday. In my concluding remarks, I again want to emphasise that a substantial majority of the Australian public and a substantial majority of the Australian parliament do not agree with the narrow-minded attitude taken by some senators and some House of Representatives members, particularly those in the National Party, and Senator Harradine.
Senator Harradine is consistent on this issue of wanting to ban material that he thinks is too sexually explicit and wanting to interfere in what adults do in private. The National Party are doing this for purely politically motivated reasons in trying to say to their own constituency, which they misjudge completely, that they are defending the family, defending children, et cetera, from this material. 
The present system, as I said yesterday, has worked very well for 30 years. I would be much more interested to hear the remarks of Senator McGauran, for example, or Senator Harradine about their concerns and problems with children having access to this material if I had heard them make speeches about the significant number of problems that have been identified in the last few decades in the Catholic Church, where priests have abused their position and have sexually assaulted children. I have not heard many speeches from Senator Harradine or Senator McGauran criticising the church for being seen to be doing hardly anything to overcome the abuse that has occurred endlessly for years and is now being exposed. If you are fair dinkum about censorship issues and your concern, you would make a lot more speeches in the Senate about the abuse that children have suffered at the hands of guardians from the Catholic Church and other churches over the years. We do not hear anything from the senators on that.
In conclusion, there is a substantial majority of Australians who do not agree with this bizarre effort—as I would call it—made by Senator Harradine and the National Party to roll the Attorney-General on a very reasonable reform which we have supported and the state attorneys-general have supported. I think this fixation that some senators have completely demeans them and this place and the majority of Australians. A majority of this parliament will stand and fight those who want to interfere with the privacy of what adults can do in their own relationships, and we will not allow members of parliament to tell people what they should and should not do.

"Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha",AD,2000-03-09,"—I rise briefly to make a few remarks in relation to the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill 1998 and the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Charges Bill 1998. I suspect I am part of that majority to which Senator Chris Schacht referred who believe that in this nation we have struck a workable balance between civil libertarian views and the views that I certainly hold dear—that is, the idea of freedom of speech, freedom of press, et cetera—and various protections which ensure that young people especially are not viewing things that are undesirable, inappropriate or contain illegal acts. In his remarks yesterday, Senator Schacht put on the record very clearly what our current censorship regimes prohibit, and quite rightly too. I think we have struck a workable balance and we should commend previous governments for being able to strike that balance.
The Democrats have already put on record some of our concerns, not only in the remarks from Senator Brian Greig on this bill but also in the Democrats' and Greens' minority report. We have already expressed some of the concerns we have in relation to the imposition of what we consider a new tax. We are under no illusions as to the effect of these bills in relation to imposing a tax, and we have certainly put forward our concerns in relation to how this tax is intended to operate within the context of the ANTS package. We certainly support powers that enable charges to be waived and in relation to exemption of certain films from classifications. Those remarks are on record.
As we stated in our minority report, signed off by Senator Andrew Bartlett, the Democrats support a legitimate role by the federal government in classifying material in the public domain. However, we have always opposed—and I hope will continue to oppose—the restriction of adult access to material that generally would be acceptable to reasonable adults. We believe, similarly in relation to regulation of the Internet, that classification and content regulation should be based on empowerment of responsible adults rather than some kind of command and control censorship mechanism. We have made this position clear throughout our history—through the committee report, through the debates on this bill and also during the debate on the online services bill last year. I believe there are many congruous issues between some of these bills and the debate we have had about the NVE classification and indeed the online services legislation, which unfortunately passed the chamber last year. Ever increasing media saturation and media divergence requires a dynamic, responsive and comprehensive classification scheme and therefore a legislative agenda which addresses the fundamental questions of classification.
Unfortunately, in this place and in a number of other places fundamental classification issues are often disguised or marginalised by sensationalism and political point scoring—playing on media hype and stereotypes. I think we have seen a bit of that in this debate, or at least played out in the media over recent days. That is not to be dismissive of community concern and opinion on these issues. In fact, quite the contrary. It is rather that public opinion on such issues is being misrepresented on occasions in this place. So far in this debate we have seen an overwhelming focus on places like Fyshwick and other districts in Australia and in the media there has been a similar emphasis on such places. Of course, the media has managed to emphasise the viewing of a number of videos by various members of parliament. I think Buck's transsexual adventure was one of them, but various movies or videos along those lines.
Sure, non-violent erotica makes good headlines. However, I would suggest—in keeping with evidence indicating that extreme violence and racism are of greater concern—that perhaps explicit sexual material should not pose the same kind of sensationalist threat. Racism and issues of violence are things that stir community attitudes, and quite rightly, but they stir community attitudes more so than issues of sexually explicit material. The sensationalist manner in which some members of the government—more so National Party members—have approached not only these bills but other bills that we anticipate, has been unfortunate. 
I note a poll by the Sunday program in April last year which posed the question, `Which of the following are you most concerned about: sex and nudity on television, violence on television, or senators telling us what we can watch?' The results of this survey had four per cent of respondents concerned about sex; 12 per cent concerned about violence and 84 per cent concerned about senators telling us what we can watch. This might be indicative of how the public is beginning to view the classification debate. The public associate classification with wider concerns about censorship and politicians dictating content to the wider community.
Furthermore, on the issue of X-rated videos specifically, the Age in April 1997—and I acknowledge that that is going back a couple of years—showed that 83 per cent of Australia thought that non-violent sexually explicit X-rated videos should be legally available. Although this survey was taken a couple of years ago, it was in the midst of a debate about the major effects of banning these particular videos. However, if there is a public demand for such material, then it seems appropriate to label it as that and allow for differentiation from violent representations. This is an issue that has been canvassed in this debate.
The Australian Democrats have consistently supported regulation and classification based on the empowerment of responsible adults, instead of that command and control approach that is evident across some of these debates. The online services bill was a fine example of that command and control attitude, but one in which the Democrats disregarded sensationalism and command and control regulation, or certainly in that case, unabashed censorship. As we stated in our minority report, the government does have a responsibility to provide a system of efficient, unbiased and cost effective classification to industry and consumers. In many respects the bills that we anticipate and the bills that we are dealing with—although not in relation to the imposition of a tax—have been a long time coming, and certainly the NVE classification is something that we will be dealing with soon.
In relation to the Internet we have made it clear that we oppose the restriction of adult access to Internet content where that same content is available in other media. The non-violent erotica category—and there have been quite a few reflections on that in this debate—has the support of the Democrats, as well as state and territory governments. I notice that yesterday the Deputy Prime Minister, John Anderson, stated in response to media questioning that:
In a nutshell the term non-violent erotica has a sort of a warm, cuddly overtone.
To me it seems that the term `non-violent erotica' is just that—non-violent erotica. There is no fuzzying around the edges, but it is rather an instructive or descriptive term. It is a classification that has widespread political and community support.
The Office of Film and Literature Classification's primary objectives with regard to classification are: to assist adults to make informed decisions about films, publications and computer games which they or those in their care may read, view or play; and to enable the film, publishing and computer game industries to produce and market their products in accordance with public classification standards and conditions of sale and exhibition. I do believe that we have had a good regime. I commend a lot of the work that the government and the Attorney-General have been doing in relation to reclassifications, or the NVE category. I think it is hard to strike that balance between civil libertarian values and also ensuring that not only people's rights but also their needs are protected, especially in relation to young people. I do believe that adult responsibility should be a central component of any attempt to control the way in which young people use varying forms of the media.
Once again, I put on record the Democrat views in relation to issues of classification or censorship, and I also reiterate our concerns about the creation of a new tax while supporting the power under this proposed legislation to waiver charges.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,2000-03-09,"—I wish to speak for a very short time and thank the minister for giving me this time to respond to Senator Schacht's address to the Senate in which he raised the whole issue of censorship. It is a broad issue and a grey area, because views range from one end of the spectrum to the other. It should be noted that since this government came into power in 1996 there have been many changes to our censorship laws. I suppose on any analysis they have been made more conservative and certainly more understandable than they were prior to us coming into government. We believe that those changes have been, on any analysis, community based, and in fact, community accepted, if not community demanded.
A great deal of those changes were prompted by the movie Salo, which was the movie that explicitly showed minors being exploited. That was the line in the sand and since then there have been many reviews of our censorship board and censorship laws. For example—and what could be wrong with this?—the censorship board has been changed so that it is far more community based. More people are being appointed to the board from the community than previously. Previously the board was far more representative of the arts community and critics. The board did not have community based people and it lacked a number of women. That has also changed. There are now more women on the censorship board and the review board. What can be wrong with that?
Further to that, the government has looked at the classifications. I am not so sure that they have been as much tightened up as better defined, more crystal clear. More commonsense has been brought to the censorship debate. Senator Schacht thinks that is a trend, that we have gone too far. We would object to his analysis and say it is far more community based and responsive to the community. We believe the community wants a line drawn in the sand. We do not win them all. Senator Harradine does not win them all. Recently, the movie Romance was released to our screens. There was an outcry in relation to that movie, that it is more explicit than we have ever seen, but it falls under the threshold, I would say, of Salo, which was exploitation of minors.
—That wasn't the outcry at all; the outcry was because the movie was banned.
(Senator Lightfoot)—Order!
—I am being properly and rightly advised to ignore that. But my point is we do not have draconian censorship laws in the community at all. Of late there has been in the press information or news that the coalition is reassessing its classification of X to NVE. We have simply pulled that legislation out to reassess it, to discuss it, to get a greater community response. If there is any doubt on it we will look at it again. We are simply re-studying it. The National Party are unashamed—always have been; I do not know why you think we would change or why you would want us to change—social conservatives. There are all types in this parliament. There are the Senator Schachts and then there is the National Party, and the two will never meet. It is as simple as that.
I would not get too excited about the re-examination of the classification, because we simply want to make the labelling far more commonsense, far more understandable, so when you pull it off the shelf in the ACT or the Northern Territory you know what you are getting. That is community based, that is community responsive and it is commonsense. As for Senator Schacht's attack on the whole of the Catholic Church, I would say that is utterly irrelevant to this debate and says more about the man than the issue.",SENATE,"<title>CLASSIFICATION (PUBLICATIONS, FILMS AND COMPUTER GAMES) CHARGES BILL 1998</title>",<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1,speech
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2000-03-09,"—I thank senators for their contributions. I am disappointed, of course, that the opposition continues to oppose the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Charges Bill 1998 and the complementary amendments that are in the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill 1998. This is only going to increase the burden on the public purse to the benefit of commercial operators. As the Attorney-General said in the debate in the House, the government does not believe that it is either fair or appropriate to use public funds to subsidise businesses involved for commercial gain in the production or distribution of publications, films or computer games. The government does not think that it is at all unreasonable that the industry should be expected to pay for the services and benefits it receives from the national classification scheme. 
The charges to be levied by the charges bill are designed to cover the costs of activities ancillary to the classifications services provided by the Office of Film and Literature Classification. These include certain research, the community liaison officer scheme, policy development, and ministerial support. While these activities are related to an efficient and effective classification and enforcement scheme, their cost cannot, for constitutional reasons, be included in the fees for the provision of classifications services. They, nevertheless, benefit the industry. For example, the community liaison officer scheme, which now operates in all jurisdictions, is designed to increase compliance with the classifications scheme, which clearly benefits those sectors of the industry that do comply with the law.
Policy development and research assist in improving consistency in decision making and in ensuring that classification decisions reflect community standards. The government is aware that sections of the industry have expressed concern about the effect of the 1997 classification fee increases and the further increases under the charges bill on the availability of material that has a limited market appeal in Australia. To address those concerns Ernst and Young were engaged to review the charges structure in consultation with the industry, with a view to seeing whether greater equity can be provided to applicants who submit material for classification that does in fact have a limited market appeal. The review's conclusion was there was no single compelling argument supporting continuation of the proposed charging structure or, alternatively, changing the charging structure to provide concessions based on limited market appeal. Senator Greig wanted to know whether the Ernst and Young and KPMG reports were public. He did not think they were, and he invited clarification of that. The Ernst and Young report is public. The KPMG report is not yet finalised. Once it has been, it will also be made public.
Despite that, the government considered that there was a case to enable certain material, where limited distribution was involved, to be classified at reduced rates, and it has taken the following action as a consequence of that. The amendment bill empowers the director of the Classification Board to waive, in whole or part, classification charges for limited distribution of specialist interest material which comprises a documentary record of an event or something of a cultural or like nature, if it is in the public interest to do so. The government proposes to further expand this power in the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1999 by empowering the director to waive fees for short films from new and emerging film-makers. This means that films of this kind, which would usually fall outside the exempt categories, will still need to be classified but that the fee for doing so can be waived or reduced. 
The amendment bill proposes that the current exemptions in the act be expanded to cover current affairs, hobbyist, sporting, family, live performance musical presentation and religious films. These will be in addition to the current exemptions in the act which cover films for business, accounting, professional, scientific or educational purposes. Films within these proposed new exempt categories are typically distributed to a very specialised market in often relatively small numbers. Removing the need for them to be classified should ensure their continued availability and thereby contribute to product diversity in the Australian market. I think that will answer the questions Senator Cooney raised about the Melbourne Cup and so on. 
The combined cost to revenue of these measures is estimated to be $354,000. The government believes that its response to concerns about the effect of the increase in classification fees and charges on certain industry sectors has been both timely and responsible and that this should address many of the issues that have been raised. Given these factors and the fact that the industries which are embraced by the National Classification Scheme have a high turnover each year, the government can see no justification for the stance that the opposition has taken on the Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Charges Bill. What rejecting the charges bill and the attached amendments in the other bill really means is that there are some services that, but for the existence of an industry that makes a fortune, would not exist. It is fair to say that they should therefore pay for them. I understand that the opposition and the Democrats want to say, `No, let the taxpayer pay. Let's not make business pay and the movie moguls and the people who are making megabucks out this pay. Let's make the taxpayer pay for this.' I think that is an appalling situation. 
—The question is that the bills be read a second time. Before I put the question, I ask: does the Senate require the question be put separately? 
—Yes, Mr Acting Deputy President. I would request that the question be divided at this stage and that the bills be dealt with separately.

"Cooney, Sen Barney",ALP,2000-03-09,"—The Norfolk Island Amendment Bill 1999 [2000] seeks to make changes to the way the Norfolk Island government is run. Perhaps the most controversial part of this bill is that which deals with the group that will be able to vote for the government on Norfolk Island. At the moment, the people who make up the government of Norfolk Island are elected by the residents of Norfolk Island, and those residents include people mainly from Australia. A vast proportion of the residents are from Australia, but there is also a substantial group of people from New Zealand and a lesser group of people from elsewhere. This bill proposes that the only people able to have a say in the government of Norfolk Island, whether in terms of being in the government or voting for the government, will be Australian citizens.
The proposition is put that this is Australian territory. If people do not want to be Australians then why should they vote for its government? Indeed, on the mainland, that would be a reasonable proposition and one that I would agree with. In other words, if we were electing the government of Australia, the people who vote for that government ought to be Australians. That is the situation in Australia now, except in the case of some people from the United Kingdom who were here before 1984.
The minister will no doubt come to the situation on Norfolk Island when he is giving his speech. Norfolk island is in a situation that is unique in the sense that a precedent has been set—and the minister would understand the importance of precedence. This island has been run for some substantial time now on the basis that everybody there, all the residents, have a say in the government. To change that now without any real reason seems to be too harsh a penalty. To use a hackneyed but very effective phrase, it is applying dramatic surgery when dramatic surgery is not called for. 
This is an island that has, in its own view, an interesting relationship with the mainland. It certainly is part of Australia; about that there is absolutely no doubt. The residents who have come to Norfolk Island have come there since the United Kingdom took possession of it in the last century. It is not as if this island was inhabited, invaded, conquered and became part of the British Empire and then became part of Australia as a result of that. No, this island was settled subsequent to occupation by the United Kingdom; nevertheless it has been settled on a particular basis. 
People were brought from Pitcairn Island, for example, in the century before the last and they have lived there ever since. It is a select population, on the basis that Australians cannot go and simply live there. You have to get, as it were, the blessing of the people on the island. All that might almost sound elitist, but nevertheless here we have a small population, one that has got its own history and its own sense of history, including the history of the Pitcairnese, the descendants of Fletcher and the others from the Bounty. In addition to that there are people who have gone there without any connection to the Bounty but nevertheless feel that this is a unique population. In that sense they want to embrace everybody who is there, and that seems a reasonable proposition. 
After all, we can hardly say New Zealanders are altogether foreigners to Australia. If we have any group of people living in another country that are near to us, then New Zealanders would fit that bill. I think to exclude New Zealanders in this situation is placing too much of a strain upon the good relationship that we might otherwise have with New Zealand.
There was some concern about the gun laws on the island. That was one of those matters which had the government concerned, and it was properly concerned in my view. The gun laws that apply in Australia did not apply there and they ought to have. As I understand it, that matter has now been largely cleared up and it is not the issue that it might once have been.
There is also the issue of the Administrator and the Deputy Administrator and who elects the Deputy Administrator. It is the opposition's view that the Deputy Administrator ought to be elected by the people who run the island. This is a bill which I think interferes unnecessarily and too savagely with a community that is a discrete community with a particular history and with people who now want to keep expressing their identity as Norfolk Islanders.
Should we as a nation—when compared with Norfolk Island we are a very powerful nation—use our muscle and approach them like a bovver boy might approach some vulnerable person in the streets of London? Perhaps not; perhaps we ought to have some sensitivity. Perhaps we ought to understand their position and not gallop at this in the way we presently are.
As I remember it, people came from Norfolk Island to appear before the committee. They had gone to great effort to put their position forward. They certainly weren't revolutionaries. One of the attractive features about them was a lot of them were getting on towards my age and it was nice to have a committee where the people you were talking to were somewhere near the age of wisdom, which I consider I am at now.
—We tolerate young people, Barney, just like you.
—Minister, you are very young. That is what provoked me to say those things. There are all sorts of legal, constitutional and other reasons that might be developed about this but the most evocative thing is that we have this community with a history of its own—and no doubt the minister will point out that it is not a history that goes back centuries. Nevertheless it is a small community—I think there are about 1,800 people there; fewer than 2,000 in any event. They have gone along their way and perhaps we ought to let them go their way from now on.
They do not get any health services from Australia, and I do not say that as any sort of criticism because I am sure that, if they wanted to, they would be able to with arrangements being made and with taxes paid at the proper rate. I do not put that forward as a condemnation of Australia or any of the governments in Australia. I simply say that they are different in the sense that the benefits they get are not the same as the benefits other Australians get and in that sense there is a distinguishing mark. When I say `other Australians', I mean other residents of Australia because certainly the New Zealanders, although not citizens of Australia, are nevertheless residents in that part of Australian territory. 
Of course, the proposition could be put—and it has a validity about it—that, if they want to live in Australia and vote for a government on Australian soil, why should they not become Australians? But I think this is a situation where we can make an exception in all the circumstances and in the interests of being nice, at least, to a small community that feels that, out there in the Pacific Ocean, it has its own way of life with which it would like to continue.",SENATE,<title>NORFOLK ISLAND AMENDMENT BILL 1999 [2000]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Bourne, Sen Vicki",AD,2000-03-09,"—I thank Senator Mackay for letting me take her place on the speakers list. It is interesting to note that the Norfolk Island Amendment Bill is not supported by the Norfolk Island government, nor is it supported by many members of the Norfolk Island community. The Norfolk government has said that it does not want Australia interfering in its local government or its electoral laws, both of which have worked well for 20 years. The government's firearms provisions have now been withdrawn by the government, and these too were said by the Norfolk Islanders to be quite unnecessary. The Senate Selection of Bills Committee last year found that this bill contained contentious issues and referred it to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee. The minority report of that committee, signed by Senator Lyn Allison of my party, found no compelling reason to support the bill and recommended against it. The Democrats will therefore not be supporting the bill. But, if the government wishes to refer a study of the electoral system on Norfolk Island to a joint committee, as recommended by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee in its report, we would support that referral.",SENATE,<title>NORFOLK ISLAND AMENDMENT BILL 1999 [2000]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2000-03-09,"—The Norfolk Island Amendment Bill, of course, is a machinery bill. It is a bit like a curate's egg—it is good in parts—but various parts are of concern to some senators. One aspect of the bill is that the Deputy Administrator will be appointed by the minister, not through the Governor-General. I imagine this has been put there so that a minister can act more quickly than having to go through the procedures of executive council when some emergency situation occurs. The Governor-General also appoints the Administrator, and the incumbent Administrator has had his term extended by two years.
Tony Messner is well known to some of us in the Senate, as he served in this chamber for a number of years. He was an affable, hardworking senator who achieved ministerial rank but whose career was foreshortened by the coalition's electoral slump in the 1980s. Of course, his appointment is a job for the boys—no question about that. He was the PM's mate. There is no doubt that he was always a terribly loyal supporter of John Howard. But reports on his performance in the job of Administrator of Norfolk Island are positive. Probably he is one of the more deserving `jobs for the boys' applicants than many of the other sycophants who have been picked up in the system, and I wish him well in his next two years in the term.
I am reminded that, back in 1994, the then Senator Mal Colston aspired to the position of Administrator of Norfolk Island. My colleague Senator Faulkner held, amongst other things, portfolio responsibility for the territories. He rejected Colston's supplications on the basis that he regarded him as a time-serving place seeker. But it was also discovered that the then Senator Colston—at the time he did a grand tour of all the territories to see which one he would like the most—had claimed travel allowance. I discovered it only at the time that Senator Colston made his supplications for the position. I also found out that he was a recipient of hospitality from the then Administrator of Norfolk Island. So, in other words, he went over to Norfolk Island, stayed with the Administrator and claimed travel allowance. Well, he is a better bush lawyer than I am because he was able to prove to me that it was legal. I was not able to prove to him that it was morally bankrupt to do so. 
It was also known, by the way, that this matter was known to the coalition. Certain coalition senators had also gained this information but were awaiting his expected appointment to Norfolk Island before they tipped the bucket on him. But Senator Faulkner never gave them the opportunity.
History will record that the ALP has paid a major price for failing to support Colston and appoint him as Administrator of Norfolk Island. But I also think history will say that we were correct. The citizens of Norfolk Island certainly made their views known by signing a petition—800-odd, I think—pleading with us not to appoint the then Senator Colston. It is true that the Labor Party let Senator Colston disappear from the Senate on 30 June 1999 without comment. But privately I pondered what would be his first act as Citizen Colston. Sympathetically, I thought he might be consulting his doctors. Less sympathetically, I thought he might have been in conference with his legal advisers. I also thought he might have done the decent thing and written to those coalition members who had—albeit in a desultory way—praised him during the valedictories. But no, he did not. His first act as a private citizen on 1 July 1999 was to write a letter, which I intend to share with the Senate today. The letter is, of course, private and confidential. It notes his address, which I am not going to repeat to the Senate here today unless I am asked to table the letter, and it is dated 1 July 1999. It is addressed to the Secretary, Remuneration Tribunal, Post Office Box 281, Civic Square, Canberra, ACT, 2608. It states:
Dear Ms Sadaukas 
I would be grateful if you could place the following matter before the members of the Remuneration Tribunal.
I have been provided with a list of entitlements of Life Gold Pass holders by the Ministerial and Parliamentary Services Group of the Department of Finance. In part, it lists costs which cannot be met at Government expense. One of these is the meal components of travel, with certain exceptions.
On some long distance rail services in Queensland, travel and on board meal components are purchased separately. In this case the ruling limits the Gold Pass entitlement to travel only.
I would be grateful if you could examine this provision to determine whether it is possible to cover meal costs on long distance rail services.
I would appreciate it if this request is not made available publicly.
Yours sincerely 
Dr Mal Colston
Having left the Senate with his full superannuation, having had the DPP judge him not fit to stand trial, he uses the first occasion when he has left this Senate to stick the taxpayers with yet more expenses.

"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2000-03-09,"—My contribution will not be as potentially illuminating as Senator Ray's. I thank Senator Cooney for speaking first in this debate on the Norfolk Island Amendment Bill 1999 [2000] as I was attending the briefing from Dr Switkowski to federal members in relation to the Telstra cuts. I apologise to the Senate for that. 
On behalf of the opposition, I officially indicate that we will be opposing the bill. I wish to go into some detail as to why. The Norfolk Island Amendment Bill, which is before us today, was introduced into the Senate almost a year ago. At that time, the Selection of Bills Committee immediately recognised that there were difficulties with the bill and referred it to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. The bill being presented to us today remains as problematic, as far as we are concerned, as it was at this time last year. 
The bill has three purposes. Firstly, the bill proposes to alter the citizenship requirements that currently apply on Norfolk Island with regard to enrolling to vote and standing for election to the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly. Currently, Australian citizenship is not a requirement for either of these processes. This bill introduces Australian citizenship as a prerequisite for both. Secondly, the bill proposes to have the Deputy Administrator appointed by the responsible minister for territories. Currently, the appointment is made by the Governor-General. Thirdly, the bill proposes to remove firearms and ammunition from schedule 2 to schedule 3 of the Norfolk Island Act 1979, thereby permitting the minister to veto legislation passed by the assembly about those matters. This amendment is to be removed from the bill. The Labor Party supports that removal.  
At this point, Labor reject the remaining two proposals. Labor and Democrat senators from the Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee submitted a minority report outlining their opposition to the bill. We remain, at this point, in opposition to the bill. I will expand on the reasons why. The provisions setting down the requirements for voting and eligibility to stand for election on Norfolk Island are contained in the Legislative Assembly Act 1979 (Norfolk Island), an act of the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly, and the Norfolk Island Act 1979 respectively. 
Let me briefly describe the legal and constitutional framework that currently operates on the island. The island is a Commonwealth territory operating as a partially self-governing territory. In 1979, the Norfolk Island Act was passed setting up partial self-government on the island. The Administrator performs the role of administering the territory. An executive council, its members drawn from the Legislative Assembly, advises the Administrator on all matters relating to the government of the territory. The Assembly has the power to legislate to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the territory. This power is as broad as that given to any other state or territory in the Commonwealth. However, the Commonwealth retains the right of veto over certain matters. This list of matters is to be distinguished from the list of Commonwealth powers contained in the Constitution which are exclusive to the Commonwealth. Unless specified, no Commonwealth act applies on Norfolk Island. 
Requirements for eligibility to vote in Norfolk Island elections for the Legislation Assembly and eligibility to stand for election are the responsibility of the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly. Under existing provisions of the act, a person can stand for election to the Assembly if they are aged 18 or over, are entitled to vote at elections and have been ordinarily resident on the island for the five years immediately preceding the date of nomination. They must be present on the island for 900 days during a four-year period immediately preceding an application for enrolment. These requirements clearly differ from the requirements in any other state or territory. 
The bill before us today seeks to establish Australian citizenship as a requirement for eligibility for future elections to the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly as well as for future enrolments on the Norfolk Island electoral roll. It also seeks to relax the residency requirements currently in operation. It proposes to reduce the residency requirements to six months, reflecting the maximum amount of time allowed in any other state. 
This bill and its key amendments to the Norfolk Island electoral provisions will alter the current status of Norfolk Island significantly. The relationship between the Commonwealth and the Norfolk Island government has been viewed variously as from one resembling a federal-local government relationship to one representing a federal-state relationship. The real problem, highlighted by this observation—and in our view it is exacerbated by this bill—is that the government does not seem to have a firm position on the appropriate degree of self-government for Norfolk Island. 
The most detailed exposition of the government's position is found in the minister's response to the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee where he made the following points. Firstly, like other external and mainland territories, Norfolk Island will remain an integral part of the Commonwealth of Australia. Secondly, the Commonwealth government remains open to realistic proposals from the Norfolk Island government for the enhancement of internal self-government, subject to improvements in revenue raising. 
Despite these views, today we have a bill before us that, in the view of the Norfolk Islanders, seeks to peg back the autonomy of the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly and the legal system operating on the island. The coalition 1998 election statement reads: 
The Coalition recognises the unique position of Norfolk Island in the Australian Federation and is committed to continue the development of internal self-government in Norfolk Island, in cooperation with the Island's Government and Legislative Assembly, and appropriate to the efficient administration of the Territory.  
This attitude has apparently now changed. The Norfolk Islanders strongly feel that this bill not only indicates a move away from current levels of autonomy enjoyed by the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly but also has exposed the government as incapable of cooperating with the Norfolk Island government. This bill is a stark illustration of this government's reluctance to engage in genuine discussion with the community on Norfolk Island. To be fair, there has been some discussion of the matter with the Norfolk Island government, ironically at the instigation of non-government senators on the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. Four members of the Norfolk Island government attended the committee's inquiry last year. However, somewhat oddly, given the subject matter, the Norfolk Island Administrator did not attend. The committee requested his attendance for both hearings yet was informed that he was unavailable to attend. No residents of the island attended the meeting.
The two hearings that the committee held were conducted in Sydney and Canberra respectively. Given that the hearings were not conducted on the island itself, Labor senators were concerned to hear from the Administrator directly, given that the committee was not going to travel to Norfolk Island. He, of course, did not turn up or was unavailable. The representatives of the Norfolk Island government who attended the hearings were vocal in their opposition to this bill. They were highly critical of the government's approach to this issue and stressed that, while some on the island do support the government's bill, their own opposition represented by far the weight of island opinion. 
The essence of the Norfolk Island government's argument in opposition to these changes is that a significant period of continuous residence on the island is the appropriate threshold requirement for eligibility for both enrolment and standing for election to the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly. Further, it is their view that the long-term demographics of the island, its geographic distance from the mainland and its highly developed form of self-government make these changes inappropriate and ill conceived. 
The Norfolk Island government are also concerned that these changes will reduce an already small pool of eligible candidates for the Legislative Assembly and admit a number of transient Australian citizens to, in their view, swamp the small electorate who are neither well versed in the distinctive ways of the island nor committed to its long-term interests. The essence of the Commonwealth argument is one of equality across the Commonwealth. The minister has written:
The aim of the legislation is to confer the same rights and responsibilities for voting on Australian citizens, ordinarily resident on Norfolk Island, as Australian citizens have elsewhere in Australia. 
That is all very well, but Norfolk Islanders feel that the island has a very distinct history and is in a unique position, a position which was recognised by the coalition, as I have already referred to, in its 1998 election statement. Perhaps it is this unique position that has allowed the government to ignore the results of a referendum held on the island last year in May. The question posed was very specific as to whether islanders agreed with the Australian government's proposal. Seventy-four per cent of Norfolk Islanders voted no, with more than 90 per cent of the eligible community voting in that referendum. 
Later that same month, Senator Allison moved a motion in this chamber calling on the government to enter into formal negotiations with the government of Norfolk Island in view of the referendum result. No such formal negotiations have taken place. What Labor is demanding today is an open and accountable approach by the government to any changes made to the legal and constitutional position on Norfolk Island. What we are demanding is full consultation and cooperation by the government with the community this bill affects, consistent with the coalition's 1998 policy. 
The federal government is frustratingly inconsistent in its approach to matters arising in state and territory jurisdictions. When the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Amendment Bill 1999 was before this chamber only a few weeks ago, the minister who is here today presenting this bill was severe in his criticism of federal government `interference' in matters falling within other jurisdictions. He accused me and my colleague Senator Lundy of what he feared. He said: 
It is the old socialist dogma that the central government knows best—that Big Brother knows best.
That is the usual cowboy stuff from this particular minister. Yet today we have the very same minister going one step further. The government is proposing to change the laws of a partially self-governing territory without even talking to them, without even consulting with them, and without the Administrator having the courtesy to attend two hearings of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. I contend that, far from being socialist dogma, this is an action I think Josef Stalin would have been proud of. It seems authoritarianism in its purest form. 
This government generally is confused about its position on the true role of the federal government. We could go on about regional policy, but I do not think we will here. There have been heated arguments recently in relation to mandatory sentencing laws in the Northern Territory and Western Australia. On this issue, federal government ministers have been horrified at the suggestion that the Commonwealth intervene. This is the very same government that intervened in Christmas Island to abolish mandatory sentencing there. 
The Prime Minister has not even been fazed by the fact that in that case Australia stands in breach of ILO conventions, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child, so adamant is the government on its stance on intervention—with one rule for the Northern Territory and another for the Indian Ocean Territories. Then again, the Prime Minister has been flirting with the idea of intervention with regard to safe injecting rooms being set up by the ACT. What is the common theme that unites these altering positions? Is it convenience or simply political expediency? We had direct intervention in the ACT with regard to heroin trials by the Prime Minister. So much for self-determination in the ACT. 
Today, the Senate is being asked to sign off an amendment that unashamedly dictates to a community who have voiced their objections loudly and resoundingly, who have invoked legal means to express their opposition and who have been ignored. What Labor is suggesting is that these amendments and the whole matter be referred to the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories for consideration in the context of the whole issue of the future of Norfolk Island, something which we are advised that that particular committee is considering or looking at in any event. 
The coalition in its 1998 policy stated that it recognises the unique position of Norfolk Island and that it will seek to develop the self-governing regime of Norfolk Island in cooperation with the island's government and Legislative Assembly. However, in our view, through its approach to this bill, it has done exactly the opposite. It now seems to be unsure of its position in relation to the appropriate degree of self-government for Norfolk Island and definitely does not seem to be working towards the development of the internal self-government of the island. We believe that the government has failed in its commitment in its own coalition policy 1998 to cooperate with the island's government and Legislative Assembly, and it is certainly their view. This is demonstrably inconsistent and reactive in its approach to issues arising under the control of other jurisdictions. In fact, the government could not even get its act together sufficiently to ensure that the Administrator attended the two Senate hearings in relation to this matter. 
We believe that, as a minimum, the government should fulfil its commitment and responsibilities to Norfolk Island. The many arguments raised by the islanders in relation to this bill and the broader questions deserve discussion with the people they affect. With no sign of cooperation that the government pledged in its 1998 commitment, Labor now calls on the government to refer the matter to the committee I referred to before to ensure that there is consultation and cooperation with the Norfolk Island government and the residents of the island. We are keen to ensure that the people of the island are central to a debate on the future parameters of the legal and constitutional position of Norfolk Island.  
Let me briefly turn to the issue of the Deputy Administrator. That is the other amendment contained in this bill, which proposes that the Deputy Administrator of Norfolk Island be appointed by the minister responsible. At present the Deputy Administrator is appointed by the Governor-General. The Deputy Administrator of Norfolk Island holds what is known as a `dormant commission'. The position is required to fill the office of the Administrator from time to time, as the need arises, when necessary duties cannot be fulfilled by the Administrator or an Acting Administrator.
We believe the government has done little to set out on the public record the merits of its case for this proposal. The government has made two points: (1) the appointment of a comparatively junior Commonwealth officer, who conventionally fills the position, to an essentially dormant commission does not warrant the attention of the Governor-General; and (2) the appointment by the territories minister is consistent with the situation in the other two external territories, Christmas Island and the Cocos Islands.
The Norfolk Island Assembly opposes the amendment. According to the Norfolk Island government, in practice acting administrators are rarely appointed. In the absence of the Administrator, it will be the Deputy Administrator who will exercise and perform all the powers and functions of the Administrator. This has occurred in the past where the Deputy Administrator has occupied the position of Administrator for up to four months.
The Assembly is also concerned by the implication of the government's argument. Do the important functions performed by the Administrator suddenly become less important when performed by a deputy? A minority report submitted by Labor and Democrat senators reflects an understanding of these arguments. It concluded that, as the Deputy Administrator is required at all times to have powers and carry out all the functions of the Administrator, the appointment of the Deputy Administrator should mirror that of the Administrator with all the associated scrutiny in relation to that process. The Labor senators of the committee rejected the proposal and Labor rejects it again today.
The opposition opposes the amendments in the Norfolk Island Amendment Bill 1999 [2000] at this point. We recommend that the proposed changes to the electoral provisions in relation to the island go through a full and proper process of consultation in cooperation with the Norfolk Island government and the residents. It is our view that the proposals be referred to the Joint Committee on the National Capital and External Territories for consultation by way of inquiry into the whole issue of Norfolk Island self-government, which would include consultation with the Norfolk Island government and the residents of Norfolk Island. We oppose the amendment to the appointment procedure of the Deputy Administrator. As stated at the beginning of my speech, we support the withdrawal of the proposed amendment to move firearms and ammunition from schedule 2 to schedule 3 on the Norfolk Island Act 1979. Hence, the opposition opposes the bill.",SENATE,<title>NORFOLK ISLAND AMENDMENT BILL 1999 [2000]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2000-03-09,"—I will not speak for very long on this bill other than to express an interest I have in the governance and operations of our territories. I would like to commence by putting on record my congratulations to Ronald Nobbs, who is the recently appointed Chief Minister of the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly. The reason I do so is that, although Ron Nobbs was born on Norfolk Island and is a resident there and that is, in a sense, his home, he spent many years in the Northern Territory. While he was there, he made a significant contribution to our community. On behalf of the people of the Territory, I take this opportunity to publicly congratulate him on that appointment.
I think what is interesting about this bill is that, besides some of the facts that my colleague Senator Mackay raised about the process in which this bill has come about, the lack of consultation with members of the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly and the Chief Minister, and the way in which this government has ignored the referendum to ascertain whether or not they wanted these changes that was actually conducted on Norfolk island during 1998, the day of—if my memory serves me right—the federal election, it is significant to have a look at, and take into account, the uniqueness of Norfolk Island and a uniqueness that they have struggled for many years to maintain. 
It is an idyllic place, thousands of kilometres from here. I think it is important to recognise that, over the years, their relationship with the Commonwealth government has in fact changed. I do not believe that it is any longer a relationship that a local government would have with a state government, for example. They believe the role they play has elevated significantly, and they see themselves almost as a state in their own right. I am not going to make a comment on whether that is a good or a bad thing. In the context of this bill, I think the way in which those people want to operate on Norfolk Island, and currently do operate on Norfolk Island, and the way in which they perceive themselves in relation to the others states and territories of the Commonwealth needs to be taken into account and has not been taken into account significantly by this government.
The main effect of this bill that I want to speak about is that it not only requires candidates in future elections to the Norfolk Island Assembly to hold Australian citizenship but also requires that only Australian citizens will be able to enrol to vote in future ballots on the island. Late last year, some people might remember, I presented an adjournment speech to this chamber after a trip I took to Guernsey. One of the main reasons I actually went to Guernsey was to simply have a look at their electoral arrangements. It is interesting to note that the island of Guernsey is doing the reverse. For many years, they had only British subjects or people from the Republic of Ireland who lived on the island and who also met a residency test voting in their local elections. They have quite recently changed the way that residents of that island can participate in their local elections by expanding the criteria on which they can get on the roll. So, in other words, they no longer have to be British subjects or from the Republic of Ireland. They in fact can be from anywhere around the world.
Why did they do that? They recognised that there were people coming from places like America, Europe and Japan that significantly contributed to the island, its economy and its lifestyle, had made a commitment to live there for a very long time, but found that they were being isolated and ostracised by the way the electoral roll and the criteria to get on the electoral roll were structured. So they have expanded their eligibility for criteria to get on the electoral roll in Guernsey. It is interesting to note, and it should be kept in mind, that the Norfolk Islanders actually communicate a lot with people in the British Isles and Guernsey. They exchange ideas, they talk, they meet at conferences and they share almost a common sense of purpose: that is, to preserve the uniqueness of the island community in which they live.
It is no wonder then that people on Norfolk Island are actually saying that they do not support this bill, that they want to preserve the criteria and the way in which people on the island are actually eligible to vote. What is significantly missing from this debate is the role that people from New Zealand play on that island. Although 81 per cent of the permanent population on Norfolk Island are Australian citizens, 16 per cent of the island's permanent population are New Zealanders; and UK citizens and people from other nationalities make up around 3½ per cent of the remaining population.
I agree with the people from Norfolk Island when they say that this bill would significantly disenfranchise some of the people in their community in an unfair and unjust way. There are people from New Zealand there, and I know this bill would preserve their right, but what of those people who would come in the future? What of those people from New Zealand and other countries who may come and stay for many years at a time and contribute to industries on the island and, after many years, would want to actually make that their permanent home? It is those kinds of people that this bill would disenfranchise.
In conclusion, I would like to quote from a representative of the Norfolk Island government, Mr Don Wright. This quote is from the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee on the consideration of this legislation. He claims: 
The conclusion reached is that there is potential for approximately ... 20 per cent of the present permanently resident population to be disenfranchised on the basis of the 1996 census results and taking into account that the grandfather clause will eventually run out.
He goes on to say:
After the effect of the grandfathering provision has been spent, the assertion in the submission is that about 20 per cent of those presently eligible to vote will become ineligible.
So I think it is important that Labor does in fact support the Norfolk Island people by not agreeing to this bill. There is a need for this situation regarding the eligibility of voters on Norfolk Island and the electoral system to be looked at, possibly by the Joint Committee on the National Capital and External Territories. At this stage, it would be fit and proper for us to not support this bill and to give the people on that island an opportunity to present their views properly and fairly to the Commonwealth government about the future of their regime.",SENATE,<title>NORFOLK ISLAND AMENDMENT BILL 1999 [2000]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,10,1,speech
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2000-03-09,"—The Norfolk Island Amendment Bill 1999 [2000] is intended to provide democratic reforms for that part of Australia which is Norfolk Island and to otherwise do a couple of very minor machinery things that were requested by Labor Party politicians when they held responsibility for the island. I regret that, yet again, the Labor Party shows its hypocrisy in its approach to these issues. You have to look no further than a couple of weeks ago at the debate on the government's bill to give the 300,000-odd people of the Australian Capital Territory the right to determine their own issues. It was opposed by Labor, and today its members come in here with the fairly shallow arguments we have heard opposing this particular bill.
A theme running through the speeches from the opposition is that it needs to be, yet again, investigated by a parliamentary committee. I think the people of Norfolk Island just about cut their wrists when they see that yet another federal government parliamentary committee is on their island conducting some form of investigation. This particular legislation results from a previous parliamentary committee, which, as I recall, had a majority of Labor Party members who said, `This is what we should do.' Many of those Labor Party members are still in the parliament. How in their caucus meetings they could now come to a different conclusion simply amazes me.
It is important just to look at the very simple provisions of this bill, and I am sure that anyone following this debate will share with me a sense of amazement as to how any parliamentarian interested in democratic rights could possibly oppose this bill. On electoral matters, the Norfolk Island Amendment Bill will extend the right to vote in the legislative assembly elections to all Australian citizens ordinarily resident on the island. How could anyone oppose that? Currently, there are a large number of Australian citizens living in that part of Australia who do not have the right to vote, and that exclusion of those people from a right to vote is supported by the Labor Party and the Democrats.
I simply cannot understand why a party like the Democrats, which prides itself on being libertarian, and the social conscience group of the Labor Party, who claim to be all for democracy and liberty, will stop Australians from voting in an Australian territory. I sympathise with Senator Cooney, who I know is a genuine libertarian, and I know he choked through the few comments he had to say whilst waiting for the shadow minister to turn up. I know that Senator Cooney, like most of the rest of us in this parliament, is very determined to ensure that Australian citizens, wherever they are in Australia, have the right to vote; and the Labor Party and the Democrats are combining to stop Australians citizens voting.
The second part of the bill is to establish Australian citizenship as a qualification for enrolment and election to the Legislative Assembly. Can you imagine any other country in the world which would allow non-citizens to become members of an elected legislature? Can you imagine any country in the world that would find that surprising? Yet the Labor Party and the Democrats are saying, `You don't have to be an Australian citizen to be part of the government of this part of Australia.' It does not happen anywhere else in Australia.  
Norfolk Island is part of Australia. There is no question about that. Yet in the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly, you do not have to be an Australian to be Chief Minister, you do not have to be an Australian to be a minister in the government, and you do not have to be an Australian to be a member of the nine-man parliament. Our legislation seeks to bring Norfolk Island into line with every other part of Australia in requiring that people standing for election have to be Australian citizens. 
There has recently been an election, and I am not sure of the nationality of a couple of the newly elected members, but all of the members of the old parliament—and that means the government, too—were Australian citizens. So it is no big deal. Most of the people who stand choose to become Australian citizens if they are not already; most of them are at the beginning. So there is no significant variation. 
The Labor Party's view is that you can come from Ghana, you can come from India, you can come from anywhere in the world and be elected Chief Minister of an Australian territory without being an Australian citizen. Without having sworn the oath of office, the oath of allegiance to Australia, you can be head of a government. How the Australian Labor Party and the Democrats could possibly come to that conclusion leaves me breathless.
There has been some suggestion—Senator Crossin said it, but after my interjection corrected herself—that rights are being taken away. No rights are being taken away from anyone. If you are not an Australian citizen and you currently have the right to vote in the Norfolk Island election, that right is preserved. We are not making those people take out Australian citizenship. They can continue to vote for as long as they live and as long as they are otherwise eligible for enrolment on Norfolk Island. So existing rights are not affected. The theme that came through from a couple of the opposition and Democrat speakers was that we are taking away rights. That is simply not true. It is simply not factual, and it is inappropriate that it should be.
To just explain in a little further detail, currently the Norfolk Island Act prescribes qualifications for election to the Legislative Assembly. Under those provisions, a person can stand for election if he or she is 18 years or over, is entitled to vote at elections and has ordinarily been resident on the island for five years immediately preceding the date of nomination. Currently, you have to live there for five years before you can have the qualifications for election. So Australians who are in that part of Australia for 4½ years do not have the qualifications for election. 
Currently, the act prescribes that a person is qualified to enrol—this is just to enrol, not to stand for election—where that person has attained the age of 18 and has been present on Norfolk Island for 900 days during the period of four years immediately preceding the application for the enrolment. So that is unlike anywhere else in Australia, where usually you have to be there for one month to get on the electoral roll. In Tasmania, it is a bit different, where you have to be in the state for six months to get on the electoral roll. In Norfolk Island, it is 900 days, which is about three years—so a long period of time. Our legislation proposes that Australians who are on Norfolk Island for six months—as in Tasmania—have the right to vote in that part of Australia. The Labor Party and the Democrats would restrict the right of Australians in that situation to enrol to vote.
The proposed electoral amendments would bring electoral provisions prescribing enrolment and entitlement to stand for election more into line with those in other legislatures. Under our provisions, an Australian citizen would be eligible to stand for election to the Legislative Assembly. An ordinarily resident qualifying period of six months would also be introduced. I emphasise again: existing rights to non-Australians enrolled on the island remain. They are preserved, so we are not taking them away.
The other part of the bill is simply a processional issue which was requested by the Hon. Warren Snowdon when he was parliamentary secretary in charge of Norfolk Island. Mr Snowdon obviously realised that the appointment for a short period of time of the Official Secretary, a government public servant, as the fill-in administrator, if I might say, really should be done as a matter of form. Mr Snowdon agreed with that, saw the sense of that and asked that that happen. We are actually doing that, and we find that the Labor Party and the Democrats are opposing it. It is a very simple administrative matter to appoint the Official Secretary on a temporary, fill-in basis without having to go through the procedures of approaching the Governor-General to appoint the Official Secretary as the Deputy Administrator. It can only be sheer bloody-mindedness on behalf of the opposition parties to oppose that. I repeat: it was a proposal suggested by Mr Snowdon. Should this debate get into the committee stage, I ask Senator Mackay to explain to me why Mr Snowdon's request is now being opposed by her party.  
—As Senator Newman rightly interjects, the left does not know what the right is doing. It amazes me that we get these stupid decisions—and I have to say that—which the Labor Party proposed and which we adopted, but which now the Labor Party is opposing. People can make up their own minds on why this is, but it is certainly not an approach towards good government. That is what the bill is all about.
I want to briefly comment on some of the speeches made by various speakers in this debate. I have already expressed my sympathy to Senator Cooney. I know he was very uncomfortable, and the lack of his normal fluency demonstrated that he was uncomfortable that, because of party rigidity and discipline, he had to actually vote against these democratic reforms. Grappling for words, he said that it was a change without reason. Senator Cooney, the reason is democracy—a pretty simple reason. Australians living in Australia should have a right to vote. Many of them are excluded. Senator Cooney was not terribly familiar with the issue of the Deputy Administrator, and I make no further comment on that. It is simply a clerical matter and not really a question of election by the people on the island.
Senator Cooney mentioned the guns issue, and perhaps I should have briefly mentioned it. Initially we had intended to override Norfolk Island legislation which did not comply with the national guns legislation adopted by every state and territory in Australia. After the introduction of the bill, the Norfolk Island government actually altered its law to comply and, accordingly, there was no reason for the government to proceed with that amendment, and we consequently withdrew it. I might say that we withdrew it and indicated as such in the course of many consultations, approaches and discussions that I had with the Assembly and the government about various issues. They had urged me to adopt that action if they fixed their bill. That was a process of long consultation and discussion between both parties, and the right result was achieved.
Senator Bourne's brief speech indicates that again the Democrats have no real interest in this. They are blindly following the Labor position, as they tend to do most often. Senator Bourne's speech showed that she had no real understanding of the issues involved. Her speech was notable for its shallowness. Again it surprises me that the Democrats—who do pride themselves on some understanding and commitment to democratic reforms—could possibly oppose this. Why they could possibly oppose Australians living in Australia from having a vote that other Australians enjoy is just beyond me, as is why they are opposing the proposal that you have to be an Australian to stand for an Australian parliament. If you read Senator Bourne's speech, you will not find any clarification of their approach.
Senator Ray congratulated Mr Messner, and for once in my life I wholeheartedly support Senator Ray. The current Administrator, Mr Messner, is an excellent Administrator. His term has just recently been extended and he is doing an exceptional job there. Senator Ray went on to talk about Senator Colston never missing a chance to vent his spleen, of course, never emphasising—although he had the courtesy to be a little bit embarrassed about the fact—that the Labor Party knew all about Senator Colston and did absolutely nothing about it. Senator Ray has admitted that before. He admitted it today. Whatever was alleged against Senator Colston—and I do not say whether that is true or not—if it is true, the Labor Party knew about it and did nothing. They will stand forever condemned for their hypocrisy on that issue. 
I will ignore the personal attacks that always seem to come out in Senator Mackay's speech. I am big enough; I can handle them and I do not mind. I will ignore the personal attacks, but I do wish that Senator Mackay would get her facts right. She talked about the legal system being wound back. There is no suggestion of that at all. She talked about the need for genuine discussion. I think she might have met with them once or twice, but I meet with the Norfolk Island government and the Assembly as often as I can. I speak with them very often on the telephone. They know that my policy towards them is that my door is always open. Whether we agree or not is another question, of course, but they know that my door is always open, and I willingly discuss everything and anything with members of the Assembly and the government. We have a very good relationship. I join Senator Crossin in publicly congratulating the Hon. Ron Nobbs on his election as Chief Minister. I have done so privately in a telephone conversation with him and in personal correspondence, but I publicly do so here.
Senator Mackay spent a lot of her time talking about the need for consultation and parliamentary committees. I will tell her again that this bill originated as a result of the Islands in the Sun report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. They recommended this. Any group that has been to Norfolk Island has had a view on it. Mr Simmons when he was the Labor Minister for Territories agreed to reinstate—and I emphasise `reinstate'—Australian citizenship as a qualification for membership of the Legislative Assembly and that was his proposal at the time.
Senator Crossin in her address referred to the island of Guernsey. I ask her: does she suggest that because the British government think it is good for Britain, that it should apply in Australia? Surely, she is not suggesting that we should be slaves to what the British government does? The logic of Senator Crossin's argument is that, because the British government is doing it on Guernsey and it is good there, perhaps we should do it in Australia. I am expecting that very shortly the Labor Party will be moving to provide that you do not need to be an Australian citizen to enter the Australian parliament or state parliaments. That is an extension of their logic.
—Don't be silly.
—Senator Mackay is interjecting, `It's silly.' I agree with you. The logic is just silly, and I accept your words for that. Senator Crossin also referred to a referendum. It is a pretty good referendum—the people you are wanting to benefit do not get a chance to vote in the referendum, because the Labor Party and the Democrats keep them off the roll. And you ask people, `Do you want to keep them off the roll or do you want to keep them on?' The people who want to come on do not get a say. It is a great referendum! I am disappointed at the simply amazing position that the Labor Party and the Democrats have taken. (Time expired)

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,2000-03-09,"—The Therapeutic Goods Amendment Bill 1999 aims to facilitate the implementation of a mutual recognition agreement between Australia and three members of the European Free Trade Association—that is, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. This is an extension of the original mutual recognition agreement between Australia and the European Union entered into in 1997. In short, it means that Australia will now accept conformity assessment certificates for therapeutic products and devices issued by conformity assessment bodies in Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein and, in turn, that Australian conformity assessment certificates issued by the Therapeutic Goods Administration will be accepted in these three countries. While this bill may not be controversial, it does represent another important step in making our ability to export high technology Australian products cheaper and easier by removing unnecessary regulatory barriers. It also, of course, holds the same benefits for manufacturers from the EFTA.
That is not to say that in doing so Australia is in any way jeopardising its own very high regulatory standards. By entering into the original MRA, Australian regulatory authorities ensured that overseas assessment standards met our own strict requirements. The Therapeutic Goods Administration has an enviable reputation as a world leader in setting standards relating to the evaluation and assessment of therapeutic products and devices in terms of quality, safety and efficacy. For the Australian public this means that they can be sure that the therapeutic products and devices they use have been through a rigorous testing process before they are made available to our market. Now, together with the citizens of EU countries who have been accepting our therapeutic products and devices under the mutual recognition agreement for the past two years, the citizens of Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein can be assured that the Australian products they use meet the highest possible quality, safety and efficacy standards. On that basis, the opposition commends this bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>THERAPEUTIC GOODS AMENDMENT BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,13,1,speech
"Senator TAMBLING,",CLP,2000-03-09,"—I am pleased to acknowledge the support that this legislation has received from all parties in the House of Representatives and the Senate. The bill before us today relates to the regulation of therapeutic devices.

This initiative will contribute positively to Australia's trade efforts and I am therefore pleased to support the passage of the bill. I note the Senate's endorsement of the work of the Therapeutic Goods Administration and acknowledge the support of other senators for the bill.

I do realise that, being an Arian, you have an ego bigger than Texas, and you probably would give yourself that capacity. But others understand that what is justice in any one situation is not necessarily going to be agreed amongst parties. Your question, however, wants to juxtapose the situation of mandatory sentencing in the Northern Territory for a third conviction with, as you say, letting someone who has been convicted of white-collar offences walk away. The issue of mandatory sentencing is a state issue. It is a matter for the Northern Territory and for Western Australia. The issue of whether someone walks away is a matter for the courts.

"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,2000-03-09,"—My question is to Senator Herron, the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care.

How successful is that rebate, and what would be the effect of any alternative policies?",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Health Insurance: Rebate</title>,Questions Without Notice,16,1,question
"Herron, Sen John",LP,2000-03-09,"—I thank Senator McGauran for the question. It is a great question, and I have got good news. For the first time in 10 years we are seeing a rising trend in private health insurance membership rates, just as my learned colleague has told us today that we are seeing a fall in the unemployment rate. More than 293,900 people have joined private health insurance since the Howard government introduced the 30 per cent rebate on 1 January last year—just as the Howard government has created 650,000 new jobs, which we have just heard about. It should be apparent to all of us that Labor almost destroyed health services in this country, and we are fixing the mess, just as we are fixing the economy. In relation to your second question, Senator McGauran, the opposition's recent media comments reflect the Labor Party's confusion and infighting about health policy, particular Labor's position on the 30 per cent rebate. That probably explains their failure to have a health policy. We are still waiting for their health policy. We have been waiting four years for their health policy, and we are still waiting.
—We're still waiting for Bronwyn Bishop's resignation!
—Senator Faulkner is more concerned about the Leader of the Opposition's factional enemies than putting together any sort of alternative policy position. Labor have never given a clear and unequivocal commitment to the Australian public that they would retain the 30 per cent rebate in its entirety. Mr Beazley has reluctantly acknowledged that he will retain the rebate, but he continues to leave the Australian public in the dark about whether he will means test or roll it back as part of his GST roll-back proposal. Why doesn't he roll over, as Bob Hogg said in relation to the GST? He might as well roll over now in relation to the 30 per cent rebate. I will quote him. He said that the 30 per cent rebate has been `a complete and monumental failure'. I know who has been a complete and monumental failure: Mr Beazley. Mr Beazley and his non-existent health policy. 
—Senator Conroy might tell us where the health policy is. Where is it?
—Senator Herron, you should not be addressing remarks across the chamber.
—I am asking him through you, Madam President. The rebate has been a great success, and this just goes to show that Mr Beazley does not know anything about health care in Australia, and it is fairly obvious that the Labor Party does not either. As another example of how they got lost in health policy, you have only got to look at his statement on access to Medicare. Mr Beazley says that if Labor returns to government, it will provide access to health services from post offices. Mr Beazley is going to allow access to health care rebates through post offices. Mr Beazley seems to have forgotten that the Labor Party closed 277 postal outlets between 1989-90 and 1994-95. Madam President, Senator Faulkner was part of the government that closed 277 postal outlets.
The Howard government has already considerably expanded access to Medicare by initiatives such as telephone claiming, fax in the pharmacy, two-way agency arrangements with private health funds and rural transaction centres. In total, we have more than 800 retail facilities nationally in addition to telephone claiming. The Health Insurance Commission is also trialing the use of touch screen kiosks and electronic lodgment of claims from doctors' surgeries. We are light years ahead of the Labor Party in relation to health policy—light years. It is about time Labor came out of the dark and told us what their policy is.

"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2000-03-09,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage (Senator Hill) and the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (Senator Alston) to questions without notice asked by Senators Mackay, Allison and Bishop today, relating to Telstra.
Today Minister Hill let the cat out of the bag in relation to the Prime Minister's commitment on regional services and employment. What he said today was that they would meet their commitment in relation to services, but he did not mention job losses. The Prime Minister did mention job losses. We note today that the government has in fact backed down in relation to that commitment on services in regional Australia.
Let us just recap. Since 1996 27,000 jobs have been lost from Telstra and what Telstra has now flagged is that an additional 16,000 jobs will go. Sixteen thousand jobs represents one quarter of the remaining work force of Telstra. Today Dr Switkowski had a briefing for federal MPs. I notice that that was very well attended by members of the National Party, and so it should have been, but poor old Dr Switkowski was sitting down there by himself. Who was missing? The Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, Senator Alston, was missing. He could not even be bothered turning up. He was not there. In fact, there were very few government ministers there. Senator Macdonald was not there as Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, and Minister Anderson was not there. He did not even bother turning up. I think Minister Anderson represents how big a doormat the National Party has become in relation to Telstra. Let's look at what he said this morning. This is what Minister Anderson said on the Today program this morning:
I am very concerned about service levels in rural Australia.
We are very pleased to hear that. He goes on:
But, by gee, I tell you what, they'd—
Telstra—
want to watch their performance on services in the bush.
That is good! He is only the Deputy Prime Minister! But most unbelievably he said: 
Well, all I can say is we've not been told where the job losses are but they cannot, inevitably, mostly be in rural areas, they really can't.
This is the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia who has not been told by Telstra where the job losses are going to be. The deputy of the Prime Minister in a mendicant status with a majority government owned agency does not have a clue where these job losses are going to be. It is no wonder that the National Party were late here to question time. No doubt they were caucusing in relation to what they are going to do.
I will turn to the National Party again, because they are supposedly here to represent regional Australia; we know the Liberal party don't. I notice Senator Mason is smiling over there. He is probably smiling about the further 2,000 job cuts that will happen in Queensland as a result of the Telstra cuts. Mrs Dickie, the federal president of the National Party, put out a press release under the heading `Nationals urge extreme caution on Telstra'. That's telling them. That's telling the government what they should do in relation to Telstra—they urge extreme caution. We have the Deputy Prime Minister saying that he is really concerned about services in relation to the bush, and he is hopeful that Telstra might have cognisance of this, and we have the National Party saying that the government should be very careful. She says—and with some degree of prescience, I have to say:
Telstra has the potential to become the biggest issue across rural and regional Australia at the next federal election.
Ten out of 10 for being on the ball, and what a degree of prescience it is! She then goes on to say:
The government must be extremely cautious of, and appropriately reactive to, public opinion on Telstra ...
That is good. After all, the Australian people are the majority shareholder. But where was the government today in relation to the briefing by Dr Switkowski? Nowhere. He was down there by himself and there was no Senator Alston there. As Senator Allison has already said today, Senator Alston is consistent. He consistently says that the government has no role in relation to Telstra and, of course, he said yesterday that Telstra was not owned by the public. Of course, the government retains the majority shareholding in relation to it.
Today we have a stark example of the Prime Minister's commitment to regional Australia being shown to be completely hollow and totally hypocritical. In fact, it has become increasingly obvious as time goes by that that commitment was simply made to get himself out of some very difficult public meetings when he poked his nose out into regional Australia. I agree with members of the coalition who have urged Mr Costello to go out to regional Australia and have a look at what is happening there. I agree with them in calling for Minister Alston to take a more proactive role.
This is a disgrace. There is no doubt that the Prime Minister has in fact totally repudiated his commitment to regional Australia. And the National Party is right: it will be a big issue at the next election, and I believe it will be an issue that will see the end of the National Party.

"Tierney, Sen John",LP,2000-03-09,"—Senator Mackay has got a very short memory. Let us look back to Labor's history on this matter. Let me, Senator Mackay, take you back to 1991. We did have a telecommunications minister at that time, and there is no prize for guessing who it was: it was one Kim Beazley. Let me quote what Kim Beazley had to say in 1991:
Telecom has to vary its structure to face future competition. It has to restructure its work force.
Of course, at that time there were 17,610 jobs shed from Telstra. What humbug from this opposition and what humbug from Mr Beazley, whom I was listening to in the House today discussing this issue. We must remember that he was the minister who started this downsizing process. He justified it then; it can be justified now, because of what is happening in the restructuring of telecommunications in this country. We have an industry in telecommunications that is growing at 12 per cent a year. There are massive job opportunities. What has already happened out of this proposed work force shedding of 10,000 over two years is that 88 per cent have already found other jobs. The other thing that has happened of course is that, although these jobs might be disappearing from the payroll of Telstra, the jobs are not disappearing. Many of those jobs still have to be done, and they will be outsourced and other communication workers—or, indeed, redeployed Telstra workers—will be the ones picking up those jobs. 
So, what is going to happen? We will restructure the industry. And Mr Beazley in 1991 recognised we were going to restructure the industry; he justified back then that loss of 17,600 jobs by the fact that the then monopolist had to make way for competition. What he said is that even though Telstra was going to lose employees, Optus and the other providers would pick them up. And Mr Beazley was right. That is exactly what happened in the early nineties, and it is exactly what is going to happen from this change in the employment structure.
What we have to do is to make sure that, in all of this change as the industry restructures, the services that are provided, particularly the services to the bush, are maintained. This is not up to Telstra to decide. This is not up to Optus to decide. This is a matter of Commonwealth law. What we have in place through the Telecommunications Act is two major provisions: one is a universal service obligation of what services Telstra has to provide and the other is a customer guarantee. Under those requirements Telstra, or any other provider, can be fined up to millions of dollars for not meeting certain standards, and that is what will happen. That is what keeps them on the straight and narrow. That is what keeps them moving through, providing services to the bush.
Mr Howard did speak to the heads of Telstra yesterday morning. He said this in question time this afternoon. He said that services had improved but there was still a way to go; and there certainly is, because I can remember the level of services that was provided under the Labor government out in the bush. There was a very embarrassing and damning report tabled in 1994, and that debate was had in this chamber, on western and south-western NSW and the absolutely appalling standards in terms of the services that were provided by Telstra at that time. They have improved; they have come a long way; they have put in new technology. What this government has done is underpin that with legislation to make sure that keeps improving.
It will keep improving. The industry is restructuring. It has a bright future. Jobs are going to increase dramatically in this industry, as indeed they have under the Howard government. We had today announced an unemployment rate of 6.7 per cent. Since the Howard government was elected 650,000 new jobs have been created. You might keep your eyes on the jobs that are actually going to be picked up in other areas of the telecommunications industry. The job boom created by the Howard government will continue not only in telecommunications but right across the entire economy.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,Questions Without Notice,17,1,speech
"Bishop, Sen Mark",ALP,2000-03-09,"—As I looked at the press this morning the thought came to me that the reports concerning Telstra were both glorious and terrible—glorious, of course, for those Australian shareholders who hold shares in Telstra; glorious that the half-yearly profit was in the order of $2.1 billion; glorious that the interim dividend will increase to 8c per share; and glorious for various fund managers and the like, who will return some or all of those proceeds to various unit holders. In a perfect world we would all pat Telstra on the back and go about our business. Similar arguments can be made about the returns of various banks and financial institutions over the last six to eight years—glorious in terms of growth, glorious in terms of share price valuation increase, glorious in terms of return to superannuation funds and unit holders.
But that, of course, is not the end of the story. I am rapidly coming to the view that in this area we are playing a zero sum game. Something is seriously wrong in the Australian business community. Something is seriously wrong in the government of this nation. Something is seriously wrong when the largest shareholder, holder of stock worth $50 billion or $60 billion, can walk away from 10,000 people; walks away from 90 per cent of the landmass of Australia; walks away from towns and small cities in regional Australia; walks away from entire communities in Tasmania, the Northern Territory, the north-west of Western Australia, western New South Wales, Western Queensland and Far North Queensland. Something is seriously wrong when the Australian government can applaud the loss of 10,000 jobs or 16,000 jobs. Something is seriously wrong when the Australian government allows, permits or encourages the destruction of jobs, the loss of family income and harm to local communities. 
Something is also terribly wrong when the Australian parliament has directly given power to a minister of the Crown to intervene and issue instructions that would stop or delay this process—that would reverse this process to allow a breathing space for thousands of families and hundreds of communities to reorder and reorganise their lives. But Minister Alston refuses to do anything—he consistently and constantly refuses to intervene. The minister and this government love what is occurring. The minister encourages Telstra to go harder, to sack more people, to harm more families and to ruin more communities. These are not my words and they are not the words of the opposition—they are the words of a member of the government who properly and correctly says that the minister is a national disgrace with no credibility inside or outside this parliament. Any fool, any government, any minister can do nothing—can refuse to intervene and applaud massive profits at the expense of 10,000 jobs—but it requires special courage and special fortitude to intervene and direct Telstra to stop sacking and dismissing 10,000 workers. It requires concern for everyone, not just shareholders. It requires respect for all Australians, not just those people who live in our major cities. It requires special assistance for rural and regional Australia, not just platitudes. It requires a real government and a real minister to do what is ethically correct. On every count, this minister has refused to intervene. He offers a form of an apology, a form of an excuse—he offers platitudes but nothing real. Behind the scenes, this government, this ministry and this minister applaud the degree of restructuring that is occurring. They applaud the loss of 10,000 jobs across Australia. Those jobs, by and large, are in rural areas where thre are not immediate replacements.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2000-03-09,"—One of the great lessons of the 20th century was that government owned monopolies served themselves first and the people second. Competition and market forces have grown the economy in this country, not government owned monopolies. I thought the Australian Labor Party had learnt during the eighties and the nineties that competition for government monopolies was extremely important. That is what the Hawke government brought to the Labor Party and, indeed, it was followed up by Mr Keating. Both the Commonwealth Bank and Qantas were privatised by the Labor Party, and that was a right decision. Indeed, the Labor Party itself created the environment for competition in telecommunications in this country when it created the duopoly of Telstra and Optus. This party will conclude the endgame. We want to privatise Telstra; we have to because we are dealing with the most competitive environment in the world. It is an industry that is changing all the time, and the only way it can continue to do so is to make decisions—as the directors have to—based on commercial reality. Telstra is not a charity.
It is a pity—I agree with the opposition—that some workers were made redundant. It is perhaps a pity, too, that between 1991 and 1994, when 17,000 jobs were shed, not so many tears flowed. Fortunately, however, there has been a 9 per cent growth each year in the telecommunications industry and many of these people will pick up jobs in that industry. More importantly and more broadly, the rate of unemployment is falling. The Australian economy is now one of the strongest in the Western world. This government has taken the economy from being a weak economy in a strong region to being a very strong economy in a weak region. We did that against the Australian Labor Party's opposition. We now have one of the strongest economies in the Western world. In short, community service obligations are very important. There are guarantees on price caps, universal service obligations and untimed local calls. The government will stick to those guarantees, including $5.7 billion that Telstra announced for investment over four years in non-metropolitan communication systems. 
What has all this meant for the average person? It has meant that I can sit in my Brisbane office and call Senator Ludwig for as low as 15c for an untimed local call and that I can talk to him all day. My good friend Senator Carr is not here today, unfortunately, but I could call him in Havana or Melbourne or wherever he happened to be, knowing that the price of an STD call has fallen over 40 per cent in the last few years. When Senator Carr calls his friend Red Ken Livingstone in the Greater London Council to discuss the great merits of socialism he can do that for 17.5c per minute. This is a fall in the rate of overseas calls of nearly 80 per cent and it has been brought about by competition that was consistently opposed by the Australian Labor Party. This government had the guts to make the hard decisions and the endgame will be the final privatisation of Telstra. Just like you have adopted our policies on the economy over the last 20 years—and you will adopt our policies on welfare—it is going to happen: Telstra will be sold ultimately. We will win this debate. Telstra will be sold and then, finally, we can pay off much of the debt that your party has left over the last century.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2000-03-09,"What can I say after that outburst? Senator Mason, you make a number of false assumptions in your speech.
—I do not need to yell across the chamber like some senators to make my point, Senator Hill. The first assumption is that the rest of Telstra will be sold. As long as the Labor Party has a strong policy about providing very good communications to Australia, the rest of Telstra will not be sold. Ask the Democrats today what they think about it, because every newspaper report that I have read and every word that I have heard Senator Lees speak about this situation reaffirms their position—that they will not be supporting the full sale of Telstra either.
The major flaw in that argument is that you believe that a company has to be privatised in order to be competitive, and that is not the case. The company does not have to be privatised in order to be competitive. Telstra has proven that it is competitive; it has proven that it has record profits—$2.1 billion profit for the half year and $4 billion profit in one year.
—It is not a welfare organisation.
—That is right: Telstra is not a welfare organisation. You are right, Senator Mason; it is not a charity either. But it is a service delivery organisation. It has an obligation to deliver the best service it possibly can to Australia and to people in the bush. So let us talk about people in the bush and people in rural and regional Australia.
Even this morning, John Anderson, the Deputy Prime Minister, was saying that they—meaning, I am assuming, the National Party—will need to be convinced that proposed job cuts will not affect service levels; they have not been given that guarantee. If you think that service levels in rural and regional Australia are bad and if you are worried about jobs in rural and regional Australia and if you are worried about customer service guarantees out there in the bush, then your worries are going to get even worse, because this is a government that does not particularly care about rural and regional Australia. They have learnt nothing from the demise of the Kennett government in Victoria, and that is what will happen to them when we face the polls at the next election.
But what we have got here is a CEO of Telstra speaking out of both sides of his mouth. He says, on the one hand, that there will not be job losses out bush and that the jobs that will be cut in Telstra will not be affected by decisions that he has made today. Yet, at the same time, he is also saying that the regional call centres will stay open. How can you maintain a commitment to leave those centres open but not specify where the job cuts will be? So we have got a CEO who has not quite come to terms with what he has actually announced today, and there are a lot of anomalies in what he has announced. We have a minister who is actually trying to privatise Telstra through the backdoor, a minister who really walks around with a mask over his face because, in setting up the network and design corporation as a separate entity under Telstra, it will now be sold off and it will be privatised. So it is privatisation through the backdoor. 
—It will go the same way as the phone boxes.
—Exactly. There are two things this government have been dishonest about. This government have not got enough temerity to bring that proposal back before the parliament and ask us what we think about the network and design corporation being sold off to honour their commitment that no more than 49.9 per cent of Telstra will be privatised and 50.1 per cent will remain in the public's hands. They are not prepared to bring that proposal back to the parliament for us to have a look at it. It is just privatisation through the backdoor. They have been dishonest about what they have done in this area.
The other thing they are being dishonest about is protecting jobs, protecting families and protecting rural and regional Australia. The Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister have shown that they are not prepared to step in as a 51 per cent shareholder on behalf of the people of this country and ask where those job losses are and demand that the job losses not happen. They are not standing up for people in the bush and they are not prepared to ensure that Telstra maintains its commitment, maintains its service d livery and ensures that we have a world best communication system for the best possible price we can.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,Questions Without Notice,17,1,speech
"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,2000-03-09,"—I will finish off this debate, given that the speakers on our side of the House, particularly Senator Mason, presented the case superbly and passionately and put the merits before Senator Crossin, who duly got up and failed to build her case at all. What Senator Crossin and those on the other side had to answer first up was: if this announcement was made yesterday morning, why are you just bringing it up now? Where is your real concern and where is your passion? You happen to have read the papers this morning, and that is how you are driven. This announcement is not new. It was announced more than 48 hours ago, Senator Crossin, and now you just bring it before the Senate with all the feigned passion that you could possibly muster and try and build a case that there is a link between privatisation and unemployment. Well, that link first began with Mr Beazley when he was the minister for telecommunications, when 17,000 members of then Telecom lost their jobs under his stewardship. And what was his justification? It was not dissimilar to what we are saying today—that restructure within the telecommunications industry is most necessary. In fact, it was the other side of the House when they were in government that set this whole process in train, that set in train the process of bringing competition into this industry, and today we have some 37 licensed carriers. 
That is why Telstra has had to adjust. The old monopoly is now in a competitive market. It is now having to meet competitive standards, to meet new technological standards, to meet new productivity standards, and it is all wrapped up in competitive pressures. Thankfully, this is an industry that is growing at a rate of some 12 per cent. As previous speakers have outlined, it can be tracked that 88 per cent of former Telstra lay-offs have in fact been picked up by other industries. And that was what the Labor Party said when there were huge lay-offs in their time of government. They said that other carriers would pick up the redundant Telstra employees, and that is exactly what happened.
The Telstra announcements tell us that 8,000 of the 10,000 positions will be made redundant. Some 2,000 positions will be outsourced, and 3,000 positions will be reduced by natural attrition. They go on to say that Telstra will hire an additional 3,000 staff to meet different skill needs within the growing industry. So, if you break down the 10,000, it is not as dramatic as it at first sounds. Some 3,000 new staff will be employed, 3,000 positions will be reduced through natural attrition and 2,000 positions will be outsourced. Do your sums on that, and it is nothing near the 10,000. Nevertheless, I can say that it is most regrettable that this does occur. When I see these big lay-offs by Telstra, I wonder how many more people they can lay off. Since 1991, when Mr Beazley was the minister for employment, there have been some 17,000 of them—all I can say is that they must have been overloaded with employees. It is most regrettable. 
We have confidence in the industry as a whole and in the fact that these employees will be picked up. This is a case of a monopoly now moving into a competitive situation, and there are now 37 licensed carriers. The responsibility of this government is in that industry. We are not walking away from it. We particularly have a responsibility in rural and regional Australia in three areas: the delivery of technology, services and prices of a standard equal to those in the metropolitan areas. We have a responsibility to ensure that there is no discrimination in pricing between the city and metropolitan areas. In all three of those areas, we have delivered. In the area of technology, we have delivered in the social bonus—over $1 billion in the last privatisation sale of Telstra, which the opposition stood against. In the area of services, we were the only government to introduce the very strict regime of the customer service guarantee. In the area of prices, anyone who has seen information about Telstra's email service—where prices have tumbled to as low as 15c for a local call—over the last couple of weeks will see how competitive that market has become.

Question resolved in the affirmative.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Telstra</title>,Questions Without Notice,17,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-03-09,"—In all the various matters of urgency that have been debated in this chamber over the years, few could be better examples of something that is urgent. This is a major environmental crisis. The Minister for the Environment and Heritage himself said in question time, half an hour or so ago, that this is against the national interest and a national environmental problem. Yet it is something that nothing is being done about at a national level. It is occurring as we speak, from dawn until dusk. Bulldozer contractors are booked out for months in advance in Queensland. This problem has been urgent for not just months but years, and yet still nothing is done, particularly at the federal level.
I am certainly not going to defend or justify every action of the Beattie Labor government in the area of the environment and, particularly, of land clearing. There is a lot to criticise them about, but we are here in the federal parliament debating an issue of national environmental significance. The matter of urgency is that there is no action happening at a national level. Even the action that has occurred at the state level has not been backed up with any assistance at the federal level.
I do not think there is much need to justify the first part of this motion—the fact that this is an environmental emergency. Indeed, the minister himself has already admitted as much in question time. But it is worth putting briefly on the record the scale of the problem. A total of 227 different, separate ecosystems are under threat from land clearing in Queensland as we speak. The area of endangered and `of concern' ecosystems at risk is approximately 3.5 million hectares. On a list of countries around the world, in terms of the rate of clearing, Australia is at best fifth and quite possibly now moving further up that table to fourth or third. There can be no dispute that the situation is completely unsustainable and that major, long-term environmental damage is being done, and yet no action is being taken. 
I had a letter from a constituent today which put the situation perfectly in an analogy with Nero fiddling while Rome burned. Nero was only a street busker compared with the actions of the federal government in this. There has been no action. There have been lots of words and lots of complaints about the inactivity or failures of the Queensland government. I asked the minister in question time what he was going to do about it, other than complain about the Queensland government. He then proceeded to complain about the Queensland government. I can complain about the Queensland government as well—there is a lot to complain about—but I do not think that is a satisfactory answer for something that is such a major national environmental issue.
It is a situation in which the federal government has powers and responsibilities in terms of not just Australia's own national interest but also conventions that Australia has signed, not least the Kyoto protocol. While that has not been ratified yet, Australia is a signatory to that. Land clearing in Queensland, as is widely known, is a major contributor to Australia's national greenhouse gas emissions.
We also have obligations under the UN Convention on Biological Diversity which are being breached left, right and centre in Queensland day after day, month after month and year after year, while no action is being taken by the Australian government at the national level to ensure that Australia meets its obligations under that convention. One wonders why all that money is spent on sending people to develop, negotiate and agree to such conventions if governments then do nothing to ensure they are enforced. 
While we are on the topic of money, there has been a lot of talk in recent times about Telstra and what the money from any future sale of Telstra might be used for. Let us look at where money from the sale of the first part of Telstra went: to the Natural Heritage Trust. The government made such a big noise about it being such a major environmental initiative on their part. It is the cornerstone of all that the government have to point to in terms of environmental initiatives yet, in question time today, the federal environment minister basically admitted that the target of the Bushcare program—a major component of NHT funding—is not going to be met. That is the Queensland government's fault, according to the federal government. I do not really care whose fault it is. We have sold off part of this major national asset and put money into Bushcare, and clearly the goals of that program have not been met. And they are not going to be met, according to the minister's own ratios: the ratio of tree planting to tree destruction is about 1:100.
The Telstra sale money has gone into volunteer planting of a bit over 10,000 hectares of trees. All that money has been spent on planting 10,000 hectares of trees and yet there has been no commitment for any money to be spent to stop the clearing of hundreds of thousands of hectares. Clearly that is a false economy; clearly it shows that we are more interested in feelgood programs of tree planting than actually doing something to stop the damage that is happening now. Even where the government has fenced off areas, for every one tree protected by fencing, 10 are destroyed. We could save 30 times more trees per dollar than we currently do by putting funds into ensuring that there is viable Queensland land clearing protection which would protect up to 4 million hectares, or 940 million trees. Those are the sorts of things that would make a real difference and that would stop the major environmental problems that will be visited upon us, without doubt, if nothing is done. Nothing is being done. There could be nothing more urgent than this issue.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Vegetation Clearance in Queensland</title>,Matters of Urgency,18,1,speech
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2000-03-09,"—This motion is one which, at least in part, I am sure nobody would disagree with. There have been unacceptably and unsustainably high levels of vegetation clearance occurring in Queensland, and I can only say that Senator Bartlett is right. The question of the damage done to the Australian environment by unsustainable land clearance has been a story of really severe damage not only in Queensland but also in my own state of Western Australia, where land clearance programs in the 1960s—when the state government was proud to declare that it was clearing a million acres a year—have resulted in huge salination problems in the wheat belt and the salination of many rivers in the south-west of Western Australia. People forget how fragile the ecology of the south-west of Western Australia is. Western Australia is a very dry state with very little water. We have this green and beautiful south-west corner, but the clearing of forests or farmland has had a devastating impact on the country in Western Australia and in the south-west. 
Similarly, in the Murray-Darling Basin, clearing has had a devastating impact in terms of the salination of the country. In all other mainland states, the lesson of the consequences of clearing has been learned; in Queensland, it seems those lessons have been ignored. Despite clear evidence from other parts of Australia, land clearing in Queensland has continued to burgeon, with some 90 per cent of land clearing throughout the country occurring in that state. Indeed, during the past year, some 400,000 hectares of land were cleared in Queensland alone.
Given the implications of this process, one might ask what the Queensland government has done to stop this land clearing. The answer, of course, sadly, is `not very much', unless you count the recent actions of Premier Beattie who, in the latter part of last year, announced that his government would introduce legislation to deal with land clearing provided the Commonwealth provided the Queensland government with $100 million in funding. At the same time, he refused to provide details to the federal government of the legislation he would introduce, including the level of funding the Queensland government was prepared to contribute itself. It has been only very reluctantly that he recently revealed those sorts of details. One must wonder about the priorities of the ALP Premier of Queensland. While he was being so difficult about providing funding for the protection of the environment in Queensland and cutting back land clearing programs, he was going out of his way to offer inducements and incentives to Richard Branson's Virgin Airlines to lure them to Queensland. Money could be found to get Virgin Airlines to Queensland to bring tourists to the coast of Queensland, but no money could be found in the Queensland budget, it seemed, to save the Queensland countryside and bushland. Premier Beattie's sense of priorities is very short term, and he needs to think very carefully about the damage he is doing to the Queensland environment.
What about the federal scene? Part 2 of Senator Bartlett's motion talks about `the failure of the federal government to take concrete action to ensure that this major environmental threat is addressed'. What action has the federal government taken since it has been in office? Obviously the ALP, the previous federal government, did very little about it, because the need to provide major programs was there when the Howard government came to office, and the Howard government did that through the Natural Heritage Trust. As we know, through the $1.5 billion Natural Heritage Trust the Howard government has provided programs to look after Australia's land care needs; to care for the waterways, rivers, coasts and forests of Australia; and to preserve Australia's natural vegetation. This program was funded through the partial sale of Telstra, and it obviously was the greatest program to protect the environment which the Australian nation had ever seen.
As part of that program the Commonwealth insisted that all state and territory governments sign the Natural Heritage Trust partnership agreements which, among other things, committed them to protecting native vegetation and introducing controls on unsustainable land clearing. The federal government established a $350 million Bushcare program, the goal of which was to achieve, for the first time in Australian history, a net increase in native vegetation across Australia. All mainland states, except Queensland, as I have said, recognised years ago that controls on unsustainable land clearing were an essential component of turning around the mistakes of the past. Most importantly within the context of this debate, all state governments, except Queensland, have recognised their constitutional responsibility to introduce such programs and regulations without demanding, as Queensland has, an extra $100 million from the Commonwealth to do so. South Australia, by contrast, spent $70 million in the mid-1980s to provide assistance to land-holders when it introduced controls on land clearing in that state. South Australia did not come running to Canberra threatening to withdraw legislation unless it was given an extra $100 million in the way Premier Beattie of Queensland did. 
The Commonwealth government is very willing to make a contribution to better land management outcomes in Queensland, but it is not going to let the Queensland government avoid its primary constitutional responsibility in this matter. The Commonwealth government expects Queensland to exercise the same kind of responsibility in terms of preserving natural vegetation as the other states do. The problem, in other words, lies not with the federal government, as Senator Bartlett would have you believe, but very much with the ALP state government in Queensland, which has acted with total irresponsibility in this matter.
Let us have a look at what the federal government has already provided to Queensland in terms of protection of the environment. Through the Natural Heritage Trust, Queensland has received over $100 million in assistance, $21 million of which has been specifically allocated over the last three years to better vegetation outcomes through the Bushcare program. As I have said, Premier Beattie, rather than going ahead with a Bushcare program in his state, instead has gone ahead and cleared 400,000 hectares per annum. Also, before he will proceed with a state program, he is now demanding that the Commonwealth government hand over another $100 million for financial assistance to land-holders. That, of course, is quite outrageous. So, far from the Commonwealth being at fault here, as Senator Bartlett would claim, the Queensland government is acting a little bit like Ned Kelly and demanding, `Your money or your life!' In this case, it is: `Your money or the bush, or the bush will die!' In the last budget, in fact, Premier Beattie cut $50 million out of his environment department's budget. He is now saying that he will put back $20 million as his contribution to better environmental outcomes in Queensland. Big deal! Until Premier Beattie exercises more responsibility, we are not going to see better environmental outcomes in Queensland.
The Prime Minister recently agreed to establish a task force between the Commonwealth and Queensland governments to work through the legislation and come up with some sort of financial assistance package for the land-holders of Queensland. Again, the Commonwealth is acting with a sense of responsibility to the needs of Queensland, while the Queensland government is seeking to hold the Commonwealth to ransom.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,2000-03-09,"—I would start by staying to the chamber and to Senator Eggleston that it was a sad and non-constructive response that we received this afternoon from the government to this issue. I am sure that Senator Bartlett and people interested in this area would have been looking for something more constructive. I do not blame Senator Eggleston for this, because obviously he was given a set of notes from the minister's office which relate and reflect the government's reaction to this issue.
But, Senator Eggleston, if I were you, I would very quickly go up to Senator Hill's office and make it clear to him that you have been set up, that you do not like the fact that you have been set up and that perhaps next time they should give you briefs that are more accurate and maybe a bit more responsive. No wonder the public gets more and more cynical when they hear a speech like the one we have just heard. It was a case of the federal government trying to blame the Queensland government, with the federal government itself taking no responsibility for what is definitely and clearly a national issue—one that has been identified as such not just by the governmental process but also by leading politicians in this country, representatives of this government. I would say to Senator Eggleston that, when he is told, `Look, the Beattie government is not prepared to put any money in and it has come to us with a bill for $103 million,' he should go back to Senator Hill and make it clear to him that the Beattie government is, in fact, prepared to put $111 million into a management budget in this particular instance, because that is Queensland's part of the proposal. 
Also, Senator Eggleston should remind Senator Hill that on numerous occasions Senator Hill is on record—whether in this place, on the radio in Queensland or in correspondence to the Queensland Premier—as saying such words as `in relation to funding, Commonwealth support would of course be supplementary to that of a serious Queensland commitment'. If $111 million is not serious, then ask Senator Hill what is. It is a serious commitment, it is a serious problem and it is not at all helped by this putting up of barricades approach of the federal government.
The issue we are debating this afternoon is clearly of national and international significance. On a national level, ongoing uncontrolled land clearing is contributing to increased salinity, greenhouse gas emissions, land and water degradation, habitat destruction and loss of biodiversity. Continuing clearing will leave future generations with a huge environmental restoration bill. At an international level, our reputation as a nation is at stake. We are already viewed as an environmental pariah for the position we took at Kyoto and the special deal we got through the `Australian clause' on including land use changes in our greenhouse gas emissions baseline. We are now clearing more native vegetation than any other developed country. We have one of the highest rates of land clearing in the world, outpaced only by Brazil, Indonesia, Congo and Bolivia. This is not a group we should be proud to be a member of. 
Land clearing goes on despite this government claiming to have some responsibility in the area. This government is not fulfilling such a responsibility. At a rate of some 400,000 hectares per annum, Queensland's land clearing accounts for some 80 per cent of all tree clearing in Australia. Land clearing is also estimated to contribute some 13 per cent of Australia's greenhouse emissions. Let us not make any mistake: the rate of land clearing in Queensland is unsustainable and unacceptable. We agree across the chamber in respect of that. The impacts of it are widespread and quite deep in many circumstances. 
Let us get a fix on the problem. Currently, less than four per cent of Queensland is occupied by national parks. Therefore, the protection of this state's biodiversity is primarily dependent upon land use practices on freehold and leasehold land. We should acknowledge also that significant work has already been done in recent years in acknowledging and encouraging land-holders to adopt a land care ethic. Many land-holders have changed their land management practices in the face of economic pressures. However, our concern is—and I am sure it is the concern of Senator Bartlett and the Democrats—that changes in attitude may be too slow. What we do need to recognise is that responses based solely on voluntary measures have not been found to be effective, either in Australia or anywhere else in the world. As a consequence, you do have legislation in Queensland. As a consequence, you do have the federal government expressing concern about land clearing. The direct consequence of that should be a meaningful response. 
As I said earlier, this has been identified as a national issue. The 1996 state of the environment report makes it very clear that habitat destruction and fragmentation caused by vegetation clearing may be Australia's most serious environmental problem. The national document identifies this as one of the most, if not the most, serious environmental problems. Yet land clearing was not included in the new environment legislation passed by the Senate a few months ago. Its nomination as a key threatening process under the old Endangered Species Protection Act was twice rejected by the environment minister, Senator Hill. 
What is of major concern, and it came out in Senator Bartlett's contribution this afternoon, is that in recent years the federal government has dropped the ball in terms of its responsibility in this area. A key goal identified in the Commonwealth government's Natural Heritage Trust is to reverse the long-term decline in the extent and quality of Australia's native vegetation cover. Yet the government is now trying to put all the blame for the failure of its expensive National Heritage Trust to deliver outcomes on the states. 
Years of coalition government in Queensland have failed to deliver land clearing legislation, and now the Queensland Labor government have introduced this legislation. Let me put on the record that it is legislation that Senator Hill has encouraged them to introduce on a number of occasions. He is on the record as talking about an adequate regulatory response. They have done that. He is also on the record as saying that, were they to do that and make a commitment, he would provide funding. We have the legislation and now we have a Commonwealth minister who in the past has said, `Legislate and we will assist,' and is now saying, `There is no real assistance available for you under Commonwealth programs and moneys.' It is important legislation. It provides a capacity to implement a sustainable vegetation management practice across all land tenures in Queensland. It presents to the Commonwealth and to the national budget the most cost-effective outcome in terms of addressing this particular problem.  
This government's position stands in stark contrast to their position when they were in opposition. In March 1995,  the then spokesperson, Ian Macdonald, moved as a matter of urgency in the Senate: 
The coalition's policy ... calls for an end to broadacre land clearing with compensation to owners to be negotiated between the Commonwealth and the states for the loss of further earnings ...
That was their pre-election promise. They have a commitment. The most cost-effective approach to addressing this particular problem is to fund the sort of resources that Queensland needs from the federal government under the NHT. In recent days, the Australian Conservation Foundation has estimated that some 30 times more trees per dollar could be saved were the money to be invested in supporting the Queensland tree clearing legislation. There is no more cost-effective program than the one that the Beattie government presents. 
Yet despite commitments by the minister, we now have the Prime Minister coming in and basically doing what he knows best, what he always does best—that is, playing politics with an issue. He discards any real responsibility in terms of achieving outcomes for taxpayers' money. He discards any real concern for vegetation and the destructive effect land clearing has in respect of it. He discards any real concern for long-term sustainability on the farms involved and for the people on the land. Instead he plays politics. This is an opportunity for the Prime Minister, despite the fact that he may embarrass his own environment minister, to say, `Let's put Beattie up against the wall in Queensland and let's get behind Borbidge and see whether we can cause damage to Labor politically.' 
It will not stack up. The government's review of its own Natural Heritage Trust—these are not my words—has indicated that it has failed. It has failed because, in a sense, it has disbursed a lot of money across the board, but it has not really targeted some of the major problems. This is the government that promised that issues such as this, that deep-seated problems such as this, would be responded to by, as it said, the biggest ever rescue package for the environment. Its own review recommends that the use of the Natural Heritage Trust funds should be deployed for essentials such as the stopping of further clearing of land. But that is not happening, and it is not happening because politics has intervened and it is an opportunity to set Beattie up. 
This is not good enough. We are talking here of a Natural Heritage Trust which has available to it some $253 million. We are talking here of an identified cost-effective approach available to government. But what we have in response from government is a total state of amnesia, forgetting all previous commitments and undertakings from Senator Hill—and there are pages of them which indicated that support would be forthcoming. They have just dumped that and played politics. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Vegetation Clearance in Queensland</title>,Matters of Urgency,18,1,speech
"Boswell, Sen Ron",NP,2000-03-09,"—The urgency motion today addresses two topics: (a) the unacceptably and unsustainably high levels of vegetation clearance continuing to occur in Queensland, with the resulting consequences of soil and water degradation, high greenhouse gas emissions and the threats to endangered species and the maintenance of biodiversity; and (b) the failure of the federal government to take concrete action to ensure that this major environmental threat is addressed. 
The facts are these: the Beattie government brought forward legislation, rushed it through the parliament with no consultation process, and then went out to try to sell the Beattie plan. There may well be a need to contain some of the tree clearing. I do not think that would be disputed. But what is disputed by every grazier in Queensland and Agforce—a peak body that represents these graziers—is the way in which the Premier acted in bringing in this legislation. The legislation was slammed through parliament and then Labor went out to try to sell it. 
This has enraged graziers to the same depth as has the native title bill. We saw 1,500 graziers at Roma last week and 1,500 graziers at Longreach a couple of weeks ago. They are absolutely devastated that their livelihoods are going to be restricted or taken away from them. A number of them are saying, `You've got us out there on a property. We are growing wool. No-one wants the wool. We cannot clear our land. We cannot do anything else. You have us restricted to poverty. If that is the case, where do we go from here? You are locking us into a life of poverty because we cannot utilise the assets that we have.' 
There are many forests out there that consist of regrowth trees. Some would maintain that there are more trees out there—not on their particular properties—than there were 40, 50, 60 years ago. They want the government to recognise this. They want the government to recognise their problems. But no—they went straight in, whacked the legislation through, and then hoped for the best. They have sent the bill for $111 million to the federal government—they will put up something like $1 for every $10—and expect the good old federal government to pick up the bill for the Labor state government. 
I just want to speak on behalf of the graziers. There was one young lady, a 16-year-old girl, at the tree clearing rally at Roma last weekend. In just seven words this fourth generation young lady from the bush summed up the problems facing the graziers. Senator Bartlett's urgency motion has no room in it for this girl and thousands like her. Her dream is that she will be able to grow up like her father and grandfather and have a cattle property that will be sustainable and produce products that will be able to keep her on the land. That is not a bad dream for a youngster in the bush. We are going to need people with these visions and dreams. We are not going to be able to fund our social and environmental programs without the prosperity that comes from viable agricultural industries and their exports. 
Senator Bartlett has a dream too. His vision is for free-range chooks. That is his little vision. We have seen him promoting that cause. But the National Party's dreams are a bit wider than that: we want sustainable, wealth producing industries and jobs. That schoolgirl knows better than anyone—she knows better than Senator Bartlett and anyone in the Democrats—that they need their land protected for future generations. Farmers are environmentalists. They have to be environmentalists. They own properties, and if they are not environmentalists those properties will not sustain their livelihoods for the next 10 years and for the next generation. That is what irks them out there. They have to live on the land. They have to maintain the land. They have to get an income out of the land, and they know that if they overservice that land or overproduce from that land it will not be there for them in the next generation. 
The Queensland Country Life editorial this week said, `Labor is not counting on votes in the bush but is promoting its green credentials in the urban media, and that appears to be a far greater concern to the Labor government.' That is quite correct. Mr Beattie was out there last week, and what did he do? From the stage, he suggested that the graziers give Pauline Hanson a cheer. Why not? If you are a Labor Party Premier, why not ask them to give Pauline Hanson a cheer? If they help One Nation, that helps him stay in office. That is how concerned about rural Queensland the Premier is. He is encouraging the graziers to support Pauline Hanson because he knows that a vote for Pauline Hanson is a vote, in effect, for the Labor Party.  
As the clock runs out, I want to leave this impression with the Senate. There is recognition out there that you must have a sustainable environment—that is recognised by the farmers. But it is also recognised that, if you want their support, you have to come to them, you have to give them some seat at the table.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2000-03-09,"—Firstly, before I address the substantive matters in the urgency motion, let me recount some of the issues that have led us here today. The Vegetation Management Bill was passed by the Queensland parliament in December 1999, but it sits there awaiting a deal to be struck between the Queensland and Commonwealth governments on financial assistance for land-holders. The bill itself provides a framework for the vegetation management of Queensland. It appears, when we talk about compensation or assistance, that there are three main types of assistance envisaged: firstly, buying a property outright; secondly, where there is a partial effect on land value due to clearance restrictions; and, thirdly, financial assistance to improve on property vegetation management.
This is clearly not going to be an inexpensive exercise, and it is one that needs federal government support. The Queensland government recognises that land clearing is a national issue. The most recent national assessment of land clearing undertaken by the Bureau of Rural Sciences reported that, during the 1991 to 1995 period, Queensland accounted for 81 per cent of all native vegetation clearing that took place in Australia. The introduction of tighter clearing controls on leasehold land in Queensland during 1995 under the Land Act has had some impact. However, clearing rates on freehold land increased by 55 per cent after 1995—hence the need for a new approach. In broad terms, the Vegetation Management Bill gives the state government significantly more power to regulate the clearing of vegetation on freehold land, in particular through requiring the development of regional vegetation management policy and providing for the development of regional vegetation management plans following public consultation—it is not bereft of consultation—which will then set out detailed assessment criteria for what sort of clearing is likely to be allowed in each region. Of course, it has the other usual features of bills. The way it will work is that some types of clearing are exempt from the covering of the bill and do not require approval, otherwise a property vegetation management plan must be supplied with details of any native vegetation clearing proposal. What has not been clear in this debate is what the bill entails in truth, not the emotive speeches of other participants here in the Senate.
Turning now to the substantive matters contained within the motion. It seems clear that the coalition government is playing politics in respect of the importance of environmental management in Queensland. It seems, on the one hand, the Prime Minister, John Howard, and Senator Robert Hill, the environment minister, are requiring Queensland farmers to reduce their land clearing efforts, but, on the other hand, are refusing to assist in defraying the costs that are involved. Or is the Prime Minister telling the farmers in Queensland that they do not deserve compensation? It seems odd that Senator Ron Boswell is demanding the Commonwealth keep out of state land clearing laws. In a press release dated 17 February 2000, the National Party Senate Leader, Senator Ron Boswell, welcomed the assurance by the environment minister, Senator Robert Hill, that the Commonwealth would not override the state legislation on land clearing.
When you look at the issue in more detail, it belies the true nature of the issue. In fact, clearly the responsibility for natural resource management lies with the states, but Senator Hill himself recognises that Australia has been overcleared and, at the moment, Queensland is being overcleared. Senator Hill goes on to say:
The rate of clearing in Queensland is too high and it is up to the Queensland government to do something about it.
Well, it is. Given the importance of the issue, it is of no surprise that the Premier of Queensland developed legislation, introduced it into parliament and sought federal government funding to ensure that farmers would be assisted in the required change from one field to a regime where the environment is given some importance. In fact, Senator Hill wrote to the state minister, Mr Rod Welford, on 11 August 1998 seeking assurances that Queensland would reduce regulations to reduce tree clearing on freehold land. A year later, on 9 August 1999, Senator Hill wrote again, in the same vein, reiterating the need to substantially reduce the net loss of native vegetation cover in Queensland. Again, Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson stated: 
Queensland farmers are entitled to compensation for the loss of rights under the Queensland legislation.
It is a furphy to suggest that one of the main reasons for the National Party to oppose the legislation is the failure of the Queensland government to consult land-holders. The legislation itself, as I said earlier, provides clear consultative processes—processes that everyone can plainly see and follow within the legislation.
However, it is strange indeed when you look at the sums of money that Senator Hill has got at his disposal to turn around the environmental issues that matter the most, such as land clearing. Senator Hill has something in the order of $400 million in the greenhouse gas abatement budget that was committed as part of the federal government GST deal with the Democrats and another $1.5 billion in the Natural Heritage Trust scheme. So when you look at the $103 million sought by Queensland to save 4.7 million hectares of trees as compared with the war chest that Senator Hill is holding, it pales into insignificance. Perhaps there is an underlying motivation that Senator Hill is not making plain. It could be that the National Party have convinced Senator Hill that it would be politically wiser for rural Queensland farmers not to be subject to this piece of legislation because they are on the nose in the bush. They know that the holding up of the funds which would provide compensation to farmers would effectively stop the Queensland government from proceeding with the legislation.
I call on the National Party to support the Queensland Beattie government on this important piece of legislation and press with me against Senator Hill to fund the Queensland scheme. Senator Hill stated that the Natural Heritage Trust, the NHT, funding is conditional on states meeting vegetation goals and said the New South Wales and Queensland land clearing rates were too high to meet the NHT's goal of having revegetation in Australia exceed clearing by 2001. Senator Hill said that, for Queensland to meet its NHT agreement, `controls and incentives need to be put in place across all regions and across all land tenures, both public and private, leasehold and freehold'. It could be argued then that the withdrawal of funding and the expenditure of funding are part of the same continuum and that one is a carrot and the other is a stick to assist in this process.
The NHT funding for the Bushcare program in Queensland allocated so far is $9 million, which is out of a total of $81-odd million available for Bushcare funded under the NHT. If land clearing controls in Queensland are not implemented because of the lack of funds for compensation, it could be argued that $9 million is wasted in the face of the land clearing rates of Queensland, and the NHT goal of reafforestation exceeding land clearing by 2001 would not be achieved. An economic rationalist may even argue that it would be more effective to use the NHT funds to halt land clearing.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2000-03-09,"—The coalition is concerned about land being overcleared in Queensland and the consequences of that overclearing, such as increased salinity and loss of native wildlife. This is precisely why the federal government has decided to do something about the issue. That is the difference between the coalition and Labor. Labor only care about the bush when it is useful for their scare tactics, otherwise they did not do much in their 13 years in government. The coalition, on the other hand, has recognised the problem and has decided to help those areas in need.
It is precisely for this reason that the Prime Minister established the largest environmental restoration plan, with the $1½ billion Natural Heritage Trust. It is precisely for that reason that we have signed the Natural Heritage Trust partnership agreements with all the states and the territories to commit them to protecting vegetation and to control land clearing. It is precisely for that reason that we have also established the $350 million Bushcare program to increase native vegetation right across Australia. I challenge Senator Bartlett and his fellow Democrats to support the full sale of Telstra so we can do even more for the environment in this country. 
The federal government is willing to help the states, even though everyone knows that, constitutionally, land clearing is a state responsibility. All the state governments do recognise that it is their constitutional responsibility to introduce appropriate regulation with respect to land clearing. It is a state constitutional responsibility. All the state governments recognise that they have to spend their own money to assist land-holders once the controls on land clearing are introduced—except the Beattie Labor government in Queensland. It is the only state government to try to avoid its responsibilities and now demand $100 million from the Commonwealth for financial assistance to land-holders.
The final sentence of Senator Bartlett's urgency motion should read: `The failure of the Queensland state government to take concrete action to ensure that this major environmental threat is addressed.' That is how the urgency motion should read. Let us have a motion to condemn the Beattie Labor government and their sad attempt to escape their responsibility as a state government and provide funds to prevent land clearing. Let us have a motion to condemn the Beattie Labor government for trying to blackmail the federal government to supply all the funds that are necessary. If Senator Bartlett is willing to do that, I will happily second the motion. Or maybe the conclusion of the present motion should read: `The failure of the Democrats and the environmental movement to support the federal government in taking action to ensure that this major environmental threat is addressed.'
Let me get to the point. There is an inconsistency here. After all, the Democrats and their friends in the environmental movement have always opposed federal aid to the states to help them with funding environmental programs. Mr Downey, the Democrats' environmental adviser, has come out in the papers saying that providing federal funds to the states is bad because then the states do not have to use their own money for environment purposes; they can run off and use the money for something else. The Democrats' good friends at the Australian Conservation Foundation have also said the same thing. You have the same problem as the Labor Party, Senator Bartlett—that is, `We're sort of in favour of the federal government providing money to the states but we're sort of not. We're not quite sure.' It is a bit like the Labor Party policy on the GST—`We're sort of for it but we're against it. We're not quite sure.'
The bottom line is that the federal government has always been happy to assist Queensland deal with the problem of overclearing. It has already given over $100 million under the Natural Heritage Trust, including $21 million through the Bushcare program specifically to ensure better vegetation outcomes. Until just seven days ago, Mr Beattie was not prepared to spend a cent on this program. Instead, he was spending all his time trying to blackmail the federal government to provide $100 million to bail out the state. Now, I understand, Premier Beattie is prepared to pay $30 million, but still of course demands that the federal government foot the rest of the bill, the other $70 million. Until such time as the Beattie Labor government undertakes its full constitutional responsibility, the Beattie Labor government should stand condemned for its appalling inaction, not this federal Liberal government.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Vegetation Clearance in Queensland</title>,Matters of Urgency,18,1,speech
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2000-03-09,"—I must say that if I had a hat on I would take it off to Senator Boswell, because Senator Boswell this afternoon has laid down the only real issue in this whole debate—that is, the meetings that took place out at Longreach and Roma. The Longreach and Roma meetings were about one thing: not stopping clearing, but continuing the right to clear. That is what they were about. That is what they talk about out in that part of the world. 
What we have now is a smokescreen being put up to defend the position of the National Party along with One Nation and the City Country Alliance out in the rural seats. That is what this debate is really about—nothing more and nothing less. I never thought I would see the National Party go into an alliance with the City Country Alliance and One Nation on this issue, but obviously they have. According to the paper, they all marched down the street together at Roma to protest to Mr Beattie—it was a big deal, big issue, et cetera. The truth of the matter is that they do not want to see the Beattie legislation proceed which will bring a halt to quite irresponsible land clearing that has been taking place in Queensland. 
—What about the compensation?
—Senator McGauran, if you wanted to have a say, you should have got up earlier. Just keep out of this. 
What has happened is that in the state of Queensland legislation has been passed, parts of which will enable proper use of the land and proper clearing of the land under proper circumstances. What we have here is a bloody-minded attitude by the federal government to stop proper funding to enable that legislation to come into force.
Participating in this debate was our good friend Senator Eggleston from Western Australia. I do not know if he knows where Queensland is, but at least he stood up and read the prepared script, as Senator Bolkus pointed out. 
Let us look at the funding package that has been put forward. There were two parts to the Beattie funding package. The tree clearing funding package had a $111 million management budget which was Queensland's contribution. So you cannot say there was no contribution from Queensland. That contribution was $49.7 million in extension programs promoting good practice in managing the permit approval system; $38.6 million for landscape assessment and planning, mapping and monitoring; and $22.9 million to augment existing systems and to extend management to freehold tenures. What was being sought by the Beattie government was $103.2 million to cover these issues: $22.3 million in incentives for on-ground works, $44 million in adjustment assistance, $15 million for vegetation management assistance and $21.9 million as the acquisition budget. 
So the Queensland government were not abrogating their responsibility, contrary to the belief that some people would have taken from this debate this afternoon. The Queensland government were very much concerned about the issue of land clearing that has an ongoing legacy for generations to come in this nation. We are already paying the price for the land clearing that has taken place in this nation over a long period of time, predominantly from European settlement until now. If one reads the statistics that come out of the Bureau of Rural Sciences, one sees that the forest area has almost been halved and the woodland area has been cut by one-third, and one will find that most of that has been handed over for other purposes. The other interesting thing that comes to light when looking at the Bureau of Rural Sciences web site is this quote: 
... many people believe that the last major clearing for agriculture occurred in the 1970s and that relatively little had taken place since. However, a recent review undertaken for the National Greenhouse Gas Inventory suggested that annual rates of clearing over the period 1983-1993 could be greater than 500,000 hectares.
As was confirmed in question time today by the minister in response to a question from Senator Bartlett, there was a clearance of 300,000 to 400,000 hectares per year, 80 to 90 per cent of which took place in the state of Queensland. Quite obviously, the problem in the state of Queensland is worse than anywhere else in Australia. The problem is getting worse day by day. The Queensland government have put in place a piece of legislation which will address the problem and go to the problem, but we have rallies that are being supported to take on the Queensland government to say, `We don't want land clearing stopped. We want the inalienable right to clear land how we like, when we like and wherever we like.'
—You know that is not right. 
—That is the issue, Senator Boswell. You know that as well as I do. While you can play the federal government off against the Queensland government, you will continue to try to rally those supporters out there whom you have lost to One Nation and to the fragmentation of One Nation, the City Country Alliance.  
Clearly, the issue that we have before us here today is a very important national issue and a very important issue for the state of Queensland. There is the opportunity for the federal government to come to the party to provide a mere $103 million which could be diverted from other aspects of the Natural Heritage Trust and which would have gone to Queensland anyway at some time. 
Let us stop kidding each other. Let us get down to the real argument, and the real argument is that there are tree clearers in Queensland who want to keep their practices going. Let us stop them. Let the federal government start today by putting the money into the Queensland legislation and seeing a halt to irresponsible tree clearing in Queensland.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Vegetation Clearance in Queensland</title>,Matters of Urgency,18,1,speech
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2000-03-09,"—I will briefly conclude and remind the Senate that this is about a major national problem. Nobody disputes that, except possibly Senator Boswell. Yet, despite Senator Mason's best efforts to suggest that the federal government have done a lot, clearly what they have done has not worked, because it is a huge problem. The state of the environment report identified it as the major issue a number of years back. It is still a major issue. So whatever the federal government may have done has not worked. 
Senator Mason wants us to sell more of Telstra to fund the Natural Heritage Trust, yet the government's own mid-term review of the Natural Heritage Trust and the Bushcare program specifically rated it as `a failure on the environment'; `too small a scale to have much impact on sustainable production'—the issue we are talking about—`few projects specifically addressing this'; and `Bushcare is not effectively addressing sustainable production issues'. Yet you want us to sell more of Telstra to fund something that your own report says is a failure. I think we need to try another approach. Clearly, the lesson has not been learnt. It might be nice to suggest that all farmers are environmentalists and that they know best about when to clear, but clearly some of them do not. Some of them are acting irresponsibly; some of them are acting unsustainably.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2000-03-09,"—I wish to focus on the inquiry into the use of the Shoalwater Bay army training area by the Singaporean armed forces, which comes under one of the three international treaties included in report No. 29 of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. As part of this inquiry, the committee travelled to Rockhampton to speak with members of the local business community, local and state government representatives, local environmental groups and defence officials based in Rockhampton. The committee also inspected the training area and met with visiting officers of the Singaporean armed forces.
I would like to place on record my appreciation for the assistance given by everyone who put submissions in to the inquiry, facilitated meetings and the inspection of the training area or appeared as witnesses in the public hearings. I would like to thank the Singaporean armed forces for their frank and open discussions and for allowing the committee members to view their training exercise. In particular, I would like to thank Mr David Lim, Minister for State, Dr Bernard Chen, who was a member of the group of the representatives for Defence, and Colonel Chang Long Wee, the Singaporean armed forces defence attache, for their hospitality. I thank the mayor, Mr Jim McRae, and other local council and state government officials, who also gave up their valuable time to meet with us to discuss a number of issues of concern. I would also like to thank Mr Barry Large for coordinating the meeting with many representatives from the local business community, allowing us to gain first hand their perspectives on the implementation of this international agreement.
While we were told of the many economic benefits to the region that flow from the use of the training area by visiting international forces, there are also some difficulties needing to be addressed and suggested improvements in the implementation of this agreement. The committee also received in considerable detail information on the environmental strategies and protection measures in place to protect the environment. We were able to view at first hand the benefits of the department's managerial expertise in maintaining the high conservation value of this area.
In light of these and other benefits to Australia's international relations, our final report supported the proposed agreement. However, while we believe that this agreement is in Australia's national interest, there were some suggestions for improvement. We believe that the administrative and consultative processes over the duration of this agreement can be improved. We recommended that the Department of Defence undertake additional consultation with the local business community during the preparation of future agreements with international forces to expand the opportunities for local businesses. Additional consultations with the local environmental groups and improvements in the dissemination of information could also allay many of the concerns about the adequacy of the environmental management of the area. This would enable the conservation groups to have greater confidence in the environmental management expertise of the Department of Defence. 
We urge the department, the local business community and the environmental groups to be more proactive in maximising the benefits of an agreement such as this in the region. This inquiry provided an excellent example of the application of the reformed treaty making process and provided an opportunity for the Queensland community to have their say on a proposed international agreement which has significant employment opportunities for the region. I congratulate the Rockhampton community for taking advantage of this opportunity and thank them for their hospitality and the time and effort spent in preparing material and speaking with the committee. I encourage all Australians to take advantage of these opportunities. Public participation in our treaty review process is crucial if we are to ensure that the international agreements reflect and advance Australia's national interest.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2000-03-09,"—On Australia Day the most moving ceremony I attended was the unveiling of the Lyons Tribute in Devonport, Tasmania. It is a memorial to Devonport's most prominent and historically significant citizens: the Rt. Hon. Joseph Lyons, the only Tasmanian to be Prime Minister, and his wife, Dame Enid Lyons, a pioneer of women in Australian politics. The tribute consists of bronze busts sculpted by Tasmania's nationally acclaimed sculptor and civic engineer, Stephen Walker AM, mounted on stone plinths and set inside a hand-built rock wall on a paved viewing area beside the Mersey River. 
The project was an initiative of the Rotary Club of Devonport North who applied for, and received, funding of $25,000 under the Centenary of Federation Fund. The grant, added to other funding secured, ensured the completion of the very impressive project in time for the unveiling on Australia Day. In his introductory comments, the President of the Devonport North Rotary Club, Mr Alan Pattison, expressed the club's gratitude for their three main sources of financial assistance. In order of receipt they were $5,000 from the Commemoration of Historic Events and Famous Persons Program, $10,000 from the Devonport City Council and, finally, $20,000 from the Centenary of Federation Braddon Electorate Fund. 
The value of these grants was very much enhanced by the contributions of many local sponsors who showed great community spirit and supported Rotary in its endeavours. I must say that it is so wonderful to see the community and government working together to achieve something so significant. It is an excellent example to other individuals and organisations that want to achieve their vision. The Devonport North Rotary Club is to be warmly congratulated for its initiative. The first suggestion that the club should develop something to commemorate the Hon. Joe Lyons and Dame Enid Lyons was that of a former club president, the late Dr Peter Brothers, in 1994. My special thanks are recorded to Richard Quinn, the club secretary, and members of the Devonport North Rotary Club for allowing me to use some of the comprehensive details they gathered and the words they prepared for delivery in their speeches on that impressive unveiling day.
Special mention is also made of the four Rotarians who comprise the club committee which brought the Lyons Tribute from an idea to reality. They are Leon Wootton, John Phillips, Bruce Gowans and Richard Quinn. I am advised that together they spent many hundreds of hours over the last two years to bring the Lyons Tribute to completion especially for Australia Day 2000. This tribute will serve as a tangible reminder of the way two ordinary Tasmanians of humble origin rose to the pinnacle of citizenship and statesmanship in our country——so humble that, during his address on behalf of the Lyons family, Peter Lyons expressed the sentiment that his mother and father would be bewildered at the fuss that was made on that day. You had only to see their very modest graves at the local Mersey Vale cemetery to know exactly what he meant.  
Since Federation, the Hon. Joe Lyons is the only person who has been Premier of his state, 1923 to 1928, and Prime Minister of the country, 1932 to 1939. Dame Enid's achievements, as a pioneer of Australian women in politics while being the mother of 12 children, had a very significant impact on the national scene at the time. She was the first woman elected to the House of Representatives in 1943 and the first woman appointed to cabinet in 1949. One of the great strengths of the Lyons family was the sense of partnership that existed between husband and wife from the time of their marriage in 1915 until Joe's death in office in 1939. In her subsequent career, Dame Enid still drew inspiration from their time together. 
The joint tribute therefore preserves a very valuable part of Devonport's history. The city has come of age by recognising its famous forebears. I think it is a sign of maturity that this has eventually happened. How appropriate it is that the tribute was unveiled on Australia Day using funds from the Commemoration of Historic Events and Famous Persons Program and the Centenary of Federation funds. The Devonport North Rotary Club; the Mayor of the City of Devonport, Alderman Mary Binks, who unveiled the tribute; members of the Centenary of Federation Grant Electorate Advisory Committee; the member for Braddon, Sid Sidebottom; aldermen of the Devonport City Council; contractors; sponsors; council staff; and all those who in any way contributed can be justly proud of the magnificent Lyons Tribute that now stands on the western bank of the Mersey River in Devonport. Honourable senators, the tribute is a must to see for any visitor, and I invite all members and senators to the city of Devonport in the electorate of Braddon to view this outstanding achievement.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Lyons Tribute</title>,Adjournment,22,1,speech
