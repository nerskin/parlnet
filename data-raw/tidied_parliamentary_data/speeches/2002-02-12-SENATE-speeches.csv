"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2002-02-12,"—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
That the provision of standing order 111(6) which prevents the continuation or resumption of second reading debate on a bill within 14 days of its first introduction in either House not apply to the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2002.
I also table a statement of reasons justifying the need for the bill to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
Purpose of the Bill
The Bill will provide legislative commitment and support for the outcomes of the Regional Forest Agreements and for ongoing action to implement the Forest and Wood Products Action Agenda through the Forest and Wood Products Council.
Reasons for Urgency
Ten Regional Forest Agreements (RFAs) between the Commonwealth and four State Governments have now been concluded since the agreement between governments to implement RFAs in 1995. Some State Governments have challenged aspects of the outcomes of these agreements, introducing uncertainty about continuing Government commitment to the RFAs.
The substance of the Bill has been extensively debated in the Parliament. This Bill honours a commitment to regional communities, industry and some State Governments. It will commit the Commonwealth unequivocally to the outcomes achieved in the RFA process and increase the confidence of investors, environmental organisations and local communities in these outcomes so essential to RFAs being effective.
Passage of the Bill will also underpin ongoing action under the Forest and Wood Products Action Agenda through the Forest and Wood Products Council.
Failure to pass the Bill in the 2002 Autumn sittings would prolong uncertainty about the future of the RFAs. This could undermine the work of successive Commonwealth and State Governments, since the National Forest Policy Statement of 1992, to improve inter-governmental institutions and decision processes to support comprehensive forward planning of forest use.
(Circulated by authority of the Minister for Forestry and Conservation)
—Could I seek the indulgence of the Senate that the Leader of the House read out that request again?
—I would be happy to paraphrase it. It is to exempt the RFA Bill from the cut-off motion.
—You are giving notice?
—Yes, I am just giving notice, just like you just gave notice of a motion.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2002-02-12,"—I rise to make some remarks on what might perhaps be regarded as a more mundane issue after the strength of the motions of condolence we have heard today. Given it is such an auspicious day with the opening of the 40th Parliament, I mean to make some remarks about trade policy. Before that, I would like to note that I was very pleased to see that one Australian media outlet took up the challenge of presenting to the Australian community, in an interesting and informative way, a process as important to us as the opening of parliament. Sky News took it upon themselves to televise live the opening of parliament today. It is a commendable initiative and something that we should encourage.
As I said, I want to make some remarks about trade policy—in particular, about some of the more recent moves in Japan to involve Australia as a key member in future regional economic partnerships. I particularly want to note and commend the importance of the efforts and work of Minister Vaile and Austrade in regional trade engagement. In a recent speech, Japan's Prime Minister, Junichiro Koizumi, acknowledged our longstanding efforts to deepen relationships with countries in South-East Asia by saying we should `act together as a community and advance together' to further dialogue between Australia and ASEAN countries.
The speech of the Prime Minister of Japan signified a recognition within our region of the successful economic endeavours of the coalition government since 1996. It also rejected—as the Australian electorate wisely did last November—statements from the opposition that we have not focused adequately on relations with our near northern neighbours in recent years. Both Australia and Japan have made significant efforts to strengthen economic relations for some time, including the publishing of two recent reports—one released by Australia and one by Japan—on strengthening economic relations. The reports cover the revitalising of the bilateral arrangements in a broad range of areas, focusing on economics as a fundamental pillar of our relationship. Both of those reports recognise that, while the relationship remains strong, there is more to be done to negotiate a framework trade and economic agreement between the two countries. 
This idea was picked up at the Australia-Japan conference last year, which was a Prime Minister Howard-Prime Minister Mori bilateral initiative, jointly convened by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. I was fortunate to be a delegate to that conference, and it recommended that we look at this idea. Under the excellent chairmanship of Jerry Ellis, there was significant and valuable input by a number of participants, not least by my coalition colleague Kay Hull but also by Australians like Helen Nugent, John Moriarty, Mark Paterson, Paul Twomey and, of course, John McCarthy, the current Australian Ambassador to Japan.
The concept of entering into a trade and economic agreement fits naturally into Prime Minister Koizumi's vision for a growing East Asian community and agrees well with the direction taken up at that conference. This vision is multilayered. It has an economic focus, but the Japanese are also looking towards a network of cooperative agreements between individual countries that will build a whole network of much stronger collaboration. That may be cooperation in the security and strategic field but also in regional efforts to combat transnational crime, piracy, money laundering and people smuggling. As we know well in the current climate, these are very important. It is not about creating a new institution but rather about encouraging habits of cooperation that are already there and strengthening them—in Koizumi's words `to take meaningful actions for regional cooperation'.
We could, for example, start by focusing on what is in the new partnership agreement just concluded between Japan and Singapore, because Japan will be looking towards Australia to conclude similar agreements. Piece by piece, we can construct a patchwork quilt or a jigsaw puzzle of stronger relations, both on the economic and non-economic fronts. It fits very well with our own priorities; our own economic interests are fairly and squarely in the Asia-Pacific region. Japan is our No. 1 trading partner, China our No. 3 and Korea our No. 4. We are advancing not just our economic interests but also our strategic interests in this process.
The strengthening of economic partnerships in our region will be complementary to our pursuit of other global trade goals. The Doha round of multilateral negotiations is a very high priority for Australia and in some areas—such as reducing agricultural tariffs— it might be that the multilateral track is the most effective, but there are a number of things that Australia can do by way of both facilitation and cooperation to complement those reductions through the multilateral round. For example, we can look at linkages between industry and new sectors like IT, environmental management or establishing linkages between stock markets. There is a range of facilitation agreements to support and complement improvements that we can get through the new round. Even on questions like agriculture, we can look at harmonising quarantine procedures or streamlining custom standards or requirements so that those bilateral agreements can complement what is achieved through the multilateral round. I note that many of those subjects were covered in the report of September last year of the Senate References Committee on Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade, Japan: Politics and Society: Report 2 in the inquiry into Japan.
In the context of other regions which have set up economic community structures, we must acknowledge that the Asian region is much more diverse and uneven in its differing styles of government and development of economies, particularly in comparison to Europe. From my perspective, what Prime Minister Koizumi has in mind is a more loose and flexible arrangement because conditions are not right to move towards something along the lines of the European model of integration. The Embassy of Japan in Canberra has a new and able leader in incoming Ambassador Atsushi Hatakenaka. He is strongly focused on economic activity, given that that is the bedrock of the bilateral relationship, and so the mission is acting in the spirit of the recommendations that came out in the conference. For example, in May of this year there is a planned dialogue between higher education institutions and another on issues that plague both our countries such as ageing populations, the hollowing out of our regional areas and policy solutions for people who do not live in urban areas. 
About 800,000 Australians speak an Asian language. This should be a very valuable resource in future trade with countries in our region and in attracting foreign investment. The importance of language teaching in Australia and fostering links between young Australians and young people from our region cannot be overstated. It is an investment of time and effort for the sake of effective future relations which we cannot afford to ignore. There is a very active program by the Asia Education Foundation to improve the standard and quality of Asian teaching in Australia which involves study trips for Australian teachers to visit Asian countries. I know from the reports of those who have participated that it is regarded as a very positive and valuable program. The Australia Japan Foundation has a broad range of cultural and sporting exchange programs and strongly encourages English as a second language in Japan.
The Minister for Trade, Mark Vaile, has energetically and effectively pursued a number of important tracks for Australian trade. For example, on the World Trade Organisation multilateral track we have taken a lead in working through the Cairns Group of nonsubsidising agricultural exporters to get reduced subsidies on agricultural product. Within the regional organisations, of which APEC is our primary focus, we have achieved a strong level of influence in the region. Our CER agreement with New Zealand has been concluded, and last year's agreement to link the CER with the ASEAN Free Trade Area represents for the first time a much more comprehensive approach to promoting trade and investment linkages that will underpin both future growth and prosperity in Australia and throughout the region. We have made significant advances in maintaining and advancing new bilateral relationships since the coalition was elected in 1996. There are a number of examples in that regard: we are currently in negotiations for a free trade agreement with Singapore; we are conducting a scoping study on a free trade area with Thailand; and, as senators would know, we are also talking to the United States about a free trade agreement. These are important foci for the government and the minister. I look forward to the emphasis that will be placed on strengthening relationships with our region and that looks likely during this 40th Parliament.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Trade: Policy</title>,Adjournment,22,1,speech
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,2002-02-12," asked the Minister representing the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 19 June 2001:
(1)	How much compensation for health conditions related to radiation exposure to civilians and ex-servicemen involved in the nuclear tests in the 1950s and 60s and the subsequent clean up operations. Can the answer be provided to show breakdowns for: (a) Australian servicemen and women; (b) Indigenous people; (c) civilian contractors; (d) pastoralists; (e) families of the deceased; (f) health disorders for which compensation has been made; (g) number by year awarded compensation; and (h) the average compensation pay out.

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2002-02-12,"—The Minister for Veterans' Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question: 
 (1)	Compensation has been paid to claimants under:
·	the Special Administrative Scheme and the Act of Grace Scheme administered by the Department of Industry, Science and Resources; 
·	as result of a successful common law action;
·	under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988 administered by COMCARE; and 
·	the Military Compensation and Rehabilitation Service (MCRS) which assumed responsibility for claims by ex-service personnel in July 1991 from COMCARE.
The breakdown for each category is as follows:
(a)	9 payments have been made to Australian servicemen (a further 7 cases are still under consideration);
(b)	23 payments have been made to indigenous people;
(c)	6 payments have been made to civilians;
(d)	no payments have been made to pastoralists;
(e)	11 payments have been made to families of the deceased (excludes 3 payments to families in category (b));
(f)	the health disorders for which payments have been made include malignant neoplasms and skin conditions such as psoriasis; 
(g)	1981 (1), 1989 (7), 1990 (7), 1991 (1), 1992 (20), 1993 (1), 1994 (2), 1996 (2), 1998 (1), 2000 (3), 2001 (4); and
the average compensation payout has been $92,712.61
 (2)	Australian servicemen—342 (This figure includes some cases where the Commonwealth has accepted liability for conditions arising from a member's service but where no compensation has been paid.) 
Indigenous people—14
Civilians—11
(3)	Common Law Actions
Since the conclusion of the British Nuclear Testing Program, at least 79 common law actions against the Commonwealth have been instituted by ex-servicemen, other former Commonwealth employees and employees of Commonwealth contractors. 
Many of the cases before the courts have either been discontinued or withdrawn. Four cases have been heard by the court. 
(4)	Legal costs expended by the Commonwealth are funded by a Special Appropriation established in September 1989 to cover the costs of defending the Atomic Test related common law actions and compensation payments arising from these actions. To date, $5.13 million has been spent on both legal and compensation costs. It is not possible to provide a further breakdown of legal and compensation costs.
(5)	The Special Administrative Scheme was announced on 4 September 1989 and is administered by the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources. Changes to the Scheme were announced on 10 February 1995 and it now provides for the payment of compensation to those Australian participants (or their dependants) in the British atomic tests program who developed leukaemia (other than chronic lymphatic leukaemia) in the first 25 years after participation in the tests program.
The decision to commence the Scheme was based on the results of a study undertaken by the UK National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) of the health of participants in the British atomic tests program. The study, published in 1988, showed a possible increase in risk of test participants developing multiple myeloma and leukaemia (other than chronic lymphatic leukaemia). The UK Government then extended its war pensions scheme to cover British test participants with these conditions. As the activities of Australian and UK personnel at the sites were similar it was decided by the Australian Government to introduce a scheme to cover Australian participants.
Following the publication of a follow-up NRPB study in December 1993, the UK Government decided to accept new claims only where leukaemia (other than chronic lymphatic leukaemia) had developed in the first 25 years after participation in the atomic tests. On 10 February 1995 the Australian Government announced changes to the Special Administrative Scheme to reflect these later findings. 
 (6)	and (7) The Government will consider reviewing the Special Administrative Scheme and the Act of Grace Scheme if the results of the current health study suggest this is appropriate.
(8)	The preliminary version of the Nominal Roll of Australian participants in the British Atomic Tests Program conducted in Australia from 1952-1963 at present contains 16,716 names. The names on the Roll are in the following categories:
·	Navy—3,268;
·	Army—1,657;
·	RAAF—3,201; and
·	8,590 civilians, including 10 indigenous people.
Pastoralists are not identified separately within the civilian group.
(9)	It is not possible to provide an answer to this question at this stage. However, the Cancer Incidence and Mortality Study will match data with national cancer registers and death certificates. The information obtained from the Study will provide an estimate of the number of atomic tests participants who have died since the tests.
(10)	The preliminary Nominal Roll referred to in (8) has categories for civilian personnel, defence service personnel and indigenous people. 
The definition of an Australian 'Atomic Participant' for the purpose of the Roll is someone who was present, either working or as a visitor, in at least one of the testing areas whilst a test or tests were conducted in that area, or were there within a 2-year period after the explosions.
The Roll has been compiled by examining Department of Defence records (including ship lists of the involved HMA Ships, Routine Orders from the Army Units known to have been involved, and identified RAAF Squadrons and Squadron members), personnel records of private firms engaged for the purposes of conducting and supporting the tests, the Report of the Royal Commission into Atomic Testing (1986) and records of the issue of Maralinga Security Cards. Documents prepared previously for the purposes of listing participants in the tests and other documents provided by the various 'nuclear veteran' associations were also examined for any additional names and identifying details.
The names on the Roll have also been checked against the list of radiation-exposed personnel compiled by JR Maroney in the Australian Radiation Laboratory document `Personal Monitor Records From Exposure To Beta And Gamma Radiation During Engagement In The Program Of British Nuclear Weapons Tests In Australia', dated 10/12/1984.
The Roll contains the names of ten aboriginal residents who were present in the testing areas. Obtaining a comprehensive list of aboriginal people who were exposed to the tests because they were in the area is extremely difficult. It is recognised, therefore, that there are names of aboriginal people, who were in the area, that are missing from the Roll. This is partly because population information from the relevant communities (Yalata, Koonibba, Ernabella, Maralinga Tjarutja, Pitjantjatjara, Yankunytjara, Wallatinna, Ngaanyatjarra, Marble Bar and Cundeellee) was not sought or obtained at the time of the testing program and partly because movement of indigenous people through the restricted area during the testing period, may not have been effectively policed.
Similarly, a lack of contemporary population information on the residents of pastoral properties, which may have included some aboriginal people, means that the Roll may not include that group if they were not included as part of the information in other documents. However, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) have a representative on the Atomic Tests Participants Consultative Forum chaired by the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA). Officers from DVA and ATSIC are working together to identify sources from which this information may be obtained.
(11)	The Department of Industry, Science and Resources holds records for defence personnel and civilians involved at both the Emu Plain and Monte Bello Island Atomic Tests. These documents include a Nominal Roll for Australian participants at Emu Plain, Australian Radiation Laboratory records of radiation dose readings, Ship Lists for the 1952 and 1956 Monte Bello Island tests and RAAF lists for both Emu Plain and the Monte Bello Islands. 
 (12)	and (13)
(a)	No comparison has yet been done between the Atomic Tests Participants Nominal Roll and DVA data bases to determine the number of atomic tests participants in receipt of a disability pension. Such a comparison would be time consuming and could not be completed until the Nominal Roll was finalised.
(b)	No disability pension paid by DVA would be paid for illnesses relating to atomic testing. Atomic testing is not service covered by the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. Therefore, all pensions paid by DVA are for conditions arising from service other than atomic testing.
(14)	The Special Administrative Scheme and the Act of Grace Scheme were announced through the issue of separate Ministerial media releases. In addition, the plaintiff for common law actions, Maurice May and Company, has been regularly provided information on the two schemes for distribution to their clients. The Government has also directly provided potential claimants with details of the two schemes in response to requests for information through correspondence with Ministers or officials, and has provided information directly to Atomic Test Veterans' groups for circulation to its members. 
Senator Gareth Evans, the then Minister for Resources and Energy announced the then Government's response to the Royal Commission into British Nuclear Tests in Australia, as recorded in Hansard on 17 September 1986. In that response, Senator Evans announced the Government's intention to establish a scheme to allow claims to be considered under the Compensation (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1971, to be administered by the Department of Social Security. The Minister also extended an invitation to the Aboriginal communities' legal representative to submit claims for compensation.
Australian defence personnel have previously been made aware of the role of the MCRS through media releases and information made available to members at their workplace. 
(15)	This allegation received media attention in 1984 and was brought to the attention of the Royal Commission and is referred to in the list of exhibits at the back of the Report. The Royal Commission considered this allegation and rejected it as having no substance.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Nuclear Weapons: Testing</title>,Answers to Questions on Notice,25,1,answer
