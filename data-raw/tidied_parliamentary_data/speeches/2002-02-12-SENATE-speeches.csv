"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,2002-02-12,"—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
That the provision of standing order 111(6) which prevents the continuation or resumption of second reading debate on a bill within 14 days of its first introduction in either House not apply to the Regional Forest Agreements Bill 2002.
I also table a statement of reasons justifying the need for the bill to be considered during these sittings and seek leave to have the statement incorporated in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
Purpose of the Bill
The Bill will provide legislative commitment and support for the outcomes of the Regional Forest Agreements and for ongoing action to implement the Forest and Wood Products Action Agenda through the Forest and Wood Products Council.
Reasons for Urgency
Ten Regional Forest Agreements (RFAs) between the Commonwealth and four State Governments have now been concluded since the agreement between governments to implement RFAs in 1995. Some State Governments have challenged aspects of the outcomes of these agreements, introducing uncertainty about continuing Government commitment to the RFAs.
The substance of the Bill has been extensively debated in the Parliament. This Bill honours a commitment to regional communities, industry and some State Governments. It will commit the Commonwealth unequivocally to the outcomes achieved in the RFA process and increase the confidence of investors, environmental organisations and local communities in these outcomes so essential to RFAs being effective.
Passage of the Bill will also underpin ongoing action under the Forest and Wood Products Action Agenda through the Forest and Wood Products Council.
Failure to pass the Bill in the 2002 Autumn sittings would prolong uncertainty about the future of the RFAs. This could undermine the work of successive Commonwealth and State Governments, since the National Forest Policy Statement of 1992, to improve inter-governmental institutions and decision processes to support comprehensive forward planning of forest use.
(Circulated by authority of the Minister for Forestry and Conservation)
—Could I seek the indulgence of the Senate that the Leader of the House read out that request again?
—I would be happy to paraphrase it. It is to exempt the RFA Bill from the cut-off motion.
—You are giving notice?
—Yes, I am just giving notice, just like you just gave notice of a motion.
—He has given notice of a motion and he sought leave to incorporate a statement relating to it.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2002-02-12,"—I rise to make some remarks on what might perhaps be regarded as a more mundane issue after the strength of the motions of condolence we have heard today. Given it is such an auspicious day with the opening of the 40th Parliament, I mean to make some remarks about trade policy. Before that, I would like to note that I was very pleased to see that one Australian media outlet took up the challenge of presenting to the Australian community, in an interesting and informative way, a process as important to us as the opening of parliament. Sky News took it upon themselves to televise live the opening of parliament today. It is a commendable initiative and something that we should encourage.
As I said, I want to make some remarks about trade policy—in particular, about some of the more recent moves in Japan to involve Australia as a key member in future regional economic partnerships. I particularly want to note and commend the importance of the efforts and work of Minister Vaile and Austrade in regional trade engagement. In a recent speech, Japan's Prime Minister, Junichiro Koizumi, acknowledged our longstanding efforts to deepen relationships with countries in South-East Asia by saying we should `act together as a community and advance together' to further dialogue between Australia and ASEAN countries.
The speech of the Prime Minister of Japan signified a recognition within our region of the successful economic endeavours of the coalition government since 1996. It also rejected—as the Australian electorate wisely did last November—statements from the opposition that we have not focused adequately on relations with our near northern neighbours in recent years. Both Australia and Japan have made significant efforts to strengthen economic relations for some time, including the publishing of two recent reports—one released by Australia and one by Japan—on strengthening economic relations. The reports cover the revitalising of the bilateral arrangements in a broad range of areas, focusing on economics as a fundamental pillar of our relationship. Both of those reports recognise that, while the relationship remains strong, there is more to be done to negotiate a framework trade and economic agreement between the two countries. 
This idea was picked up at the Australia-Japan conference last year, which was a Prime Minister Howard-Prime Minister Mori bilateral initiative, jointly convened by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. I was fortunate to be a delegate to that conference, and it recommended that we look at this idea. Under the excellent chairmanship of Jerry Ellis, there was significant and valuable input by a number of participants, not least by my coalition colleague Kay Hull but also by Australians like Helen Nugent, John Moriarty, Mark Paterson, Paul Twomey and, of course, John McCarthy, the current Australian Ambassador to Japan.
The concept of entering into a trade and economic agreement fits naturally into Prime Minister Koizumi's vision for a growing East Asian community and agrees well with the direction taken up at that conference. This vision is multilayered. It has an economic focus, but the Japanese are also looking towards a network of cooperative agreements between individual countries that will build a whole network of much stronger collaboration. That may be cooperation in the security and strategic field but also in regional efforts to combat transnational crime, piracy, money laundering and people smuggling. As we know well in the current climate, these are very important. It is not about creating a new institution but rather about encouraging habits of cooperation that are already there and strengthening them—in Koizumi's words `to take meaningful actions for regional cooperation'.
We could, for example, start by focusing on what is in the new partnership agreement just concluded between Japan and Singapore, because Japan will be looking towards Australia to conclude similar agreements. Piece by piece, we can construct a patchwork quilt or a jigsaw puzzle of stronger relations, both on the economic and non-economic fronts. It fits very well with our own priorities; our own economic interests are fairly and squarely in the Asia-Pacific region. Japan is our No. 1 trading partner, China our No. 3 and Korea our No. 4. We are advancing not just our economic interests but also our strategic interests in this process.
The strengthening of economic partnerships in our region will be complementary to our pursuit of other global trade goals. The Doha round of multilateral negotiations is a very high priority for Australia and in some areas—such as reducing agricultural tariffs— it might be that the multilateral track is the most effective, but there are a number of things that Australia can do by way of both facilitation and cooperation to complement those reductions through the multilateral round. For example, we can look at linkages between industry and new sectors like IT, environmental management or establishing linkages between stock markets. There is a range of facilitation agreements to support and complement improvements that we can get through the new round. Even on questions like agriculture, we can look at harmonising quarantine procedures or streamlining custom standards or requirements so that those bilateral agreements can complement what is achieved through the multilateral round. I note that many of those subjects were covered in the report of September last year of the Senate References Committee on Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade, Japan: Politics and Society: Report 2 in the inquiry into Japan.
In the context of other regions which have set up economic community structures, we must acknowledge that the Asian region is much more diverse and uneven in its differing styles of government and development of economies, particularly in comparison to Europe. From my perspective, what Prime Minister Koizumi has in mind is a more loose and flexible arrangement because conditions are not right to move towards something along the lines of the European model of integration. The Embassy of Japan in Canberra has a new and able leader in incoming Ambassador Atsushi Hatakenaka. He is strongly focused on economic activity, given that that is the bedrock of the bilateral relationship, and so the mission is acting in the spirit of the recommendations that came out in the conference. For example, in May of this year there is a planned dialogue between higher education institutions and another on issues that plague both our countries such as ageing populations, the hollowing out of our regional areas and policy solutions for people who do not live in urban areas. 
About 800,000 Australians speak an Asian language. This should be a very valuable resource in future trade with countries in our region and in attracting foreign investment. The importance of language teaching in Australia and fostering links between young Australians and young people from our region cannot be overstated. It is an investment of time and effort for the sake of effective future relations which we cannot afford to ignore. There is a very active program by the Asia Education Foundation to improve the standard and quality of Asian teaching in Australia which involves study trips for Australian teachers to visit Asian countries. I know from the reports of those who have participated that it is regarded as a very positive and valuable program. The Australia Japan Foundation has a broad range of cultural and sporting exchange programs and strongly encourages English as a second language in Japan.
The Minister for Trade, Mark Vaile, has energetically and effectively pursued a number of important tracks for Australian trade. For example, on the World Trade Organisation multilateral track we have taken a lead in working through the Cairns Group of nonsubsidising agricultural exporters to get reduced subsidies on agricultural product. Within the regional organisations, of which APEC is our primary focus, we have achieved a strong level of influence in the region. Our CER agreement with New Zealand has been concluded, and last year's agreement to link the CER with the ASEAN Free Trade Area represents for the first time a much more comprehensive approach to promoting trade and investment linkages that will underpin both future growth and prosperity in Australia and throughout the region. We have made significant advances in maintaining and advancing new bilateral relationships since the coalition was elected in 1996. There are a number of examples in that regard: we are currently in negotiations for a free trade agreement with Singapore; we are conducting a scoping study on a free trade area with Thailand; and, as senators would know, we are also talking to the United States about a free trade agreement. These are important foci for the government and the minister. I look forward to the emphasis that will be placed on strengthening relationships with our region and that looks likely during this 40th Parliament.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Trade: Policy</title>,Adjournment,22,1
