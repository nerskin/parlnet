"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,1999-06-23,"—by leave—Given that we have a motion for a guillotine before the Senate, there obviously is a capacity for me to move, subject to contingent notice of motion, a suspension of standing orders to allow debate on the motion that the Manager of Government Business has just moved. The Manager of Government Business has indicated to me, as Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, that it is not the government's intention to gag the allotment of time motion that is before the chair. On that basis, it is the opposition's intention to have a substantive debate on the allotment of time motion and not to proceed to suspending standing orders to allow debate on the motion that the manager has moved. The manager has given me a commitment that it is not the government's intention to gag the allotment of time motion and, on that basis, I will proceed in that way.
	 Question put:
	 That the motion (Senator Ian Campbell's)  be agreed to.

—Now that both of these bills are being debated, I will table the supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendments being moved to this bill, the Environmental Reform (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1998 [1999] .

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-06-23,"—A few points need to be made to clarify the record. We have the Democrats claiming that this legislation is an improvement because the Minister for the Environment and Heritage now has the role of making decisions. What a joke. Anyone who has been involved in government and anyone with a day's experience in this place would understand that there is no such thing as unfettered ministerial discretion. The systems of cabinet and the systems of government are such that a minister consults with other ministers. At the end of the day, matters go to cabinet. For Senator Lees to be saying on radio this morning and here today that this is a major improvement because from now on Senator Hill will make huge decisions in respect of mining, in respect of logging and in respect of protecting the environment is basically a hoax on her supporters and on the Australian public. There is nothing further from the truth.
What this legislation does is to actually reduce the transparency of the decision making process. At least under the existing legislation there is transparency and there is publication of decisions and recommenda 
 tions. That will go. The system adopted by the Australian Democrats and pushed by the government will mean no transparency. It will mean less accountability. It will still mean a minister consulting and being, in a sense, influenced by cabinet, but we will not have the same degree of transparency and, consequently, accountability because of the grubby little deal that the Democrats have entered into. Why have they done this? People across Australia are actually asking this morning: why have the Democrats given up their environmental cause?
—Who are these `people across Australia'?
—I reckon there is one reason, Senator Hill. You can laugh, because you have conned them. You have conned them all the way to this chamber into a situation where we have 25 minutes this morning to discuss 300 amendments.
—I was laughing at your `people across Australia'.
—That amounts to about 10 seconds at most per amendment. It would be a joke to try to go through them all. The reason they have done this is to save their own skins. We are all asking why. I will tell you what has happened. The government has given them an assurance that they will not change the voting system for the Senate. That is what is behind this. There is no core concern for the environment, no core concern for biodiversity and no core concern for nuclear actions. There is no core concern for anything that they have pretended to be concerned about for such a long time. When it came to the crunch, when they sat down with the government across the table, maybe over a cup of tea, the assurance was given to the Democrats that the government would not change the voting procedures.
To save their own skins, they are prepared to jeopardise the skins of so many of their constituents. This is what this is all about. For what other reason would they be rejecting the sorts of amendments that we are putting up this morning? These are the sorts of amendments that will ensure that a federal minister cannot write off any scrutiny or any assessment through the mechanisms of bilateral 
 agreements, declarations or conservation agreements.
These are the things that Senator Allison has railed against for so long, yet these are the things that she now embraces. These are mechanisms to avoid national scrutiny. She said, `We've got six matters of national environmental significance,' but she knows, and Senator Lees should know—if she does not know, she is incompetent; if she does know, then she is guilty of misleading the public, who do know—that these matters of national environmental significance can also be cascaded through to the states. They also know that there is no degree of public accountability and participation that is adequate enough, because they are the sorts of amendments that they are rejecting this morning.
They are rejecting amendments that would introduce a pretty wide range, as opposed to their limited range, of criminal offences. They are rejecting amendments about the protection of critical habitat. They are rejecting amendments that would protect against expansion of the nuclear industry. They say, `We've got an amendment,' but the amendment they have does very little to protect against new generations of industry development in the nuclear industry in Australia.
They are rejecting these amendments either through incompetence or deliberate action. They are rejecting in this batch of amendments a trigger for greenhouse actions. We have circulated one; we are moving one. It is a trigger that has been on the table with the minister for quite some time now. Greenhouse actions are defined in our amendment—the trigger is there. Let us spend some time looking at it. We do not maintain that it is perfect. We do maintain, however, that it is within the capacity of this parliament—and we have had some time to do it—to actually define a greenhouse trigger. But no, this trigger has been rejected by the Australian Democrats as part of the deal to save their own skins. Indigenous people have also been sacrificed in that respect. The Democrats are embracing a concept where, by declaration, a Commonwealth minister can basically exempt Commonwealth land or Commonwealth agencies from the operations of environmental 
 assessment and scrutiny. They are adopting a system where, through bilaterals, this same thing can happen. They say that the bilateral arrangement has been refined. I will get to that in a minute.
They are rejecting proposals for public participation. As I said earlier, they are rejecting proposals to extend nuclear actions to include the establishment or significant modification of nuclear fuel fabrication plants, nuclear reactors and power plants, nuclear storage facilities and enrichment plants. They are rejecting proposals that would ensure that only on the grounds of the security of the Commonwealth, as opposed to this broad, ever-blossoming exemption clause of commercial-in-confidence, will public accountability be excluded. They are rejecting amendments that would ensure that ESD principles are firmly entrenched. They are rejecting amendments to protect world heritage properties. In respect of the Northern Territory there is an agreement, and there is an agreement with respect to bilaterals, but this legislation is nowhere near the benchmark provided for in the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act in so many matters. There are some incremental improvements, but this is not as good.
This deal adopted by the Australian Democrats lets the cause of the environment down enormously. One only has to look at the leading lawyers in this country and their views to come to that conclusion. Associate Professor Rob Fowler, the Director of the Australian Centre for Environmental Law at the Adelaide University, had to work overnight like the rest of us to examine over 500 government amendments. His view is that the Democrats are wrong and misleading on key provisions of this legislation. He is right. It does not take a Rhodes scholar to work out that they have sold out. This is what he says:
The government-Democrat deal on national environment laws expected to be guillotined through the Senate today is fundamentally flawed—
—He is fundamentally wrong.
—He is a person who gave evidence, Senator Hill, to the parliamentary inquiry, and Senator Allison embraced his evidence and thought he was a 
 great witness. You say he is wrong, but unfortunately for you I think the jury is against you on this one. It is fundamentally flawed, according to one of Australia's leading environmental lawyers. To continue, this is what he says:
On the crucial issue of handing Commonwealth responsibilities to the states the amendments added procedural hoops but still allowed delegation of these responsibilities, and comments to the contrary by Senator Lyn Allison are wrong and misleading.
Senator Allison, do you know and are you misleading, or don't you know and should you not be here? The benchmark on this is one that you yourself have created. You are also on the record of that parliamentary committee as saying that Professor Fowler's evidence was amongst the best that we had. Here is the press statement. I am sure it will be an advance on the debate.
Senator Hill says Professor Fowler is wrong. We are talking about a person who has had 25 years of teaching environmental law. Senator Hill, you put your experience up against his; you put your talents and qualities up against his. He is the co-editor of the environment law chapter of the Laws of Australia Compendium of the Law Book of Australia.
—Haven't you ever come across an academic who is wrong?
—Senator Hill, I have come across more politicians who are wrong than academics who are wrong. I have come across more ministers who have been misled by their departments. What are they adopting? They are adopting a system that is flawed, a system that will give us duplication and a system that will basically accredit not just state laws but laws made under state laws. It will accredit local government authorities. We are moving to a system whereby national responsibility can be divested to the Shire Council of Hervey Bay. If sand mining on Fraser Island is allowed under a management plan accepted in this place, warm and fuzzy as it might appear, then this parliament writes off its powers to intervene and protect against that.
I could talk all day about this, but I know Senator Brown and Senator Margetts want to 
 say something as well so I will stop here. I will just say to the Democrats that you are fundamentally flawed, and you will be remembered for this.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION BILL 1998 [1999]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1999-06-23,"—Yesterday I suggested that an orderly way to proceed with this might be that I move all of the government amendments in relation to chapters 2 and 4. Last night I did not get leave to proceed in that manner. I again seek leave to proceed in that manner. Unless you, Madam Temporary Chairman, can suggest a better course of action that may be open to us, it would seem to me that within a limited time frame it would be better to deal with the batch of amendments which have to be voted on at 11.30 a.m.
Leave not granted.
—I move the first government amendment in my name:
(10)	 Clause 11, page 8 (line 19), omit paragraph (c).
I also want to respond to a few of the points made by Senator Bolkus in what seemed to be a slightly abbreviated rerun of his second reading debate speech. In actual fact he is quite wrong. This is a major reform of Australia's environmental laws that has been recognised by academics, including the one to which he referred, as long overdue. I do not think I have come across anyone who has objectively and carefully looked at Australia's environmental laws at the Commonwealth level and not found that they are significantly wanting. They are really outdated. They are not in fact immediately triggered by environmental issues at all; they are triggered by actions that might be taken by the Commonwealth government that have no direct relationship to environmental matters at all.
This is the point that I was seeking to make last night: it makes no difference to environmental consequence if the funding of a particular project is funding from overseas that requires a FIRB approval, as opposed to funding internally. It is a nonsense to now say that the Commonwealth should have a responsibility only where it related to the overseas funding and not where it related to the domestic funding. The test, of course, for the 
 Commonwealth—and for Commonwealth intervention—should be whether it concerns a matter of national environmental significance. It seemed to the government—and it actually seemed to others before we came to government—that that was the logical way in which to progress a reform of environment laws in this country. This is bearing in mind that, in the federal system in which we operate, what makes sense is to define what should be the Commonwealth responsibility and, as a consequence of that, to make it clear what remains a state responsibility—from an assessment point of view and also from the point of view of responsibility—and then to put in place procedures that allow for an interrelationship of the two to achieve a better national outcome.
The Labor Party was aware—as I know when I came to government—of these issues and of these representations from the type of academic to which Senator Bolkus has referred. But in their 13 years in government unfortunately they found it too hard, like so many other things, such as the new taxation system that we are going to be debating for the remainder of this week. It remained in the too-hard basket, therefore it did not ever get to the chamber. We acknowledged that the reform was long overdue and that we should tackle it, even though it was complex and politically difficult. We are well aware that there are a range of stakeholders in these debates—industry being one, obviously the states being another, conservation groups another, indigenous groups yet another—and often it is not easy to find a formula that can meet the satisfaction of all.
Notwithstanding that political difficulty, we decided the time had come and that we should tackle it. We said that the logical starting point was to seek to negotiate with the states on where that dividing line should be between Commonwealth responsibility and state responsibility so that it is much more meaningful to the community than what currently exists. Thus we sought to define—and I mention this in particular because this is part of the clauses that we are debating, between chapters 2 and 4—matters of national environmental significance, and there has 
 been considerable debate as to where that line should have been drawn.
We have heard, in the early parts of this debate, the Labor Party list a whole range of other issues that they say should have been included as primary Commonwealth responsibility—for example, land clearing. But land clearing was not included because in our view the primary responsibility on issues of natural resource management, such as land clearing, does and should remain with the states. That does not mean that there is not a national interest, and that does not mean that the Commonwealth will not take an active interest in the matter. In fact, as you would know, Madam Temporary Chairman, this government is investing substantial sums of taxpayers' money to revegetate Australia and to protect remnant bushland. This is pursuant to agreements that have been reached between the Commonwealth and the states whereby the states have agreed that they will ensure that action is not taken within their jurisdiction that threatens endangered species or ecological communities and also that they will work towards a reduction of overall land clearing in this country.
The fact that there is still too much land clearing and that overclearing has caused very significant environmental damage—in particular its linkage to dryland salinity and the like—is not in dispute, and the response must therefore be partnership between the Commonwealth government, the state government and the community. But the primary responsibility in terms of the regulatory response for land clearing must be that of the states: some states have introduced appropriate regulations as a safety net, and some states are still yet to do that. We did not see that the Commonwealth should, in effect, take over that primary role of the states in that regard; the pressure should remain on the states to make sound decisions and the role of Commonwealth should be to support the states and, through them, the community to achieve better outcomes in that very important environmental area.
So that is an example of an issue that is of national importance, but we have not defined it as a matter of national environmental 
 significance in terms of a Commonwealth trigger. By a `trigger', I mean where the Commonwealth is primarily responsible for assessment and approval of an action that might have a detrimental consequence upon that matter of national environmental significance. Our definitions at this stage are more limited than that but they are very significant. I think the most significant one of all is in fact that of endangered species, because it demonstrates a change of attitude by the Australian community. There was a time when endangered species were seen as primarily the responsibility of the states. There is a species in South Australia on the verge of extinction and there is no doubt in my mind at all now that all Australians regard that as a matter of concern to them; a matter in which they expect the involvement of their Commonwealth or national government. We have listed matters of endangered species as a matter of national environmental significance, so an action that might have a detrimental effect upon such a species would require assessment and approval at the Commonwealth level.
That takes us to the other important part of these chapters. Whilst we acknowledge that the Commonwealth should take primary responsibility for these areas of national environmental significance, such as endangered species, world heritage, Ramsar internationally listed wetlands and the like, it is also not always appropriate for the Commonwealth to carry out the assessment process itself. This is because the states are physically closer to the action for which the consent is being sought. They have the bureaucracies on the ground that are often better able to carry out this work than the Commonwealth. Therefore, it seems to us, again in a system where we have a cooperative relationship between the different tiers of government, that there will be circumstances when it will be better for the state to carry out an assessment process for the Commonwealth. It might surprise some in the chamber to learn that that actually occurs now, but it occurs on an ad hoc basis.
What we are more interested in is putting in a process that can give the public confidence that, when the state is carrying out that 
 assessment process for the Commonwealth, it is carrying it out according to best contemporary practice. So we have developed this concept of bilateral agreements between the Commonwealth and the states that will allow the states, in certain circumstances, to assess for the Commonwealth the consequences of a particular action and, in even more limited circumstances—but there is no surprise in that because we have said it to the states all along—to even make an approval for the Commonwealth, pursuant to bilateral agreements.
There was concern—and I concede that concern—by some that this might mean, in practice, a passing of responsibility from the Commonwealth to the states. A number of the amendments that we have before us in these parts that we are debating today are to ensure that the responsibility of the Commonwealth is not passed while we pass the administrative role. It was never our intention that that responsibility pass but, nevertheless, we accepted that the community has a right to be confident beyond our assertions to that fact. We are building in with these amendments a number of processes of public participation, greater transparency and, in certain limited instances, even the capacity to disallow by this body.
On the issue which is more likely to happen in practice—the state carrying out an assessment for the Commonwealth—it may not be that that bilateral agreement will be through regulation that will set out the benchmarks, although that will be our goal and we will be heading down that path forthwith upon the passage of this bill. But if it is impossible for us to get the agreement of the chamber to that bilateral agreement—in other words, if it were disallowed—we would still be able to proceed. We are confident that we can get an agreement of best practice in relation to assessments that can be put in the form of regulation and that will not be disallowed. But we have the two fall backs, and I think this is important to industry. Those fall backs are that we can proceed under the state agreement, if we have made our best efforts, and we always have the alternative of being able to carry out the assessment ourselves.
In relation to approvals, which are of even greater concern to some conservation groups, as I said, there are further restrictions. That is not surprising, because when the responsibility is passed to the Commonwealth by legislation it would be an unusual experience indeed for a Commonwealth minister to say that the state minister can make the decision—that is, the decision rather than the process—for the Commonwealth minister. We have demonstrated, particularly in relation to Shark Bay, that it is possible under management agreements that have been approved by the Commonwealth minister, that meet the best contemporary standards, that within such limited circumstances that responsibility can be passed. But we have said, as an extra safeguard, that that will be disallowable in this place. Of course, if it is disallowed, although I do not think it will be, it will revert to the Commonwealth responsibility. So industry does not miss out in that it is not delayed, and also the system will work.
Why do I say that this will be unnecessary? It is really because what we are planning in the development of the bilateral agreements is a transparent process. We want the involvement of the community in that process; we want the involvement of parliamentary parties. That is why we sought to negotiate these amendments with the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Greens, but neither were interested. If after the passage of this bill they do want to be involved—I hope the Australian Democrats will also be involved in the development of these bilaterals—to ensure that we are adopting best international practice, we would be very pleased to engage their participation. (Time expired)",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION BILL 1998 [1999]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-06-23,"—We are left with two minutes for a debate on the most comprehensive environmental matters while the Australian Democrats sat mute and allowed the minister to give a long dissertation. I draw attention to the pleas of people outside this place that the legislation not proceed. I refer to an urgent plea sent to Senator Lees and the Democrats from Dr Aila Keto, the President of the Australian Rainforest Conservation Society, summing up the damage this bill will do to 
 the environment, saying this must not occur and calling for it to be called off. I have a letter from that magnificent elder Australian, Judith Wright McKinney, saying it has been such a let-down with the Democrats, nobody can be mistaken about the need for a greens party now and what a foolish and unpredictable thing this is.
I draw the committee's attention in the seconds that are left to the very important amendment, which I have now circulated, to ensure that the minister does retain the power to overrule a bilateral agreement where the environment is manifestly being damaged. I hope that the Democrats will support that amendment because it is ostensibly one of the things on which they went to the prime ministerial table and they failed to get. I draw particular attention to it. The amendment complies in small measure with the concerns that Associate Professor Rob Fowler—he has been referred to earlier as an expert in the field—has. I can give an explanatory statement to the Democrats. We will test them on that one.
—Order, Senator Brown! It being 11.30 a.m., time for consideration of this amendment and chapters 2 to 4 has concluded. I shall now proceed to put the question.
—I have a question about whether or not there are opposition amendments to this part.
—I shall put government amendment No. 10. After that has been dealt with, I shall proceed to put the remainder of the government amendments—some that are split because they are not straight amendments; they are opposition to a clause standing as printed. I will then invite opposition and minor parties, if there are parts or numbers of their amendments that they wish to seek leave to move, to indicate to me which numbers they wish to move, and that course will be followed if leave is granted. Is that clear?
—I have a point of clarification. The Senate has not actually given leave for the government's amendments to be taken together. Does this gag overrule the standing orders which have not given the 
 government the right to move all their amendments together?
—Standing order 142 allows and requires that all the government amendments be put because they have been circulated for more than two hours. They will be put together unless somebody indicates to me that they wish to vote differently or call a division on different items.
—The opposition amendments were also circulated last night and if I need to formally move them, I will do so.
—No, you do not formally need to move them.
—Can I suggest that these amendments also be treated as one batch?
—You can seek leave to have them put, after we have dealt with the government amendments.
—Madam Chair, I raise a point of order. Standing order 84 states:
The President may order a complicated question to be divided.
This is an extraordinarily complicated question. We have dozens of amendments, totally unrelated to each other, some dealing with migratory species and others with matters to do with totally different aspects of the Australian environment. In such a complicated situation, I ask the chair to very diligently sort out those amendments and put separately amendments referring to one subject. It would be totally contrary to the spirit of the standing orders for an amalgam of totally disparate amendments to be put at this time. I ask that each of the amendments be put seriatim so that we can vote on them and know what we are voting on. I think it would be totally contrary to the standing orders for these to be put in the batches as indicated.
—I will read to you a ruling that I have received as to how I intend to operate, that is:
Standing order 142(4) requires that, at the expiration of the time allotted for the consideration of a bill, the chair should put any amendment circulated by the government at least two hours before that time.  

Standing order 84(3) empowers the chair to divide a question (this applies in committee by virtue of standing order 144(7)).
The chair divides a question at the request of a senator if the senator indicates that this will facilitate the senator voting in accordance with the senator's choice, for example, if the senator wishes to vote against a part of a question and for another part.
There are now a large number of amendments to be resolved and I will divide the questions on the various groups of amendments only if a senator clearly indicates that this step is required to allow the senator to exercise the senator's choice in voting on the questions. Is that clear?
—You said, `as an example, if a senator wants to vote differently on a particular instance.' I think it is an outrage that we are being asked to do this in this way, considering the various topics that are included here. Personally, I believe that we should vote on them separately and I am asking that we vote on them separately.
—I will allow that to proceed only if you can indicate to me that you are going to change your vote on a particular—
—The standing order that you read out said, `for example, if a senator wanted to vote separately.' I believe the principle here is that these should be recorded. It is only an example and it does not mean that this is the basis upon which it should be done. If you are now going to rule that the only basis on which a person can ask for a separate vote is that they are going to vote separately, that is going to be a new part of the standing order, which will then be a precedent for future votes.
—No, I am acting under standing order 142(4) and if I act on that alone, at the expiration of the time allotted for the consideration of a bill I will put any amendments circulated by the government at least two hours before that time. It does not say separately, either. I then go onto standing order 84(3) and that empowers me to divide the question, and I will only divide the question if a senator indicates to me that they wish to vote a different way on that group. I have ruled that that is the way I am going to rule, 
 that is, I will take all those as a block and if you wish to vote a different way to parts of those in the block, you should indicate to me that you are going to do so and I will divide them. If you do not indicate that you wish to change your vote for different sections of the block, then I will put the block as a whole. If you disagree with my rulings, there are procedures that you can adopt, but that is the way I intend to proceed.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION BILL 1998 [1999]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1

These are vital improvements to this legislation coming from the Greens (WA) and the Australian Greens on behalf of the conservation movement. I ask the Democrats to use their leverage, which is total, on this minister for the environment to ensure that leave is given for that to be put to a vote.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-06-23,"—I refer now to Australian Greens amendment No. 1 on sheet 1445. This is the important overriding clause that ensures the minister for the environment retains the power to override states that are doing destructive things to the environment, including to the forests. This amendment pre-empts a Democrat amendment coming down the line which will have no teeth; this one does. I ask that leave be given for this amendment to be put to this chamber.
—First of all, is leave granted?
—No.
Leave not granted.
—Senator Brown, you are testing the patience of the chair and the prerogative of the chair—
—Madam Chair, I rise on a point of order. I do not believe it is reasonable for the chair presiding to suggest that their patience is being tested. It is proper—
—We are not interested in what you believe.
—With respect, it is proper for non-government senators, who do not have the advantage that operates under the guillotine of automatically having their amendments put, to seek leave in the way that non-government senators are. It might be a bit repetitious—
—What is your point of order?
—My point of order is that the issues are important, and it does not matter what side of the chamber senators are on or what party they come from—
—What is your point of order?
—If they represent a political party they are entitled to seek leave to ask that a question be put to the committee. It may be—
—That is not the problem, Senator. I can give you a ruling.
—Madam Chair, it may cause you personally some concerns but I must say that it is an entitlement of the chamber to do so. I am not in—
—Order! What is your point of order?
—My point of order is that I am not in the business of defending Senator Brown, but he is entitled to seek leave on these questions and that is the point I would make to you or any other chair of the committee presiding.
—Thank you, Senator Faulkner. He is entitled to seek leave but he 
 is not entitled to make a comment and to go into further debate.

—Order! You are out of order. Just tell me which item you are seeking leave to have put and I will deal with that.
—Madam Chair, I rise on a point of order. I would like you to tell the committee what standing order prevents a senator from explaining in a simple term like that what amendment we are dealing with, not to speak of listeners right around this country trying to make sense out of this debate.
—Standing order 142 indicates that the time for debate has expired. Therefore, all you are entitled to do is stand to seek leave for the particular number of the amendment you wish to have considered. That is the way I am ruling.
—Madam Chair, on a point of clarification—
—Madam Chair, I rise on a point of order.
—Senator Margetts has the call.
—No, she is taking a point of clarification, whatever that is.
—I thought that was probably the equivalent of it. Senator Margetts is seeking the call and I have given her the call.
—Good ruling!
—Senator Macdonald, I do not need any comments. Thank you.
—Madam Chair, we have our amendments down as amendments. Earlier you demanded that we explain which clauses they referred to. Now you are saying we should not explain what they refer to. You did two things: firstly, you demanded we explain what our amendments were and, secondly, you said we cannot. I am sure which one—
—I am sorry if you misunderstood. I am demanding just the number of the amendment that you wish to put.

—Madam Chair, on a point of order. Earlier in this debate you said to the 
 Senate that if a senator believed that there would be a different vote taken in respect of an amendment as opposed to the rest of the block of the amendments, then leave would be given. I suggest to you, Madam Chair, that, given the fact that we have got some 300 amendments to go through in one block, it does assist the Senate if we were to, in one sentence, explain what subject area—
—No, all I require you—
—Sorry, I have not finished my point of order. It would assist the Senate if we could explain, even by way of general description, where this amendment attached to the bill. Senator Hill has spat the dummy this morning. He should be given a chance to change his mind. I do not think we can do this properly without some explanation.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1999-06-23,"—Under standing order 142(4) I draw your attention to the proposition that Senator Bolkus, Senator Faulkner and I have sought to get before this chamber, that is, the consideration of what are important issues, for which the government is attempting to deny leave. Not content to deprive the chamber of the opportunity to evaluate this proposition, the government is now seeking to protect the Democrats from what is quite clearly a miserable effort to prevent consideration of these important questions.
Madam Chair, what I would seek to do is to encourage the opportunities for opposition senators to have these matters put before the Senate. I ask you: under what standing order are they prevented from seeking leave to do that?
—Standing order 142(4) requires that, at the expiration of the time allotted for the consideration of the bill, the chair shall put any amendments circulated by the government at least two hours before that time. That is all that I am required to put. The remainder may be put if you seek leave and 
 are given leave, but if you do not seek leave for a particular amendment, then we are going to have problems. Is leave being sought for opposition amendment No. 11?",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION BILL 1998 [1999]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1

—Madam Chairman, I also raise a point of order in relation to the operation of the guillotine. This process of deliberately drawing out the time available, as the opposition is doing at the moment: does that actually mean that the time that is allocated for debating forestry issues, which is up next, is being reduced by this process?
—The time for debating clauses 38 to 42 will complete at 1.30 p.m. or after 1½ hours, whichever occurs first.

—Excuse me, Senator Faulkner. That has come very close to reflecting upon the chair. There have been many spurious points of order raised today. There is no point of order.
—Madam Chairman, I raise a point of order. Senator Bartlett asked the chair if the forestry matters, which are coming up next, were having time taken away from them by the Democrats' application of the guillotine. I did not hear your ruling on that.

—It is not my responsibility whether leave is granted or not, Senator.
—I draw your attention to the comment made by Senator Hill, which was, `You wait till the next lot.'
—Which standing order are you taking a point of order on?
—I am taking as a threat to the processes of the Senate that Senator Hill has basically said to us that we will have as much luck moving them next time, and that does pre-empt your ruling, Madam Chair.
—There is no point of order. I am moving to clauses 38 to 42.
—Madam Chair, I raise a point of order. When the Leader of the Opposition asked if the government was using the guillotine mechanism to deny the opposition's amendments be put, Senator Allison interjected and said, `Yes, that is the case,' in the compliant way the Democrats have with this government process.
—There is no point of order, Senator Brown.
—The point is that I wanted that on the record.
—We are now trying to move clauses 38 to 42 to which the government has an amendment.
—Madam Chair, I raise a point of order. Standing order 142 quite specifically outlines the operations of the guillotine. Draconian as they are, they also refer to the question of amendments which have been circulated two hours at least before the expiration of the allotted time.
—Senator Carr, that is only for government amendments.
—Madam Chair, it indicates by reference to government amendments `any other question requisite to dispose of the business before the Senate or the committee'. I put it to you, Madam Chair, that that allows Senator Bolkus to move the amendments on behalf of the opposition en bloc. If it is not the case, Madam Chair, can we have the reasons spelt out?
—It is only the government amendments, and the wording that you read out relates to machinery matters such as `That the bill, as amended, be agreed to'.
—Madam Chair, I raise a point of order. Then you would not even be able to put government amendments, because—
—I am sorry, if you read the standing order—
—I have not completed my point of order, Madam Chair. I have not even started my point of order. The guillotine that was moved and passed this morning—
—Senator Bolkus, what is your point of order, please?
—I am explaining it, Madam Chair. I do not think you can make a ruling on it unless you hear me explaining it.
—I would like you to quickly get to the point of order and not debate it.
—I may actually need 60 seconds to do this. It follows on from Senator Carr's point of order, and that is that, if one was to take guidance from the actual guillotine resolution passed this morning, then there is no reference even to government amendments. If we include government amendments in terms of the guillotine then you have to 
 also include any other amendment that was circulated and is before the chamber.
—That is what it says.
—That is exactly what it said. But if you are going to take this literal interpretation of the guillotine and say that it deals only with the bill, then we have no capacity within the format of the guillotine to actually deal with Senator Hill's amendments. We either deal with one lot or we deal with the whole lot.
—The guillotine relates to the allotment of time and standing order 142(4) requires that at the end of that time allotted the chair will put any amendments circulated by the government at least two hours before that time. If you disagree with my rulings, then you take the appropriate action.
—On a point of order, Madam Chair: the government actually moved its amendments after the allotted period of time—after 11.30 a.m. If they can move their amendments after the allotted period of time, then so can the opposition.
—I am sorry; it does not say that. The advice that I have received is that the chair shall put any amendments circulated—and that means that they end up on your desks—by the government at least two hours before that time. These amendments have been circulated by the government more than two hours ago. Therefore, that is all that I am required to put. The remaining ones can be put by leave, and leave to date has not been granted. I therefore wish to move—
—Madam Chair, on a point of order in regard to your ruling—is it possible then for the opposition to move amendments in the later periods of debate, or do we do that by leave as well?
—If leave is granted.
—So basically Senator Hill can act as dictator in terms of what is before the Senate this afternoon?
—Senator, if somebody has not granted leave—
—It is outrageous, Robert, you don't want to review your position, do you?
—If leave is not granted, then people cannot move anything. We shall now move to clauses 38 to 42. I understand that, on the running sheet, the government has some amendments to clauses 38 to 42.

"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1999-06-23,"—I am quite happy to talk for some time on the subject of forestry, because it is an important issue and it should be clarified. The government has taken the view that the process of regional forest agreements is outside of this legislation because they have been in themselves a most comprehensive process—I think one can fairly say the most comprehensive assessment of Australian forests in our national history. The government chose to take that course of action—which, I concede, was to adopt a national strategy that had been negotiated between the previous Labor government and the states—because it, for the first time, set out a framework within which there could be some certainty for forest industries but with a background of protecting a comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system and also to ensure that the forestry that was to take place in relation to native forests, on the balance—that is, that which is outside the comprehensive, adequate and representative reserve system—had to be conducted in both an ecologically and economically sustainable way.
The precedent of that structure is regarded as world best practice. I can recall two years ago, for example, attending a CSD meeting in 
 New York when WWF International held up the Australian precedent as the example that they would like to be achieved globally, because the reserve system was of course of a higher composition than the recommendations that they were putting down internationally. Also just as important is to ensure that the forest that is to be harvested is harvested, as I said, not only in an economic way—which is what has been considered in the past—but also in an ecologically sustainable way.
We went about the task of conducting those assessments. I would be the first to acknowledge just how difficult that process has been. Nevertheless, those RFAs that have been agreed—the RFA for Tasmania, the RFA in Western Australia and two RFAs in Victoria, in Central Highlands and East Gippsland—I think have achieved the goals that Labor actually had set down for us in the National Forest Strategy. I am pleased to say that we are very close to completion of the agreement for the Eden region in New South Wales. We are close to another agreement in Victoria. We are finally making some progress on the balance of regions in New South Wales and with regard to the Queensland proposal. Whilst it has been politically difficult and it has been difficult in practice to implement, we are achieving those goals.
After such a comprehensive assessment as that it makes no sense, to the government in any event, to then come back through this legislation and seek to achieve another path for assessment. That is why we have chosen to take the course of action of leaving the RFAs outside of the bill as such. I can see that there are others in the chamber who would argue that that is not the best course of action to have taken. We have a difference of view in this particular matter, but that is the basis on which we have taken this action.
I make the point because I want to demonstrate, in case it is misrepresented by some, such as Senator Brown, as an attempt to avoid the responsibility for assessment and for making proper decisions in relation to natural forests, that it is quite the contrary. It is in recognition that there has been a parallel process of a comprehensive nature to carry 
 out those assessments and to achieve the best possible outcomes both environmentally and economically. That is the reason we have moved in this direction.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION BILL 1998 [1999]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1

If any honourable senators turn to pages 40 and 41, they will see that division 4 is given over to forestry operations. I want you to remember, Chair, throughout my delivery in the next 15 minutes, that everything I refer to here has changed since last week. Last week the Democrats were the defenders of the environment and the forests. Now they have become not only part of the problem but also the pivotal vote in cementing into place the destruction of forests around this country for the next 20 years.
I read earlier from a letter from world noted scientist Dr Aila Keto of the Australian Rainforest Conservation Society, who is also representing another dozen conservation groups in Queensland. In this heartfelt letter that she sent to Senator Lees yesterday, the fourth paragraph reads:
The legislation will entrench Regional Forest Agreements, locking in ongoing threats that have put so many forests and their wildlife on the brink of extinction, and it will be nearly impossible or too late to do anything about it for the next 20 years.
In that 20 years, under this Democrat approved process, more than one million hectares of Australia's wild forests, ancient ecosystems and wildlife—the bird life, the possums, the bats, the insects, and the fish and the platypuses in the rivers draining from those places—will be threatened with extinction because of this dark Democrat deed being done today. This legislation would not be going through—this imprimatur of the Democrats on the regional forest agreements, as laid out in this legislation—except for their going to the Howard table last week to gain a little bit of power and, in the process, as entry to that table, dropping all of their past principles. Let me read from section 39 on page 40:
The purpose of this Subdivision— 

Chair, you will understand if I interpret this now by saying that it is the purpose of this now Democrat approved subdivision—
is to ensure that an approval—
that is, a ministerial approval before something dastardly is done to the environment—
under Part 9 is not required for forestry operations in a region for which—
a regional forest agreement is in place. What we have here, with the approval of the Democrats, is the minister washing his hands, for 20 years at a national level, of responsibility for the great forests of Western Australia; the wild forests and their wildlife in Victoria and New South Wales; the forests of south-east Queensland; and the forests of world heritage value in such places as the Sticks, Huon, Weld and Picton valleys in Tasmania, the Great Western Tiers, the Tarkine, the North-East and the Tasman Peninsula, just to name some of them.
Democrat approved chainsaws are now moving in on these forests, these ecosystems and this wildlife. When the Democrat approved chainsaws have gone in and felled the forests which the woodchippers want to take—and they are taking 90 per cent of the trees; Senator Murphy might have something to say about what an economic and resource abuse that is—and have sent those trees through the paper mills of Kyoto and Tokyo to the rubbish dumps of the Northern Hemisphere, now approved by the Democrats, the next thing is that the incendiaries will move in.
We have before this Senate at the moment a change in civil aviation regulations to reduce the qualifications required for those pilots who take helicopters or light planes over these ancient forests—once they have been felled and the woodchippers have taken out what they want—and drop thousands of incendiaries to create a firestorm. This is happening at the end of every season in Tasmania. Thousands of hectares of these ancient forests have been felled—rainforests included. Indeed, the Democrat purpose here has become, through those incendiaries, to kill the cotyledons—the little growth opportunities for new rainforest trees—the root systems and any living fur, feather or flower left in this 
 recently ancient ecosystem so that genetically manipulated eucalypts, fast growing for the woodchippers' purposes, will replace them. That is what the Democrats are giving their approval to.
The Democrats have now, through their imprimatur on this legislation, approved the bringing in of 1080 to these wild forests to be sprinkled through the fire holocaust area. Any marsupials—wallabies, potoroos or possums—which hop in from adjacent forests to forage on these genetically manipulated little eucalypt seedlings will be poisoned—murdered by this Democrat action. Senator Bartlett from Queensland, who has been something of an advocate for Animal Liberation but is now a 1080 poisoner, is going to get up here in a minute and tell us that the Democrats have an amendment which they expect the Labor Party and the Greens to join with them in putting through here that will overturn this particular part of the legislation. But it is utter deception, and it is knowing deception, by the Democrats and they will not get away with it.
Let me explain. They went to the table and said to the government, `We want different provisions for the forests. We don't want to be seen as responsible for the 20 years of destruction that Dr Aila Keto has referred to as coming down the line for the forests, with no federal powers to stop it.' This legislation removes all federal powers to stop it. But the government said no. These Democrat puppies, these poodles of Liberal politics, put their tails between their legs and accepted that. But they thought, `We must greenwash. Senator Hill greenwashes all the time and it seems successful. We'll try it. We'll bring in an amendment here which we will get the numbers for if the Independents agree,' knowing that it has no effect. That amendment is not going to go through the House of Representatives, and they know it.
What the Democrats are doing here is giving their stamp of approval to the destruction of the forests for the next 20 years. I cannot accept this pathetic little effort to try to cover up their tracks and deceive their membership, conservationists or anybody else out there—and 87 per cent of people, according to recent West Australian polls, do not 
 want this Democrat destruction of the forests. I cannot accept their little effort to try to deceive people into thinking that they really do care.
Every tree in those forests that dies, every owl's nesting place, every possum, every endangered species—like the great Tasmanian wedgetail, which is bigger than the mainland species, or the white goshawk, which is down to 200 breeding pairs, as I told the Senate two days ago—is now pushed closer to extinction because of Senator Allison, who laughs over there in her seat; because of Senator Bartlett; because of Senator Stott Despoja, who stayed absent from this debate but put her signature on the bottom of this death warrant for forests; because of Senator Lees; because of Senator Murray from Western Australia; and because of Senator Woodley from Queensland. These are the environmental sell-out people.
Senator Bartlett interjecting—
Senator Allison interjecting—
—They are yabbering now—the poodles have been activated. They are down off the Howard lap for a moment while they try to bark at somebody else before they jump into another environmentally destructive lap somewhere further down the line. The trouble with their yabbering is that this is so serious. This is so dreadful for those forests. This is so awesome. And the Democrats have put their stamp of approval on it and have turned their back on the environment which, in the past, they have said they stood for.
—And the Tasmanian Conservation Trust? What a bunch of possums.
—Senator Bartlett intervenes with, `What about a bunch of possums?' I thought he would know better than that. This is a serious matter. But these people do not treat it seriously anymore, because the livelihood of ecosystems and the livelihood of grand forests right round this country was expendable to them to get a place at the table of power.
Senator Bartlett interjecting—
—`Yep,' says Senator Bartlett. He agrees with that analysis because he knows it is true.
—Madam Temporary Chair, I raise a point of order. Senator Brown is obviously willing to misrepresent what is in the legislation, but he is not entitled to misrepresent my statements.
—Senator Bartlett, that is not a point of order. Would you please resume your seat.
—It is inappropriate for him to try to mislead the Senate and put things like that on the record.
—Senator Bartlett, you know that is disorderly. You will have the opportunity to respond at the end of the debate if you believe you have been misrepresented, but it is not a point of order.
—Thank you, Madam Temporary Chairman. You know that reaction underscores the guilt that Senator Bartlett, Senator Allison—still grinning at the back of the chamber—and the absent senators have about this matter. This is environmental perfidy. We all get involved in political cut and thrust but this is a core issue as far as we Greens are concerned. The Democrats have ostensibly been an environmental party and they have used that kudos right down the line. That is now dead. The Democrats are now part of the environmental problem of this country for decades to come. They now have their hands on the chainsaws. They are now in the cockpit of the bulldozers.
—Driven by the Tasmanian Conservation Trust.
—They are trying to blame the Tasmanian Conservation Trust. Let them answer for themselves. They cannot answer for themselves.
—They have already done it.
—This interjecting and, I might add, environmentally despicable senator from Queensland is not going to be able to answer for himself. The people listen 
 ing to this broadcast and the people of Australia can know this: the Democrats will guillotine this debate on forests as well, just the same as they will now chainsaw down forests everywhere that they exist in this country. The Democrats will try to say, `Well, we had one or two individuals in the conservation movement who were looking at specific clauses and lost their view of the wider environmental good,' but they are going to live to regret this day. The problem is that that is now what counts; the problem is that it is the forests of this country that count here.
We have in this legislation at page 41 the death warrant for those forests, and it has now been signed by Senator Lees, Senator Stott Despoja, Senator Murray, Senator Woodley, Senator Bartlett and Senator Vicki Bourne from New South Wales. They have personally signed the death warrant of millions of hectares of Australia's forests in the next 20 years with only this `out': if a federal government should move in those 20 years to do anything to protect those forests, the big woodchip corporations—to whom the Democrats now appeal for funds; they want to be part of the funding from the corporate sector—will be compensated out of the taxpayers' purse. That is what the Democrats have given their seal of approval to in this very anti-environmental measure.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION BILL 1998 [1999]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-06-23,"—A number of times during that last contribution—if you can call it that—there were frequent comments as to the laughter coming from the Democrats benches. I guess it is a bit hard not to laugh at such a joke, and it is a bit of a shame that someone that did have such credibility on environmental issues in the past has allowed himself to be reduced to that. As I said yesterday, it seems that it can happen occasionally in politics—people have been in it for so long that they forget what they are in it for. I guess that, as Senator Brown has been a politician for around 18 years or so, obviously he now sees his role as a politician as trying to out-compete people like Senator Faulkner and Senator Ray with vitriol, abuse and gross distortions. If that is the way that he wants to perform his role, that is fine. But it is a bit of a shame 
 that someone who does have the opportunity to—and is seen as someone who previously was able to—put forward arguments on behalf of the environment is willing to sacrifice credibility for the sake of what he obviously sees as nothing more than a political opportunity to bash the Democrats.
That, I suppose, demonstrates how much, sadly, he has just simply become a politician that is interested in nothing else but ignoring what he was originally there for—to try and protect the environment—and has simply turned into someone that is willing to seize a political opportunity to attack other political parties that he sees as his opponents. In doing so of course—as highlighted throughout his previous contribution—he is quite willing to misrepresent the facts, distort the facts and completely ignore the facts for the basis of what he sees as his own political campaign. He has obviously chosen to take on that role, and that is a shame, from my point of view, because I would rather see as many credible voices as possible in the parliament promoting and trying to save the environment. It is a bit of an unfortunate situation that he has chosen to ignore that role.
I would make a plea to the conservation groups who work so hard for so little recognition in such a dedicated manner throughout the country to think carefully about this issue. There are clearly differences of opinion amongst conservation groups at the moment. Some of them are still reacting to the significant concerns that the Democrats identified, in conjunction with them during the committee process, with the original bill and have not yet been able to recognise that what the Democrats have achieved here is a major advance for the environment. If they wish to simply take a role of attacking the legislation as a whole and trying to knock off those advances, whether they like to or not they will be associating themselves with the sort of nonsense that Senator Brown is willing to go on with—that, somehow or other, the Democrats are responsible for clear-felling Tasmanian forests.
Of course, for every mention of the word  `Democrats' in his previous contribution—how we have now got our hands on the 
 chainsaw and all of that sort of nonsense—you could go through that speech, cross out `Democrats' and put in `Tasmanian Conservation Trust', who have approved the amendments that the Democrats have managed to gain to this legislation as a significant advance for the environment. So he may as well be criticising the Tasmanian Conservation Trust—and all of those people in the environment movement who have praised this agreement—as equally having their hands on the chainsaws and as equally gleefully staffing the bulldozers.
If he wants to try and divide the environment movement that he as a person has done so much to build up in the past, it is a bit sad. He has now got to a stage where he is willing to use his position as a politician to try and divide and weaken the environment movement that previously he has contributed so much to. That is a shame, but the real problem is in relation to an issue for the environment groups, and I would urge them to consider that. Certainly, as Democrats we have no problem with them calling it as they see it. I know that some of those who have concerns with this amended legislation are doing so. They are going through it and are willing to call it as they see it—as they understand it—as they try to avoid some of the absurd statements that Senator Brown makes. But they do need to be careful that their credibility as environmental advocates is not tarnished if they allow themselves to be associated with such nonsense. It is a shame that for political purposes that sort of risk and that sort of threat is being put to the environment movement.
The issue that we are debating at the moment concerns forests. It is one of the areas where the Democrats, as much as anybody else, have highlighted that there is a failing in this bill. It is an issue on which the Democrats, as much as anybody else, have pledged to continue to fight to protect our forests. But the obvious fact, which has been confirmed by Senator Brown's speech, is that the destruction to the forests is happening now—it is happening now under existing laws—and this parliament is powerless to do anything about it. What we are doing in this legislation 
 in many areas is providing opportunities, for the first time, for the parliament to do something about it. Senator Brown wants to prevent that opportunity and that extra avenue of activity from being able to occur. The Democrats will not ignore the advances that have been achieved in so many areas in protecting the environment through this overall set of amendments simply because we will not be able to ensure that the forests are protected. But we will continue to try and do that. As indicated, we will be moving amendments to put forests back into the bill and to include forests as a trigger.
One of the useful aspects of this debate has been that it has served to rekindle the interests of the Australian Labor Party in the environment. Many Labor Party members who were in the chamber earlier today—not so many are in here now—were suddenly playing the role of being major supporters of the environment. Given that there has been such a lack of any policy position from the Labor Party on the environment since the last election, hopefully this will serve as an opportunity for them to develop a policy on the environment and to put forward indications about what they would do if they were in government. This debate gives them a chance to indicate their policy and to give public statements on how they would protect the environment if they were in government. They have spoken previously about greenhouse. This debate gives them a chance to get their state Labor colleagues in Queensland to come out and say, `We will support greenhouse being put in place as an environment trigger.' The Democrats would welcome them on board because it would give us an opportunity to put that into the legislation, adding to the other gains that have already been made in this area.
As I have said previously, the Democrats do not say that the bill is perfect. As amended, we see it as a significant advance. It is equally important that we highlight the gaps that still exist. The issue of forests is one of those gaps that still exist and where improvements desperately need to be made. Attempts are being made to put around a big fabrication that the inability to address that issue some 
 how leads us to a situation where the forests have even less protection than they have now. That is false. There are any number of indications and explanations that you could give to outline why so many aspects of this legislation are an improvement, but this was probably summarised quite well by Stephen Lunn in today's Australian with the simple headline, `New laws an improvement, but major concerns remain'. That would just about be an assessment of the Democrats' view: this legislation is a significant improvement, but we still have major concerns that we will continue to work on.
The initial comment by Stephen Lunn, leading into his article, was, `The system was broke and needed fixing.' There is still some fixing work to be done, but at least we have a vehicle that will provide us with a better opportunity to make further advances in those areas where there are still significant concerns. This aspect of the legislation that we are debating at the moment deals with the issue of forests. It is an area where the Democrats will be moving amendments to take out the exemption clauses for forests in the bill. I have not seen any amendments put forward by the Labor Party in that regard but, given their new-found concern for the environment, I am sure they will be supporting us in our amendments.
It is equally important, when looking at the whole issue of how we address the legislation and the issue of forests in future, to look at how we can best ensure that mechanisms are in place and that we have a legislative vehicle to make further improvements. This forests section that we are dealing with is a significant problem and it needs to be removed from the bill, because our forests are being destroyed. That is something that is recognised by all conservation groups, including all of those that have supported the amendments and the improvements that the Democrats have managed to achieve.
We have had a lot of involvement through the committee process with conservation groups in the process of developing our amendments. Again, we have heard a lot today about the lack of ability to examine issues because of the need to ensure that these 
 achievements are passed by the parliament before it rises. However, this bill has been subject to a significant number of committee hearings over a long period and the concerns addressed in the amendments that the Democrats have gained support for are based on all of the input from conservation and indigenous groups during the inquiry.
Despite all the noise from Senator Brown, when we look at what he does in his role as a parliamentarian to try to advance the environment, and when we ask how many times he turned up to any of the committee hearings on the environment legislation to hear what the concerns of environment groups were, to ask questions and to try to put the government on the spot about what it was doing, the answer is zero. Senator Brown is quite able to come in here, be the politician and see how he can compete with Senator Faulkner and Senator Ray in the abuse stakes but, when it comes to doing anything other than abusing the Democrats and significant proportions of the environment movement throughout Australia, there is nothing else there; there is nothing else to fall back on.
Let us actually look at what has been achieved by Senator Brown in his role in the Senate on environment issues and at how many amendments he has actually had passed in respect of environment legislation in his time here. Having examined his record on improving things for the environment, I can say that he has had one amendment passed in respect of environment legislation, back in 1997. All seven disallowance motions he has moved have been negatived, the urgency motion has been negatived, and the two references to committees have been negatived. His sole contribution, in terms of a concrete outcome, has been one amendment. Obviously, he makes frequent contributions in terms of hurling abuse at the Democrats, trying to attack the Democrats for political purposes and trying to now split the environment movement to get them onside as an attack weapon against the Democrats for his own political purpose.
I guess we can look at how successful he has been in that regard as well. The other day he was calling on myself and Senator Stott 
 Despoja—as everybody knows, we have indicated our unwillingness to support the tax legislation—and saying, `You disagree with this legislation; you should quit the party if you are serious.' I suppose that shows the obvious consequence of that: if every time you disagreed with other people and your colleagues you split the party, you would end up with a pretty small party pretty quickly. Perhaps that is why Senator Brown is in a party of one, and perhaps why he has achieved only one amendment in his time here.
We are quite willing to work through our differences, and I hope the conservation movement are willing and able to work through their differences constructively. We certainly look forward to working with them in an ongoing fashion constructively in lots of the opportunities that have been gained through passing this legislation as amended. We are quite happy to hear their concerns and to take their criticisms about the areas that still need work, and we will do that constructively. If we have concerns or disagreements about their assessments, we will discuss that with them. That is the measure of the Democrats' work and the approach we are going to take, and we are going to keep doing that because we are here to get gains for the environment.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION BILL 1998 [1999]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-06-23,"—I wish to make a few comments in respect of both what Senator Bartlett has said and this part of the proceedings. It is quite understandable that Senator Bartlett would take the position he has taken. It is basically a very pathetic response to the arguments put forward by the opposition and the Greens this morning. But Senator Bartlett is basically, I think, working on the basis of ignorance. He comes in here and tries to pull on this stunt and in doing so tries to argue that the Democrats still have a compelling conviction and commitment to environmental issues. As part of that, he says that they have achieved improvements.
Senator Bartlett, you can quote any journalist you want, but you have had direct advice this morning from Associate Professor Robert Fowler, Director of the Australian Centre for 
 Environmental Law, and he has put it to you that your deal does not deliver; your deal does not enhance protection. In fact, he put this to you:
I reluctantly conclude that the amended bill is still inferior to the existing scheme of adhockery triggers for Commonwealth assessment and approval in relation to environmental matters.
He has asked you to reconsider this particular aspect of the bill. This is a person who has been a guru to the green movement and to the Democrats. This is a person whom Senator Allison praised lavishly in hearings, and he has put direct to you that you have failed and that the pretence you are putting to the Senate and to the Australian public is a fraud. You do not understand constitutional law, Senator Bartlett. If you did understand constitutional law, you would have acknowledged that over 20 years from 1970—30 years—because of the environment movement, because of Labor in government, because of activities of people like Senator Brown and Senator Margetts, we have actually enhanced the scope for Commonwealth interest, activity and legislative capacity.
Those cases that were fought through Tasmania and through Queensland have given the Commonwealth an enhanced role and capacity to act in respect of the environment. It is that law that you are now unwinding. It is that law that you are winding back. You have failed, Senator Bartlett, and you cannot run away from that. Unfortunately for the environment, for the whole morning the record will show that, while the debate has raged on in this place, the Democrats have sat there like dummies in a sideshow, like those clowns that you see with heads moving, nothing coming out of them—absolutely nothing of any relevance. That has been your role now and that, I must say, has been your role in terms of negotiating outcomes.
You come here now and say, `Well, we would have considered a greenhouse trigger.' You had the chance to vote for one. You sat there compliantly while Senator Hill refused us leave to move it. There was a greenhouse trigger moved this morning. I sought leave to move it separately to the rest. Where was your voice, Senator Bartlett? Where was 
 Senator Allison? Where was Senator Lees? Nowhere to be heard. Now, having sold out on the constitutional basis for Commonwealth action, having sold out on greenhouse triggers, what do you do? You come in here and move a stunt.
Why wasn't this issue—if you are so committed to it—a core issue in your discussions with Senator Hill? Why do you raise it now as an afterthought? You know full well that the only way you could have organised delivery on this, that you could have delivered anything on this, was to have put it on the table with the government. The numbers in this place are not sufficient to deliver.
—They wimped.
—Of course they wimped. They were not brave enough. I pay tribute to Senator Hill. He has conned them. He has conned them superbly. They might have lost, but the environment is the loser as well. Senator Hill can walk away with his legislation. He has set up a couple of committees and a couple of processes—he is happy. That is all he has had to give, a bit of embroidery. But you have been conned and you have sold out on everything that you have believed in.
—Order! Senator Bolkus, would you please address your remarks through the chair.
Senator Hill interjecting—
—I am not suggesting that at all. I am suggesting they were conned. So you come in here and raise this as an afterthought. As I say, if it is a fundamental issue, you should have organised an outcome with the government. Why not recognise that the numbers are not in this place sufficient to force this on the government? Now you try and cover up your sell-out. That is all this is about: `let us try a bit of fluff in the air and let us see if we can divert people's attention and let us see if, through that, we can put the heat on Senator Brown and on the Labor Party and so on.'
But just think of what you are doing. Firstly, you are imposing a guillotine on this debate. Secondly, you know that the only way 
 it could have got up was through the government. But by imposing the guillotine on this bill, do you know what you are doing? You are ensuring that there is time for the RFA legislation to be debated in this place and to go through. That is the direct result of your complicity in the most undemocratic manoeuvre taken in this place for the 18 years that I have been here. You will ensure, through your complicity in the guillotine, that we will get RFA legislation. It does not matter what you do; it does not matter what we or the Democrats do.
We have got amendments, and the amendments that we will move to the RFA legislation represent an advance on what you have agreed to in this legislation. You have signed up to this bill—all seven of you. You have signed up to a regime that we are still trying to improve and which we will move amendments to improve, in terms of linking it to national forest policy, in terms of tighter definitions and in terms of accountability in this place. Where were those amendments in your discussions with the government? They were nowhere to be seen.
So do not come in here now, at the end of this debate, having sold out, having signed up, having not got anything out of the process with Senator Hill on the forests, and say to the world, `We're greener than the Greens and we're better than the Labor Party.' You were probably a kid when the Labor Party was pursuing constitutional cases in the High Court to expand Commonwealth power. When Senator Hill, amongst others, was out there belting the cause for states rights, promoting and protecting Joh Bjelke-Petersen whenever he wanted to use a bulldozer to go through anything, we had those debates in here. We had those attacks on the then Attorney-General, Senator Evans. We actually fought the hard fight. We do know about environmental issues, Senator Bartlett, but we also know about the complexity of them. We are not conned like kids in a creche in respect of this, as you have been.
You should lift your standard. In lifting your standard, could I give you a bit of advice: it does you no service to go out there and say of the peak environmental movement, 
 `We can't trust them,' as your leader said this morning. They cannot trust you, and with good cause. You reinforce that distrust by coming in here after the event, facilitating debate, facilitating the bringing on of the RFA legislation, having achieved absolutely nothing. We will try to enhance the government's position, but we will do that in the RFA legislation. We will not fall for your stunt here.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION BILL 1998 [1999]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-06-23,"—The issue that we are dealing with here is in relation to forests. The reason that we are dealing with it is because it is one of the triggers that do not exist under this new legislation. The quite clear information that was provided in the report that was signed by the Greens and the Democrats in relation to this bill indicated that the original bill was abysmal in terms of how it was to be a vehicle to wind back the Commonwealth's responsibilities. That was clear, and there was a solid bank of opinion.
The government and Democrat amendments barely change this abysmal situation. The only changes are those at the margin in terms of ensuring adequate and effective Commonwealth roles. They are marginal. It is in fact mere tinkering. I heard Senator Hill yesterday, in a comment by way of an aside, explaining about the number of amendments. He said, `Most of these are merely technical.' Basically, the minister, if I overheard him correctly, does not consider these amendments to be particularly significant. That is why he said it is okay to have them in large chunks. So the minister did not think they were particularly significant.
The bill remains a major step backwards. There is no way of getting around this. There may be some groups who think that, for a particular issue, they might get better coverage than they have got now. But the overall picture involves a massive step backwards. To borrow the words of Senator Stott Despoja regarding the Reith-Kernot agreement in relation to industrial relations, it is draconian legislation only marginally improved. That goes for this legislation as well. Quantity should not be confused with quality. There may be 400 or so amendments that the Demo 
 crats have achieved, but in terms of overall substance, they are inadequate. Maybe 20 per cent of those are what is needed for good environmental legislation and have been achieved, not the 80 per cent that has been claimed. The numbers do not actually relate to the quality of the concerns that people have.
Make no mistake: the government still have a number of triggers—that is, a mere six—and it will not be hard to give them exemptions for every one of these. When we are talking about endangered species, if the issue focuses on the clearance of their habitat, the government will weasel out of it if they can.
There is an urgent need, as many people have said, for a greenhouse trigger. Where are the commitments by the government to do other than consult with the states? I have not seen a single promise from the government about doing anything other than consult. With respect to land clearance and water, what do the Democrats claim? Merely that land clearing may be regulated if it affects a matter of national environmental significance. I cannot find a single amendment that relates to land clearing, water or the stating of the obvious situation—that something may be regulated if it affects the NES matter about which they are claiming to have achieved a partial result, even if the probability of significant land clearance being stopped is minuscule.
As for the forests, which is what this bunch of amendments is about, the Democrats have not achieved anything. They have not even consulted with the Greens on the matter, despite knowing how concerned we are about the exemption of forests from the bill. This lack of consultation is now par for the course. Just consulting with a few select groups, when it should have been possible to consult all in the process, illustrates the tactics that the Democrats have learnt from the government—that is, pick off the groups that you think may be easily scared. If we are talking about threats, the major threat, as has been mentioned, comes out in this Democrat release, which says:
It was clear to the Democrats that the ALP-Greens strategy was an extremely risky one. If Senators Harradine and Colston supported the bill, the 
 Democrats would have had to start to argue for the very substantial amendments required on the floor of the chamber.
Shock, horror! The release continues:
Clearly, this would have exposed the environment to unacceptable risk. There was much to lose and the potential for real gains was ignored.
The government said their priority in this section of the parliamentary program was the tax package. The government said that again and again and again. For public credibility, the agreement should have been that, if the government's priority was the tax package, the time priority should also have been for the tax package.
We are not in a situation where this Senate has been debating the committee stage of this bill for days on end, even though it is important enough to have done so and the number of amendments and the complexity would warrant that happening. We are not in that situation. The gag was imposed before we even started on the committee stage of an environment bill. So, here we are dealing with, in my understanding, an unprecedented situation where a minor party in this case is using a gag in a situation where they themselves have argued in the opposite direction in the past. Where is the logic? I have thought and thought to see where that logic is. The only answer I can get is about as unkind as I can be at this stage, which is that in the recent past there has been a situation where the Democrats wanted to regain a seat in Western Australia. Of course, they have won that—to my loss, to the green network's loss and, I believe, now obviously to the wider network's loss because we know what they will do with that power. They have already signed up to it. With that loss of competition, temporarily, from Western Australia—hey, there is no need to be put down as the true green party and no need to appeal to that electorate because they think they have got it sewn up.
I do not usually make statements like this but this is all I can think of that must have been in the minds of the Australian Democrats in reaching this decision. We saw yesterday quite clearly that they did not have to be pushed at this time. We saw they had a 
 golden opportunity to say, `Let's listen to what Aboriginal groups, peak conservation groups and the wider community are saying and let's leave this committee stage until the August sittings. Let's make sure that the new bill'—which it is—`is then given a chance for consultation.' No, not good enough. The opportunity was here. It was not taken. So, it was a nonsense to suggest—and I believe it was an unfair threat to the environment movement in Australia to do so—that they had to make a decision then because otherwise something worse would happen. Unfortunately, the worse thing that is going to happen is that after the end of June we are not even going to have a say. I am certainly not going to have a say on these issues. There won't even be this concern by the Democrats that there might be someone else around from Western Australia at least to show where they are wrong in their statements and where they are not representing their electorates, which they promised to do. All of the statements, all of those leaflets, about protection of the forest are now clearly shown to be false because they have let down that community, let down that electorate, unnecessarily.
The Democrats assert that the disallowable nature of the management plans will ensure stringency. I can only foreshadow that exactly the same thing could happen with any disastrous plans of management as is happening with this bill. We do not know now that the Democrats will not be thrown some crumbs in order to pass it because, when nobody that I know of can understand why this decision is being made now and rushed on and pushed on without debate and gagged, I cannot guarantee—and I do not think anyone can guarantee—what would happen if those disallowances come to the Senate. Since the plans of management can only be disallowed and not amended, those crumbs will be in some totally different area and the Australian people will be left with bilateral agreements that give the Commonwealth power.
Note that the Democrats and government did not support the Greens' amendment to retain even a Commonwealth reserve power so that the Commonwealth can intervene in, say, a development project if state processes 
 are totally inadequate. Madam Chair, as I say, the reasons behind this deal originally escaped me, but I do recall that Senator Lees went through a `pick me, pick me' stage in relation to the consultation and sell-out in relation to tax. The only thing that I can suggest is that after the `pick me, pick me' it became very hard to move away from the table. There are also people, I admit, from the environment movement who were attracted to that feeling of power at the table. It is very difficult for people in that situation not to see how badly they are being done over—and unfortunately they were.
The environment movement, yes, has been divided in this process. It has not been the Greens dividing that movement. The movement was very clear and has put in hours of work. And I know because I have seen people in my office from environmental defenders and we have put in many hours. I have had a volunteer worker working with me day in, day out for months on this issue. You cannot talk to me about the work that has been done, because I know that that work has now been betrayed for the sake of the Democrats and some people from the environment movement who thought it would be good to be at the table, despite the fact there was no need for them to be forced to be there.
If Senator Harradine or Senator Colston had considered that they wanted to pass this bill, the indications were not here yesterday. But even if they had, if I were in that situation I would not want my name on that bill. The government are laughing all the way to the bank. They cannot believe that the Democrats have put themselves in this situation of taking the heat for what in fact is the government's abysmal bill; and that is what has happened. The government cannot believe their luck. If this deal had been made, carried on and debated after the 30 June, there would be no clearer indication that it was a Democrat deal. At the moment the Democrats can pretend that they had to do it because something worse might happen if they had not. After 30 June there would have been no excuse and that is the reason why we are being forced to vote on this now; that is the reason why our 
 forests will get no further protection and that is the reason why we are being restricted to six matters in a very narrow way that is worse than what exists now.
The minister and other ministers in this government have clearly said they do not want people asking about wider issues if there was an export power involved. They do not want people, for legitimate reasons, questioning very bad decisions by state governments. The federal government do not want to deal with it and this is what has been achieved in this bill. It is no wonder it is being rushed through now. It is no wonder that the amendments by non-government parties have not even been allowed to be put. I have been here six years and I have never seen that situation in the Senate before. Okay, lots of things happen in the House of Representatives, but this is supposed to be the states' house. This is supposed to be the people's house. I have never seen a situation like this where cross benchers, in a party that is supposed to be about the environment, have denied the right of minor parties to put their amendments.
Was this part of the original agreement and, if it was not, I believe the Democrats would have had the right to say to the government, `All bets are off unless you give other people the chance to put their amendments. This is not part of our agreement and all bets are off.' There is still the opportunity for the Democrats to say that all bets are off unless we have a proper debate; that all bets are off unless we have the chance to scrutinise these bills in a democratic way so that people can see what we have agreed to.
But no, I have not seen this. Even if we voted on them all at the end of the time, all in a lump, how meaningless that process has become. I believe that the people from my own state of Western Australia will be feeling very betrayed as a result of what has gone on in the last couple of days. Some people thought there would be some deals associated, but I do not think very many people realised how bad this would be in relation to the forests, which is what these amendments are. In my state I know that people have very, very long memories.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION BILL 1998 [1999]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,2,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1999-06-23,"—I just wanted to respond in relation to the forests and point out that the Greens have had so many opportunities in this place to make a difference on matters of forest protection and have taken up none of them. What I find so extraordinary is that, when the government brings forward environmental reform legislation which is designed to achieve better national environmental outcomes, it gets damned by the Greens without any willingness to contribute to developing a process to achieve a better outcome.
We offered the Greens, as we offered the Australian Labor Party, the opportunity to work with us towards better environmental outcomes. I know that as a matter of principle Senator Bob Brown will not work with the government, no matter what the consequence. No matter what benefit he could get for the environment, he still will not work with the government to achieve that benefit. I do not understand it. I presume it is just something to do with his past when he made his name as a confrontationist and became a hero to the green movement as it then was. He is concerned that by now moving on and being prepared to negotiate better environmental outcomes would in some way put him at risk with his very small remaining constituency. I can only assume that that is what this is all about. I regret that. When we look back at the opportunities that Senator Brown has had over the past few years to achieve better environmental outcomes in this place we see that he has wasted the whole lot. I just cannot understand why the remainder of his green constituency stands by him.
When I look at the advantages—and I see nothing wrong with this at all—that Senator Harradine, for example, has been able to achieve for Tasmania, I would have thought that Senator Brown, also being a Tasmanian senator and one who claims to be here representing an environment constituency, would have recognised that he had the opportunity to win some real gains for the environment. But has he ever come to our door and said, `I want a better green outcome and this is my proposition'? Of course not. When we come 
 to him and say, `Do you want to participate in a process to achieve a better green outcome?', he washes his hands of us. In other words, to preserve his political stature with what remains of his constituency, he sacrifices the opportunity to achieve a better environmental outcome.
I know that is Senator Brown and there is nothing much we can do about it, but I would have thought Senator Margetts, who I know has a genuine interest in the forests of Western Australia, would have approached this matter differently. I would have thought she would say, `If the government is going to embark upon a major environmental reform, this is a wonderful opportunity for the green parties to become involved in the process to seek to achieve some of our aspirations.' Is that not logical? Is there some major flaw in my logic? But of course they will not do so. In other words, she has been wedded to the Bob Brown style of politics which is not to work with governments to achieve better outcomes but to go out there and run the old battles of the past and to try to achieve what? Notoriety, personal notoriety. That is the aspiration of Senator Bob Brown and it is very much a regret to me that Senator Margetts is prepared to lock herself into the same political mentality and sacrifice the opportunities that she has had to achieve better green outcomes.
How could negotiating with the government to achieve a better green outcome be described as selling out her principle? How does Senator Margetts know if she has never tried, if she refuses to participate in a process? How can she assume that the outcome would not have achieved any of her goals? That is the fundamental flaw in the position of both the green members of this Senate, and I think it is very much a matter of regret, not for me of course but for the environment, because there are people out there that have elected Senator Brown and Senator Margetts because they actually thought that they would make a difference. But as has been demonstrated today, they have not made a difference at all. They have wasted their time in this place. They certainly have looked for political notoriety, particularly in the case of Senator 
 Brown, but they have achieved no outcomes for their constituency.
They can stand up and say `We've fought the good fight, we belt the government every day', but that does not get a better environmental outcome. Why don't they join with the 4,000-odd Landcare groups and conservation groups and get out there into the forest and do something worth while for the forests.

—I move government amendment No. 175:
(175) 	 Clause 176, page 160 (line 5), at the end of subclause (1), add ""In preparing the plan, the Minister must carry out public consultation on a draft of the plan in accordance with the regulations."".
I wanted to make a few comments on this chapter of the bill because it is the first conservation of biodiversity law at a federal level in Australia's history. We have had a situation where Australia is a party to the International Convention on the Protection of Biodiversity, and some years ago there was in fact a strategy for the conservation of biodiversity negotiated between the Commonwealth and the states. Regrettably, the last Labor government did not take the one extra step and set up a legal framework at the Commonwealth level to implement its commitments under that strategy. We are very pleased that the Howard government has been prepared to take the initiative and provide for Australia its first law for the conservation of biodiversity.
The amendments to the chapter improve the provisions for management of species and ecological communities and of protected areas, and also they continue the statutory office of the Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, which I will come back to in a minute. The amendments provide for increased recognition of the important role of indigenous peoples in conserving biodiversity and managing jointly managed Commonwealth reserves. In particular, representatives of the traditional owners will have the power to withhold consent, within reason, to the appointment to the joint management board of a person nominated by the Northern Territory. The amendments provide increased transparency for listing species and ecological communities and for decisions about permits relating to them. Strict liability is applied to some offences or elements of offences. It will now be possible to list key threatening processes purely on the basis of scientific criteria. Whilst I mention key threatening processes, it also overcomes the technical deficiency in the previous legislation which meant that a process could not be listed if it crossed the boundary between state and Commonwealth jurisdictions. So some of those matters 
 that were not listed on a technical basis could be reconsidered in the future.
I would also take the opportunity to thank the volunteers, really, within the scientific community who have given us advice, and so much sound advice, in endangered species areas. In fact, the men and women on the advisory bodies that we have in this area—the biodiversity advisory body, our threatened species scientific body and threatened species advisory body—do play a very important part in the conservation of our biodiversity through the assistance that they give to government and in the community leadership that they provide. It is not sufficiently or often enough recognised, and I am pleased to do so today. Also, the capacity to proclaim conservation zones to afford interim protection to the areas while their values are assessed will be retained.
I said I wanted to come back to the matter of the Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. Although there has been much comment about the number of amendments before the chamber, in fact many of those amendments simply relate to reinstatement of that position. It is no secret that we in the government believe that there was opportunity within this legislation to streamline administrative structures in relation to environmental protection and as such to remove what some would say is simply another tier in the structure—that is, the position of the director as a statutory officer—and then have a more clearly defined line of command and responsibility between government and the decision making process in relation to national parks.
That policy preference was consistent with the stand this government has taken across portfolios—that where possible separate statutory authorities should be removed. Regrettably, in the past so many have been created really as a cushion for government, and in particular for ministers, to avoid having to take direct responsibility. That is not the view of this government. This government believes that ministers should take responsibility for decisions that are made and not pass that responsibility off to third parties in the form of statutory authorities. Having 
 said that, and still believing that it would be sound administrative restructuring, it was strongly objected to by the joint boards, to which we are a party, for, in particular, Kakadu National Park and Uluru.
After sitting down with the traditional owners on a number of occasions—it is interesting, because I have heard in this debate those on the other side asserting that there was no consultation on this issue with indigenous people—I have not been able to convince them that the removal of the position would not be seen as some symbolic downgrading of the relationship. Of course, it was the director who signed the leases. Out of respect to the traditional owners, I therefore took the decision to not proceed with that proposed reform. Of course, to reinstate the position of director has meant that many clauses have had to be re-amended, and that makes up a large block of the amendments that are before us today. That is why we revised our opinion on this matter. It does in fact demonstrate that consultation does work and that this government is prepared to listen. Where a decision is going to cause distress, even though we might think it is sound administrative practice, we will vote to avoid distress.
In relation to the Northern Territory representative, we are not moving from our strong commitment that the administration of both parks would be enhanced by a Northern Territory representative. But I would like to stress, contrary to what was asserted in the Senate yesterday, that we are talking about one person, one representative, on boards that have a majority of traditional owners. Furthermore, what we are providing through these amendments is that the nominated representative must be approved by the traditional owners—in other words, it will be with the consent of the traditional owners. We have provided that that consent will not be unreasonably withheld, because unfortunately in my experience third parties, including the ALP, put considerable pressure upon traditional owners in these matters. I listened to the ALP's presentation yesterday in relation to the Northern Territory, and it was a totally unjustified and unreasonable condemnation of the 
 Northern Territory government. I have to say that, based on my dealings with the new Chief Minister in the Northern Territory, he is somebody who wants to build a good working relationship with indigenous Territorians, as they were called in the debate yesterday. I say that that is something that should be recognised and applauded.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,1999-06-23,"—Madam President, yesterday I gave an answer to a question and I promised Senator Woodley that if there was more I could add I would. Yesterday in question time Senator Woodley asked me a number of questions about the Albury-Wodonga Freeway. The answers are in the same order as the questions were asked yesterday. In relation to question (1), the costs of the project are being refined, including the impact of final project design. The final project designs are to be put on public display and there may be some further refinement of the costs as a result of the consultation process.
In relation to question (2), the answer is yes. The economic analysis carried out during the EIS process took account of the social and health costs and impacts. In relation to question (3), in conjunction with the refining of costs of the internal route, a review of the external route costings is being undertaken. The results of this review are being finalised now and the New South Wales government is to provide the Commonwealth with a report on this.
In relation to questions (4) and (5), Senator Woodley, I think I dealt with them yesterday. However, I can add that, while you were suggesting that the majority of your Albury residents are opposed to the internal route, with respect there is also very strong evidence to support the opposite claim. I note two articles in the Border Mail dated 18 and 19 June in which a couple of independent community groups and the state member for Benambra, Mr Tony Plowman MLA, whom I omitted yesterday in my list of the elected representatives who support the internal route, are indicated as strongly supporting the internal route.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Albury-Wodonga Freeway</title>,Questions Without Notice,5,1
"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-06-23,"—I want to speak about indigenous issues because during the course of the day we have not as yet had a chance to address what is another important area of debate and concern in the community in respect of this legislation. One group of people who have been misled and done over by the final compromise between the Democrats and the Greens are indigenous Australians. This is an environment bill and a lot of people would be misled into thinking that maybe there are not enormous indigenous issues in respect of this legislation. The truth of the matter is that there are. Whether it is in respect of diversity, hunting and gathering rights, native title rights or the management of some pretty important national parks in Australia, indigenous Australians have a role by law and by social policy. 
Probably the most fundamental role is that if we as a parliament were to take more than token recognition of the concept of self-determination, we should involve indigenous Australians in decision making, particularly as it affects them directly, as is does in this legislation. In the last few hours there have been a number of press statements issued by indigenous organisations, including the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park Board of Management, the Kakadu Board of Management and the Central Land Council. The issue of self-determination is best summed up by the media release from the Central Land Council, where Tracker Tilmouth not only condemns the deal but makes the point that:
The debate has been deliberately limited and has excluded many Aboriginal people who are still not fully across the issues.
He goes on to say:
Until there is a political process which is inclusive of Indigenous interests the question of our very basic right to self determination remains a myth.
He calls his press statement, `Political process sends us back to the mission'. Later on, I will go to the press release from the Kakadu Board of Management, but it is also worth noting at the outset one of the comments that Mick Alderson, the Chairperson of the Kakadu Board of Management, makes in respect of the way they have been treated. He speaks on behalf of not only Aboriginal members but also the tourism representative of the Kakadu Board of Management. They express their concern and he says:
We are tired of being treated like jacky-jackys, sitting on the sideline watching non-Aboriginal people making decisions about our land.
These people raise these sorts of concerns because they have been misled, not just by the government but also by the Australian Democrats. It was this minister who wrote to the boards of management saying that there would not be a change in the management arrangements without the consent of the boards. The next thing they knew was that legislation had been introduced to change the structure of the boards of management. There was no consultation in between and no consent sought. The minister just comes in here and introduces legislation, and not only does he not consult but he breaks a commitment 
 and a promise. Further down the track, this felony is compounded by the Australian Democrats, who not only sell them out but try to portray their sell out as a great win for indigenous Australians. That is adding insult to injury, Senator Allison.
When you look at yesterday's press statement from the Australian Democrats, you see that they claim to have acted in the interests of indigenous Australians; they claim to have acted to stop the appointment of Northern Territory government representatives on the boards of the two Territory national parks—Ulura-Kata Tjuta and Kakadu. Big achievement! But if you read on in the documentation, you find that that achievement is not what it appears to be. Basically, they chose a deliberate course of deception and deceit, not just of indigenous Australians but of the broader Australian public. This is the mob who claimed victory on the environment legislation when the most eminent constitutional lawyers in the country told them that they had failed.	So we should not be surprised about what they have done.
They have told indigenous Australians, `Look, we have taken measures to ensure that there will not be a Territory rep on the board of management,' but when you go into the documentation, that is further redefined to mean that the appointment of a Northern Territory rep on the boards of Kakadu and Uluru-Kata Tjuta national parks is now subject to the consent of traditional owners, with the rider `which may not be withheld unreasonably'. If you go further into the documentation to try to work out what that means, you find that if they resist—if the boards of management do not like a Northern Territory rep on the board of management—the decision will be taken out of their hands and given to the Commonwealth Ombudsman.
This is defence protection Australian Democrats style. This is the new wave of Australian Democrats social conscious and social policy: `Sell them out and try to make them feel good on the way through.' Senator Allison, this is the depths of deceit and you ought to be ashamed of yourself in respect of it. I have been with you when you have looked traditional owners, the elders of these communi 
 ties, straight in the face and said, `I will not let you down.' Not only have you let them down but you have tried to con them on the way through. Your voice is worthless in that community from now on and that is depicted by the press statements, releases and letters from these boards of management.
They write to Senator Meg Lees of their concerns about the proposed bill. They call on the Democrats to stall the debate. They want to have time to look at the amendments. These are not unreasonable things, given the fact that the sorts of people we are talking about and the sorts of management structures we are talking about are very successful examples of management by indigenous Australians. Kakadu was the first place in Australia to set up a joint management model. It has been internationally recognised and other parks, not just in Australia but around the world, have learned from us and have made stronger laws for joint management. That is the view of the Chair of the Kakadu Board of Management, Mick Alderson.
But what do we do here? We have put poison in the well. We have put a Northern Territory government representative on the board of Kakadu, and of Uluru. Maybe not on day 1, but give it three months and it happens. Three months is not a long time to wait for the Northern Territory government; they have waited a long time. They are on record in their most recent statements on this matter as saying that they want to take over control of these national parks. These are things that you cannot avoid, that you cannot run away from, Senator Allison, because they were told to you directly. You were there in Darwin at the meetings, and I was sitting next to you, when the Northern Territory government representatives made it very clear that they wanted to take over. They still want to take over. There is distrust there.
You have a great board of management structure that is working. So what do you do? You bow to the government again. Why? People have to ask themselves why you are doing this. These are the most fundamental rights. You know they are fundamental rights because, not only are they social rights, rights of decency and rights of recognition enshrined 
 in international covenants, they are also rights enshrined in leases under our law.
Those leases provide—and you yourself know full well they provide because, once again, we have had copies presented to us—that in circumstances such as this, even if legislation is introduced to disrupt or overturn the established management structures of those boards, whether it is Kakadu, Uluru or Wreck Bay, the traditional owners have a right to revoke those leases. It is a legal right of theirs. But, in total disregard for this—and we expect it from the government because the minister made his position clear from the start—you have traded away these legal and social rights in secret, without consultation, pretending to represent all these people.
—Outrageous!
—It is outrageous, Senator Crossin. No wonder these people reckon that they are seen by the political process of Australia as `Jacky Jackys, sitting on the sideline'. As I said, there are major concerns. They have been spelt out in the two letters to Senator Lees and the press statement. The concerns as stated in the Central Land Council media release are that:

We do not know to what extent this government is going to reinstate the role of the National Parks and Wildlife Director. But we do know that the independence of that position has been marginalised enormously over the last 12 to 18 months. I sat next to Senator Allison, hand-wringing and expressing concern about what had been happening, about how a public servant under the direction of the minister was now in that position. That concern does not filter through in terms of any outcome of the compromise in the agreement between the Democrats and the government. The next point in the press release expresses concern that the bill:
.	 ignores native title and cultural heritage protection laws 

Your protection of existing native title rights, as agreed with the government, is not good enough; it is not adequate enough. You cannot hide behind incompetence on that one because you knew, and you continue to know, that that was an issue. But did you seek consultation with those who have actually defended Aboriginal Australians in respect of native title? Did you become aware of it? Did you let them come to the table as you were sitting there, cozy with the Prime Minister, Senator Hill and others from the government? There was no room for black people at the table of negotiation on this particular bill when it came to even their most fundamental rights. The deal does not protect the Native Title Act, which passed this place after a long debate less than a year ago. How do you reconcile that? How will you go back to your supporters in Victoria and explain to them that you have actually sold out on the protection of that Native Title Act? You are going to have to. The press release further states that the bill:
.	 does not provide an effective framework for negotiation of indigenous land use agreements . . . 
That is another area in contradiction to the Native Title Act 1993. The next point states that the bill:
.	 allows the Commonwealth to transfer responsibility to the States and Territories without sufficient accountability
To some extent, you have protected against bilaterals, but you have not protected against that list of myriad mechanisms that are available under legislation for this minister, this government, to basically flick-off responsibilities in that area. The second last point is that:
.	 there is no requirement for consultation with indigenous stakeholders
You would not want that, because you have not had it. You have not allowed them at the table, so it is no wonder that that does not find itself in the legislation. The last point states that this bill:
.	 gives the Commonwealth Minister wide discretion in key areas
That is right; that is something that your minority report expressed concern about. So we do have here a sell-out of the Kakadu, 
 Uluru—Kata Tjuta and Wreck Bay national parks and the destruction of their boards of management. But I suppose the most offensive thing about all this is that it has been done with absolutely no participation of indigenous Australians. Their view, as last expressed to us, is that they want more time. They do not want the Northern Territory rep. They reckon—not only do they reckon but the international bodies reckon—that they have a good board of management structure. You have sold out on that; you have done it in the dark and you have done it trying to mislead the people most directly affected.
So I say to you: any time you put your head up, Senator Allison, and any time the Democrats put their heads up in the future pretending to be defenders of indigenous Australians, we will remind you of two things—the fact that you have sold out their rights and the fact that you have sold them out without even warning them and trying to deceive them.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION BILL 1998 [1999]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Allison, Sen Lyn",AD,1999-06-23,"—Since Senator Bolkus quotes so freely from press releases, I will do so as well. I quote from a press release put out yesterday by the Chairman of ATSIC, Gatjil Djerrkura. He said:
The Federal Government and the Australian Democrats have negotiated a number of important concessions for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in negotiations over proposed amendments to the Environment Protection Biodiversity Conservation Bill.
Federal Environment Minister, Senator Robert Hill and Australian Democrats Leader, Senator Meg Lees and Democrats Environment spokesperson, Senator Lyn Allison, have clearly listened and taken on board key Indigenous concerns about the proposed Bill in a series of meetings with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander groups, including ATSIC.
This is reflected in a number of key changes they have negotiated to the proposed legislation before the Senate.
We acknowledge that there are a number of Aboriginal groups who would like more time. Indeed, Mr Djerrkura says that he would too; that he would like to see another round of consultations with their constituents before the bill passes into law. We would like that too, but the fact of the matter is that this legisla 
 tion has been around for 18 months; we have had a very extensive inquiry; and I have had meetings with Aboriginal groups both as part of that inquiry and outside there. What remains is that, once Aboriginal people are across the detail, they are—ATSIC tell us—not uncomfortable. I will just run through some of those indigenous benefits.
The objects of the amended bill recognise the role and the knowledge of indigenous peoples in relation to the conservation and sustainable use of Australia's biodiversity. Senator Bolkus cannot claim that any of his legislation has done that. The amended bill explicitly states that it does not affect the operation of native title or Aboriginal land rights legislation. In spite of all of the scaremongering, this bill does not affect native title or Aboriginal land rights legislation.
—You don't know what you've agreed to.
—That has been written into the bill, Senator Bolkus, and you should have a look and acquaint yourself with that fact. In entering into a conservation agreement the minister must take into account obligations under biodiversity convention and the national biodiversity strategy relating to indigenous people's customary use of biodiversity and indigenous knowledge of biodiversity. Again, this is something Labor did not do. The minister must also have regard for the role and interest of indigenous peoples in the conservation of Australia's biodiversity in developing bilateral agreements, recovery plans and threat abatement plans.
Existing provisions relating to indigenous people's rights to use Commonwealth reserves for hunting, food gathering or ceremonial and religious purposes have been reinstated. The Biological Diversity Advisory Committee will now include indigenous representation. So all that Jacky Jacky stuff is nonsense. Our amendments make sure that the voices of indigenous people are heard and that they will have representation on that advisory committee. An indigenous advisory committee will be established to advise the minister on the operation of the act, taking into account the 
 significance of indigenous people's knowledge of the management of land, and the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity.
The appointment of a Northern Territory representative, as you have already indicated, on the boards of Kakadu and Uluru national parks is subject to the consent of traditional owners. Furthermore, there is an opportunity for them to review that appointment and for them to, if necessary, replace that member on the board. So we are not talking here about the Northern Territory taking over control of those two boards of management—nobody has ever suggested that. In fact, as I recall, Senator Bolkus—and I think you were there at the time—a suggestion was put forward by the Kakadu Board of Management that they could live with a Northern Territory member on the board, provided that that statutory role of the National Parks and Wildlife position remained intact.
—And an expansion of the board? What have you done about that? Nothing.
—Indeed, Senator Bolkus, but it is the judgment of indigenous people that they can live with a member of the board. We are not talking about a majority of Northern Territory members; we are talking about somebody who can demonstrate their ability to be cooperative with indigenous people—and that certainly would be my hope. I am persuaded by the government's arguments that, in terms of the future for relations between the boards and the Northern Territory government, there may well be some strong argument for there to be a Northern Territory rep on that board. We have judged, based on what we were told by the Kakadu Board of Management, that this is not the end of the world and that if it is one member it is not going to mean that indigenous people lose control of the board or anything of that sort.
—This is outrageous.
—So your criticisms, Senator Bolkus are really unfounded and, again, I draw your  attention to what Mr Gatjil Djerrkura has said. He has indicated that we have clearly listened—not just slightly listened—and taken on board indigenous 
 concerns. I think for the first time we are going to see legislation which really reflects the important role that indigenous people in this country have in biodiversity.
On the general subject of biodiversity, we have negotiated a range of amendments under this section. I am very proud to say that this country now has the first national biodiversity legislation. We have upgraded the number of categories of threatened species and increased the types of communities listed. We have specified time lines for all the steps of the listing process. We have uncoupled the decision about listing a threatened species from the decision about the feasibility of a threat abatement plan. So that will stop a lot of existing problems where political decisions were used to stop listing threatened species. That listing will be made solely on the basis of scientific criteria. Recovery plans at present are required for only listed species occurring entirely or partly on Commonwealth areas. Now they are required for all listed species and ecological communities as well.
We have registers of critical habitat, deeper safeguards for migratory species than ever before, strict liability in relation to threatened species, and we are banning the capture of dolphins for live display. Anyone who thinks that wild dolphins should be caught and put in a swimming pool for their life is obviously barbaric. Commonwealth fisheries will now be subject to strategic environmental assessment during the next five years. And there has never—I repeat never—been an environmental impact assessment on a Commonwealth fishery. The Democrats see this as a major positive step, with so many fisheries vulnerable to collapse from overexploitation. There will now be conservation agreements entered into for the protection and conservation of biodiversity anywhere in Australia. There will be identification and monitoring of biodiversity and preparation of bioregional plans.
One of the most important agreements we have made with Senator Hill is that there will be a public inquiry into the use of and access to biological resources. Indigenous people will be specifically funded to make submissions and to participate. That will be an open and 
 public inquiry, and it will feed into the regulation making process under this bill. Senator Bolkus will recall that indigenous people have been calling for this kind of inquiry for some long time.
Another important measure is that all wildlife on Commonwealth land will be protected unless it is specifically exempted in a schedule. There will be a regulation making power to list invasive species—again, a first. It is a pity that Senator Bolkus and the Labor Party never thought of this while they were in government. Invasive species, as the Democrats know—Senator Brown probably does not know this—are a major ecological threat, and there are no provisions to deal with them in existing Commonwealth legislation. There is nothing here at present.
This is yet another area in which the Democrats have made a difference and have made sure that this legislation is not only greatly amended from the original version but also a great improvement on the status quo. There are very many other ways in which biodiversity is protected as a result of this bill, and I am proud to say that the Democrats will be part of introducing the very first Commonwealth biodiversity act.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION BILL 1998 [1999]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1999-06-23,"—I want to build upon the comments I was making before lunch on the indigenous issue. I noted that Senator Bolkus, on behalf of the Australian Labor Party, repeated much of what Senator Crossin had said yesterday. It really is the politics of division, I am sad to say. It is an attempt to gain a short-term political advantage through dividing indigenous Australia from non-indigenous Australia, an attempt on Senator Crossin's part to bring the politics of the Northern Territory down here to Canberra to gain, I presume she believes, some short-term political benefit at home. It is a matter of great regret in relation to an issue of such consequence.
I say that because Senator Crossin's contribution yesterday was principally an attack on the Northern Territory government. She cannot win an election in the Northern Territory and so she comes down here with her complaints when rather what she should be 
 doing is addressing the indigenous issues as they relate to the bill. They are very important. The message I wanted to bring and the point I wanted to make—and it really is necessary because unfortunately, in relation to indigenous affairs as in other areas, the Labor Party wants to dwell in the past rather than move forward—
Opposition senators interjecting—
—I am proud of the joint management. I have said that many times publicly and, if we are talking about the Northern Territory parks, in relation to both Kakadu and Uluru.
—Then why change it?
—Senator Crossin said yesterday that the Northern Territory wants to get rid of the indigenous representation on the board. That is wrong. Those they want to get rid of are us: they want to get Canberra out. That is an aspiration I understand from a territory that wishes to be a state. They wish their parks service to play the same role as parks services in the states, and they cannot really see why the Commonwealth still needs to be involved. But they are not against joint management between themselves and indigenous people. Senator Crossin would be aware of the Nitmiluk National Park and of Gurig. There are instances of joint management between indigenous people and the Northern Territory government. When I have visited those parks, particularly Nitmiluk, the indigenous people have told me that it works well.
Be that as it may, we as a Commonwealth government are not going to walk away from either Kakadu or Uluru. We are pleased to be there, playing our part as one of the partners in joint management. We are pleased to bring the best practices in relation to park management and we also recognise the symbolism of those parks in relation to the aspirations of indigenous Australians. But we, in contrast to the Labor Party, also believe that you need to put the wars, battles and disappointments of the past behind and move forward. This idea that one representative of the Northern Territory government—one representative on a board on which it is prescribed that the indigenous people must be a majority—will 
 in some way be a negative is simply a reflection of the disappointments of the past. It is obvious to me—and, I would have thought, to anybody who looked at this issue objectively—that, provided the Northern Territory representative was prepared to contribute in a constructive way, it must be an asset.
—Is that guaranteed in this legislation?
—If Senator Crossin has that assurance, does that mean that she will then support a Northern Territory representative? Of course she will not, because she wants to relive the battles of the past in the Northern Territory. It is a sensible progression in the interests of the parks and of the indigenous people that there be a Northern Territory representative—not, as she asserted yesterday, to give Northern Territory control but to have one Northern Territory representative who can bring the perspective of the Northern Territory government and the Northern Territory parks service. It can help in relation to transfers of staff and the building-up of employment opportunities—all of those things that cooperative relations can achieve.
Senator Crossin says that, because they were not cooperative in the past, they cannot be so in the future. That is a negative, disappointing approach to this issue. What we need—and I would say this to Senator Crossin and to Senator Bolkus, who also seeks to win political points out of these issues—is to move forward. And a Northern Territory representative contributing constructively can be a significant step forward—without any threat, because it is only one representative. I accept that it should be somebody who is satisfactory to the indigenous people.
That is a safeguard but, as we know, traditional owners are influenced by third parties and by people such as Senator Crossin who are much more interested in fighting the political battles than in the advancement of indigenous people. So they are influenced and decisions are not always made on the basis of what is the best outcome, but they get dragged into the political process of the Northern Territory. That is why we have put the provision in that consent will not be unreasonably withheld. Obviously, the person 
 who would be found for these positions would be a person who is sensitive to indigenous issues. This provision will not come into effect for a 12-month period, and there will be no difficulty at all in finding a representative of the Northern Territory government who is sensitive to indigenous issues and can actually work to the betterment and improvement of the parks and of indigenous people who live in those parks. As I have said so many times, they are not just simply parks; they are also communities.
On the same subject, I heard it said yesterday that the government has not consulted. The government has consulted. I have consulted on these issues since this process started in 1996. As I said this morning, I listened to the consultations and I abandoned what I thought would be a good administrative reform by reinstating the position of the director of national parks because that was the request of the indigenous people and of the traditional owners of those two parks. I have watered down the provision and added extra safeguards in relation to the position of a Northern Territory representative so that there can be no threat—and there was never any—or perceived threat. But will the Labor Party acknowledge that? Will Tracker Tilmouth acknowledge that? Of course not. If the Labor Party took Tracker Tilmouth seriously, they would have preselected him. They will not preselect him as a candidate but they come here and want to use his words to support their case.
There are so many other aspects that have been built into this package to ensure a full contribution by indigenous Australia. I want to make particular mention of that which we agreed with ATSIC, that is, to establish an indigenous advisory body. We recognise that indigenous Australians bring to the table a different perspective, a unique perspective, in relation to biodiversity. It is important that that perspective is part of the debate.
—Where is the funding coming from?
—What do you mean `where is the funding coming from'? We will fund it. The government will fund it.
—Environment or ATSIC?
—Environment will fund it.
—Good.
—At least I got some acknowledgment from Senator Bolkus. That committee will ensure at the highest levels at the table an indigenous contribution to this broader environment debate, a contribution that has never been facilitated by such a structure in the past. I would have thought that that would be acknowledged by even the Labor Party. But no: because it would spoil a political point.
There was not within the bill, and I have to acknowledge it was inadvertent, a specific place dedicated on the BDAC committee for an indigenous representative. That has been pointed out and it is now corrected, and it ought to be acknowledged. When I met with the board in Kakadu there were some misgivings about the quorum provisions imposed in the bill. Although I thought they were misconceived, I know they were repeated in submissions made by the Kakadu board and traditional owners to the Senate committee. We have taken steps to amend that so there can be no doubt—in other words, we listened to the indigenous representatives and we acted on their concerns.
Within this bill we have protection for traditional use of land and water in Commonwealth reserves, something that ought to be acknowledged and recognised. We provide for conservation agreements to be entered into with indigenous communities, which is a positive step in the right direction. As was mentioned in the last contribution, there will be a special place for indigenous Australia within the proposed study of access to biological resources because, again, as I said, there is a unique indigenous perspective of these issues and it is important that that perspective is part of the debate.
Consultation requirements have been expanded to address indigenous interests in relation to bilaterals and the recovery plans. That ought to be recognised and it certainly has been by those who take indigenous issues seriously. The objects of the bill have been expanded, also to address indigenous issues. Bilateral agreements will not apply to actions in relation to Kakadu, Uluru and Booderee, 
 contrary, again, to what I recall Senator Crossin saying yesterday. A provision confirms that the bill does not affect the land rights act and the Native Title Act, contrary to what Tracker Tilmouth says in the document to which Senator Bolkus refers. All he has got to do is read the amendments and he would find that what he is asserting in that document is incorrect.
So if you package all of that up, you must concede there have been real steps to ensure that indigenous Australia has a vital place in the whole perspective of how our country manages its natural assets and conserves them to the benefit of future generations. It is in fact an unprecedented opportunity from which all Australians will benefit. Getting full benefit from the Aboriginal perspective is not just to the benefit of Aboriginal Australians but to the benefit of all Australians, and that has been our philosophical approach to this particular act. I hope, as such, that in this year it will be recognised and recalled as a significant contribution to reconciliation as well.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION BILL 1998 [1999]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-06-23,"—It is remarkable, is it not, that the patronising can be so glib? The ultimate decision about who is on the boards of these great natural areas, which are indigenous people's areas and which, through their generosity of spirit, they have opened up to all Australians, is now being moved—by sleight of hand endorsed by the Democrats—into the hands of a non-Aboriginal officer appointed by the government. That is where this process has ended up.
I want to briefly talk about biodiversity—because I know Senator Crossin wants to speak on the indigenous issues—and to follow up on what Senator Allison had to say about what a great deal the Democrats have got for biodiversity. Let me start by informing the Senate that half of the biodiversity in Australia—that is, half of the spectrum of wildlife and plant life—is in Australia's forests. We know that wildlife is concentrated in the forests of the world and, because of deforestation primarily, some 50 to 100 species of our fellow creatures on this planet are going to extinction every day.
Here in Australia the count is not kept. For example, in the Tasmanian forests, which are very much affected by this Democrat endorsed bill, there are some 10,000 forest insects. We do not know their role in the forests. We do know by rule of thumb that at least some of these creatures with their ancient lineage will be very important to human health and survival further down the line. But they are not listed, they are not studied and they are not protected.
The Democrats' process today involves endorsing what the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, Robert Hill—with his reputation as the worst minister for the environment in this nation's history—has done in the Regional Forest Agreement process, which says that all the unprotected forests of Western Australia, Victoria, Tasmania, New South Wales and Queensland will in future be out of reach of any federal minister. With that goes the wildlife and the plant life, and now with that comes the Democrats' endorsement. Senator Allison gets up and speaks glibly about what she is doing to protect things, but she is selling out half the wildlife species range in Australia in this one fell move.
Not only is she selling it out with her fellow Democrats—in the lap of the government, because they put their place at the Howard table ahead of Australia's biodiversity—but she is saying, `We are going to pass this legislation'—they will vote later today for the third reading—which means that for the next 20 years half the biodiversity of Australia is going to be unprotectable by the minister for the environment, because there is a bilateral agreement in place, unless a state government wants to come to the party. The states will have the control.
What we do know is that in Tasmania the governments are far from taking up that role. In the north-east highlands, beyond Ben Lomond and towards Weldborough—if you can imagine the heart-shaped island of Tasmania, it is in the north-east corner—a forest is being pulverised by the big woodchip companies, with the authority of the Howard government and now with the authority of the Democrats. 
There has been turmoil in those forests, with people risking arrest not least because in the damper, more rainforested part of these highlands there are two species listed as endangered. The Simson stag beetle is a huge, magnificent, glistening forest floor forager. The north-east forest snail, Anoglypta Launcestonensis, is larger than the introduced garden snail with which most Australians are familiar. It is brilliant orange, and it has a magnificent carapace on its back. It is listed as endangered, but the loggers want its territory.
So what has been happening while the minister for the environment and the Democrats bind their hands? Forestry Tasmania has got in a consultant. The consultant said, `Well, yes, this has been listed as vulnerable, endangered and on its way to extinction, but we guess'—because they cannot do better than that—`that if we leave some remnants of this to-be-pulverised forest along rivers and roadsides, which we were going to leave anyway, and we let the bulldozers, chainsaws and firebombers drop incendiaries at the end of the season to burn to death everything in the logged areas, including the north-east forest snail on the endangered list, that's okay.'
Because this snail was getting in the way of logging, they have now gone so far as to move into a process of de-listing, Senator Allison. You do not know about this because you are not aware of the impact on the wellbeing of the biodiversity—the spectrum of wildlife in this country—of handing back power to state governments. We already know from the Regional Forest Agreement—honoured now by the Democrats—that when you hand Commonwealth responsibility for the nation's wildlife, its creatures and its diversity back to state governments, who are under pressure from corporate extractors, the corporate extractors win the day.
So, very early, one creature on the list of threatened and endangered species will simply be removed from the list. It is no longer going to be on the list as endangered because it is no longer going to be allowed to get in the way of the bulldozers, the chainsaws and those people who, at the end of the wrecking 
 of these forest ecosystems in the highlands of north-east Tasmania, come with the firebombers and the 1080—and the same for the rest of this country and the diversity in those forests.
The Democrats today are endorsing the Robert Hill dictum that this embarrassing problem should be handed back to the loggers and the woodchippers. That is what this process is about, and that is why this is such a shameful day—as the Democrats turn their backs on all those years of tub-thumping and saying that they stood for the environment. Today they stand for the chainsaws and the diminution of this nation's environment. The things that Senator Allison read out ought to be part of any decent piece of legislation—but a minor part of it.
What is notable here is how much Senator Allison, when she went to that polished Howard table, failed to get. What is also notable is that Senator Allison—so recently able to march the streets of Melbourne with conservationists for the protection of the forests of East Gippsland—is now endorsing the Regional Forest Agreement which is going to lead to the pulverisation of forests in East Gippsland and the threatening of species in East Gippsland. If you cross the border, breeding koala habitats are marked for destruction under the Regional Forest Agreement endorsed by this bill and about to be endorsed by Senator Allison, Senator Stott Despoja, Senator Woodley, Senator Bartlett, Senator Lees, Senator Murray and Senator Bourne—these new friends of the government environmental wreckers—when they vote yes for this bill on the third reading later today. Let them live with it.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION BILL 1998 [1999]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,1999-06-23,"—Before I make some comments further to my speech yesterday, I want to say how terrific it is to see some young kids up in the public gallery—and young babies, at that. It is probably one of the very few places in this Parliament House where young children can go, and some of us live in hope for the day we have a child-care centre here that is as large as a gymnasium.
—A bit of relevance to the bill would be helpful, thank you, Senator Crossin.
—We cannot just let these opportunities go by, Madam Chairman. I want to take some arguments through about one particular aspect of this bill, and that is the proposal to change the arrangements for the management of the national parks at Kakadu and at Uluru. I do not want to raise my voice and get angry, but I must say that I am surprised, Senator Allison. Last week we sat together at an inquiry to look at Jabiluka and we met the traditional owners from that area. One of the things that you must not have failed to grasp when we talked to those people is that all of these arrangements—the lease arrangements and the idea of us passing laws in Canberra to change their lifestyle—are very complex issues for them. I have met with these people time and time again, and they have not ruled out having a Northern Territory representative on the board; in fact, they have said they would welcome further discussions and thinking about it. But at this point in time they have said no to that.
One of the things that must have impressed you, as it has impressed me, is that they talk about Aboriginal law being constant. It does not change; it has been with them for many, many years. So if you are going to put changes and suggestions to these people, they need time to think about them and synthesise them. When I put it to them that a Northern Territory government representative on the board may be the way to go, they talked about it and said, `Maybe, but we would want an increase in our Aboriginal representation if that were the case.'
In a letter from the Kakadu Board of Management which was sent on 18 June, they talk about perhaps being serious about having a Northern Territory representative on the board if the Kakadu Board of Management were to have statutory powers to run Kakadu National Park. So those are two suggestions that I have heard traditional owners in this area come forward with. In other words, they are prepared to negotiate and think about changes, but they are not prepared to tolerate people making decisions about the manage 
 ment of the park without their being consulted—and by that I mean consulted in the last five, seven or 10 days—about these amendments. If there is one thing I would urge, Senator Allison, it is that this amendment be withdrawn while you take it back to Aboriginal people, get them to have a look at it, and bring it back in August. If nothing else is achieved today, perhaps this section of the bill could go away for further discussion with the people who matter.
What we are talking about here is an arrangement between people who own the land being leased to the Commonwealth. They have an arrangement as to who is going to control the park. They know who sits on the board of management and they have agreed to that, but it does change. They have not agreed to a change in composition of the board. They have not even had a chance to discuss your amendment or your proposal. The worse thing is that nobody even bothered to make two phone calls to the chairperson at Uluru and the chairperson at Kakadu. When you talk about a Northern Territory representative being on the board unless their consent is unreasonably withheld, what does that mean? Have you taken the time to explain to these traditional owners what those words mean? Even for the sake of this parliament, what does that mean?
Time and time again there have been a number of things that both this government and the Northern Territory government have done, things which Aboriginal people have not agreed with, but they have gone ahead anyway. The government has persisted. So I think at the end of the day the words `unreasonably withheld' will be shown to be meaningless.
Senator Allison quoted a letter from ATSIC. The other thing she should have learnt from talking to Aboriginal people is that they respect the words of the traditional owners. Gatjil Djerrkura and ATSIC do not speak for the traditional owners of Uluru and Kakadu. If you asked Gatjil Djerrkura, he would verify that. He is a traditional owner from north-east Arnhem Land. He cannot make and would not make decisions about Uluru and Kakudu, and 
 I am sure he would support the traditional owners of Uluru and Kakadu in this stance.
Last week, in relation to the Jabiluka approval process, when we asked the traditional owners whether they had been consulted by this government and by this company, Yvonne Margarula said to all of us who were present, `They talked to the traditional owners in this area, but we are the ones who count; we own the land. Other traditional owners disagree with us, but they do agree in our right to say what we want to happen with our land.' If you ask Gatjil Djerrkura whether in fact he upheld the views of the boards of management at Uluru and Kakuda, and ask Mick Alderson and Joanne Willmot for their views, they would support the boards of management. I have no doubt on that. I think this view goes more to a general statement about the bill, as opposed to these specific areas. We have received a couple of letters from Kakadu in only the last 24 hours which talk about either stopping or slowing the process of this legislation. They go on to say:
When the current government came to power, the way of doing business changed in Kakadu and joint management from the inside is now not so good.
From Uluru, in a letter to Meg Lees, those people say:
The traditional owners are asking you and other senators not to agree to amendments to do with their land but to delay the passage of the bill.
They are not saying, `Don't pass it.' What they are saying is, `Delay it.' On behalf of the constituents whom I represent, who have control over these two parks, perhaps what I am saying to you is that this is one area that should just be set aside while you go back and ask them if this is what they want or whether there could be a compromise in order to achieve this. The letter from Uluru goes on to say:
The minister has misled us by initially declaring that the proposed Bill would not affect the joint management arrangements at all.
Senator Hill will say, `There is no change.' In the minds of the traditional owners there is a significant change. First of all, they have not been consulted about these changes in the last week. Secondly, they have an arrangement with the Commonwealth that does not involve 
 a state or territory government representative on the board, and they do not understand the words `unreasonably withheld'. You need time to sit down and talk to the traditional owners about that. They go on further to say:
The bill was then tabled in the House of Representatives before we were aware of its grave implications to existing arrangements.
They also say:
The Minister has not agreed to repeated requests for sufficient time to consult properly and negotiate what amounts to the future of joint management.
I think in this case they are right. They have also raised the fact that they believe there are legal requirements which have not been fulfilled in the process of preparing these new bills. That is not a road which I want to go down, but I do want to impress on people here, particularly on the Democrats and on Senator Hill, that out of the blue we had amendments tabled on Monday night—it does not come as a surprise—where the traditional owners at Kakadu and Uluru know you have been thinking about expanding the membership of the board. They have not ruled it out. They have already put a couple of compromises to you about them having statutory powers to run the park or perhaps increasing their number of representatives. Those compromises are certainly in correspondence that I have received and they are certainly in correspondence that Meg Lees has received—both letters are in front of me.
These people do not want to shut the gate; neither do these people want to be dictated to and told what the new arrangements are. It is not the way they operate, it is not the way they want to operate and it is not the way they should have to operate because they own that land. That area has been disregarded in all of this. It would be like you leasing your house to some person and a third party coming in to sit on your board of management to help you control that lease arrangement. Unless you had been consulted about that, I would have thought you would be pretty annoyed about it.
I am trying to impress on you that there is no urgency about this section of the bill. There is no requirement to get this part of the bill through by midnight tonight. The tradi 
 tional owners of these national parks have put their trust in the Commonwealth and have undertaken a lease with the government to run that park. They are now saying, simply, `You want to change our best practice arrangements and you want to change the way in which the park is managed. You want an additional person on that board, but we have not said yes to that.' Mind you, they have not said no outright either. As well, you have not offered them a complementary person, so you are not going to increase the numbers—
—I did. They rejected it.
—Maybe you need to go back and now put this proposal.
—I did. It went back and back again.
—Have you been back to them, Minister, since these amendments have been tabled? I would say that the answer to that is no. You could not possibly have done that since Monday when these amendments were tabled, or else these letters would reflect otherwise. These people are simply saying, `That's your proposal; let's think about it. Maybe we will reject it outright, but maybe we will sit down and think about it.' These people need time to digest the proposals you are putting. They own this land. I believe these people have the right to be able to sit down and come to a compromise with you. I am astounded that Senator Allison and even Senator Woodley have agreed to such arrangements without even taking that amendment on board and without undertaking to consult with these people about this specific amendment.
There is no rush. You said earlier that there is a year before this will come into place. The boards of management of those national parks have established best practice, and have been internationally recognised for that. I am simply saying that you need to pull this off the agenda. You need to sit down and talk with these people. If it is something they are comfortable with, bring it back in August.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AND BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION BILL 1998 [1999]</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1
"Hill, Sen Robert",LP,1999-06-23,"—There is a lot that could be said in answer to those comments. Firstly, I repeat 
 that there has been consultation for nearly three years. Secondly, a whole range of concessions have been made as a result of those consultations, none of which were acknowledged by Senator Crossin. Thirdly, in relation to the prospect of a new structure for the two parks, perhaps more akin to that of Nitmiluk, which is an interesting precedent, we have said to the Aboriginal people we are prepared to look at that as well.

—Certainly. I am unable to tell whether that is apparent from the amendments. Minister, are you able to indicate whether government amendments Nos 176 and 177 are related to government amendment No. 180? Are they consequential or related to one another?
—I am not suggesting they are consequential.
—When I sought guidance this morning, you howled me down.
—The old onion in the hanky again.
—I am seeking your guidance, Madam Chair.
—Well, I am seeking the guidance of the minister because I am unable to ascertain whether there is any relationship or linkage between No. 176 and the others.
—Let me assure you that I am not seeking Senator Hill's guidance, I was seeking yours.
—From the amendments, we are unable to ascertain whether there is any relationship or not.
—I appreciate that with the advice of the Clerk you have attempted to do that. I think it is better for me in the circumstances to seek that amendments Nos 176, 177 and 180 be taken separately. I think that might assist the committee, in the absence of further advice.

—Madam Chair, I raise a point of order. As I understand it from what was said this morning, this is a practice that has been designed by the chair to facilitate a genuine situation where an individual senator wishes to take a different perspective. It is difficult for me to recall one occasion in the last 18 years in this place on which an individual Labor Party senator decided to take a different position to his or her colleagues. All of a sudden today the Australian Labor Party comes in here and has suddenly adopted a new liberalism.
—Madam Chair, I raise a point of order.

—Well, you are not making a point of order.
—What's the point of order?
—Make a point of order.

—Madam Chair, it is that this is a stunt. It is spurious. There is no genuine difference, and you should not let the processes of the Senate be abused in this way. In other words, guidance that has been given to help genuine differences of view should be used for such circumstances, not to facilitate stunts.
—Madam Chair, I raise a point of order on the non-point of order. Of course, that was not a point of order from Senator Hill; it was just an attempt for him to use the guise of the standing orders of taking a point of order to make a speech, which he knows that he cannot do. Another political point: he does not refer to the Senate standing orders or rulings that have been made. I believe, Madam Chair, in this circumstance he ought to have been sat down after the first couple of sentences.
—What is your point of order?
—My point of order, Madam Chair, is that it is a deliberate abuse of the standing orders for Senator Hill to stand up and make that sort of contribution under the guise of a point of order, and he should be sat down immediately.

—Standing order 84(3) gives me the discretion. There are a number of people who have requested variations to the orders because they want to vote differently from previous votes and may wish to 
 change their vote on different amendments. I will now put the amendments individually.
—Madam Chair, I raise a point of order. I draw your attention to standing order 193(3), which states in part:
. . . and all imputations of improper motives and all personal reflections on those Houses, members or officers shall be considered highly disorderly.
I regard it as highly disorderly to have it suggested that my decision to vote in a particular way on a particular amendment before this committee has somehow an improper motive. I resent that and I believe that any such imputation or suggestion by Senator Hill or anyone else in this committee should be withdrawn.
—No imputation is meant. A significant number of people have indicated that they wish to vote individually and in differing ways on different amendments. However, if, when we start to put those amendments, people vote the same way as others are voting and in a way that would indicate they have changed their minds in respect of what they have requested here, I will be left to draw no other conclusion than—
—Is that imputing on the rest of them?
—No. It relates to the individual.
—Madam Chair, I raise a point of order. I wanted to put clearly on the record that I do not wish to vote differently on those ones that have been dealt with previously. My matter of deep conscience relates to amendments Nos 429, 430 and 432. How am I going to indicate that to the chamber if you do not proceed in that way?
—Because I will be putting them separately, Senator, and you will be able to vote on them.

This is an unusual way to do business but, in this new era of flexibility, an alternative option would be that the second environment bill still requires a second reading, and I am sure at least Senator Bob Brown would like to spend 15 minutes bagging us again—notwithstanding that we have heard the speech 20 times already today. If we suspended this consideration whilst the second reading of the second bill, which is the  Environmental Reform (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1998 [1999] , took place—I do not know whether the contents of the bill will be relevant to the speech, but anyway—that might facilitate the negotiation that has been suggested.

"Bolkus, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-06-23,"—There are enormous concerns about this Environmental Reform (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1998 [1999]  as well as the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998 [1999] . One of the main concerns emanates from the title. We are asked as a Senate to consider the Environmental Reform (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1998 [1999] , but that title is something which does not satisfactorily reflect the legislation. Once again we have a bodgying up of the process, once again we have an abuse of the rules and once again we have the government trying to conceal something in this legislation that they should really be more up-front about. Once again we have the Australian Democrats as the conspiratorial joint party to this particular deception.
Let me read what the Parliamentary Library say about this legislation. They make some comments about the legislation and about how this bill is described as a `consequential amendment' bill. They say on page 22 of their report:
The Office of Parliamentary Counsel has advised that although there is no formal limitation on the content or scope of a `consequential amendments' Bill, such a Bill would usually contain provisions required to implement a new legislative scheme and would not normally contain provisions (technical or otherwise) that were unrelated to the scheme's establishment.
This Bill implements a range of necessary amendments that are consequential to the implementation of the EP&BC Bill. However the Bill also makes a range of other amendments which can be interpreted as substantial new proposals which supplement, rather than arise from, the EP&BC Bill. This raises issues as to the adequacy of consultation and scrutiny of these substantive measures by all relevant stakeholders. On that point, it is notable that the current Bill was not included in the Senate Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee's inquiry into the EP&BC Bill 1998 until 24 March 1999. The Committee reported on 27 April 1999.
They are the two primary concerns. First of all, you have misdescription. You have this legislation described as `consequential' when in essence it is more than consequential. In essence it raises other measures that are of 
 enormous relevance and importance to stakeholders but about which those stakeholders have not had the normal advance notice. More importantly, this bill was sent to the committee late in the process—only three or four weeks before the committee reported.
These are not minor amendments. They are also reflective of how this legislation has been handled by this government and this parliament. We have had amendments introduced to the major bill and amendments to the consequential bill. Those amendments have been discussed in secret but, in respect of this bill as well as the other, we have not had engagement with industry or with the states, I must say—and the states have an enormous stake in the management of operations under these two bills—and, extremely importantly in respect of this particular consequential provisions bill, we have had no engagement with indigenous Australians. We are not talking about inconsequential amendments; we are talking about consequential amendments. Yesterday Senator Hill said that, if we were serious, we would have given him notice in respect of certain matters before we came in here yesterday.
Well, if he were serious in respect of this legislation, he would have given us—this parliament—notice as to his amendments before we came in yesterday. So, once again, this legislation is in the same category as the major piece of legislation—that is, there are amendments to it; amendments which have avoided public scrutiny and which have not had sufficient parliamentary scrutiny as well. When you are looking at the process, something like 20 seconds per amendment is totally inadequate parliamentary scrutiny.
The best assessment of this legislation also comes from the library's Bills Digest. What does this legislation do? It does exactly the sorts of things that we have been talking about for some little while in this place. It affects indigenous people's interest in, stake in and rights on the boards of management of the Kakadu National Park, the Uluru-Kata Tjuta National Park and the Wreck Bay Aboriginal community council. It appears that, although these issues were raised in the 1998 consultation paper, it was not indicated 
 in the central aspects of the act that changes would be made. So you had indigenous Australians having to take last-minute mercy dashes to appear before the committee to try and defend their positions as to joint management and their concern in respect of the abolition of the position of the Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. That is something that we are told has been wound back, but we have not been told the details of that. There were concerns in respect of what they thought would be a compulsory transfer of the lease from the Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service to the Commonwealth.
These matters in themselves are important matters, not consequential on the other legislation, but they were thrown in here primarily, I suppose, because the government was thinking that we would believe it was an after-thought, but they were thrown in here in a way that did not give stakeholders sufficient notice. The concept of the addition of a Northern Territory board member also arises in this consequential legislation. This legislation also affects the traditional use of land and water by Aboriginals. Section 70 provides, in essence, a limitation of rights to those appearing in the current legislation, so we do have some concerns in respect of indigenous Australians.
We also have concerns as to what this particular legislation does to the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975. Not having done enough damage in their primary legislation, the government then seeks to amend the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975. The Council of Australian Governments' 1997 heads of agreement provides the policy basis for the proposed EPBC act. It states that the Commonwealth and state heritage ministers would develop a cooperative national heritage protection strategy. The government's environment reform 1998 consultation paper proposed the introduction of a new heritage protection law at a date following the debate on the primary legislation.
This new heritage legislation has not been introduced in the parliament. Given this, we would deem it inappropriate to remove the links between the Commonwealth environ 
 ment minister and the Australian Heritage Commission in relation to actions that may impact on heritage areas. In order to avoid the creation of a regulatory vacuum on these issues, it may be—and we will be moving amendments to this effect—advisable to continue the operation of the EP(IP) Act in relation to heritage matters until a new heritage regime is introduced.
We should save the operation of the Heritage Commission Act—our amendments will go to that. But, given the conduct of proceedings in the last 24 hours or so, there is absolutely no way that those substantive amendments will get up. We might get some mealy-mouthed alternative from the Democrats, we may get some promise of a committee or an inquiry down the track—all those sorts of things—but the substantive operation of the Australian Heritage Commission will be affected by this legislation, as will the operation of the world heritage protection act itself. We have in the government's legislation some incremental improvement in respect of the protection of world heritage areas but we also have some monumental wind-back from the currently prevailing law, and we are also seeking to protect those provisions that are about to be affected.
There are other aspects. There are amendments to the Lands Acquisition Act and there is the repeal of the Biological Control Act 1984, all under the guise of consequential amendments. So we say the government stands condemned because this is not a consequential amendments bill; this does much more than that. We say the government and the Democrats stand condemned because they have entered into an arrangement which does over some substantive rights and some pretty substantial protections in terms of indigenous Australians, world heritage and the AHC. We also say they stand condemned because no-one in here, let alone anyone outside of here, has had enough opportunity to give this legislation adequate scrutiny.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENTAL REFORM (CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1998 [1999]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-06-23,"—The previous speaker in this debate on the Environmental Reform (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1998 [1999]  was absolutely right. Not only are we in the position where we are 
 dealing with a bill which claims to be consequential on the major environment bill that has been debated for much of the day, but also we have been asked by the government to deal with this bill before that environment bill has gone through and before we even know how it is going to be amended. That is an extraordinary situation for the Senate to find itself in. It shows that the government and the Democrats are in a complete mess as far as the handling of this environment legislation is concerned. They do not know what their strategy is. They did bring in the guillotine. They thought that was the end of it and that all this stuff would be finished by half past five this evening, but now they are in a complete mess because people on this side of the house who think differently from the Democrats and the government about the environment have wanted the debate to go on.
Let me just take up what Senator Bolkus said a moment ago about the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975. The Australian Heritage Commission was established in the wake of the flooding of Lake Pedder in 1972. There was a national parliamentary inquiry into that disaster by the then Whitlam government in 1974. That inquiry found that never again should the Commonwealth be in the position of not intervening on the loss of heritage of national significance, that such places ought to be listed and that there ought to be a facility for warning the federal government when such heritage, be it natural heritage or cultural heritage, was at risk. As a result of that, the Australian Heritage Commission was established in 1975.
The commission has had a major role in the defence of Australia's environment since then, even though in the last decade successive governments have tried to wind down its influence and power. I am very well aware that the Heritage Commission was central to the saving of the Franklin River. The Australian Democrats claim a role in that but their role pales into insignificance when compared with the active role of the Australian Heritage Commission at the time. In fact, the Australian Heritage Commission was so active at that stage in alerting politicians and the public to the threats to the Franklin River that no doubt 
 in the collective political memory that was a reason for it being put under strangulating political repression in the years that have followed.
The legislation that the Democrats and the government are railroading through the chamber today—we will get back onto that later at the committee stage—effectively gets rid of the Australian Heritage Commission and its relevance. But the agreement between the states and the Commonwealth has been that, instead of having the Heritage Commission, there be a joint arrangement. Let me outline how that arrangement would go. Following the meeting of the Council of Australian Government heads in 1997—that is, the state and federal heads—there was an agreement for the Commonwealth and state heritage ministers to develop a cooperative national heritage strategy. Let me interpret that. The arrangement was to get rid of the functions of the Australian Heritage Commission and replace it with ecowaffle—a passing of the buck between Commonwealth and state heritage ministers—which was going to do nothing in particular to protect heritage in the way the 1975 establishment of the Australian Heritage Commission was meant to do.
The government's environment reform 1998 consultation paper proposed the introduction of a new heritage protection law following the environment bill which the Democrats are pushing through this place today at the behest of the government. This new heritage bill would be the replacement, essentially, for the Australian Heritage Commission and its past good works. But we do not have such a bill. Here we have legislation effectively getting rid of the Australian Heritage Commission on the promise that there will be a Commonwealth-state arrangement to replace it, but there is no replacement. We have a vacuum of that function. It has been abolished. We are back to the flooding of Lake Pedder, thanks to the Democrats supporting the government on this matter.
We are being asked to support what is called a consequential bill which is nothing of the sort. It is a bill to abolish the Australian Heritage Commission's powers and replace them with nothing at all. I will not be part of 
 that. The Democrats, of course, will be, because they do not even understand what is in this consequential bill. They are more interested in their moment of power at the Howard table of power. They are more interested in selling out any environmental principle that will get in the way of them keeping that seat at the table. They are more interested in trying to put a gloss on the environmental disaster that they are delivering through this parliament to the people of Australia in these terrible days for the environment. If an arrangement has been made between the states and the Commonwealth to look after matters of national heritage importance—if this cooperative national strategy has been established—I ask Senator Woodley, who is the only Democrat in the chamber, to get up and explain what it is.
—You are the only Green.
—Senator Abetz intervenes from the other side of the chamber, but he does not know either. We could ask him to get up and explain this alternative that we are supposed to accept as coming into place which is not mentioned anywhere in the bill. It is a wing and a prayer, or at least a promise that we are supposed to accept coming from the chainsaw driven offices of the minister for the environment or, as we now have it, the subservient hand on the chainsaw gang of Democrat senators who have sold out so comprehensively on the environment these last few days. I know that no Democrat will explain to the Senate what they are doing, for the simple reason that they do not know. They have abrogated their policies; they have dumped their policies. In the vacuum that that leaves, they are simply reliant on Howard government environmental policies. That is the measure of their strength of commitment to the environment these days.
The Democrats are prepared to guillotine this bill but they do not have the foggiest about how to explain why we should be voting for a situation where the Australian Heritage Commission goes west and the promised replacement is nowhere to be seen. We are in this extraordinary situation on another matter—biological control. We are being asked to deal with legislation which 
 gets rid of the effects of the Biological Control Act 1984 because they are no longer appropriate, but we have not yet dealt with those amendments to the environment protection bill. We have this extraordinary situation, this remarkable failure of process by the Democrats. There is not even a Democrat adviser in the place. They have fled altogether to try to work out what this bill is about, because they were not ready for it.
They were depending on the so-called environment protection bill—I would call it the environment wreckage bill—being passed. It has not been passed because they have been outmanoeuvred this afternoon by the people on this side of the chamber. The guillotine was not dropped on debate on that important environment legislation at 5 o'clock because, despite the combined brains of the government and the Democrats, they still did not see what was coming and they were outmanoeuvred. That outmanoeuvring means that the environment protection bill has not gone through. We do not know what the outcome is going to be, but here are the Democrats asking us to abolish the biological control provisions which the Commonwealth currently has in place. They have not replaced them with anything. They talk about how they want biodiversity protected in this country, but they are getting rid of control mechanisms and so far they have put nothing else in their place.
That is why they are such environmental puppies. As I said yesterday, they have rushed around the room barking at everybody and then jumped onto the first lap available. They are political poodles. Of course, the first lap available was Senator Hill's. Last week on the GST it was the Prime Minister's, with room also on Mr Costello's. But the Democrats do not know what they are doing, except for this: they do know that there is an open door at the end of the green carpeted corridor, on the occasions when it suits the government, where they can sit and feel important. And they will trash any policy to keep that door open and they have trashed many a policy in the last few days. We have this extraordinary situation where, having got rid of protection mechanisms which have been developed over recent 
 decades, as of this moment they have nothing to replace them with.
We do not know whether or not the amendments to the environment protection bill are going to go through. We have no way of knowing that. It would be quite irresponsible of us to deal with this so-called consequential bill which abolishes the existing protection for the environment until we know what is going to happen with the major bill, which the Democrats are supporting the government to get through. That is the extraordinary tangle we have got into. Maybe it is worth recalling that time-honoured quote:
Oh what a tangled web we weave when first we practise to deceive.
The Democrats have practised to deceive those people who voted for them—the environmentalists; a million Australians who thought that they would stand by the environment; people all across this country who thought that the Democrats' record would be good. Can you imagine what would have happened to the Democrats if their sell out over the last fortnight on their social and environmental principles had been known to the electorate last October? They would have been decimated. I have to admit to being one of the millions of Australians who is gobsmacked by the way in which they have dropped every founding principle of the party to get to the table of power. That is what they have done, but I am not going to be one who supports this piece of legislation and leaves a vacuum. There may be a vacuum of Democrat policy; there is now a vacuum of Democrat principle.
There is now a failure to understand the almighty consequences of what they have done by Senator Lees, Senator Stott Despoja, Senator Bourne from New South Wales, Senator Woodley and Senator Bartlett from Queensland, and Senator Murray from Western Australia. There is a vacuum of appreciation of what they have done, but they are sticking with it because they want to be counted as one of the big players. As one of those senators said to a business lunch, as reported in the national media a couple of weeks ago, they are flushed not only with the new sense of power but also with the prospect 
 now of getting some of the kick-backs—that is, donations—that come from the corporate sector when you do the right thing, as far as vested interests are concerned in this place. The Democrats are moving from being a party of the people and the environment to being creatures of the big end of town. That is what this is all about.
However, when such revolutions in process occur, there are glitches and one is occurring right now. I note that Senator Lees has come into the chamber and therefore I expect that we are going to have a clearing of the air by Senator Lees as to what has happened to the Australian Heritage Commission's powers; why there is no replacement; and why she is asking the Senate to effectively abolish the powers of the Australian Heritage Commission and replace them with nothing else at this particular juncture on this Wednesday afternoon in June 1999.",SENATE,<title>ENVIRONMENTAL REFORM (CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL 1998 [1999]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,7,1
"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,1999-06-23,"—We have just listened for about 20 minutes to an assault on the Australian Democrats by the sole Tasmanian Green in this chamber. The reason that he had to devote all that time to assaulting the Australian Democrats is that it is quite clear he has not read the bill. He has not considered its provisions so he has embarked on an attack of the Democrats. But I would just kindly remind him that, on page 11 of the explanatory memorandum, he might find some of the answers to the questions that he posed in a rhetorical way. If he had spent more time studying the legislation and the explanatory memorandum, he might have been in a position of not having to devote so much of his 20 minutes to a wholesale assault on the Australian Democrats.
The bill that we are considering is the  Environmental Reform (Consequential Provisions) Bill 1998 [1999] . This bill continues the process of Commonwealth environmental legislation. Labor and the Greens used to talk big about the environment, but they failed to deliver. What they cannot abide is the fact that, since the Howard government was elected, there has been a program of environmental reform in this country not witnessed 
 before. Of course, the Natural Heritage Trust is one of the examples of environmental reform in this country. It has delivered millions of dollars for repair to the environment—a project never thought of by Labor or the Greens but one that we were able to do because we were willing to forgo the public ownership of Telstra to ensure that something more important remained within our grasp; that is, the environment of this country. So the Natural Heritage Trust is part of our environment reform program, as is the Green Corps—a fantastic program that has delivered environmental repair throughout the breadth of this nation.
But has Senator Brown acknowledged the wonderful work of the Natural Heritage Trust? Does he acknowledge the wonderful work of all those volunteers in the Green Corps, who actually do something for the environment? Absolutely not. Senator Brown locks himself away in his rooms and dreams up these speeches. I have to say that I think the dreaming has lapsed somewhat of late because it is the same speech repeated time and time again. It is becoming a bit boring. All we ever get to hear about is a chainsaw. In fact, he is starting to sound like a chainsaw—that repetitive buzz and the noise do not make much sense, except in Senator Brown's mind; most of his contributions these days are not to build up but to destroy.
We have the Natural Heritage Trust and we have the Green Corps program. What else have we done for the environment? We have the wonderful Regional Forest Agreement that, for the first time in this country's history, has balanced conservation and the needs of the forest communities who get a living from the forests. Let us not forget that what we harvest from the forests is in fact a renewable resource. If you do not have the timber harvesting, what do you have? I suppose you have mining for building products instead—products which are not renewable. So the timber industry is vital.
—You still have mining products for building that are not renewable, but you need them.
—Sorry, Senator Murphy? You are not making sense again—a bit like 
 your contributions with Premier Jim Bacon. The regional forest agreements have been another wonderful example of this federal government getting to terms with the environmental problems of this nation and making a contribution in a way that will have lasting benefit. On top of that wonderful record, we now have this legislation and the bill that was just before us.
This bill has three primary objectives. Firstly, it will provide for the repeal of the five acts to be replaced by the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998 [1999] . Those acts are: the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974; the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975; the Whale Protection Act 1980; the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act 1983; and the Endangered Species Protection Act 1992. It makes sense to have this reform of environmental legislation. Secondly, the bill puts in place savings and arrangements for a smooth transition from the processes that are in place under the existing acts, including environmental assessment and permitting arrangements to the new schemes established under the  Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998 [1999] .
Thirdly, the bill also amends Commonwealth government legislation that is affected either by the repeal of the five acts or by the content of the proposed  Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998 [1999] . This bill, together with the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Bill 1998, provides a new environmental law regime which enables the Commonwealth to join with the states in providing a truly national scheme of environmental protection and biodiversity conservation, recognising our responsibility to not only this but also future generations.
What this legislation is about is trying to ensure that we as a federation cooperate with the states on environmental issues, rather than taking the sledgehammer approach like Senator Brown, who could not win the debates in his home state of Tasmania and therefore had to seek federal intervention to win them. We say that, instead of having that `them and us' approach to environmental 
 issues, it makes a lot more sense to cooperate with the states and ensure that we are able to work in a responsible, user-friendly way to deliver benefits to the environment and, as a result, to future generations.
—Order! The time allotted for the debate has expired. I therefore put the question that the bill now be read a second time.

	 Example 2:	 An action of a particular kind may have a global impact over an indefinite period of time.
	 (3)	 The intensity of the impact of an action includes, but is not limited to, consideration of:
		 (a)	 the degree to which the proposed action affects:
			 (i)	 public health or safety; or
			 (ii)	 unique characteristics of the geographic area, such as proximity to historic or cultural resources, parklands, farmlands, wetlands, wild and scenic rivers or ecologically critical areas; or

			 (i)	 are, or are likely to be, controversial; or
			 (ii)	 are, or are likely to be, uncertain; or
			 (iii)	 involve, or are likely to involve, known or unknown risks; or
		 (c)	 the degree to which the action may establish a precedent for future actions;
		 (d)	 whether the action is related to other actions which, individually, may be insignificant but which, when taken together, may have a significant impact;
		 (e)	 whether the action is likely to result in a breach of any law of the Commonwealth, of a State or Territory or of a local government authority for the protection of the environment.

The running sheet that we have is the running sheet that was left over when we terminated the debate after the famous speech by Senator Harradine in which he said he could not bring himself to support the government's legislation. That is the running sheet before us.
One reads in the press that a deal has been done between the Australian Democrats and the government to alter the tax package considerably. That deal substantially changes the nature of the proposition that we had before us. We did not see the amendments that give legislative voice to that deal until late last night. We saw one of them then and some have dribbled out during the day. We did not receive an explanatory memorandum until quite late in the day. There are 119 of these amendments—so it is not an insubstantial number—and we have no proposal as to how they should be dealt with in this chamber. I would have thought that that was a matter of considerable importance in terms of parliamentary procedure.
Before we move to motions about how we will conduct a parliamentary debate on the Democrat-government GST deal, we are, I am sure, reasonably entitled to have some explanation by either the government or, if they are too afraid of making it, the Australian Democrats as to what the proposition is. We remember the Prime Minister saying, when asked whether he would remove food from the GST—and these were his words—`No, no, no, no, no.' Apparently, he has agreed to do so, but what explanation has been afforded to this legislative chamber, the Australian Senate, as to what the package is now? There has been no explanation. All we have had is the parliamentary secretary moving a motion about procedure so he can knock off things that this chamber has decided to do previously in this debate. There has been no explanation at all as to the substance of the matter. This is a contemptuous attitude towards the powers of the Senate.
I would be disappointed if the Democrats supported this procedure without there being any explanation to the chamber. If there is one thing the Democrats are famous for it is for insisting, in speech after speech, year in, year out, in every parliamentary sitting that I have sat through for the last 16 years, that this chamber should be afforded the opportunity of greater and proper scrutiny. In fact, Meg Lees's second reading speech to this chamber chided the government for not allowing proper parliamentary scrutiny in the time allotted to this debate in the chamber.
Are the Democrats going to be compliant in ramming a procedural motion down our throat in the absence of any explanation at all? Are they going to repudiate years of so-called Democrat principle that this chamber is entitled to scrutiny and explanation? What sort of complacency do we expect from a government that has done this deal and, in effect, says to us in this chamber, `Read about it in the paper. We just want to move on. And, by the way, we haven't got a running sheet and, by the way, we don't know whether all of the amendments are before us yet and, by the way, we're not going to tell you a damn thing about it'?
—Calm down.
—No, you calm down, parliamentary secretary. You are the perpetrator of this. Is that your idea of parliamentary democracy? This motion should be withdrawn by the government. An explanation should be given and we should proceed on this in an orderly fashion. If this is going to be the government's attitude to this debate, it will be a very rancorous debate, because this is an abuse of power. This is a conscription of the Democrats to the will of the executive and a standing over of the rights of this chamber. The motion should be defeated.",SENATE,<title>STANDING ORDER 118(2)</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,12,1
"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,1999-06-23,"—I will not delay the chamber for very long. I cannot anyway: I only get five minutes. Senator Cook is right. I think the Manager of Government Business in the Senate has assumed that everyone knows the reasons for his moving the motion. I think he should have at least outlined them. Apart from an explanation, we probably should have 
 had an apology. What this motion does, in effect, is say, `I'm sorry we have wasted the parliament's time by going through the committee stage for 40 hours or so.' Senator Campbell indicated today, in an earlier burst of rhetoric, that we have spent 40 hours or so on the committee stage of the bill. The effect of this motion is to scrap it all.
Technically, this motion is probably required because, in order to consummate the deal between the government and the Democrats, the government virtually have to move the same amendments as the Democrats moved and absorb them as their own, and standing orders do not allow that to occur. Senator Campbell could have explained that to us. He could have said, `I'm sorry for wasting the committee's time for 44½ hours. We misjudged our negotiating stance. We put all our eggs in Senator Harradine's basket. The moment that fell through, we had to run and cut a deal with the Democrats and agree to amendments that we had already crushed, defeated, in this chamber.' That is, I believe, the effect of all this.
Senator Cook is right: the manager should have given us a more adequate explanation. What we will see happening over the next four days is the government supporting concepts and amendments that it had previously indicated it would oppose in this chamber. Of course, that is a humiliating backflip for the government. Nevertheless, it is a course it has chosen. I am not sure whether we were given notice of this procedural motion. Maybe when he sums up the debate the manager will indicate whether he notified us of this motion in advance.
—We gave notice of it. It is a contingent notice.
—It is a contingent notice of motion. I had heard that a contingent notice of motion had been put in, Senator Campbell. I admit at this stage that I had not read it. In summary, it is not just an explanation that we require. Senator Campbell should fess up and admit that this is necessary because of the dramatic change of course with the negotiations with the Democrats. We might then be able to proceed to a vote on it. I am not sure the opposition would seek to 
 divide on this matter. I will seek the guidance of others. Nevertheless, a better and more adequate explanation of this matter may have facilitated the time of the chamber.",SENATE,<title>STANDING ORDER 118(2)</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,12,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1999-06-23,"—I think the points have been made by the opposition in so far as the inadequacies of the explanation given for the proposal that has been put forward by way of a contingent notice of motion. I think we need to appreciate that there may well be a majority in the chamber for this proposition because I would not have expected Senator Campbell to have put it forward, with such obvious slight regard for explanation, if he did not think there were sufficient numbers to support it. Given the events of today and that there has obviously been support given by a majority of senators to the government in proceeding these questions, I do think it is important to get some questions drawn to the attention of the Senate. It was only recently that Senator Lees lectured the Senate on their approach in their relationship with this government.
I recall, for instance, that just last year she said that she thought the government's:
. . . contempt for parliament does not stop with the bullying of the Speaker by Messrs Howard and Mr Reith. It runs far deeper than that.
She then indicated that, on the question of the government's approach to parliamentary processes:
The very same bullying tactics adopted by the Prime Minister against his own Speaker are regularly employed to downgrade the status and powers of the Senate.
She went on to indicate a number of examples and particularly indicated her concern about attempts to pre-empt the decisions of the Senate in a number of ways. I think that what has occurred in recent times on this issue highlights the action now being taken up. There are none so zealous as those who have been converted to a position and we will no doubt be able to demonstrate that over the coming four days. I am reminded that it was Senator Lees who said that:
It is no secret that this thuggish government—and I stress the word thuggish because that is what it is—has set it sights on the independence of the Senate, the body described the former Auditor- 
 General John Taylor as the last effective brake on executive government.
She then went on to say that:
This government has shown far greater contempt for this parliament than any government in memory. Democracy and the people of Australia are the losers if this government with its born-to-rule mentality succeeds in avoiding the checks and balances provided by the parliament. Australia will not be served by a parliament that cannot hold the government to account, that does not provide a balanced and fair forum for debate on day-to-day issues, that does not provide a pressure valve for the public to actually have a say to express its views on government proposals that are either plainly wrong or unpopular.
I would have thought those sentiments apply quite directly to the proposition before us today and of course apply in general to the questions that are being raised about the unanswered and unexplained nature of the arrangements entered into between this government and the Australian Democrats on the GST. I think and I would hope that Senator Campbell might have learnt something from the experience of today and would seek to explain to this chamber, in a great deal more depth and clarity, what the government is seeking to achieve and the reasons for it. On the basis of the actions that we have seen, it is quite apparent that this government is most anxious to avoid scrutiny, as are the Democrats.
They are anxious to avoid being held accountable for the arrangements that they have made, which will have far-reaching consequences for many hundreds of thousands of Australians in areas that in past the Democrats were said have represented. I speak specifically of those people with whom I am in close contact, particularly those concerned with educational issues. I say to the Manager of Government Business in the Senate that it would be appropriate to explain what he is intending to do on these measures and it would be appropriate for the Democrats to come clean on the nature of the arrangements that they have made to impose upon this country a most unpopular and unwarranted GST.",SENATE,<title>STANDING ORDER 118(2)</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,12,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-06-23,"—by 
 leave—I thought that this was a fairly simple proposition. I gave what I thought was a quite clear explanation on it. In plain English, it means that under standing orders 118(2), if the Senate has made a decision about an amendment, you cannot revisit that amendment in the same debate. I think that rule applies generally to most meetings and meeting procedures throughout the world, not only in the Senate. We are seeking to suspend that. I gave notice of it some time ago so that the whole world, including all senators, would know about it. In fact, if those honourable senators who are interested turn to page 28 of today's Notice Paper , they will see that the proposition that we are dealing with is clearly set out on that page.
I make this point because I have been asked to go into more detail. I have said in plain English that this effectively means that you can re-put an amendment that has been voted on that is the same or substantially the same and have it voted on again. I am reliably told that the one matter this specifically and definitely applies to—and there are some amendments that are similar and so it may apply to those—is an amendment in relation to acupuncture. The whole debate we are having now is potentially related to just one amendment in relation to acupuncture. I suspect those people who find relief from stress in acupuncture could do with a bit after a day like today in the Senate.
I do not know whether that answer will satisfy the opposition or any other senators, but that explains why we are doing it. Quite clearly, we need to revisit the acupuncture amendment and of course some others, and this gives the Senate the power to do that. I do not think that giving a contingent notice, having it published in the Notice Paper to be brought on when the bill comes back on, is any sort of hijacking; it is certainly not meant to be. The reason you give notice of things and bring them on at the appropriate time is so that no ambushes can take place, and I certainly did not seek to do that at all.",SENATE,<title>STANDING ORDER 118(2)</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,12,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-06-23,"—by leave—I seek to put a question to the parliamentary secretary 
 which might expedite this matter. I would like to also direct it to Senator Murray, representing the Australian Democrats. The question is: does the government or the Australian Democrats, or do both of them conjointly, propose to make an explanation to the Senate as to what they have now done and how they intend to proceed in terms of the changes they have made? I ask the question because these are substantive changes. This is not anything like the same bill we were considering before. In the normal course there would be a second reading speech to at least make an explanation about the global changes that are being made. We would have a chance, at least, to respond to that and have a process that we are well attuned to in order to conduct the proper processes of scrutiny. But just to assume that we resume as if nothing has happened and that we understand everything that occurs off-stage, out of this chamber, through the media is, I think, somewhat contemptuous. I just ask the question: is it intended that an appropriate explanation will be made to the Senate as to why these measures, in which we clothe the Senate with the power to expunge decisions that it has already made, are being sought? What are the government and the Democrats attempting to do?",SENATE,<title>STANDING ORDER 118(2)</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,12,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-06-23,"—by leave—There are three points I would make. Firstly, this motion before the chair at the moment does not seek to expunge decisions; it just gives the Senate the power to make a decision. It basically suspends 118(2), which would otherwise not allow us to make a new decision. Secondly, I have in my right hand at least one, if not more, explanatory memoranda, which I will table as soon as we get into committee. I am not allowed to do it before then. There is a detailed explanatory memorandum going around. I think the running sheet has already been distributed. I am not sure if it has got across to that side of the chamber.
—It looks like the old running sheet, not a new running sheet.
—Can we get a copy of that?
—I will table that. I now formally table the regulation impact statement and supplementary explanatory memoranda—six of them, I think—relating to the government amendments and requests for amendments to be moved to certain bills contained in this package. The regulation impact statement and supplementary explanatory memoranda were, indeed, circulated in the chamber on 22 and 23 June. I am also assured by the Assistant Treasurer, who will have carriage of the bills—I am only carrying these procedural matters—and whom I trust implicitly and have enormous respect for, that he will give, in his normal style, an eloquent explanation which I am fairly certain will satisfy you. I think Senator Cook is looking for an explanation of what is occurring. I am assured by the Assistant Treasurer that, when we actually do get into the committee stage, he would like to open the batting, kick off—or any other analogy—with a thorough explanation of what Senator Cook has been looking for. I foreshadow that if Senator Cook is not happy with that explanation, he would cross-examine.",SENATE,<title>STANDING ORDER 118(2)</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,12,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1999-06-23,"—by leave—I wish to ask a further question. The Manager of Government Business in the Senate has indicated, in response to an earlier question from Senator Cook, that the issue that you were concerned about—recommittal—was in relation to acupuncture and other matters.
—It is not recommittal.
—The issues you said would be affected by this proposition went to the question of acupuncture and other matters. Could I ask what those other matters are so that we can have a list of the issues that actually would be affected by this proposition?",SENATE,<title>STANDING ORDER 118(2)</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,12,1
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-06-23,"—by leave—I was quite precise about it. We are certain that 118(2) needs to be suspended to deal with acupuncture because the amendment that is in the new group of amendments tabled 
 last night is identical, I understand, to the amendment moved during the committee stage previously. There are similar amendments in relation to food. Whether or not 118(2) needs to be suspended to deal with the food amendments is a matter of fine judgment, but it is better to suspend 118(2). You could argue for years to figure out whether or not you need to suspend it.
Specifically to Senator Carr, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, acupuncture is the matter that we are definitely dealing with and, of course, other amendments dealing with food, where there were similar amendments dealt with in the committee stage. The point can also be made—and I do not make it frivolously—that, I understand, having read the papers, there may be the Australian Labor Party's proposed tactic to re-put some of the Democrat amendments or to put some of the Democrat amendments—
—This is to help us!
—We never thought of that.
—No, it is to help the whole Senate. We understand that you would not be able to do that unless we did this. We are not trying to tell you to support this for your own good. We think it would aid the consideration of this legislation in the interests of all senators and, most importantly, in the interests of all of our fellow citizens.",SENATE,<title>STANDING ORDER 118(2)</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,12,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-06-23,"—by leave—I wish to clarify my earlier question. My question was to the coalition, which the parliamentary secretary has been kind enough to answer. But it was also to the Australian Democrats, and I wonder if they would be kind enough to answer?",SENATE,<title>STANDING ORDER 118(2)</title>,<title>Suspension of Standing Orders</title>,Miscellaneous,12,1
"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-06-23,"—I am sorry, Senator Cook. I was engaged in conversation with one of your colleagues and I missed much of what you said, but I think you were asking me about the proposition that was being put to you. Is that correct?
—No, I was asking you whether you are going to make some explanation about the changes that are proposed.
—I think our view of that would be—and I think Senator Campbell has given you the signal—that much of what is being proposed is in line with what has been previously proposed. The Senate is aware and the public at large who voted for the Democrats are aware that the Democrats always had a position that if we could change the bills towards our view of them, then we would support them. For instance, let us start with income tax cuts. We believed in income tax cuts but not in the manner that they were outlined by government. So you are substantially dealing with the same issue; it is just in a different shape. With respect to the goods and services tax, we believed in a goods and services tax but not in the shape laid out by government. What you have is the same policy result but with a different outcome in terms of the items which are taxable and not taxable.
If you refer to the social area, we agreed that it was necessary to improve pensions, allowances, social security benefits and so on, but that the improvements were insufficient. Those have been increased, so you are dealing with the same issue but a different set of numbers. On Commonwealth-state financial relations, we believed that those did need to be reformed in the manner that the government intended, but the consequence is that some items have been left in and out. None of these matters that I am outlining to you, Senator Cook, are insubstantial—and I think that is your point. They are substantial and they matter. But they fall within the intent that the government had originally put to the people. I think the clue for you—and I looked up 118(2)—is in the nature of the parliamentary secretary's—
—Order, Senator Murray. The time for the debate has elapsed.
—May I take another minute by leave?
Leave granted.
—I was going to say that 118(2) says:
No new clause or amendment shall be proposed which is substantially the same as one already negatived by the committee . . .
In other words, we agree that most of what is being done with respect to a number of the amendments is substantially the same as what we dealt with before. That is why we believe it is a continuation of the debate.
—The question is that the motion moved by the parliament secretary, Senator Campbell, be agreed to.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-06-23,"—Following the debate we have just had, Senator Cook wanted the government to give an overview of where it intends to proceed from here on out. I thought that, prior to getting into the detail of the amendments and concluding the amendment which is now before the chair, I would make a short statement which provided an overview of what is now intended.
Following yesterday's final agreement between the government and the Australian Democrats, the government will now move forward with the legislation to reform the Australian tax system. I welcome the involvement of the Democrats in the tax reform, which we believe and which they believe is in Australia's national interest. In contrast, of course, Labor does have a policy vacuum on tax reform. I think that has been well revealed during the debate so far.
I can inform the Senate that the government will be proceeding with all key elements of its tax reform package. A 10 per cent GST will be introduced from 1 July 2000, with basic food to be GST free. Personal income tax cuts targeted at low and middle income earners will be maintained. This means that the government will keep its commitment to ensure that over 80 per cent of taxpayers face a marginal tax rate of only 30 per cent. There will be some paring back of the proposed tax cuts for taxpayers earning over $50,000 per 
 annum, but significant benefits are retained. In addition to the tax cuts, generous compensation for the introduction of the GST through improved family assistance and the social security benefits will be enhanced.
The government has agreed to some changes in the GST and the diesel excise reforms. These have been well publicised over recent days. Reforms to diesel will proceed and legislation was introduced yesterday in the other place to enhance the existing diesel fuel rebate scheme and to establish a new diesel and alternative fuel grants scheme for on-road fuels. As a result of the benefits being delivered through a grants scheme, diesel credits will be taken out of the GST system.
The government has circulated amendments arising out of discussions with the Democrats, clarifying how the GST will apply to food, health, education and the financial services sector. I will not, obviously, in the interests of time go through all of the amendments, as we will have an opportunity to debate them. However, I will point out the following.
As a result of food being GST free, most food items will fall in price. The legislation provides that food for human consumption will be GST free, except for (1) savoury snacks, confectionery, ice-cream, biscuits and certain beverages currently subject to wholesale sales tax; (2) bakery products other than bread; and (3) prepared food, including take-away foods and food supplied by restaurants.
The health amendments include the following. Products on schedule 2 and the standard for the uniform scheduling of drugs and poisons will be GST free, including smaller packs of pain relievers identical to schedule 2 products. Under this amendment, over-the-counter pain relievers will be GST free. The range of health professionals who may provide GST-free health services will be expanded to include appropriately qualified naturopaths, acupuncturists and herbalists. Certain public health goods will also be GST free, by way of ministerial determination—subject to the approval of the ministerial council. Initially, the government will seek the inclusion of sunscreens, folate supplements, condoms and personal lubricants as GST-free public health goods. 
The education amendments include the following. Adult and community education courses likely to develop employment related skills will be GST free. First-aid or life-saving courses offered by non-profit bodies will be GST free. To address concerns raised concerning compliance costs of school based organisations, school tuckshops will be given an option to be input taxed.
With respect to financial services, the government has agreed to allow partial input tax credits to purchasers of a specified list of services used by enterprises making financial supplies. This measure will particularly benefit smaller organisations in the financial sector, such as credit unions, which operate with a large range of outsourced activities.
Other amendments put in place are increased compensation measures, enhanced family assistance arrangements and changes to the income tax scales. Madam President, that gives a brief summary of the changes which the government proposes, and we believe that—
—On a point of order, Minister, I am not Madam President.
—Oh sorry! I must wear my glasses, Senator. Thank you for drawing your gender to my attention. Chair, can I say that the government welcome the discussions that we had with the Democrats. We believe that they have been conducted in an extremely fair fashion. Obviously in certain areas the government and the Democrats have differed, but we believe now that the package which has emerged from these discussions and resulted from the amendments will deliver real tax reform to the Australian community. We urge the Senate to ensure the speedy passage of the legislation and the bills which are before it.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (INDIRECT TAX ADMINISTRATION) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,14,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-06-23,"—I have to say that the opposition participates in this debate under protest. We are being guillotined and required to complete the debate within the hour set by this chamber in a collusion between the Australian Democrats and the coalition. It is the government's bill but a bill which has 
 been substantially altered to suit Democrat convenience, because of the principled position of Senator Harradine.
We know that the government sought to persuade Senator Harradine to vote for the original package. It was only after Senator Harradine made what by now must be a famous speech—the `I cannot' speech—that the government knew for certain that it did not have the numbers to allow its legislation to pass in this chamber. As a consequence of that, as the opportunists that they have now been revealed to be, the Australian Democrats proceeded to `negotiate with' as they call it—but by any other standards it would be `sell out to'—the government on a range of tax measures that we now have fetched up on our shore for debate this evening.
We participate under protest because there is a straitjacket on this debate. We participate under protest because a guillotine has been introduced. We participate under protest because the amendments that give voice to the changes that have been agreed between the Australian Democrats and the government have not been given to us with sufficient notice. I note in passing that the committee stage of this debate was delayed for a day or two so that the Democrats could get ready, even though they had had significant notice, as we had had, of the changes that the government had proposed—some 218 changes, at that stage.
No such courtesy is extended to us on this occasion. The fact that the Democrats have had prior notice of the amendments and that they and the government circularised the press gallery last night before releasing those amendments to the opposition for scrutiny does indicate not only a degree of concern about news management—so that proper scrutiny can be avoided and the government's and Democrats' preferred spin can be imparted on these amendments—but also a contempt for this chamber and the processes of this chamber, in that the amendments were given to the press before they were given to honourable senators. They were held back until late in the piece—and then not all of them—and now there are 119 of them. And now the explanatory memorandum dribbles out late at 
 this stage, so that when this debate kicks off there is not even the dignity of this chamber having a running sheet before it. The running sheet is distributed—
—I rise on a point of order, Mr Temporary Chairman. I am sure that Senator Cook is not intentionally misleading the parliament but I should advise you that I only received a copy of the food amendment, which is the one that you were referring to, at 20 past 10 last night and so I certainly did not receive it in advance nor circulate it in advance.
—That is not a point of order, Mr Temporary Chairman, and I hope you will rule it out of order.
—There is no point of order. It is a point of information.
—Let me then rephrase that to actually get it accurate. What the media in this place was telling us and everyone else—and they reported it, in fact, this morning—was that the Democrat party room pored over the amendments and ticked them off finally. Maybe then the formal amendments were generated, and so you are technically right, Senator. But I have to say that you will excuse me if there is a fair degree of cynicism that you did not know what the amendments would contain until 10.20 last night. We certainly did not. I accept your acknowledgment now that you did. And that was indeed my point.
The point is: for proper debate and scrutiny in this chamber, polite and reasonable notice should be extended. That is a principle the Democrats have insisted on and it is a principle that we have tried to acknowledge and accommodate, but it is not extended to us on this occasion and that is why, under protest, we participate in the early bringing on of these bills in this manner. I think it is ludicrous to expect that we are in a position to respond properly and appropriately in all of the circumstances, given the shortage of notice, the inadequate supply of information and the conspiracy that has been entered into to put the favourable spin by the government on the legislation.
I am not alone in saying those things. This morning at the Park Hyatt in Melbourne, at a small business breakfast, the Premier of Victoria, Jeffrey Kennett, went on to say how sad it is that this legislation is coming forward and how sad it is that it has changed all the things he believed the coalition—and he is a leader of a state branch of the principal party—stood for. He made a very powerful speech which I recommend the Democrats read, because this is the beginning of the Howard alibi.
If these changes are made—and I suspect they will be, as I apprehend the numbers in the chamber to do so—and if the compliance cost difficulties start to bite, as they will, and if the unintended consequences that always emerge in rushed legislation begin to surface, this government will disown the Australian Democrats at a speed of a million miles an hour. They will hang the albatross of `It is the Democrats' legislation, not ours' around their neck. Jeffrey Kennett started the process this morning by saying, `Blame the Democrats for all of these changes. Blame the Democrats for the increase in compliance costs. Blame the Democrats for the confusion and for not having a wide enough tax base. Blame the Democrats for the problems that we in the states will experience if this legislation goes through.' That only echoes what Mr Howard has said.
But I make that point in passing because the more devastating criticism has been made by Professor Peter Dixon from the Monash Centre of Economic Studies. He put out a paper yesterday in which he made the obvious point: what is the information base upon which this ill-gotten conglomeration of changes is being made? Do we know the economic impact of this new series of changes? Do we know whether it has been modelled? Is that information available? Are we being asked to legislate blindfolded as to the impacts? The Democrats, and I think rightly, take some pride in causing in this chamber a majority viewpoint about an inquiry into the GST. That was a valuable inquiry, and that has been acknowledged by all parties, except by a reluctant government burdened by the penetration of some real insight into the 
 clouded myopia of propaganda that they had spread about their ANTS package. Everyone else welcomed it.
But what do we know about the economic implications of this in the public domain? We have not been told anything. No modelling has been set out. No macro-economic parameters have been published. What is the impact on employment? What is the impact on growth? What is the impact on our trade balance? What is the impact on people on low and middle incomes? Nothing. Silence. Do the Democrats step forward to enlighten us? No, they do not. The big advocates of proper scrutiny are silent on this point, absent without leave from the field.
I make those observations because Professor Dixon goes on to find, on reasonable research available to him and on papers and studies published between now and when the last study was done, that the impact of this set of changes will be adverse to the national economy, unemployment will increase and there will be slower growth.
—What absolute rubbish!
—Why don't you shut up! You'll get your chance in a moment.
—Order! Senator Cook, withdraw.
—I withdraw. Mr Chairman, would you bring the minister to order and do your duty in the chair as well. Will you do that, Mr Chairman? If we're going to have a debate on this, let us do it properly.
—Order, it being 7.20 p.m., I will report progress to the Senate.
—Yes. Do your job, Grant. Don't bloody well call me to order!
—Order! Withdraw that.

"O'Brien, Sen Kerry",ALP,1999-06-23,"—On 31 May I received a pack of information from the Australian National Audit Office. The covering letter told me that the pack contained a discussion paper on the principles of corporate governance as they apply to Commonwealth authorities and Commonwealth companies, and it makes very interesting reading. It states that the definitions of corporate governance are many and varied, but there are some key elements and they are: the transparency of corporate structures and operations; the implementation of effective risk management and internal control systems; and the accountability of the board to stakeholders through clear and timely disclosure. And, of course, Commonwealth authorities and companies are accountable to parliament.
The ANAO paper also states that `the board can only fulfil its responsibilities if it meets regularly and collectively with clear agendas and records decisions and outcomes'. I might add these are basic rules that one would expect from the local sporting club, let alone a Commonwealth authority or company. One would certainly expect these processes to apply to the board of any statutory authority. The discussion paper specifically goes to the operation of boards. It also states that `the effectiveness of board meetings is dependent on carefully planned agendas and providing board papers and materials to directors sufficiently prior to board meetings' and that `it is important that minutes accurately record outcomes from meetings'. Again, this sounds basic, but it is also very important.
In relation to a corporate code of conducts for boards, the ANAO paper states:
The board and senior management are responsible for promoting high ethics and integrity standards.
It also says:
The language, attitudes and actions of directors and senior management affect the integrity, ethics, values and other aspects of corporate culture.
The reason for my interest in this paper and my heightened interest in corporate governance relates to recent estimates hearings of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee—specifically, the evidence given to that committee by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority.
There are two issues flowing from those hearings that I wish to address. They are: the circumstances surrounding the appointment of a member of that board to a senior management position within that organisation; and also the manner in which the Civil Aviation Safety Authority board conducts its business. When both of these matters are considered against the standards outlined by the Auditor-General, Mr Barrett, I believe there is significant reason for concern. In fact, the evidence given during those hearings in relation to both these matters may require further investigation by the Senate and certainly requires urgent action by the minister, Mr Anderson.
Over the past couple of years the structure of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority has gone through a number of changes. The explanation for this probably lies in the instability in both the board and senior management over that period. The current management structure was settled around July last year. It consists of three main units: safety compliance, safety standards, and safety promotion. In addition, there is a corporate services area. These new management arrangements were debated by the board over a period of time. All board members were involved. The Civil Aviation Safety Authority Director, Mr Toller, told the committee on 6 May that no directors absented themselves from this process.
According to the CASA annual report for 1997-98, the board members at that time were Mr Dick Smith, Dr Paul Scully-Power, Mr Bruce Byron, Mr Michael Ryan, Mr Tony Pyne, Mr John Pyke and Mr Laurie Foley. Mr Foley was appointed to the CASA board on 8 May 1997, the same day as Mr Dick Smith was appointed. In fact, Mr Foley was appointed on the basis of Mr Smith's recommenda 
 tion to the then Minister for Transport, Mr Sharp. The board not only was actively involved in the development of this new structure but it also approved a process for recruiting senior staff to fill the newly created positions.
A key player in this process was Mr Wes Willoughby. Mr Willoughby was a regional manager in the Civil Aviation Authority, and he took a redundancy package some time around 1991. Obviously, he worked for that authority until 1991. He came back to this organisation as a consultant, I understand on the recommendation of Mr Dick Smith, on 7 August 1997. His initial work, at a rate of $1,000 a day, was with an American, Mr Brodrick. His contract was then extended by Mr Smith.
In addition to the base rate of $1,000 a day, Mr Willoughby was paid $200 an hour plus expenses to advise Mr Smith. I understand that those expenses included accommodation, travel, weekend fares from Canberra to Melbourne and Melbourne to Canberra for himself and his wife, as well as access to a car. Mr Willoughby, who I understand to be a competent officer, did well from those arrangements. In fact, for the month of July that year he was paid $57,684. I learnt that from an answer to a question from Senator Mackay to Mr Toller, the Chief Executive Officer of CASA, in estimates on 6 May this year. According to Mr Toller, the current structure was formally approved by the CASA board some time prior to May last year. He thought it was around February.
A company trading as Spencer Stuart was engaged to assist with the recruitment process. According to Mr Toller, this company had been engaged by CASA before. Spencer Stuart had a close relationship with Mr Willoughby. On 7 April Mr Willoughby sought board approval to engage a recruitment firm to fill the new executive position. The matter was settled by the board in a closed session on 15 April. There was no tender process but a call for expressions of interest on that same day.
A decision was taken to engage Spencer Stuart on 24 April, just nine days later. I understand that, over a period of time, Mr 
 Foley also had a number of dealings with Spencer Stuart, along with a fellow board member, Mr Bryce Byron. So there appears to have been a close relationship between this company, Mr Willoughby and Mr Foley before it was given the contract to provide candidates for key positions under the new structure. The contract with Spencer Stuart was signed on 5 May, but that company commenced work on the consultancy well before that. Mr Toller told estimates that this was because the company was given verbal advice that it had the job some time between 24 and 28 April.
Mr Foley had advised Spencer Stuart that he was available for work early in 1998. This occurred while he and his fellow board members were developing a new CASA structure and, along with it, a number of new senior positions. Mr Foley participated in the selection process that led to the appointment of that company. He then approved, along with the other members of the CASA board, the engagement of Spencer Stuart, but it appears Mr Foley had not advised the board of that obvious conflict of interest. He continued to be an active participant in the work of the board even though he had a direct and significant personal interest in the outcomes of a number of matters that the board had before it.
Mr Foley met with Spencer Stuart on 5 May to discuss his candidacy for one of the positions that that company was seeking to fill—that is, he met with the headhunter he had helped to appoint to discuss his interest in one of the positions he had helped to create. Again, he failed to advise his fellow board members of his actions. Two days later Mr Foley told Mr Wheatley from Spencer Stuart that he was a candidate for one of those positions, but again he did not advise the board of his decision.
At a board meeting on 15 May, the process to be followed in interviewing candidates for these jobs and the role of the board in that process was discussed. The process was to involve the establishment of a number of panels with a member of the board sitting on each panel. Mr Foley told the board he was not able to participate in that process, but he 
 did not advise the board members why he was unavailable. I asked Mr Toller, who was present at the 15 May meeting of the board, whether or not Mr Foley told his fellow board members why he would not sit on any selection panels. Mr Toller said Mr Foley gave no reason at that time. There is a lot more to this story and, given that my time is about to elapse, I advise the Senate that I intend to resume this story at the next available opportunity.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Australian National Audit Office: Principles of Corporate Governance</title>,Adjournment,15,1
