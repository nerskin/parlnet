"Jull, David, MP",LP,2002-09-23,"—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, I present the committee's report entitled Review of Foreign Affairs, Trade and Defence annual reports, 2000-2001, together with evidence received by the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—I am pleased to present this report on behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. Not only is it our first report in this parliament, it is also the result of the first general review by the committee of annual reports from the government agencies within its area of interest. Traditionally, Senate committees, not joint or House committees, have conducted general annual report reviews.
We decided to review the annual reports from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, AusAID, Austrade and the Department of Defence for two main reasons: firstly, to make an active contribution to the processes by which the parliament holds the executive and its agencies to account; and, secondly, to seek status reports on various policy and operational issues outlined in the annual reports. At a practical level, it has allowed committee members from the House of Representatives to participate in an activity similar to that routinely available to senators.
The review involved two public hearings, one conducted by our foreign affairs subcommittee and the other by our defence subcommittee. Many of the issues raised at these hearings were also of interest to our trade and human rights subcommittees. This report contains a summary of the key issues discussed at the hearings. The foreign affairs and trade chapter of the report focuses on three themes: events in the Middle East and South America, following the committee's reports on these regions in the last parliament; Australia's relations with some of the countries in North and South Asia; and Australia's relations with our near neighbours, including Burma, Cambodia, Vietnam, Indonesia, East Timor, Papua New Guinea and the developing nations of the South-West Pacific.
The scope of the defence chapter of the report is similarly broad. As well as commenting generally on Defence's performance in resourcing, management and acquisition, we considered, in some detail, the provision of support to Defence Force personnel and their families following operational deployment and in preparation for the transition from military service to civilian life. These issues are especially relevant, given the high level of operational tempo currently being experienced and the importance of retaining experienced and skilled personnel. Considerable effort is devoted to the provision of these services in the Defence Force, and over time their breadth and quality have improved.
There is scope, however, for further improvements to be made in the availability and effectiveness of transition services. We have made a series of recommendations to this end. For example, we have called on Defence to ensure that all Defence Force personnel returning from operational deployments are required to complete two weeks adjustment, or decompression, periods at work before undertaking recreational leave; and to make job placement services available to all Defence Force personnel moving from military service to civilian life.
With the exception of our recommendations on transitional management, the one-off nature of the hearings and the general absence of supporting written evidence means that we have not sought to undertake a full analysis of every issue raised at the hearings and mentioned in the report. Nevertheless, from our perspective the review has been very useful and I expect that annual report reviews will become a regular part of the committee's work program.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,"<title>Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee</title>",Committees,0,1
"Bevis, Arch, MP",ALP,2002-09-23,"—I join with the member for Fadden in saying a few brief words on the report. At the outset, I should say that I am representing my good friend the member for Chifley, who is unable to be here because of attendance at a funeral in Sydney that the House is aware of. I would also like to put on the record my thanks to Senator Alan Ferguson for his chairmanship of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and to the member for Fadden, David Jull, and the member for Maranoa, Bruce Scott, for their chairmanship of the two subcommittees that are the subject of this report. As is often the case, but seldom reported, these reports are unanimous views—that is, they are supported by all members of all parties. Sadly, when these things occur they do not always make headlines. Nonetheless, this is important business dealing with important issues. I think the constructive way in which the committee went about its affairs was a good sign for the operation of the parliament.
The committee process adopted this time was slightly different, as the member for Fadden has mentioned, and I think it has been a very useful process. In the last parliament, the committee used its annual report review powers as a way of examining issues of particular interest. For example, in the last parliament that process led to a focus on a review of military justice. I know that was an issue of great interest to the member for Chifley, who has done a considerable amount of work in that area.
On this occasion, the committee has begun a process of annual reviews which I think the committee has warmed to and would look to repeat. As has been mentioned, as part of that process it reviewed the operations of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, AusAID, Austrade and the Department of Defence. For the most part, those reviews involved a single day of public hearings and, as a consequence, there was limited scope. Nonetheless, that did afford the committee the opportunity to look at a number of important aspects, some of which the member for Fadden has just touched on. I will focus very briefly on a couple of the issues that were raised in respect of the Defence Annual Report and that have led to recommendations covered in the report being tabled now. They deal with issues such as the recruitment and retention policies and outcomes; the monitoring of unacceptable behaviour; ammunition shortfalls; the progress of acquisition projects, such as the Bushranger troop transport program, the Hawk lead-in fighter and the Jindalee Operational Radar Network—JORN.
There are a series of recommendations in the report which I think are very useful. There is comment in the recommendations on the monitoring and reporting of unacceptable behaviour, and a recommendation that in future the annual report should be segmented so that behaviours of a more serious nature are separately identified. I think that will refine the work of the committee and will be of benefit for those reviewing these matters. We have indicated that we will be seeking updates on development with respect to the military justice framework. I am sure that the member for Chifley will be at the front of those inquiries, especially as they relate to the positions of Director of Military Prosecutions and Inspector General of the Australian Defence Force.
One of the issues that emerged at the hearings on the Defence Annual Report was the importance of providing support to Defence Force personnel and their families, following operational deployment and in the preparation for transition from military service to civilian life. It is understandable, given the large number of deployments that have occurred in recent times, that this should be the subject of scrutiny by the parliament. I think it is fair to say all members of parliament participating in the committee were keen to ensure that Australia's service personnel are given every opportunity and support to assist their transition.
Finally, I would like to thank the secretariat. The Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Committee has over a long period of time been well served by very good personnel. That is the case again in this parliament and I would like to put on record my thanks to the secretariat for their support.

"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,2002-09-23,"—I present the Trade Practices Amendment (Public Liability Insurance) Bill 2002. Over the last 12 months, there has been a crisis in public liability insurance. What was once a routine procedure for most groups in the community has almost literally become a nightmare. Insurance cover has become much more difficult to obtain and the price has jumped dramatically. The effect of September 11 on the insurance market and the collapse of HIH have been significant factors in the crisis, but so is the increasingly litigious trend in our society, the growing culture of finding someone with deep pockets to blame, even in unreasonable circumstances. The crisis in public liability insurance has impacted most severely on the community sector and some areas of small business. Those groups are struggling to obtain public liability insurance at affordable prices, and the crisis has threatened the continuation of the activities Australians have traditionally enjoyed. 
The Howard government has failed to show leadership on this issue. Fortunately, the state governments have taken steps to reform the common law. The main focus of those reforms is to rebalance the law so that personal responsibility is restored. Labor believe that appropriate rights for the victims of negligence are essential in our society. The community has an expectation that those who suffer an injury as a result of someone else's culpability will be compensated for that injury, but there must be balance in any system. The law must appropriately reflect the community's expectations regarding realistic standards of responsibility, culpability and informed voluntary assumption of risk.
The objective of the reforms being put in place by state Labor governments is to ensure that our volunteer community groups can continue to function to enhance the quality of Australian life and to provide many essential services to the Australian community. Such reforms should lead to lower insurance premiums, and this bill is designed to ensure that that happens. PricewaterhouseCoopers estimated that the first stage of reforms introduced by Premier Carr would reduce the cost of public liability claims by 17.5 per cent and personal injury cases by 14 per cent. If the cost of the claims decreases, so must the premiums. We can only ensure that the benefit of these reforms is delivered if we provide a mechanism to ensure the savings are passed on. The insurance industry has warned that reform of public liability may not lead to cheaper premiums. This means that without proper supervision, the benefits of the well-considered law reforms will end up in the pockets of the insurance companies and the public liability insurance crisis will continue unabated. The Howard government has consistently refused to act on this issue, even though it is its clear constitutional responsibility.
Furthermore, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has said on the public record that it does not have the power to ensure that savings from the law reforms are passed on by insurance companies to consumers. Commonwealth legislation is required to ensure that that is the case. Legislation passed by this parliament is required. The states cannot do it. The states can reform the tort law but they cannot empower the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to ensure that the savings from the law reforms are passed on. 
This legislation grants to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission the necessary powers to protect consumers and ensure the savings are passed on. It allows the ACCC to take action against insurance companies which exploit the savings from the law reforms and do not charge premiums for public liability insurance which reflect the impact of the law reform. This legislation is necessary to realise the benefits of the law reforms undertaken by the states. I commend the bill to the House.

 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—In accordance with standing order 104A, the second reading will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.",REPS,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (PUBLIC LIABILITY INSURANCE) BILL 2002</title>,<title>First Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Griffin, Alan, MP",ALP,2002-09-23,"—Labor is introducing the Trade Practices Amendment (Credit Card Reform) Bill 2002 to protect the interests of consumers and small business. The Reserve Bank of Australia announced reforms to the operation of credit card schemes on 27 August 2002. Some of the key aspects of the reform are: interchange fees will be reduced, which has the potential to generate cost savings of up to $400 million per year; consumers who choose not to use their credit cards will no longer have to subsidise those who do; and companies who meet strict prudential standards will be able to issue their own credit cards. If properly implemented, the reforms will create a competitive credit card market and deliver substantial cost savings to small business and consumers. Labor has been pursuing this issue for years and strongly supports the Reserve Bank's reforms. There is, however, a very real prospect that the cost savings resulting from the reduction in interchange fees will never reach customers. This is because no agency has the power to ensure that the savings are passed on to consumers and small business.
This bill gives the ACCC the power to deal with any price exploitation arising from reforms to the operation of credit card schemes. Small business involved in credit card schemes pay a merchant service fee to the financial institution that provides them with the credit card service. Part of this merchant service fee is the interchange fee. The interchange fee is the fee that financial institutions charge each other for providing credit card services. The Reserve Bank of Australia reforms relate to reducing this fee so that it is more closely aligned with the costs incurred. However, despite the Reserve Bank of Australia's reforms reducing the interchange fees, there is nothing to stop the banks increasing the cost of other components of the merchant service fee to protect their profits. This means that no savings are guaranteed to consumers from the RBA reforms. Further, there is nothing to stop banks from seeking to recoup the revenue loss resulting from the cuts in the interchange fee by increasing other fees and charges. 
Anecdotal evidence from bank spokespeople and analysts indicates that only a portion of the projected savings will be passed on to Australian consumers. One bank has already publicly acknowledged that its customers will only ever see one-third of the savings. So with a reform that could be worth as much as $400 million, that could bring it down across the system to something more like only $140 million. This bank has openly admitted that it will increase other fees and charges and cut services to make up for the loss in revenue as a result of the RBA reforms. The Treasurer claims that it is the responsibility of the Reserve Bank to ensure that cost savings reach customers. In answer in this place to a question from Labor, he said:
The RBA has put that methodology in place, and the RBA will be expected to monitor compliance with it. 
If the Treasurer had read as far as page 2 of the Reserve Bank's report, he would know that this is not true. The Reserve Bank states explicitly:
The measures do not deal with the relationships between individual scheme members and their customers which are not covered by scheme regulations. Hence, they do not cover the setting of credit card fees and charges to cardholders and merchants ...
The government has ignored Labor's call to give the ACCC price exploitation powers to ensure that the projected savings of $400 million are passed on to customers. The Treasurer has accepted bank assurances that they will be, despite one bank already saying that they will not and the banks' track record on hiking fees. 
The Australian banking sector is the most profitable in the country, yet it has consistently taken record fees from consumers. Last year, almost $7.1 billion was charged in bank fees, while credit card interest rates remain at levels well above the cash rate. While ASIC has been charged with a consumer education role, protection is needed in the form of the price monitoring powers contained in this bill. The government has demonstrated that it will not act to protect the interests of small business and consumers. This bill shows that Labor will. Small business and consumer groups have also publicly stated their support for ACCC involvement. These groups include the Motor Trades Association of Australia, the Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, the Australian Consumers Association and the Financial Services Consumer Policy Centre. I commend this bill to the House.

"Cobb, John, MP",NP,2002-09-23,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	notes the serious state of drought across the south eastern part of the Australian continent;
(2)	recognises the variability of weather patterns across Australia;
(3)	recognises the serious economic and social impact being felt by rural communities;
(4)	acknowledges the need to maintain the long term viability of agriculture in the drought affected regions; and
(5)	calls on State Governments to provide a more substantial financial contribution to drought relief.
In my lifetime, I have never seen two such droughts hit south-eastern Australia. This is the second time in a decade that we have had a drought of absolutely major proportions, such as you might expect to see only once in a lifetime. Eighty-six per cent of New South Wales is now drought declared. The western regions in particular are seriously affected. Much of Queensland and Victoria are drought affected, particularly the south-west of Queensland and the north-west of Victoria. Australia is a very dry continent, and Australian farmers do not want to have to ask for assistance to deal with that. However, the fact remains that far and away the greatest proportion of Australian broadacre commodities is produced on dry land, not with irrigation. Without doubt, mother nature is far and away the best manager. This is the second time in a decade that we have had a drought of extraordinarily major proportions. Farmers cannot be expected to deal with this in a continent which is showing such a high degree of variability. Farmers want to be self-reliant; they want to look at it themselves. However, not only are we hitting for the second time in 10 or 12 years an extraordinarily bad drought situation but also we have just been through the worst decade, in my lifetime, for farmers.
In the years 1990 to 1999, wool was at its worst price cycle. This was combined with a drought which was, certainly around 1994-95, similar to the one we are approaching now. Beef has been extraordinarily variable. During that same period it hit some of its worst lows, and it has been extraordinarily inconsistent. In terms of wheat and cereal crops, in 1990-91 we had the lowest price for wheat in living memory. In the years 2000-01, people wrote off their crops because of flooding and too much rain. In the mid-1990s we had a drought. It is not, economically, something that farmers can deal with.
The farming communities and the towns that service them are tough, but they are not indestructible. In many cases they have had no opportunity to put money aside so that they can finance themselves through hard times. Quite often they have had no opportunity to physically provide enough fodder to tide themselves over. It all comes down to that big issue: money. As I said, this is the second such drought in less than a decade. The social implications include suicide and family break-ups. When drought occurs with the regularity that it has over the last 10 years, those implications are exacerbated.
The effect on the viability of farming when you have drought on such a wide scale, with much of south-eastern Australia involved—and certainly the breadbasket of south-eastern Australia involved—is enormous. I greatly thank the Deputy Prime Minister and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry for coming out two weeks ago to look at the situation in the west of my electorate. I also thank the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, the Deputy Prime Minister, the Prime Minister and the cabinet for doing what they can to make exceptional circumstances funding—or that part of it totally funded by the Commonwealth and controlled by the Commonwealth—much more accessible for farmers. This was commented on last Thursday in this House by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry.
But the state governments are refusing to come to the party to make the business side of drought relief more accessible for farmers. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has stated that if just one state will come to him to sit down and deal with it, he will deal with one state. At the moment some of them refuse to even acknowledge that drought exists. Queensland does have a drought policy. New South Wales has rediscovered one—under political pressure—in the last couple of months. If just New South Wales would sit down with the Commonwealth government and work out how to make not only family payments more accessible but business payments more accessible to farmers then we would accept that.

"King, Catherine, MP",ALP,2002-09-23,"—I am pleased to speak to the member for Parkes' motion this morning. The current dry conditions being experienced at the top end of my electorate and throughout the Mallee, and the severe drought being experienced in large parts of New South Wales and Queensland, are having an enormous impact on farmers and the communities to which they belong and will have an impact on the national economy.
The issue of drought assistance and the responsibilities of all levels of government require serious attention but, typical of the attitude of the National Party members in this House, the member for Parkes has resorted to trotting out the government line again that the Labor states are to blame. The Nationals are so ideologically opposed to the Labor Party that they are paralysed by it. Whether it be failing to stand up to the government over the sale of Telstra—something which will seriously disadvantage their constituencies—remaining silent on the government's closure of rural services such as the Rural Youth Information Service in the member for Parkes' electorate, or running the government's line for them over the issue of Commonwealth-state responsibilities for drought assistance, the Nationals fail to show that they are a party in their own right. They fail to show that they are a party that put the interests of their electorates before the interests of their coalition partners.
There are clearly reforms needed to the exceptional circumstances policy framework. The states have supported the changes that would see the introduction of buffer zones, earlier joint action and cash grants but do not support the Commonwealth attempting to cost shift onto the states in order to shore up their budget deficit. The states are spending significant amounts of money on drought relief. The Bracks government announced last week $2.6 million in new initiatives to help communities tackle dry conditions in the north of Victoria. Both New South Wales and Queensland have significant drought relief programs in place. All states participate with the Commonwealth in funding the exceptional circumstances program.
The ministers responsible for drought relief have botched the negotiations with the states and are now attempting to use the media and the members of the National Party to run their case. Rather than coming into this House to berate the states, the member for Parkes should be calling on the ministers responsible to find some middle ground. People in his electorate and in mine do not want to hear about bickering between levels of government on this issue; they want a solution. No progress has been made since May on reaching agreement on a new exceptional circumstances policy framework. The minister must show leadership on this issue and negotiate a solution with the states.
Emergency relief measures such as the exceptional circumstances program are bandaid measures when things go wrong; they do nothing to address the factors that contribute to drought. The current drought conditions do have a direct link to climate change. Where is the coalition on climate change? Nowhere. We have heard the Minister for the Environment and Heritage proudly telling us each question time that the government does not think it is in Australia's national interest to sign the Kyoto protocol. Labor knows that, if we are to address climate change in Australia and benefit from new energy sector technology and jobs, we must ratify the Kyoto protocol or get left behind.
The government has failed to address the issues of salinity and water wastage. It has been estimated that over 93,000 megalitres per year is lost through evaporation and seepage from the channels that cross the Wimmera-Mallee alone. That is 93,000 megalitres of water that is not available to farmers, not available to the environment and not available to promote economic growth. In my electorate and the member for Mallee's electorate, the coalition had a perfect opportunity to show its environment policy credentials by funding the Wimmera-Mallee pipeline.
The Victorian state Labor government took up the challenge and committed over $70 million to the project. What did we see in the federal budget for the Wimmera-Mallee pipeline? Nothing. The member for Parkes has the gall to argue that the states are doing nothing for drought relief. The Wimmera-Mallee project is off this government's agenda, and all members of the National Party in this House should be supporting their colleague the member for Mallee and demanding that the government fund it. The issue of drought relief is of serious concern and it requires a constructive solution. The Leader of the Opposition negotiated drought relief assistance with non-Labor states in 1992. Why can't this government show some leadership and do the same?",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Drought</title>,Private Members' Business,4,1
"Neville, Paul, MP",NP,2002-09-23,"—I rise today to support this motion from the member for Parkes. It resonates very much in my electorate. It is timely that this motion comes before the House at this time of year, as August and September are traditionally the driest months in Queensland. This is a time in which there is little hope that the situation will change. Based on the recent pattern of the southern oscillation index, the probability of receiving above average long-term rainfall between August and October remains relatively low, at between 30 and 50 per cent for the whole of Queensland. Although my home town of Bundaberg was offered a little relief by falls of around 145 millimetres in June and 65 millimetres in August, it has had less than 40 per cent of its average long-term rainfall this year. Approximately 21 per cent of the land area of Queensland is now officially drought declared—that is 42 shires. In addition, one shire is partly drought declared and there are 431 drought declared individual properties in a further 34 shires. This situation has huge ramifications for the families, businesses and communities which are the backbone of rural and regional Queensland. It is vital that emergency aid is extended to drought affected farmers. The Commonwealth has played a leading role in this process, providing home support as well as the recent sugar assistance package and the two sugar packages before that and making its exceptional circumstances arrangements.
Sadly, it seems the Queensland government is not so genuine in its efforts to help farmers during these tough times. A national plan to overhaul the exceptional circumstances scheme, to which the member for Ballarat just referred, and to provide more assistance quickly has been indefinitely delayed because the Queensland government has refused to provide funding to support it. The member for Ballarat said the states have been generous. What, with four percent! You have got to be kidding. In fact, the member for Ballarat is completely wrong. All states have provided drought assistance in the past, and Queensland is a good example of what is happening. Under the current arrangements, Queensland has been putting $1.3 million into economic assistance to farmers and taking out $1.2 million in administrative charges. I wonder what members of the opposition think about that. There is a case on the Darling Downs where, of all the exceptional circumstances grants that have been put out, the state has put in $400,000 and taken out $500,000 in administration. You can see that it is a pretty hopeless situation. Last year's state budget—the budget of a Labor government—offered $10 million to cane farmers, but the conditions were so tough that only $60,000 could ever be accessed. Now the state government has come out, after great trumpeting and publicity, with another $20 million as a loan assistance program. If it follows the pattern of the previous one, the assistance to farmers will be infinitesimal.
These matters have particular relevance to the southern end of the Hinkler electorate, to towns such as Childers and Bundaberg that have grown and prospered on the back of agricultural industries such as sugar and small crops. When I addressed the Main Committee on this matter on 16 May, I pointed out that the four Bundaberg and Childers sugar mills could be expected to crush 5.1 million tonnes of sugar cane this year. The 2002 estimate was down to 3.2 million tonnes but, as of today, it is down to 2.87 million tonnes. You can see that that is only half a reasonable crop. The economic effects of the downturn should be quite obvious to members of this place, especially as we come into the fourth quarter of this year. While harvesting is now in full swing, final tonnage will depend on how much of the crop is rejected, ploughed in or left standing, on whether the yield of the crop continues to be maintained and on what the commercial content of the sugar might be in that particular crop. This is a very difficult time for Queensland, as it is for New South Wales, and I call on the state governments not to perpetuate this cruel hoax and to assist properly with emergency assistance to farmers of all types throughout this country.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Drought</title>,Private Members' Business,4,1
"Evans, Martyn, MP",ALP,2002-09-23,"—Agriculture is vital to Australia. Despite the diversification of our economy over the last century, agriculture remains particularly significant. That is especially true in my own state of South Australia. South Australian exports are worth several billion dollars to the global economy—we have some $4.5 billion of exports each year. Some 50 per cent of that total figure comes from agriculture, with the key products being cereals, wine, wool, meat, fish, fruit and dairy products. There are some 15,000 farms in South Australia covering 57 million hectares in a variety of environments. Many of those environments are now drought affected, and many of our farms, as the Premier has recently pointed out to the South Australian parliament, are affected by drought. In the past six months, rainfall in South Australia has been 60 to 80 per cent below the 30-year average across a large area of the state. The state authorities and Premier Rann and Minister Holloway are working with their federal colleagues to see what can be done by way of exceptional circumstance assistance. I am sure that will be a cooperative process.
In some respects, the arguments which we have heard here today about exceptional circumstances assistance—the responsibility for it and the disagreements which emerge about the responsibility for those financial commitments—are, to some degree, irrelevant in the longer term. These are vitally important matters for the farmers of today. Exceptional circumstances assistance will be of great significance to the farms that are able to receive it. I am sure that it will mean the difference between being able to continue in these harsh conditions and not being able to continue. But, in the longer term, governments must address the important conditions which affect the viability of our farms and agricultural production across the board.
Many of those things are increasingly obvious to us. They are matters of salinity, they are matters of water management and, in the decade by decade processes, they are issues like climate change. But they will only have an impact in a 50-year time horizon. Of course, on a drought by drought basis, it is very difficult to attribute something immediately to the impact of climate change, but right now you can see the impact of things like salinity. You can go out to our farms—to our agricultural production areas—today and see the reduction in productivity due to salinity. Today you can see the wastage and the loss due to the failure of water management processes in this country, and you can see the loss to our productivity through a failure to properly grapple with the issues and the science behind water management technology.
The real tragedy of this is that we have it within our command. We have it within our science, our technology and our management skills, because Australia is at the forefront of global technology in agriculture. Australian agricultural education, Australian farm management skills, Australian farm management personnel—the farmers of Australia—are at the forefront of the science of these issues. Sadly, the states and the Commonwealth, our farming organisations—and sometimes, indeed, the farmers themselves—have failed to come to grips with the overall necessity for organisational and cultural change in these areas. Often, opportunities we should grasp are lost at the local, regional, state and national levels. Hundreds of millions of dollars are spent on salinity programs in this country, but often, for want of proper management programs, for want of proper national mapping programs and for want of proper research into the way these issues may be best addressed—and the most serious issue here is the want of proper research—we fail to spend that money in the way that would best address the salinity issue. Often, for want of proper implementation of water management techniques, many thousands of megalitres of water that could better be used in this country go to waste.
These are the issues that we might better address, rather than worrying about the technicalities of some of the financial grant processes. Although the grants are vital to the farmers of today, the farmers of tomorrow may be spared the necessity for them if in the decade to come we better manage our long-term programs to ensure the delivery of water and viable programs on the ground. That would indeed be a bonus and a gift that we could leave to the current generation of farmers and, better yet, to the generations of farmers who will support Australian and global agriculture in this country for many decades to come. I commend that to the House.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Drought</title>,Private Members' Business,4,1
"Ley, Sussan, MP",LP,2002-09-23,"—I am pleased to be able to support this motion moved by my colleague the member for Parkes and supported by the member for Hinkler. They have just demonstrated what excellent understanding they have of the difficulties we are facing in rural Australia as a result of the present drought. Even in a drought it rains. It would be a mistake to think that the falls of rain we have had in the last few days have in any way let us off the hook. They have merely bought some farmers a little more time. For some they have been too little and for some they have been too late.
Travis Dalton is a young farmer near Balranald in western New South Wales. He and his wife and their two children aged three and five have recently started out on their own in a broadacre cropping enterprise. I met Travis on a recent tour through the drought affected areas of my electorate. He wondered whether governments cared about his plight. He is still wondering. Concerned about the rising cost of grain, he bought out of his wheat contract when the drought looked to be on for sure. That basically means paying the company the difference between the cost of your contract and the additional cost to the company to reinstate it elsewhere at today's prices. The price of wheat is rising steeply. Today, to wash out of your contract, the price might be $80 a tonne. In theory it could cost someone $200,000 to buy out of their wheat contract. Imagine having these sorts of liabilities and trying to offset them. Farmers out that way are saying that they are looking at harvesting possibly two bags to the acre today. It will not be long until that becomes no bags to the acre—no income. Imagine what that does to rural communities. Imagine the flow-on effect that has in businesses dependent on farmers for their ongoing profitability.
I am not sure what Travis Dalton's precise circumstances are, but I asked him to give me a call every couple of weeks so that I can see how he is getting on. He has just approached his bank for help; he needs an extension of his overdraft. He has to deal with some pretty big numbers. Next year, along with other wheat growers, he has to put a new crop in the ground. This will cost upwards of $100,000. Without help from the bank, at a rate that will not cripple him, he is going out the door backwards. The point is this: if we lose our young farmers, if we let those young men and women who are just starting out and have laid it all on the line—and whose parents in many cases have laid it all on the line for them as well—go out of the industry, who have we got left? The way Travis Dalton sees it, there is plenty of help available when all hope is lost—payments to restructure you off the farm, payments when you are out of work, payments to encourage you to start a new enterprise—but there is nothing available to help you stay in the farm business that you have given everything to achieve. Travis's wife could get a part-time job, and they have thought of that, but she will be needed to drive the tractor, because it will not be easy to employ someone. The job of tractor driver is another job lost in a small rural community. And so it goes on.
Minister Truss's new EC model, which he took to the states in May, met with their approval. But so far they have refused to contribute, because they do not want to make the necessary financial contribution. The Commonwealth's contribution will not fall, so we are not shifting costs onto the states—that is not cost shifting—and now we have introduced significant new measures by providing welfare assistance under the EC program for six months as soon as the National Rural Advisory Council is asked to examine an application. This means that, where we can be satisfied that EC income loss criteria are going to be met in the months ahead, the Commonwealth is prepared to trigger EC assistance. We have had to step in after the states have failed again to look after their rural constituency.
Premier Carr speaks often of his concern about overcrowding in the Sydney basin and the environmental stresses and strains on the coastal ecosystems. I suggest that a strong and positive rural policy, one which shows farmers that the New South Wales government actually wants them to be in business for the long term, would be a good start to addressing some of these population issues. You see, it is not just that the New South Wales government do nothing; they do plenty, but their measures are against farmers' interests. Examples are the draft native vegetation plans, which restrict farmers' rights, and the water sharing plans, which give farmers a 10-year horizon for already-reduced access to water. The New South Wales government have responded to the drought with a package of measures, for which I am grateful, but I urge them to continue to monitor the situation closely. It is without doubt the role of the states to manage all but the most exceptional of drought circumstances.

"Gibbons, Steve, MP",ALP,2002-09-23,"—It is a pity that something as important as the impact of drought on farmers has turned into a political debate. What a great pity we have a minister for agriculture who is well known for not letting the truth get in the way of making a political point, however feeble it may be. We have a situation where the states are contributing to drought relief, as they should. I welcome the announcement by the minister last week that welfare payments are going to be made in some areas. That is quite welcome, but there needs to be a lot more done. For example, it might be a bit of a surprise to the minister that drought knows no state boundaries. If a location like Moama in south-eastern New South Wales is experiencing dry conditions, it is a fair bet that Echuca will be experiencing the same conditions. The simple reason is that they are only separated by 100 metres of Murray River. The minister obviously does not understand that. Drought is a national responsibility, and there ought to be a proper national response to it.
There has been a lot of criticism about the contribution made by the states. As we all know, the Victorian state government announced $2.6 million of measures just last week, and these are the initial measures. There will be more to come. Some of those measures are going to be very beneficial to a lot of farmers in central Victoria. For example, the $2.6 million package includes $1.17 million of assistance to increase regional water. I understand I have about 30 seconds left. I will conclude by saying that at least under the previous Hawke and Keating governments we did have some rain occasionally.

"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2002-09-23,"—There is no greater threat to world finance markets than investors losing faith in the integrity of company accounts. With over 90 per cent of people now in superannuation funds, just about every employee owns shares indirectly. Labor are determined to ensure that people's investments are safe; hence this Corporations Amendment (Improving Corporate Governance) Bill 2002. By contrast, the government continue to do nothing. We call for action, and they wait for months and simply issue a discussion paper. HIH collapsed, with Minister Hockey knowing about the situation, but the government did nothing. The Treasurer now wants to wait for the outcome of the royal commission. This is just another excuse for doing nothing.
The government has waited 20 months to move on just one aspect of corporate governance—the clawback of executives' salaries—and the draft legislation circulated last Friday is still deficient. By contrast, Labor's plan is comprehensive. The time for action is now. Labor is prepared to legislate to improve corporate governance standards now. People who breach corporate laws should be penalised, and the penalties have to reflect the serious damage that can be done to companies, to shareholders, to super funds and to the economy as a whole. This bill doubles the current penalties for serious breaches of the Corporations Act, from five years to 10 years, and increases to five years the penalties for many offences that now carry only two-year penalties. At the same time, the bill protects whistleblowers who provide information in good faith about corporate malpractice to the industry regulator, ASIC. This groundbreaking legislation will improve the culture of honesty inside our listed corporations.
Shareholders and the public have the right to know how much executives are paying themselves. In 1998, Labor—without the support of the government—forced an amendment to the Corporations Act to have details of executive remuneration revealed in companies' annual reports. But half of all companies have flouted this law, with the tacit approval of the Howard government. This bill will make them comply.
The bill also implements major recommendations of the Ramsay report into auditor independence, but we go further than Professor Ramsay. The bill follows the United States reforms and prohibits auditors from providing non-audit services to their clients in a range of inappropriate areas. It also requires auditors to specifically report on instances of aggressive accounting and to disclose the implications of an alternative treatment being used. This will clean up many shonky accounting practices.
The bill also assists investors by attempting to ensure that financial analysts always act in the interests of the users of their reports and not in the interests of their firms. Disclosure standards covering all research reports will be introduced. Ordinary investors will also gain a statutory right of access to the information provided by listed companies during briefings to analysts. Some firms have already provided this information on their web sites, and they are to be commended for that. This standard needs to be available generally. Similarly, the bill proposes a revolutionary reform of election processes for directors. Shareholders who elect directors will have a right to know what the relationships are between the candidates and the company, what the relationships are between the candidates and the existing directors and what other directorships are held by the candidate. A mandatory disclosure will need to be made by all candidates to ensure shareholders can make informed decisions on these questions.
These are sensible reforms. They respond to the inadequacies of the system, and they protect the investments of all Australians. They build trust in the market. If we do these things, we will increase the level of national investment. We will boost industry, we will increase returns for shareholders and we will create more jobs. Accordingly, I commend the bill to the House.

"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2002-09-23,"—Just recently a campaign was launched for the federal government to equalise the Tasmanian passenger vehicle equalisation scheme for our two ferries going across Bass Strait. I thank the federal government for that equalisation scheme. Unfortunately, there are still anomalies in the scheme, most notably for motorcyclists who have a trailer or a sidecar. At the moment we have an anomaly where you can come across in a motorcycle, a motor car, a motorhome and a campervan, yet if you have a motorcycle with a trailer you have to pay more in both the peak season and the off season. That is the one anomaly left in the jigsaw of the passenger vehicle equalisation scheme. I am asking the federal government to make that equal and fair by creating an equity in the structure for fares for passengers and vehicles on the Bass Strait service.
I was accused of political opportunism when I tried to get a change for motorcycles, motorhomes, cyclists and campervans. If I can get it for motorcycles with trailers and sidecars, I would love to be called a political opportunist of the first order. There should be equity and equality across Bass Strait. The federal government must finish the jigsaw by putting in the last piece to make it fair and equitable—and bring those thousands of cyclists with thousands of sidecars over to Tasmania.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Transport: Bass Strait Passenger Equalisation Scheme</title>,Statements by Members,6,1
"Vamvakinou, Maria, MP",ALP,2002-09-23,"—by leave—On behalf of the member for Reid, I move:
That this House:
(1)	pays tribute to the thousands of dedicated people across Australia who are involved every week in ethnic community broadcasting;
(2)	recognises that the Australian Ethnic Radio Training Project (AERTP), auspiced by the National Ethnic and Multicultural Broadcasters Council, performs a vital role in providing nationally available, quality, accredited, value-for-money competency-based training for aspiring ethnic community broadcasters;
(3)	acknowledges there is an ongoing demand for such training from new broadcasters, new programs, new language groups and from existing groups; and
(4)	calls on the Government to provide further financial support to AERTP to ensure that it continues to operate beyond the 2002-2003 financial year.
I am happy to move this motion. I do so on behalf of Labor's shadow minister for citizenship and multicultural affairs, the member for Reid, who is unable to be here this afternoon. He is attending the funeral of his father, the late Jack Ferguson. This motion illustrates the important role and contribution that ethnic community broadcasting plays in our society. This role is not always well understood by the broader community, nor is it particularly well known to those who do not participate in ethnic broadcasting.
The genesis of ethnic broadcasting can be traced back to the pioneering work of the Whitlam government. That government was the first to seriously acknowledge the reality that Australia is not a monolingual or monocultural society. The Whitlam government saw a dual purpose in the establishment and promotion of its multicultural policies. Firstly, by recognising the multicultural nature of our community, it sought to provide access and equity to Australians whose first language was not English. In so doing, it gave all an opportunity to participate in our social, cultural and political life without running the risk of exclusion because they could not speak English. Secondly, the policy of multiculturalism contributed to the enrichment and development of our contemporary multicultural Australian identity.
At the time the idea faced considerable opposition from the coalition and the established public broadcaster, the ABC. However, with determination, seed funding was provided for trial ethnic radio stations in Sydney and Melbourne as well as for a public access station, 3ZZZ, in Melbourne. This was to commence in 1975. These developments directly led to the birth of SBS radio and ethnic community broadcasting in Australia respectively. The Melbourne based Migrant Workers Committee and the newly formed Ethnic Communities Council of Victoria played a key role in these developments.
From these humble beginnings Australia now has a vibrant and comprehensive network of ethnic community broadcasting stations. There are about 100 stations around Australia, producing some 1,800 hours of programming in almost 100 languages with the assistance of 4,000 volunteers—a point I will come back to later on, as the culture of volunteers built around ethnic community broadcasting is in fact its backbone and its greatest strength. These stations are targeted at almost 2.9 million Australians who, according to the 2001 census, speak a language other than English at home. Ethnic broadcasting covers 50 per cent more languages than SBS radio and delivers three times as much original programming.
Its programs are a dissemination of important information in the form of news, with a domestic and international component, and current affairs aimed at keeping its audience informed and in touch. Important also to program formats is entertainment and music. To the first generations of the more established communities and to the newly arrived communities, ethnic broadcasting is a critical link. For the elderly, in particular, it is a source of great companionship and comfort, as many begin to revert to the almost exclusive use of their mother tongue as they age.
I want to come back to the issue of volunteers. While receiving only modest Commonwealth funding, these broadcasters rely significantly on the voluntary fundraising efforts and labour of individuals and community groups. Ethnic community broadcasting has never had the financial resources of, let us say, SBS or the ABC. It runs virtually on a shoestring budget, and its outstanding success is a credit to the people who, over the years, have dedicated their time and their skills to the production of programs. Producing broadcast programs is a time-consuming and often frustrating experience. I know, because I have been one of those thousands of volunteers who have spent many an hour in the studios of community broadcasting. Like all the volunteers, I committed my time because I wanted to provide a service to my community, but I also benefited greatly from my involvement. In fact, my last program was a morning current affairs segment that I cohosted with two other women, one of whom is now a producer for Lateline.
However, it is not just individuals who volunteer; it is also the communities as a whole. Each language program has its own committee, allowing for as broad a participation as possible as well as providing the fundraising efforts that are an annual occurrence. I am pleased to say that the amount of money raised increases from year to year. This is a sign that ethnic community broadcasting remains a very significant component of our diverse community.
Over the years, its role and significance has not waned, despite the rise of free-to-air commercial ethnic broadcasters, as well as cable television. Its audience remains faithful and grows because people trust the quality of its programs. In addition, ethnic community broadcasting builds strong community networks and plays a significant community development role, especially among the newly emerging communities. At a time when we have seen significant government cutbacks to English language programs, new and emerging communities are almost totally dependent on the services of ethnic broadcasting.
I want to talk a little about the training project component of ethnic community broadcasting, because this motion draws particular attention to the position of the Australian Ethnic Radio Training Project, whose future is currently under threat. In the past nine years, the program has provided accredited training to more than 2,500 ethnic broadcasters from about 80 separate language groups. Broadcasters have completed over 21,000 training modules. The project has 142 trainers nationally and participants from language groups as diverse as Tamil, Turkish, Latvian, Spanish, Somali and Croatian. Over half the stations are in regional and rural Australia, in communities as dispersed as Bankstown, Narwee, Cairns, Gosford, Coffs Harbour and Ryde. The training provides broadcasters with on-site experience at community radio stations and it does so in a very cost-effective manner. I understand it costs an average of $6.50 an hour to conduct the training. People who have studied under this project speak very highly of the usefulness of the training.
Unfortunately, while the number of stations providing ethnic broadcasting has significantly increased in recent years, funding for the training project will be exhausted at the end of this financial year. Funding for this important project was originally sourced from an endowment and that funding source has now dried up, so I strongly urge the government—specifically Minister Alston—to act without delay to match its commitment to multiculturalism and to provide further financial support to the project in order to ensure its survival. I understand it requires a commitment of around $250,000 a year, which is a pittance in the context of the overall Commonwealth budget. When you consider that the government readily spends massive amounts of taxpayers' money on advertising to bolster the coalition's image, I am sure that it could find a few hundred thousand dollars a year to continue a vital training project that benefits over 200 trainee broadcasters each year.
If the Howard government is serious about its commitment to multiculturalism, it will move quickly to reassure a very anxious ethnic broadcasting industry that its training future is secure. While it is great public relations to talk about the importance of embracing the Australian family, it is even more important to put your money where your mouth is and to continue to support programs that provide access and equity, because you cannot have a multicultural policy without access and equity programs. I would like to conclude with a quote from Jason Yat-Sen Li, who is a human rights lawyer and a former broadcaster himself:
The role of ethnic community broadcasting goes beyond the role of education and entertainment and even preservation of culture. It goes to the heart of forging an inclusive Australian identity for all Australians.

"King, Peter, MP",LP,2002-09-23,"—It was the German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck who made the observation, in the 1880s, that one of the most important strategic facts of the then contemporary world was that the United States of America and the British Empire, as it then was, had a common language; namely, the English language. Some 20 or so years after that, it was the likes of George Bernard Shaw and others who proposed a new linguistic regime for a new world; namely, Esperanto, in the hope—perhaps, in the light of events, the forlorn hope—that a new dawn would occur in cultural tolerance around the world, based upon a universal language which drew from all the languages of the then known world.
What has happened is that the English language, which we in this House know and love so well, has in fact become the Esperanto or the lingua franca of the contemporary world. In this country, we who speak English as our first language are indeed, for that reason, very fortunate.
—Even as a second language.
—Thank you. But it should be observed in coming to this topic that not only has the English language become the lingua franca but also the English language is the common language of this country. Because it is the common language and because this country has established such a strong multicultural tradition, we should now embrace, as we have done in the government—indeed, on both sides of the House—for the last 20 or so years the developments that have seen the acknowledgment and encouragement of cultural programs from so many other parts of the world and from the many peoples who make up this wonderful country of ours.
In supporting most aspects of this motion—but, I should say, not all—I endorse the comments of the previous speaker concerning the importance of ensuring training in relation to the many languages that can be found on our radio stations. I wish to speak somewhat briefly about the languages that are spoken in my own electorate. I will then speak about the government's programs in relation to ethnic broadcasting generally and will draw one or two conclusions from that in relation to training in particular. In my own electorate, Russian is an important language, as are the Greek, Italian and Chinese languages. Each of them is spoken at home in a relatively large number of households. For those who have assumed that every household in our country speaks English, it is important to understand and recognise that that is not the case and that upwards of one-third of the households in some electorates—there has been an estimate to that effect in my own—speaks a different language at home.
That calls for tolerance and respect on the part of those who do not speak a language other than English at home. It also calls for recognition by those who do speak other languages at home that we do have that wonderful tradition that I spoke of earlier, the lingua franca, and the common tradition of the English language, which we should all seek to accept and respect. If we do that, we will end up with a vital culture that is respected both by those who are part of the continuing tradition of English as their first language—who understand and can converse, whether it be in commerce or navigation or through academic studies or science, around the world and also at home—and those who come from a different tradition.
I will make one other point before I move to the government's position. In my own campaign for parliament last year, I spoke on four different Chinese language radio stations to ensure communication of my message to the people of the eastern suburbs of Sydney. I am very grateful that those stations were prepared to take a message from a new candidate for parliament. I spoke on Russian language programs as well. Television and Radio Broadcasting Services, TARBS, is an important television network. Indeed, it is a private enterprise that has recently begun in this country and has five Russian language television channels beaming into Australia. In addition, there are a number of Greek language radio programs. Probably the most popular of any in the country are the Italian programs, which I mentioned earlier.
It is not often recognised that the number of permanent radio stations has increased by some 61 per cent since the government was elected in 1996. That is an outstanding record that the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts and the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs can be very proud of. The number of stations with permanent licences has increased from 130 to 209. Interestingly enough, the majority—some 70 per cent—of those permanently licensed community radio stations are in regional areas, and 25 per cent of these provide the only local radio service in that region.
The government has increased funding to the community broadcasting sector by some 55 per cent since 1996 in order to achieve those outcomes. This funding is provided to the sector for ethnic, Indigenous, radio for print handicapped and general broadcasters as well as for transmission assistance and sector coordination. In 2001-02, an additional $5.2 million was allocated to the community broadcasting sector by the government through the Community Broadcast Fund. This can be contrasted with the funding extended by the Labor Party, when it was last in office in 1995-96, of only $3.23 million.
Over and above this substantial funding commitment, infrastructure commitment and—dare I say it—moral and emotional commitment by leading ministers of the government, the coalition has provided special purpose funding through its infrastructure package. An infrastructure package was announced as long ago as 1996, in the first year of the government, and comprised some $10.5 million in special purpose funding, which has been utilised over the last five years for the Community Radio Satellite service—also known as ComRadSat—the Community Broadcasting Database, the Community Access Network and Multicultural Community Broadcasting. That infrastructure fund provided for the extension of the ComRadSat, which is now the principal source of satellite delivered radio program content in the sector, with just under 80 per cent of all stations accessing the service; the roll-out of 181 computers to the sector with software to access the Internet and email; and the development of a Community Broadcasting Database to be made available online to stations for marketing and management purposes.
It can be seen from that record that the government has committed itself in a number of ways to the future of ethnic radio broadcasting, and I strongly support those policies in that regard. As I said at the start, if we wish to ensure that the whole of the Australian community, including those new communities that have become part of our broader community, come with us, contribute to us and are made part of the vitality of modern Australia, we must reach out to them in different ways. Ethnic broadcasting is an important means by which that can be done.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Communications: Ethnic Community Broadcasting</title>,Private Members' Business,13,1
"Hatton, Michael, MP",ALP,2002-09-23,"—I say at the outset that I agree with the motion put forward by the member for Calwell, on behalf of the member for Reid. Unfortunately, having listened for 10 minutes, I do not know whether the member for Wentworth agrees with most, if not all, of what was proposed by the member for Reid. He indicated at the start that he did, but I heard virtually nothing in all of that 10 minutes that went to the core of what this motion is about. I expect we might get a bit closer with the member for Kooyong, who I am guessing might be the next person up.
The core of this question goes to the fourth point: will the government support this program with moneys so that it can continue into the 2002-03 year? A simple proposition: will the money be put up or not? Will the program continue or not? It is not too difficult for a member of the government to have a quick word with the minister, given that a matter like this has come up in private members' business, to gauge whether or not the government is of a mind to support the program. It is not enough to say that over past years—in fact, over the 10 years that this program has operated and not just since 1996—it has been successful and that the government has, as a former government did, put funds into community broadcasting. It not enough to say that there are infrastructure funds there and funding more generally. It is not enough to say that there has been a bit of an increase in that. We specifically want an answer to point 4: will the government support it or not?
The rationale for supporting it has already been put by the member for Calwell, based on her experience as one of the people who has trained within the ethnic radio area and one who has benefited from a program that, at half the cost of normal training programs—and the Minister for Employment Services, who is at the table, would appreciate this—has turned out people in the radio area with programming skills of a high order.
This motion also argues that we should look not just at existing programs and what has happened in the past for a number of communities but realise, as the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs understands, that our immigration program, particularly through the refugee program, brings new people from diverse parts of the world all the time and that there is a continuing need not only to embed but to expand the coverage to cover different language groups. This is particularly important at two levels. One level is for those people who came in the early part of the post-war program—the people who came in the fifties and sixties—the people who came to a linguistic wasteland in Australia, the people who came to an Australia that had English as a lingua franca. It did not have anything else. It did not have the 700 Aboriginal languages that had been put aside. It was English or nothing else.
During the Menzies period, those people who came were given virtually no assistance whatsoever, not only no monetary assistance to try to settle themselves here but no assistance in the workplace and no assistance to learn English. They learned it from other migrants in their local workplaces in my electorate in Bankstown and elsewhere. Thankfully, those years have long gone. This government, following our government, has put money into ethnic radio broadcasting. It is important, because a lot of those people who came in the fifties and sixties—the people who are older, the people who had a grasp of English and were able to work their way through the community—have, as they have become older and more frail, lost their capacity to use English in the way that they did through most of their working lives. They need greater help. They need language help within the nursing home area and within the community at large and they need this kind of resource that they can get through ethnic community radio. Those people who are newly coming to the society as refugees need more people to be trained in their languages because, if they are not, then they cannot adequately communicate, not only with the members of their own community but with the rest of the community, and the government cannot do its job of passing on relevant information to people newly coming to Australia. It is an important part of the process that media like this are not only able to train people but to provide the vehicle to assist constituents in Australia, both those newly arrived and those who are part of the original post-war programs. They need to do it on the basis of a program that is funded now. The government needs to fund it into the future.

"Georgiou, Petro, MP",LP,2002-09-23,"—Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to support the motion moved by the member for Calwell in the absence of the member for Reid. I might say that the thoughts of this House today are with the members of the Ferguson family.
There are many things in which Australia leads the world and one of them is multiculturalism. This has essentially been a bipartisan endeavour mounted over the last quarter of a century or more to recognise and respect Australia's cultural and ethnic diversity and it has involved a preparedness by successive governments to assist its evolution. The path has not always been smooth. Multiculturalism has been sniped at by both left and right and there have been moments when governments of both persuasions have been unenthusiastic.
I would like to correct the member for Calwell's misapprehension of history. In terms of full frontal attacks on multiculturalism, I think she really needs to go back to the opening years of the Hawke government when we saw every institution of multiculturalism under astonishing attack. If she doubts this, then I suggest that she looks at the historical record of abolitions and intended terminations of multicultural institutions and programs, not least of all SBS.
It is encouraging that there does seem to have been an abatement of the intensity of the attacks on multiculturalism and I believe that this is due in large part to the high levels of public support for multiculturalism and its achievements. At this point I would like to quote Paul Kelly, who has long been a sceptic about multiculturalism, who recently said:
First we need an end to the domestic culture war ... It means projecting our form of multiculturalism, because whenever I explain to American or European audiences its philosophy, the immediate reaction is, `That's exactly the policy we want'.
Broadcasting is an area in which multiculturalism has made enormous, internationally recognised strides. Fundamentally important to these have been institutional developments made, for instance, in the establishment of SBS and multicultural television. These initiatives are quite unique and are something for which we owe Malcolm Fraser a great debt for his political courage, his social foresight and, not least, his capacity to mould institutions that have survived. But I have to say that the Australian Ethnic Radio Training Project was a Labor initiative some 11 years ago, which has received continued support under the Howard government. Ethnic community broadcasting involves thousands of people committed to maintaining and elaborating their cultural and linguistic heritage in Australia. This involvement emphasises yet again that, far from being disembodied and manufactured by some elite, multiculturalism does spring from and depend on the cultural commitments of our ethnic communities.
Through the AERTP the government has facilitated the expression of these commitments by providing accredited training in ethnic broadcasting. The latest figures available to me indicate that 2,500 broadcasters have participated in AERTP training and that 20,000 training modules have been completed by broadcasters. AERTP has made a significant contribution to ethnic community broadcasting, specifically to new language groups, in the areas of skills development and employment. There are now more than 4,000 people involved every week in ethnic community broadcasting and thousands upon thousands of people involved as listeners. Broadcasters are able to learn technological, production, presentation and organisational skills which have significant benefits across a wide range of areas.
I concur with the motion that the government continue to support the AERTP beyond this financial year, because it has been a success and the need for it continues. I would like to comment on one tendency that I believe needs to be recognised and resisted—that is, the attempt to subsume ethnic community programs in broader programs in the belief that placing them under mainstream program bases will achieve a better outcome. This sounds fine in theory, but experience indicates that it is exceptionally difficult to bring off.
Multiculturalism has made a major contribution to the best Australian values, and ethnic community broadcasts and the skills imparted to ethnic broadcasters by AERTP have been an important part of this. I agree with the chairperson of the National Ethnic Radio Training Taskforce, Mary Kalantzis, who I do not always agree with, when she said:
Skilling ethnic broadcasters builds an inclusive multicultural nation for Australians from all cultural and national backgrounds.
I commend the motion to the House.

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2002-09-23,"—Just over one year ago today, Ansett, one of Australia's largest companies, crashed. Ansett, as most people would be well aware, was the employer of some 17,000 people. It was a victim of not only corporate incompetence but also a raging price war with a better capitalised competitor, Qantas. Not only did Ansett workers and their families suffer; it is estimated that in total some 50,000 jobs across the country were lost as a result of the collapse of that national icon, Ansett. The companies that worked with Ansett and that were reliant upon its existence also went to the wall. It certainly was a tragedy for this nation.
It would be fair to say that in normal circumstances such a corporate tragedy would have attracted a great deal more attention. There would have been more focus and more public discourse about the reasons for the collapse and what assistance could be provided to individuals, businesses and communities hit hardest as a result of the collapse. There would also quite possibly have been an inquiry by the parliament into the way in which that company was mishandled by directors and senior managers, but unfortunately this did not occur. In normal circumstances, the government of the day would be expected to mitigate the effects, if not salvage the situation. But, as we know, the demise of this great aviation carrier occurred within the week of September 11, 2001. It is quite fair to make the point that Ansett suffered badly because it was forgotten in the fog of war.
The government's efforts to respond to this matter have been poor by any comparison. The complicity of the Minister for Transport and Regional Services in the lead-up to this disaster has not been properly acknowledged, although I think it is accepted now by many that, prior to the collapse, he was too ready to take the advice of Ansett's competitor, Qantas, as to whether Ansett was in trouble. Clearly, anyone with any nous would have realised that Qantas was not in a position to provide any impartial advice to the minister or to the government. However, that was the case; the minister accepted such advice and did so wrongfully.
The government's response after the collapse was insufficient. Whilst government may not be in a position to revive corporations that falter, they have an obligation to create an environment that will increase the likelihood of a corporation's revival. Instead of that—instead of supporting bids to get Ansett flying again—the government did little to assist. Qantas was left to capture over 90 per cent of the domestic market share of air travel. At one point, Qantas was able to lease overseas airline fleets from Air Canada, as the Ansett fleet sat on the tarmac in Australian airports across the country. Notwithstanding protests to the contrary, the government seemed quite content that concerted efforts to revive Ansett failed.
We now have a situation where one carrier still controls over 90 per cent of the domestic market share. That shows that the competition policy of this government has not worked at all. Some would say that I am being a little too harsh on the government. Perhaps it is beyond the reach of this government to salvage an important company such as Ansett—but then how do we rate the government in its role of assisting those hardest hit by the Ansett collapse and bringing those responsible for its collapse to account?
On the first count the government has done the bare minimum. By imposing an additional tax on the travelling public the government enabled each employee to receive a maximum of eight weeks redundancy, plus leave entitlements. Many Ansett employees lost more than a year's income that was legally owed to them. However, the government's response was to give them the floor rather than the ceiling amount in terms of entitlements. There have also been unreasonable delays in Ansett families being paid this minimum redundancy. I have spoken to many former Ansett workers who have not been in receipt of redundancy entitlements and, at the same time, have not been eligible for unemployment benefits. The administration of the payments has been insufficient. There should be more care and expedition by the administrators to ensure that proper payment is made to those employees. However small the payments might be, they should be paid immediately. That has not been the case to date.
Contrast the shabby regard the Ansett workers experienced with that experienced by the directors of Ansett and Air New Zealand. Although there is now all but universal recognition that some senior managers and Ansett and Air New Zealand directors were culpable of corporate mismanagement, they were recently paid millions of dollars in directors' fees. What a tragic farce this is. In responding to a question about this hypocrisy last week in parliament, the Prime Minister told us that he sympathised with the Ansett workers and that he acknowledged that directors' fees were inappropriate in the circumstances. But, beyond such comments, he has done little to stop this or any similar practice in the future.
In today's Canberra Times, the Treasurer indicated that there is nothing a government can do to prevent company failure. That may be the case, but there is nothing to stop a government ensuring that directors are not in receipt of moneys they do not deserve in circumstances where employees are losing their jobs and entitlements. The government has failed to ensure that people are afforded their entitlements; contrast that against the experience of those who have been obscenely overpaid, many of whom were responsible for the collapse in the first place. The community wants their government to right wrongs, not merely pity those on the wrong end of corporate incompetence or corruption. There is an urgent need for legislation to prevent obscenely high directors' fees being paid in such circumstances.
Finally, the communities of my electorate of Burke want to know what regional assistance will be provided to areas affected by the Ansett collapse. Despite requests for the government to provide some support and create employment and business opportunities in the Sunbury, Macedon and Melton regions, so far the government has done nothing. Compare the way the government responded to the closure of BHP in Newcastle with what it has done in the region I represent in response to the Ansett collapse. It is sadly absent from assisting the region in and around my electorate.
I could argue that more jobs have been lost in the region I represent as a result of the collapse of Ansett than were lost as a result of even that tragic closure in Newcastle, but Newcastle was in receipt of up to $10 million of Commonwealth moneys. There were efforts to provide some assistance to re-employ workers, train redundant workers, and create employment opportunities and an environment in which business could thrive in order to have Newcastle recover from that closure. There has been no response by the government with respect to the Ansett demise and its consequential effects upon the region I represent. I call upon the government to respond to the requests we are making at the local level to provide such assistance.
Six months ago, a delegation from the region met with officers of the Prime Minister and the responsible minister to request some assistance. The delegation explained that we were not looking for a handout; we were asking for assistance so that we could help ourselves. I am happy to say that that delegation included representatives from small businesses in the area, former Ansett employees, councils and community groups; it was a committee that represented a cross-section of the community. However, since that delegation met with the officers of the Prime Minister and the minister responsible, there has been no effort by this government to look at the proposals we put to them. That is why I rise to today. Despite all the efforts we have made through departmental channels to seek resolution, we have received nothing.

"Kelly, Jackie, MP",LP,2002-09-23,"—I move:
That the amendments be agreed to.
I thank honourable members for their contributions to the debate on the Customs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002. The amendments will contribute to the management and protection of Australia's borders. During the debate on the bill in the Senate, the government moved one amendment and agreed to two Australian Democrats amendments relating to the strict liability offences in schedule 1 to the bill. The government supports these amendments as passed in the Senate.

"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,2002-09-23,"—The Labor Party support strong security laws to protect Australian people from international terrorism, but we do not support John Howard's ASIO bill. The job of smashing international terrorism is far from over, but this legislation is the wrong way to achieve that goal. We want to hunt down and arrest the terrorists, but only the terrorists. We want to protect peaceful, law-abiding Australians from infringements on their rights. The question that has to be asked again is: why can't the government get this bill right? Why can't it learn? This government is always going too far and undermining civil liberties. In the name of protecting civil liberties, it undermines them. It has ignored widespread public opposition to this bill. It has ignored the strong warnings of two parliamentary committees containing members of the coalition parties. Why? The answer is simple: once again, the government is seeking to play politics with our national security, and Labor will not allow it.
Throughout this debate, Labor have advanced three main arguments. First, the process has been flawed. Good legislation can achieve bipartisan cooperation but it will not ever happen if the government simply wants to play politics. Second, the fundamental principles of equality, fairness and balance have been ignored. Third, the policy prescription of giving more coercive powers to ASIO is the wrong way to achieve the goal of greater security from terrorism for Australians.
Legislation to strengthen Australia's security against terrorism has already passed the parliament, but the bills originally introduced by the government to achieve that end also went too far. In relation to those bills, Labor pressed for amendments to correct serious flaws. We ensured that humanitarian groups were not affected by the sloppily-drafted treason offences and that the definition of `terrorist acts' contained the higher level of intent associated with terrorism. We were able to make the legislation better, ensuring that terrorists, but only terrorists, were targeted. Most importantly, we ensured that the government's proposal which gave the Attorney-General the power to ban organisations never saw the light of day.
As a result of amendments to the earlier bills, those pieces of legislation were greatly improved. They are now balanced and supported by the majority of Australians. This is extremely important, because the war on terror can only be won if the Australian people are unified—only if they have confidence that the laws combating terrorism will be implemented impartially, only if these laws are balanced and only if those laws do not infringe on their rights.
It is very interesting that the Prime Minister himself made the following acknowledgment at the National Press Club recently in relation to these bills that I spoke of previously:
We have, of necessity, tightened our security laws. I believe through the great parliamentary processes that this country has I believe that we have got the balance right.
The truth, though, is that the changes to make the legislation more balanced were achieved despite the opposition, initially, of the Prime Minister. If it were up to him, we would not have balanced laws; we would have unbalanced, draconian laws—and that is the problem with this bill. Labor were criticised at the time for insisting on our amendments, but once again our strong stand has been vindicated. Without our amendments, those laws would have been weaker. The difference between Labor and the government on this bill is clear. Not only will Labor combat terrorism; we will protect the liberties that terrorists want to destroy. The government's bill, if not significantly amended, will do long-term damage to our rights. This bill arguably goes further than any legislation has ever gone. This bill does not strike the right balance between security and protecting our rights.
Two parliamentary committee reports have been undertaken on this bill: one by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD and the other by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. Both contained members of the coalition and both reported unanimously. Here is what the government's own chairman of the parliamentary joint committee, the member for Fadden, had to say:
The bill is one of the most controversial pieces of legislation considered by the parliament in recent times.
...					...					...
The proposed legislation, in its original form—
and that is important to underline—
would undermine key legal rights and erode the civil liberties that make Australia a leading democracy.
That is what the chairman, the member for Fadden, observed. I cannot for the life of me understand why the government is not getting the message.
The committees proposed a number of important amendments. They proposed a seven-day limit on detention; the requirement for representation by security-cleared lawyers; protocols governing detention and interview that are subject to parliamentary scrutiny; protection against self-incrimination; the exclusion of anyone under 18 years of age from interrogation and detention; accountability and reporting measures in relation to warrants; and a three-year sunset clause. The joint parliamentary committee made 15 recommendations in all. The government has accepted 10 of them, but it has rejected the five key recommendations that would have made this bill more acceptable. I want to focus on three of the most important recommendations out of the five that the government at this stage is saying it will not adopt.
First, even ASIO has agreed that the detention of children needs to be reviewed. These provisions contravene up to six articles of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child. It is simply wrong to treat children this way, and just as Labor want the children kept out of detention centres, we want them excluded from detention under this bill. The second recommendation is that there be a three-year sunset clause. The joint committee has proposed a sunset clause that will terminate this legislation after three years, but the government opposes it. Labor believe that a sunset clause would be a significant accountability mechanism. The new US anti-terror legislation, the Patriot Act, contains such a clause; so should our legislation. The third recommendation is that the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security be present during ASIO interviews and have the power to stop them if necessary. The government rejects this sensible recommendation. We must remember that these powers of detention and interrogation for ASIO are new. These powers are normally limited to the police; therefore, some degree of oversight is necessary.
In addition to those three recommendations, Labor have two further concerns not raised by the joint parliamentary committee. We are concerned that the bill allows people to be detained who are not suspected of any criminal activity and that the bill allows people to be questioned by ASIO rather than by a law enforcement agency. These two measures involve a radical departure from established legal and human rights principles, and they go further than equivalent US or UK laws. While the US can detain aliens without charge, it cannot do so with its own citizens. If passed in its current form, this bill could be challenged by the High Court because it breaches basic constitutional and legal principles. If the bill is passed in its current form, Australians not suspected of any offence could be detained by ASIO for questioning. If the bill is passed in its current form, those detained by ASIO would not have the right to legal advice. If the bill is passed in its current form, ASIO would be given powers to detain children for questioning. For those reasons also, the amended ASIO bill proposed by the government is unacceptable to us. It is our belief that the measures being insisted upon by the government are unnecessary to combat terrorism.
ASIO already has extensive powers to investigate terrorist activities, including the use of telecommunications interception, listening devices, tracking devices, covert searches and inspection of postal items. The Australian Federal Police's authority to investigate terrorist activities has also been broadened this year with the enactment of new offences relating to terrorist organisations. The new powers proposed in this bill are designed with one objective only: to play wedge politics with our nation's security. It is the fourth time in the last 12 months that the government have played this card. They have failed on every occasion. First, it was over the boat arrivals. They put forward unworkable legislation that they later had to change to acknowledge Labor's objections. They tried it over the excision of islands from our migration zone, and then they tried it over Iraq.
But, since April, Labor has consistently argued for a formal parliamentary debate and a UN based solution. We argued for a timetable for Iraqi compliance with UN resolutions, followed, if necessary, by a further resolution outlining appropriate action. When Labor adopted this policy we were labelled appeasers. I was even accused of sounding like Saddam Hussein. But now the government itself has adopted our policy. On the weekend I heard the Prime Minister saying, just as he was flying out to Nigeria, that he wanted a tough new resolution through the United Nations in terms of Iraqi compliance. That is what we have been calling for since April, Prime Minister. I think the sooner you understand the importance of working with us to achieve the common objective, not just your political objectives, the better for this nation.
The government has been caught out playing politics with our national security, and I think the Australian public has had enough of its tactics. We will not be intimidated by that crude piece of blackmail. I note that the Prime Minister recently told the Chinese Communist Party—can you believe it: the Prime Minister speaking to the Chinese Communist Party cadres—that our democracy had been strengthened because we as a nation had resisted Liberal Party pressure in the 1950s to ban the Communist Party. At the same time he was telling the cadres that, he was arguing for new laws to ban not just one party but any organisation he regarded as a threat. This is breathtaking hypocrisy: one message overseas when it suits the occasion, another strategy back here at home.
But the Prime Minister seems destined to repeat the mistakes of the past with this ASIO bill. We defeated his attempts with the terrorism bills that would have seen outlawed organisations he regards as a threat. The Australian people are very wary of giving executive government too much power. They were right 50 years ago, as the Prime Minister himself concedes. So why can't he see that this bill is even worse? 
The Prime Minister's own party is beginning to split over this attack on civil liberties. Here in this House the member for Kooyong had this to say during the debate on this bill:
 the measures we employ to combat the new terrorism must not undermine our core values: the rule of law, due process, civil liberties and freedom of speech  we must be careful not to forsake them in the battle against terrorism.
These words are a direct challenge to the Prime Minister. Now is the time for all of those so-called small `l' liberals to come out and defend the principles they claim to stand for: the member for Curtin; the member for Cook; the member for Sturt; Braveheart—will we see him?—the Minister for Education, Science and Training; Senator Payne; Senator Hill; and their so-called leader, the Treasurer, who is overseas at the moment. It is time for them to show whether they have any principles or whether they too are going to be hypocritical in relation to this legislation. It is time to show whether they have the courage to follow Labor's lead and stand up to John Howard and his reactionary agenda. Just as we showed the way in terms of the terrorism legislation, so too are we showing the way in relation to the ASIO bill.
The Australian people will not accept these infringements to their rights. As foreshadowed earlier in this debate, when the bill is introduced into the Senate Labor will move a referral to a Senate references committee to examine alternative ways of enhancing the capacity of our law enforcement agencies to counter terrorism without compromising civil liberties. Labor proposes that the Senate committee develop an alternative regime in which questioning to obtain intelligence relating to terrorism is conducted not by ASIO but by the Australian Federal Police, including appropriate arrangements for detention of terrorist suspects and questioning of persons not suspected of any offence.
We also propose an examination of the relationship between ASIO and the Australian Federal Police in the investigation of terrorist activities as offences. We also propose a review of the adequacy of Australia's current information and intelligence gathering methods for the investigation of potential terrorist activities or offences. We also want the committee to look at reviewing recent overseas legislation dealing with the investigation of potential terrorist activities or offences, and to examine whether this bill, in its current or amended form, is constitutionally sound.
These are all questions the government should have asked itself. These are all questions the government should have been prepared to report to this chamber on and has not. That is the reason we have a second reading amendment in this place, but we do not hold our breath. What we do know is that we have to get it right. That is why we will use the forms of the other chamber to address these key issues. This is a government that has had more than 12 months to come up with laws that will provide new protections against terrorism. We have passed the first anniversary of September 11 and they have had those 12 months to do what they said they would do at the time of the events of September 11 last year. They have failed. They have failed because they have played politics rather than doing the right thing.
Australia does need new laws to deal with terrorists and to protect the rights of its citizens. In its current form this bill does neither. It misses the mark because it is not directed at terrorists. Labor will cooperate to give our nation the strong security laws it needs. The government should withdraw the bill, enter into discussions with us and get agreement on sensible proposals. We must get the balance right; we must do what we did with the terrorism bills again on this occasion. If the government misses that opportunity, it will only have itself to blame if this legislation fails to pass the Senate. It will come back here and it will end up in further discussions. But, if the government is serious about addressing this issue in a balanced way, it knows it can rely on Labor to support that direction. We have done it before and we have shown the way forward on this occasion. I urge the government to adopt the sensible suggestions that Labor has advocated.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Grierson, Sharon, MP",ALP,2002-09-23,"—I rise to speak on this controversial legislation—legislation that regrettably is an insult to the strength and decency of our Australian democracy. Like my opposition colleagues and my opposition leader, I oppose the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 and support our amendment. In doing so, I particularly castigate the government for its failure to respond to the rigorous analysis and evaluation by its own committees—committees of this parliament—which recommended changes to this repressive legislation. It seems that the government's persistence with this bill, a bill which deviates so completely from the principles of law that our freedom and liberties are based upon, has more to do with its agenda to govern by promoting division and fear than by any serious intent to enhance the Commonwealth's ability to combat terrorism.
The ASIO bill has had a long gestation before presentation to the parliament in its current form; a gestation born from the terror of mass destruction and human suffering that took place in New York on September 11. This sad and confronting event provoked recognition by countries like ours that terrorism has no boundaries and no predictable form. The events of September 11 had very special significance in that they showed that weapons of mass destruction did not have to come in the form of nuclear weapons or biological and chemical warfare wielded by military forces of a country waging war. Instead, they could come about through the determined and criminal activity of international terrorists in the name of hatred, zealotry and anger, rather than as acts of an officially declared war.
On this side of the House we have always been willing to respond to this new threat of international terrorism through effective and responsible counter-terrorism legislation. We have shown our genuine willingness to cooperate with the government to protect our citizens from terrorist attack. But in all our negotiations and suggested amendments our purpose has been clear: the recognition of the need to protect our nation and its people from terrorist attack has at all times been balanced with the understanding that we must simultaneously protect the rights and freedoms of our citizens—rights and freedoms that historically Australian men and women have been prepared to protect and defend with their lives.
The resultant package of antiterrorism legislation recently passed by the parliament was subjected to that careful scrutiny. It was also the subject of considerable debate by the community. The outcome was that a set of antiterrorism bills was passed in this House after significant improvement. That improvement was made possible by the contribution of members of the opposition and by the contribution of members of the community who put forward their ideas to make this legislation effective and fair. Inclusive consultation and consideration of different viewpoints were a recipe for success in that case. Australia has now met its obligations under United Nations resolution 1373 and enacted antiterrorism legislation as serious offences under domestic law.
Through the diligence of the Labor opposition, humanitarian groups will not be affected by the new treason offences and any possibility that protest or individual action could be dealt with as terrorist offences has been removed. Through pressure by Labor and by the public, offences in the terrorism legislation now only target terrorist activities and the definition of terrorist acts has been improved by including the necessary high level of intent that guides criminal law in this country. Similarly and most importantly, the proposal to give the Attorney-General power to proscribe and ban organisations has been totally removed. However, in spite of similar efforts by the Labor opposition and by members of the Australian public, and even by members of the coalition, no similar improvements have been made to the ASIO legislation. It seems that the Attorney-General and the Prime Minister are determined to put before the Australian parliament legislation that civil libertarians, constitutional lawyers, religious and civic leaders and the government's own bipartisan parliamentary committee rejected. That is exactly what the bill deserves—rejection by both houses of this parliament.
The original bill was introduced to the parliament six months ago and only now is the bill subject to debate. Apparently 12 months since September 11 the government needs wide powers now to detain and interrogate its own citizens about any threat of terrorist attacks. Its credibility is seriously strained on any suggestion by the government that this legislation is urgently needed to protect us from international terrorism. This bill is excessive given that the package of five antiterrorism bills passed earlier this year significantly broadened the powers of the Australian Federal Police and ASIO. In that capacity, ASIO already has extensive powers to investigate terrorist activities: powers of surveillance, interception, tracking, covert searches and inspection of postal items. That means every communication mode is accessible to ASIO. That should mean that they have significant data about any threats to the security of this nation.
Unfortunately, the ASIO legislation before the House that would purport to be a necessary response to the events of September 11 is unacceptable in its present form. Currently, it is open to abuse that is totally unacceptable to Australian citizens. The abuse of power and authority and the abuse of citizens' rights and liberties are unacceptable to our Australian way of life; they are unacceptable to this Labor opposition as well. 
Given the lack of urgency and our history of a stable and peaceful democracy, this ASIO bill goes much further than is reasonable or necessary and must be opposed. It proposes to enhance the Commonwealth's ability to combat terrorism by amending the definition of `politically motivated violence' and also by giving ASIO special powers relating to the investigation of terrorism offences, including warrants requiring persons to attend for questioning before a prescribed authority without a lawyer and, in certain circumstances, to be detained for 48 hours and potentially indefinitely.
In its original form when introduced last March, the bill proposed that powers be extended to ASIO to allow for adults and children to be detained, to be strip searched and to be questioned without any charge being placed on these people. That detention was for periods of 48 hours, which could be extended continuously. During that detention Australians charged with no offence could be denied access to people outside of ASIO and could not inform family members, their employers or even their lawyer of their detention. To detain a person would have needed an official warrant from a prescribed authority—that is, from a federal magistrate or from a member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. That would seem to give some protection against the nebulous or nefarious issuing of warrants; however, in this day and age of short-term contracts and appointments, the independence of bodies such as the AAT no longer has the same confident acceptance by the Australian public. Perhaps the `children overboard' incident has exacerbated the fear that separation of powers no longer applies when public servants are providing independent advice to a government with a particular and determined agenda—a sad development in a nation that once had exemplary practice.
Under the original legislation, to be detained, no charges needed to be laid or even any reason established for future charges. Warrants for detention and questioning could be issued simply on the suspicion that a person or persons may be able to substantially assist the collection of intelligence that was important in relation to a terrorism offence. Under the original legislation, no access to legal advice would be given; in fact, a penalty of five years imprisonment could apply to anyone who refused to answer any self-incriminating questions. So, even though information given could be admissible in any prosecution of a terrorism offence, an interviewee could not decline to answer. One wonders what other ways would be used to persuade suspects to answer questions. Historically, ASIO has not had powers of detention. The original ASIO bill significantly changed the role of ASIO, transferring it from an intelligence gathering body to a body with powers of coercion and detention. In that new context, the present bill deserves close scrutiny indeed.
There have been some changes to the original legislation, and they are what we are dealing with in this debate. In March the ASIO bill was referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. The parliamentary committee tabled its report, which was then taken into consideration by the Senate committee. But the Senate committee went slightly further and looked at whether the government actually had the power to do the things the bill provides for under the legislation. In reviewing the parliamentary joint committee recommendations, the Senate committee agreed completely with the recommendations put forward to amend the bill. The Senate committee also expressed its view that, if the government responded to those recommendations, it would then allow the bill to proceed and be examined further in the Senate committee stage. 
Both parliamentary committees found that, in its original form, the bill would be open to serious abuse. They proposed a number of amendments, including a seven-day limit on detention; the requirement for representation by lawyers who were security cleared; protocols for detention and interview which would be subject to parliamentary scrutiny; protection against self-incrimination; the exclusion of anyone under 18 from interrogation and detention; accountability and reporting measures in relation to the issue of warrants; and a three-year sunset clause. It is important that we examine those recommendations and see what we now have before us in the bill.
When the government looked at those recommendations, it supported only 10 and omitted five very significant recommendations. Those were recommendations that guaranteed access to legal representation. The government rejected this suggestion and now proposes to allow legal representation only after 48 hours of detention and interrogation. Even after 48 hours, no private consultation between the detainee and their legal representative would be allowed without ASIO present. I must agree with the statement by the president of the Law Council of Australia, Mr Tony Abbott, when he said:
The suspicion is that ASIO wants to extract information under interrogation using methods which it couldn't if a lawyer was present. 
These are the methods we would associate with police states and repressive regimes, not with the law enforcement practices we expect in this country.
The other recommendation that was rejected was the suggestion that definite protocols be developed to govern custody, detention and interview processes and that those be developed before the legislation could take effect. Although the government now includes in the legislation some acceptance of the need to develop such protocols, it insists the bill be put into effect without delay. Of course, those protocols could take a very long time to develop. The recommendation regarding children suggested that no child younger than 18 should be able to be subject to this legislation. The government's response has been to extend this protection only to children under 14. That means that, under this legislation, children between 14 and 18 years could be detained if under suspicion and not have their lawyer and parent or guardian present. This seems to fly in the face of our practice and respect for a protective juvenile justice system. After listening to the Leader of the Opposition, who cited the UN convention for the protection of children, we would certainly suggest that an advocate for children is seriously needed in this country.
The recommendation that provided a three-year sunset clause was changed by the government to a review process in three years. But, of course, that process is most unclear. The other suggestion by the parliamentary joint committee, that the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security be given the power to intervene if concerns were raised about noncompliance or improper conduct by ASIO, was also rejected. It seems the government considers this role as unnecessary and inappropriate and instead allows in its bill for any concerns to be raised with the Director-General of ASIO or with the prescribed agency that issued the detention. This would mean that there would be no external scrutiny of the activities of ASIO with regard to the issuing of warrants or for the detention and interrogation of persons suspected of having knowledge of terrorist acts.
By not responding to these important recommendations from its own joint parliamentary committee, which were endorsed by the Senate committee, the government has failed to deliver for this country acceptable legislation. In fact, this legislation in its current form, which allows ASIO to detain and interrogate people who are not actually charged with any offence, may in fact not be constitutional. This is a radical departure from established legal and human rights practice and precedents. As such, if this legislation were enacted and implemented, it would undoubtedly be tested through the judicial appeals system at first application. Such a situation must be avoided. It would place ASIO personnel in the front line of this scrutiny and no doubt compromise the need for secrecy and protection of ASIO employees that has been accepted practice.
Currently the measures incorporated in the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 resemble those of a police state or a dictatorship. This bill goes further than similar laws in the United Kingdom, the USA and Canada. Although those countries have had more experience of terrorism and are certainly more likely targets for terrorist acts than Australian is, their laws do not allow for the detention of citizens who have not been expressly suspected of or charged with any offence.
Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 8.00 p.m.
—As I was saying before the suspension, no citizens of the United Kingdom, the USA and Canada can be detained in secret without legal advice. If the ASIO legislation is passed, that will not be the case in Australia. Australians have a healthy respect for their law enforcement bodies and for their intelligence and security agencies; but, equally, Australians have a healthy suspicion of authority. On too many occasions the Australian public has witnessed abuse of power by those in authority. Although they may represent a minority, we are all aware of incidents where excessive use of policing powers has made us question the integrity of those involved. Every month in our media we see examples of abuse of power and authority, whether they occur in the church, in child care, in aged care, in education or in the police or armed forces. So suspicion has its foundation in the reality of human experience. But at least we knew of these incidents and at least those incidents were subjected to open investigation. In many cases we also saw justice done and the abusers of their positions of authority exposed and penalised under the law.
This will not be the case with the ASIO legislation. Australian citizens detained and interrogated incommunicado, without legal representation and without actually being charged with any offence and who then may be subjected to abuse would have no redress. The ASIO legislation does not include any accountability processes or penalties for those who abuse this authority. That is not good enough. If we are to grant ASIO police powers, then we must also grant it the same accountability, the same checks and balances that regulate the application of these powers. Although the legislation now says police will handle the arrest and detention, ASIO will decide who is to be arrested and who is to be detained, and it will be ASIO who conducts the interviews. ASIO should not been placed in this invidious position, a position that could potentially compromise its effectiveness. It should remain an intelligence organisation, not a law enforcement body.
If our freedoms and democratic rights are suppressed or perverted in the name of authority or under the threat of terrorism, then we are the losers and terrorists are the victors. So why would the government resist these recommendations to protect our democracy? Is the threat of terrorism so great? Not according to the Attorney-General or to the Director-General of ASIO. Does the government lack confidence in the law enforcement, security and intelligence agencies in this country? That does not seem likely, given that we hosted the Commonwealth heads of government conference this year incident free. So is the real reason, as Simon Crean the opposition leader suggested, wedge politics? The simple answer is yes. This government again is determined to look tougher than anyone else—tough on terrorists and tough on detainees, whether they be Australian citizens or refugees. This government intends to continue to govern through promoting fear and division in our country.
But in the case of the ASIO bill, which has such universal condemnation, the government will not succeed. Australians prize freedom and Australians will oppose threats to their freedoms, whether they come from without or within. They will not abide a government that seeks to take their freedoms away. For the sake of our democracy and our freedom, the ASIO legislation must be opposed.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"O'Connor, Gavan, MP",ALP,2002-09-23,"—The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 is a bill which, in its present form, ought not to have made it to the floor of this parliament. If the so-called progressives in the Liberal Party, the self-styled protectors of our civil liberties on the conservative side of politics, had done their job and their duty, this awful legislation would never have been presented to this House in its present form. It is an indication of how far right the Howard government really is in political terms, how weak the Treasurer really is within the bowels of his own government and caucus, and how insipid the so-called Liberal progressives really are that they have been rolled so emphatically and so easily on such an important issue.
Members opposite ought be in no doubt about how the Australian community, particularly the people in my electorate of Corio, feel about the attack on their civil liberties by the Howard government which is contained in this legislation. My electorate has a strong ethnic community. Many have settled in this country, fleeing repressive and politically excessive regimes that have on occasions attacked their civil liberties and denied them their freedoms. My electorate of Corio encompasses the Geelong community and has a strong union movement which has historically been at the forefront of protecting the rights of workers to organise and assemble, often in the face of intense provocation and repressive legislation that has been introduced by conservative Liberal governments at either the state or the federal level. They have a long proud tradition of opposing such repressive governments and legislation.
It is also an electorate that, in its church community, boasts an activism and vigilance in defence of the political rights of others in overseas countries such as East Timor. Naturally, they look on this piece of legislation with considerable unease and, in some cases, alarm. So when those alarm bells do ring for them on legislation that threatens their civil liberties and those of their fellow Australians, and fails to achieve an appropriate balance between the needs of security and the civil liberties of citizens in a democracy, then I am duty bound to bring these concerns to the attention of the House. And concerned they are; I have had many representations from members of church groups, the trade union movement and ethnic communities in Geelong on this issue.
This bill is a spectacular case of policy failure by the Howard government. It is a policy failure for the following reasons—and these have been canvassed by members here in the debate thus far. This legislation fails to achieve an appropriate balance between security considerations, the need to protect the community and, of course, the need to protect the civil liberties of citizens in a democracy. That is the essential yardstick by which we must judge this piece of legislation. It would be remiss of any opposition in a democratic society, in a house of parliament democratically elected, to fail to articulate the concerns of people—not only those in the community but also those of all political persuasions within this parliament—who are concerned about elements of this legislation. This bill is a policy failure because the Liberal Party in government has failed to use the parliamentary processes to good effect, and I will speak a little about this later on in the debate. However, we know that this legislation has been scrutinised by two parliamentary committees thus far. In an attempt to improve this legislation, those committees have made very good and sensible recommendations which have largely been ignored by the government, and I think we are entitled to ask why. Indeed, further on in my address on this bill, I will seek to explain for my constituents why the government has done so.
With this legislation there has been an inherent failure, in the wake of September 11, to more quickly address the problems of terrorism. In the wake of September 11, ensuring the safety of Australians from terrorist attack became an urgent matter that had to be attended to by the national government of the day and, of course, legislation was presented to this parliament for that purpose. But why has it taken this particular bill so long to get into the parliament—leaving aside the time it has taken for the parliamentary committees to go about their particular work? It is a policy failure on the part of the government because, in the face of overwhelming evidence and concern, the government has failed to come up with a bill that can achieve the unanimous support of both houses of this parliament.
Let us go to the first issue: the balance between the security needs of the community and the civil liberties of its citizens. We live in a democracy which has a proud democratic tradition, and there are important pillars on which that democracy is based and sustains itself over time. In our democracy we operate under the rule of law, with the separation of powers between the executive and the judiciary. We operate on the basis that people in this society do have rights and freedoms. They have the right to demonstrate, the right to assemble, the right to speak freely on issues and the right to practise in a religious sense according to the dictates of their personal beliefs. Individuals have political rights and legal rights that are protected in our democracy. If there has been a fundamental criticism of this particular bill, it is in this particular area: the rights of individuals and the failure of the government in this piece of legislation to protect those rights.
I am not alone in voicing that particular concern; it has been expressed by independent academics and by the constituencies that I have referred to in my own electorate. It has also been articulated by members of the government party itself, operating in the environment of the committee system of these great houses of parliament. Those two committees made very substantial recommendations to improve this legislation along the lines that we have been arguing for. Indeed, in those committees members on this side of the House participated freely, bringing their intellect and experience to bear on the great issues that are thrown before us in this legislation. Members on the Labor side came to certain conclusions that this legislation needed to be improved—but they were not on their own: there were Liberal members who agreed with them. Indeed, on the committee, with a Liberal member in the chair, unanimous recommendations were made to the government to improve this legislation. One would have thought that that would have been enough for the government to improve this legislation in line with the thinking of the parliament and the Australian community—but it has failed to do so.
We need to ask the fundamental question here: what is the problem that we are attempting to address by this legislation, and how are we are addressing that problem. We have not heard a coherent statement from the government of the extent of the terrorist threat to Australia. We all know of the capacity of terrorists in the modern era and, where there are issues of security for the Australian community at stake, we on this side of the House do not deny the necessity for the government to strengthen the powers to detain and to interrogate.
I really take umbrage at the inference by members opposite that the party of which I am a member is not concerned about the security of Australians. It seems to me that the conservatives in the Australian political system always resort to this particular charge. I have children. I have an extended family. I have an interest in their personal security above everything else. I also have an interest in the security of the community that I represent on the floor of the parliament. So I do not need any lecture from any member opposite about my bona fides on this issue of security for Australians. Yet it seems to be that when the government members are backed into a corner on argument they resort to that sort of statement.
We know that there are significant shortcomings in this legislation. It is fundamentally inconsistent with democratic practice as we know it here in Australia, and that has been confirmed by the processes of this parliament. Two committees of the parliament—involving members of all political persuasions—have come to the conclusion that this legislation is fundamentally flawed. There is potential for abuse, and that has been highlighted by many of the commentators who have entered the public arena in criticism of elements of this legislation. They have not criticised the need for greater security nor have they criticised the need to sharpen some of the existing powers to detain and interrogate. But they have taken issue with placing these new powers with ASIO and they have highlighted the potential for abuse in the system.
Make no mistake: this legislation changes fundamentally the way ASIO will operate. It in effect creates a secret police. ASIO is a secret organisation. It operates under legislation of this parliament, and we demand that it operates with a high level of accountability and as much public security as can be achieved in a democratic society when we in our own interest are required to structure secret organisations to work on our behalf. But this legislation extends ASIO's power in a new way. It gives ASIO new powers of detention and interrogation and of course it alters fundamentally the nature of that organisation.
One would have thought that any government bringing this legislation into this parliament would have made sure that the legislation was constitutionally tight. But of course we have seen some very strong legal debate on whether in fact this legislation is constitutional. But I think the most telling feature of this legislation is the fact that it goes further than any other piece of legislation in the comparable democracies of the United States and the United Kingdom. We have to ask ourselves why this is so. Why is it that the Australian government is going further than any other country that is in the alliance against terrorism? The Australian people want to know that.
We have real concerns here on the Labor side, and they have been articulated by the Leader of the Opposition. We are concerned at the detention of children and the violation of six UN articles in the process. We wonder why there is not a three-year sunset clause. We know that sunset clauses by themselves impose a significant discipline on any legislation. We are concerned about the legal representation of people who are detained, and the expansion of ASIO's powers and the new powers of detention and interrogation. And, as I have said, we are concerned that the law goes further than comparable laws in other countries.
I asked myself: why is this legislation in its present form on the floor of this House? I think the Leader of the Opposition gave a clue to that in his address to the House of Representatives earlier on today. If we look at the history of conservative parties in this country we know that they have form in this area. We only have to go back to the 1950s, when the then Liberal government brought legislation into this House to ban the Communist Party. It was opposed by Labor at the time; it was defeated by the community in a referendum. Where was the great Liberal tradition, the great democratic tradition, then? One might ask: where is it now?
We get a clue to the conservative psyche if we go back to the recent experience in Victoria. Some members might say I am a little extreme in mentioning the Kennett government but I had one particular commentator say to me that the Kennett government, the Liberal Party in government practice, was a cross between an old Soviet-style republic and fascist Italy. Why was that so? Look at the behaviour of the Kennett government; let me take you through what it did. It abolished a tier of democratic government—local government—and replaced it with what we called commissars. In Victoria they were called commissioners but they were beholden to the central authority, the central state authority, who controlled the political appointments and the purse strings. The Kennett government developed an ugly link between the corporate sector and the government of the day, and it was the favoured few who were in the know and the rest of the business community were on the outside. That eventually turned the business community en masse against the Kennett government.
Then we had the circuses created to keep the peasants happy—the grand prix, the casino and all the great extravagant public events, and the cult of the leader around Jeff Kennett: `We know what is best for you. It's not really as bad as you make out. Leave it to me.' Then we had the subtle erosion of civil liberties in legislation. A conservative lawyer friend of mine—someone I respected, from a large Catholic family—came to me on one occasion with a long list of amendments to legislation in the state of Victoria that curtailed the right of appeal and made it more difficult for individuals to exercise their democratic rights. That is happening here in this legislation. Not much has changed. I suspect that the Prime Minister is misusing the events of September 11 and engaging, as the Leader of the Opposition said, in wedge politics.
The Australian community do not like that, and they have a good nose for bad legislation and a good nose for when legislation really impacts adversely on their democratic rights. This is such legislation, and I urge those members on the opposite side, the wets in the Liberal Party who have those deep concerns, to make them known in a public sense, and to force the Attorney-General, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer—`old yella' we call him on this side—to make sure this legislation is amended.

"Jull, David, MP",LP,2002-09-23,"—As Chairman of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD, a committee commissioned by this parliament to examine the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 we are debating tonight, it was not my intention to speak in this debate. However, what I have been hearing over the last few hours and, indeed, over the last week of the sitting, has brought me into this House with a sense of some frustration, some sorrow and some anger about the blatant hypocrisy that we have been hearing preached at us from the opposition's side of the House.
I would like to remind the House tonight that the report to the parliament in June this year from that committee was unanimous. And who constitutes that committee? There are four members of the government and three members of the opposition on it. And who are the three members of the opposition? The member for Brand is one. He is the former Leader of the Opposition, a former defence minister and a former member of the security committee of the cabinet. Senator Robert Ray is another member. He is also a former defence minister and former member of the security committee of the cabinet. And the member for Watson is also a member. He is a former Speaker of this House.
In terms of that report that came to the House, there was not one dissenting voice. There was not one vote taken on that committee. That committee met for a great number of hours and received 160 public submissions. We had public hearings. We went through this bill and we made some pretty stern recommendations to the government about how we believed it should be treated—about the provisions of the bill and about our concerns about some aspects of the bill and its possible effect on the civil liberties of Australians. All in all, that committee made some 15 different recommendations. Let us have a look at the government's response to those, in terms of what it is doing with this legislation.
The first recommendation from the committee has been accepted by the government. The second recommendation has been accepted by the government. The third recommendation has been accepted by the government. The fourth recommendation has been accepted by the government. The sixth recommendation has been accepted in part by the government. That was the recommendation concerning the legal representation for persons who were the subject of a warrant. We recommended that a panel of security cleared senior lawyers, recommended perhaps by the Law Council of Australia, could sit in on the entire proceedings at the prescribed authority and represent a person at further hearings which sought to extend any detention. The recommendation was also that when they first appeared before a prescribed authority detained persons could be advised that they could have access to legal representation. The government has accepted that in part, and I must say the recommendations from the government certainly do not destroy the impact of the proposals that the committee put to the parliament.
The seventh recommendation has been accepted by the government. The eighth recommendation has been accepted by the government. The ninth recommendation has been accepted by the government. The 10th recommendation, the detention of children, has been accepted in part by the government. There was a very real concern within the community of Australia that 10-year-olds could be taken into detention, that they could be strip searched, that they could go through all that. Our recommendation was that children under 18 should not be included in this legislation. All right, the government has not accepted that recommendation in full. It has put a cut-off at the age of 14, but it has established a separate regime to look after the interests of any child that might be picked up as part of some ongoing inquiry into terrorist activities.
The 11th recommendation has been accepted by the government. The government did not accept the sunset clause of the 12th recommendation, but it put in its alternative proposal. The government has a much more formalised review process going in, but what is true is that this legislation is going to be reviewed. It is going to be reviewed in 12 months time. There is going to be an ongoing review. It is going to come back to the parliament. It is going back to the joint committee. And I have no problems with the angle the government has come at from that. The 13th recommendation has been accepted by the government. The 14th recommendation is one that has not been accepted by the government, but there is an alternative proposal and it is a vast improvement in terms of the activities of the inspector-general and how he would be involved in the processes. The 15th recommendation on the judicial review has been accepted.
All in all, we have three clauses that have been changed. I do not think that is a bad effort from the government. That effort follows from a very serious report that was undertaken most seriously by the members of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD—remembering that three members of that committee, the member for Brand, Senator Robert Ray and the member for Watson represented the Labor Party and made a magnificent contribution to the hearings and review we had. They are men who, I dare say, have some of the finest brains in the Labor Party here in this parliament. And here we hear this absolute hypocrisy and tripe coming from the other side, who are making a real effort to make a political football out of this at a time when our first priority should be the security of Australia. Surely that is the prime purpose for which this parliament meets and the prime reason we have a democratic government in Australia—to make sure that the security of this country is protected. And who can tell me that we are not living in different times?
The other line that really gets in my craw is that there is no danger, there is no threat of terrorist activities in Australia. The line that is always used, whether it is by the government or the Director-General of ASIO, is that there is no known threat in Australia. There is a very great difference between a threat and no known threat. We have to be vigilant all the time. It is all very well to say, `Australia has not had any experience of terrorism.' That is rubbish. We have been victims of terrorist attacks in Australia. Go back 30 years to the bombings at the height of the Croatian and Serbian problems in Melbourne; to the Hilton Hotel bombing; to the bombing of the Turkish Consulate and the murders in Sydney; to the storming of the Iranian embassy just 10 years ago in Canberra. We have seen terrorist activities on our soil and we know that there have been connections between terrorist groups overseas and individuals and agents based in Australia.
At a time when the world has changed quite dramatically, it is absolutely wrong for us to do anything but try for the ultimate protection of Australia. That is what this particular bill is all about. Yes, there are some tough clauses in it. Yes, this is tough legislation, but these are tough times. If it is the difference between protecting Australian citizens and this country from some terrorist operation, we have to be prepared to take those tough decisions. This legislation is tough. Nobody would deny that. As a committee of this parliament, we have managed—and indeed, in its response, the government has managed—to try to get that balance in these difficult circumstances that make sure there are protections of civil rights. This is not an out-and-out attack on civil rights; this is a process by which, hopefully, we can maintain the security and freedom that we enjoy in Australia and make sure that our citizens are not subjected to any terrorist activities.
I have been absolutely horrified by the speeches I have heard from the other side of the House. If the left wing of the Labor Party want to play with the security of this country, let them. I am very disappointed that the Leader of the Opposition of this particular place is also prepared to play with security. My friend and equal member on this committee, the member for Watson, who comes into the House now, is one of those men who made that contribution, took on the hard decisions, got the balance right and helped to present this unanimous report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD to this House. I hope this bill has speedy passage and that, all of a sudden, the Labor Party wake up to the fact that they too have an obligation to ensure the security of this country.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2002-09-23,"—I appreciate the strong feelings that the member for Fadden has. I recognise that he has made a great commitment, both emotionally and intellectually, to the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD that has been brought down in this parliament on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002. He has strong feelings, but there are other people in this parliament who also have very strong feelings. To say that the feelings, thoughts and concerns of members on this side of the parliament are hypocritical is not giving justice to the arguments that are being put before this parliament.
Good legislation balances the interests and competing needs of our society, something this legislation fails to do. John Howard's ASIO bill has its roots in fear and is playing on security and the fears of international terrorism. The events of September 11 last year were horrendous. They created fear, anxiety and uncertainty within Australia and, for that matter, throughout the world. The actions of those terrorists cannot be condoned. Every step needs to be taken to ensure the safety and security of the Australian people. This legislation is not the answer. Increasing the power of ASIO is not the answer. Draconian laws that affect the civil liberties and the rights of Australian people are not the answer.
I believe this parliament should enact the legislative response to the dangers of terrorism. In doing so, any such legislation should not simply be an impetuous action for vengeance or justice but should seek to achieve the equilibrium of both national defence and civil rights of the Australian people. The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 or ASIO bill fails to establish such a balance. This legislation is playing politics with Australia's security and the fears of Australians. It is driven by a government that will stop at nothing to politicise all aspects of Australian life. It is legislation that abandons any attempt to encapsulate equity, fairness and balance. When I speak of such basic civil rights, I refer to the democratic rights relating to the power of detainment, access to legal representation and the right to silence. It is these rights which the Australian people have elected us, as their representatives in this House, to protect and indeed enhance, as opposed to eradicate, which is what this proposed law sets out to achieve.
The Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 seeks to amend the ASIO Act 1979 by including terrorism within the definition of `politically motivated violence' and by providing extraordinary powers to ASIO to detain, search and question persons before a prescribed authority. ASIO was not established for the purpose of law enforcement, but rather to act primarily as an intelligence-gathering agency—something this legislation seeks to change. One of the functions of ASIO is to `obtain, correlate and evaluate intelligence relevant to security'. Another is to supply security assessments to Commonwealth agencies. Thereby, currently there is a formal distinction between the intelligence activities of ASIO and the law enforcement motivation of state and federal police.
ASIO can currently perform its investigatory function to gain intelligence on terrorist activities by gaining government warrants to undertake physical searches, telecommunications interceptions, inspection of postal items, covert searches and to use listening devices, tracking devices and gain computer access. In performing these current powers, ASIO does not perform a law enforcement role and remains independent from the criminal justice system. I see that as a strength. However, if this bill is passed, the independence of ASIO will be diminished—along with the democratic values of Australians—and ASIO will simply become another law enforcement body.
Under the bill, ASIO would be allowed to seek a warrant from a prescribed authority, such as a federal magistrate or a legal member of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, that would require a person to be either suspected of terrorist activities or simply be able to `substantially assist in the collection of intelligence that is important in relation to an offence of terrorism'—and that appears in the bill—`to appear before a prescribed authority to provide information or to produce documents or things.' Things!
This represents an unprecedented shift in the Australian justice system for three main reasons. First, the ASIO bill allows the detention of individuals who merely may `substantially assist in the collection of intelligence that is important in relation to a terrorism offence'. That is correct; this bill allows ASIO—or, effectively, the government—to bypass the judicial system in order to detain individuals in secret, without charges being laid or even the possibility of such charges being brought against these individuals. You would hardly say that that is the Australian way. Second, requiring a person to provide information abrogates the right to silence. The right to silence ensures that no individual be compelled to answer questions or confess guilt. This fundamental democratic right derives from the principle that the state must established the guilt of the accused person—and that was set out in Sorby v. The Commonwealth (1983). The third significant issue arising from this section of the bill is the issue of privilege against self-incrimination, as the bill at the moment `requires individuals to provide information, documents or things'. Privilege against self-incrimination protects an accused who is required to produce documents which tend to implicate that person in the commission of the offence charged. This privilege extends to revealing anything that may lead to the discovery of adverse evidence not in the person's possession or power. This privilege has been described by the High Court as being:
... in the nature of human right, designed to protect individuals from oppressive methods of obtaining evidence of their guilt for use against them.
This right has also been referred to as a human right `based on the desire to protect personal freedom and human dignity'. It is this human right, this personal freedom and fundamental element of human dignity that the Howard government is proposing to pilfer from the Australian people with the introduction of this bill—a right that we value so much in this country. The bill allows a `prescribed authority' to issue a questioning warrant authorising ASIO to detain and strip search persons, including children, for a specified period of no more than 48 hours. The previous speaker said that it is a tough bill—a tough piece of legislation. I think it is an unacceptable piece of legislation. Whilst each warrant is subject to a 48-hour limitation on detention, successive warrants may be issued leading to the detention of an adult or even a child for an indefinite period. This bill strikes at the heart of our justice system. No Australian who has not been charged or involved in a procedural component of our judicial system, such as being held in custody pending a bail hearing, should be detained beyond the initial eight-hour maximum period of detention. 
The injustice of this bill does not stop there. The bill does not permit detainees any contact with persons outside ASIO. As a result, Australians could be denied access to legal representation and denied the right to silence, as failure to answer questions will result in five years incarceration. Recently I was privileged to hear Professor George Williams. As he pointed out, although the bill refers to treatment of detainees with humanity and with respect for human dignity, there is in fact no punishment for ASIO officers who subject detainees to cruel, inhumane or degrading punishment. Further, it is an offence under the ASIO Act to publish the identity of an ASIO officer.
Once again, that is very much a closed shop. The detention of nonsuspects is a first for Australia; it is not even tolerated in equivalent legislation in the USA, Canada or the UK. For example, in the USA the Patriot Act 2001 provides for the mandatory detention of an alien whom the Attorney-General has reasonable grounds to believe is an inadmissible alien or is engaged in any other activity that endangers the national security of the USA. An inadmissible alien is defined to include persons who have incited or engaged in terrorist activities and members or representatives of a foreign terrorist organisation. Under the USA procedures for trial by military commissions, detainees have access to legal representation, a right to silence and a right to call and cross-examine witnesses. The Howard government has not afforded Australians any of these measures in the legislation we are debating. Furthermore, in the USA the detention is for renewable six-month periods. 
Under the UK Terrorism Act 2000, the police may detain suspected terrorists for 48 hours, extendable for a further five days. In Canada, under the Anti-Terrorism Act 2002, the police may detain terrorist suspects for 24 hours, extendable for a further 48 hours. It is only Australia—the Howard government—that has sought to detain suspects, in secret, for no restricted period.
The problems with this bill not only have a detrimental effect upon fundamental democratic rights for all Australians but also may conflict with the Constitution of Australia. As George Williams has reported, there may be two possible grounds for constitutional challenge to this bill available in the High Court. The first is that the bill may breach the doctrine of the separation of powers. The reason is that this bill confers power on the executive to detain in secret Australian citizens who have not even committed an offence and, more disturbingly, Australian citizens who are not even suspected of committing an offence. In George Williams's credible opinion, this aspect of the bill is contradictory to the High Court decision in Lim v. Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. In this decision, Justices Brennan, Deane and Dawson, with whom Justice Gaudron agreed, held that:
... the involuntary detention of a citizen in custody by the State is penal or punitive in character and, under our system of government, exists only as an incident of the exclusively judicial function of adjudging and punishing criminal guilt. 
The possible exceptions to this rule are in regard to detention due to mental illness and infectious disease. Otherwise, the detention must be authorised as part of the judicial process. Under this bill, such detention of Australian citizens in secret would not be so authorised.
The second ground on which George Williams considered the bill might breach the Constitution of Australia was in relation to the issue of whether a federal magistrate can be a prescribed authority. The High Court has held that non-judicial powers such as granting a warrant can be conferred on a federal judge in his or her personal capacity. Nevertheless, in the High Court decision of Grollo v. Palmer, Chief Justice Brennan and Justices Deane, Dawson and Toohey considered that: 
... no function can be conferred that is incompatible either with the Judge's performance or his or her judicial functions or with the proper discharge by the judiciary of its responsibilities as an institution exercising judicial power.
As stated by George Williams: 
... a power cannot be granted to a federal judge that is incompatible with the nature of the judicial office for the reason that it undermines the integrity of the judicial system and moreover the confidence which the Australian people have vested in the judicial system. 
It must be asked whether involving the judiciary in an investigative process, which this bill proposes, where Australian citizens are detained in secret for unprecedented periods of time, would indeed destabilise the public confidence in the Australian judicial system. 
In conclusion, I contend that these laws are unbalanced. They are draconian laws. They protect the liberties of the terrorists by destroying the liberties of the Australian people. The legislation does not have the support of all members on the other side of the House. There has been great controversy within the government ranks about this legislation. Thinking members of the government are questioning this legislation and the impact it will have on the civil liberties and basic rights of all Australian people. We have only to remember the previous set of antiterrorism laws that this government tried to push through the House, and to see how substantially they had to be amended to become workable and to protect the civil liberties of the Australian people. I would argue very strongly that in Australia we need to have strong laws to ensure the security of all Australians, but we must balance this against protecting the civil liberties of all Australian people.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"McLeay, Leo, MP",ALP,2002-09-23,"—In speaking tonight on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002, I note that it is over 12 months since September 11, and the government still has not got the totality of its package of antiterrorism legislation through this parliament. One has to ask oneself why. The reason is because of the government's knee-jerk reaction. A lot of governments around the world had to look at where they were going on security issues after 11 September. I do not think the world changed absolutely, as a lot of people say, but there has certainly been some sort of quantum change. It seems to me that only this government went too far in its attempt to address this issue, and this bill is part of that problem.
Earlier this year, this bill was referred to the Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD, of which I am a member. The member for Fadden, who spoke earlier in this debate, was the chairman of the committee. The committee reported to the parliament in June this year, and it is worth reminding the House, as the member for Fadden did, that there was a unanimous report. Every member of the committee, which comprised four government members and three opposition members, considered that this legislation was flawed. Fifteen very reasonable and carefully considered recommendations were made to the government and the parliament by the committee. When the report was tabled back in June, I said:
The committee accepts that there is a need for ASIO to seek to gather intelligence on terrorist activities and to question and search people who may be able to assist them in preventing a terrorist attack. There is no doubt that ASIO do need that power. But there is a lot of doubt—and the unanimous view of the committee is that there is a lot of doubt—that this bill goes too far in trading off individual rights in the pursuit of terrorists. One would think that many of the proposals in this bill had come from a police state rather than from a democracy.
The committee made 15 recommendations. We believe that those recommendations will preserve the rights of individuals, will provide legal protection for a person who is taken into custody and will still allow ASIO to acquire the information that they require to assist them in preventing terrorist attacks in Australia or overseas. 
It is important to realise that the intelligence that ASIO achieves through the operation of this legislation, if it is ever enacted, will be able to be passed on by them to other governments. Striking the appropriate balance, the committee felt, is very important. The committee considered that the adoption of its 15 recommendations—not some of the 15—would help achieve the appropriate balance. The committee came up with a package, not a pick-and-choose.
For the benefit of the House, I will repeat the gist of the committee's recommendations. Recommendations 1 to 5 concerned warrants. Recommendation 1 dealt with the issuing of warrants. It provided for all warrants to be issued by federal magistrates. Why did we suggest magistrates rather than judges or members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal? Because the committee was conscious of the Grollo decision. The Grollo decision was about federal judges issuing warrants. The federal judges had said that they did not believe that they should issue warrants, because that got in the way of the separation of powers; but I do not think we had an operating federal magistracy at the time of the Grollo case, and the committee was of the view that federal magistrates, who have tenure, would be the appropriate people to do this. 
If we accepted the government's idea of having members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal issue these warrants, we would have people issuing warrants who did not have tenure. Members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, except for one or two who are longstanding appointments, have five- or seven-year appointments. The concept that people should be able to deliberate on issuing warrants without fear or favour can be called into question if the person does not have tenure. The committee felt that magistrates would be able to do this job properly and that this would not get in the way of the problems that the High Court saw with the Grollo case or in the way of the view of federal judges, who did not think that issuing all these warrants was a good idea. We thought that federal judges should issue warrants where detention is to exceed 96 hours and members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal would undertake all the other duties of a prescribed authority, with the exception of issuing warrants. Members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal could oversee these inquisitions, but we thought that the initial stage ought to be that judges or magistrates should issue the warrant and the police take people into custody, so that you get an understanding of the way the normal protocols in this country work with judges and the police and do not need a whole new set of rules for this specific issue.
The committee particularly had the sense from ASIO that these warrants would be a last resort, and I will come to that later on in my remarks. The committee was never of the view that this would be a recourse that ASIO would go to on a day-to-day basis. We saw the issuing of these warrants and this type of inquisition as something that would happen only in extraordinary circumstances, and the feeling that we got from the representatives of ASIO who gave evidence to the committee was that that was also their view. So, to be fair to the agency, we do not think that they were about to have the tumbrels rolling, collecting people daily on the basis of these warrants. I am always willing to get involved in any conspiracy theory that is going around, but I have not bought this one yet. 
Recommendation 2 suggested an amendment whereby the Attorney-General could, by regulation, nominate an authority that could issue a warrant under this bill. So if a particular magistrate or judge took exception and thought that this was not his or her role, the Attorney-General could, by regulation, prescribe certain people to do it and others not to be on that list. 
Recommendation 3 sought to amend the bill so that the maximum period of detention of a person would be no more than seven days—168 hours—and, at the expiry of that period, a person must be either charged or released. Under the current provisions of the bill it is possible, if an Attorney-General is mad enough to give the agreement and a member of the AAT is crazy enough to continue to issue these warrants, that a person could be held for an indeterminate period. One would ask oneself whether you would get a conjunction of those two crazinesses. You would probably say that even the best conspiracy theorist would not sign up to that, but the committee thought that the safeguard should be put in so that, after seven days, a person has to be either charged or released.
Recommendation 4 sought to ensure that the Director-General of ASIO, in seeking a further warrant for a person, must seek the minister's consent prior to requesting a further warrant from a federal magistrate or Federal Court judge. The reason for that was to make sure that the Attorney-General was always in the frame and that a politician who was accountable to this parliament had to give the okay for the continuation of these warrants, not some secret bureaucrat incarcerating people without any light being shone on the proposal. We thought that putting the Attorney-General in that position would ensure that there was some accountability.
The purpose of recommendation 5 was to ensure that a person immediately be brought before a prescribed authority. Under the legislation it was unclear whether you could have a person picked up and then take as much time as you liked to bring them before someone who was going to ask questions. We thought it should be made very clear that there should not be that time delay.
Recommendations 6 to 10 dealt with detention. Recommendation 6 was concerned with the provision of legal representation for persons who were the subject of a warrant. The committee recommended that a panel of senior lawyers recommended by the Law Council of Australia be formed to represent persons held in detention; that these lawyers be allowed to sit in on the entire proceedings of the prescribed authority and represent a person at any further hearings which sought to extend detention; and that the lawyers were to be security cleared so as to be eligible to represent people in detention. Recommendation 6 also sought to ensure that the prescribed authority advised the person, when they first appeared before them, that they had access to a legal representative from a list that the person would be given. That ensured that there would not be people being interrogated without legal advice. Some people suggested that, because these warrants would be used only in extenuating circumstances, there was a need to have people who were security cleared. The committee did not see a problem with that.
Recommendation 7 dealt with the development of protocols governing custody, detention and the interview process provided for under the bill. It recommended that ASIO develop protocols in consultation with the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, the Australian Federal Police and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal; that the protocols be approved by the Attorney-General; that the committee be briefed on the protocols prior to their being tabled in parliament; and that the bill not commence until the protocols were developed and in place.
Recommendation 8 sought amendments of the legislation to provide protection against self-incrimination in the provision of information relating to a terrorist offence. The committee thought that it was wrong, under the type of government that we operate in this country, that a person could be required to incriminate themselves and then have that evidence used against them.
Recommendation 9 concerned the inclusion of penalty clauses to apply to officials who do not comply with the provisions of the bill, with particular reference to the operation of proposed section 34J. Section 34J says that people will be dealt with fairly and properly, but there is no provision in the bill for a penalty when that is not the case. One would hope that officials always would be fair and proper, but we thought it was useful to put in a penalty clause so that the people who are involved in the implementation of this legislation would know that, if they did something wrong, there would be a penalty to pay. Recommendation 10 amended the bill to ensure that no person under the age of 18 could be questioned or detained under the legislation. 
Recommendations 11 to 15 dealt with accountability measures. Recommendation 11 stated that ASIO must include in their declassified annual report the total number of warrants issued under the bill. This was to keep ASIO honest. They had given us the impression that they did not think this legislation would be used often. We said, `That is fine; let's put it in your report so that the whole country can see that this is not a problem.' To go back to conspiracy theories, before ASIO reported to this parliament half the people in my party and two-thirds of the people in your party, Mr Deputy Speaker, were absolutely convinced that ASIO were tapping their phones. Now that ASIO have to provide a report on these things, it is very clear that they are not doing too much of that at all. So we thought it was a very good thing to have that transparency.
Recommendation 12 dealt with the inclusion of a sunset clause to terminate the legislation three years from the date of commencement. The reason the committee took this view was that at present there is a lot of concern around the world about terrorist activities, but three years ago there was not, and three years hence, there may not be. If we are going to put draconian legislation like this on the books, the committee was of the view that it should be reviewed in the near future to see whether this type of legislation was still needed. The committee picked three years because that will be halfway through the next electoral cycle, and the government of the day will not be in a position where, because of the exigencies and hysteria of elections, they will not look at this in a sane and sensible way.
Recommendation 13 ensured that the Director-General of ASIO sought the minister's consent to request a warrant and immediately provided details of the warrant to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. This is to keep a check on both the Director-General of ASIO and the minister by ensuring that a third person knows that a warrant has been sought and granted.
Recommendation 14 dealt with the amendment of another piece of legislation, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986, to provide that the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security had the power to suspend, on the basis of noncompliance with the law or of any impropriety, any interview being conducted under the warrant procedures in this bill. It required the inspector-general to immediately report the nature of such cases to the joint committee. Once again, this was putting a third person in the frame so that, if the security services did go too far, there was an ability to report that to the parliamentary committee which no doubt would then report it to the parliament. Recommendation 15 sought to amend the proposed bill to include a requirement that the prescribed authority advise the detained person that they had the right to seek judicial review after 24 hours of detention and at every time a subsequent warrant was sought.
Those were the 15 recommendations made in the joint committee's unanimous report. What has been the government's response? It has been inadequate. Its response has been to accept some of the recommendations and to try to stonewall the rest. That is unacceptable. We still have a flawed bill. In its current form, the bill should be rejected. If it is passed, Australians not suspected of any offence will be able to be detained by ASIO for questioning. ASIO has never had powers of detention previously. Those detained by ASIO will not have the right to legal advice and ASIO will be able to detain children over the age of 14 for questioning—ASIO's role will be significantly changed. It will have powers of coercion and detention that it does not currently have, and there will not be the safeguards that the committee suggested.
It is worth while looking at the recommendations of the joint committee which the government has not adopted. Recommendation 6 dealt with access to legal representation. The government is now proposing that only after 48 hours of detention must a person be provided with access to a security cleared lawyer. Even when they do have a lawyer, they are not allowed to consult with the lawyer privately; ASIO will still be listening to the conversation. That is ridiculous. It is hard to imagine that lawyers will be happy with this, not to mention the individuals who are to be detained.
Recommendation 7 concerned protocols and the timing of their introduction. The government says, `Pass the bill and we'll think about the protocols later.' The committee said, `Think about the protocols and then pass the bill, otherwise the protocols may never see the light of day.' Recommendation 10 dealt with an issue of great importance to the joint committee, many of its witnesses and many of the submissions made to it during the course of its inquiry. It concerned the detention of children. As I said earlier, under the original bill a child of 10 or above could have been detained and strip searched. We thought that was just beyond the pale.
While the government has come some way towards meeting the concerns of the joint committee on the matter of detaining children, in my view it has still not moved far enough. The committee did not want children under 18 to be detained or questioned. The government is now proposing that children under 14 not be detained, and that those between 14 and 18 only be detained if they are under suspicion and have a lawyer and a parent or guardian present. I still do not believe that is acceptable. The government's point that a person of 14 is legally responsible might be true, but they are legally responsible for a criminal matter. Under this legislation, people can be detained who have done nothing wrong but may just know something. I think that to put children in an invidious position where they may be asked to inform on their parents is the sort of thing the Stasi got up to.
Recommendation 12 dealt with the application of a sunset clause. Again, the government has gone halfway to meeting the recommendation and has said that the committee should review the legislation. The committee does not think that is good enough. We think that the bill should lapse and that the government should make the case again in three years about whether we need this sort of legislation at all. The committee does not think it will be good enough if we do not have the parliament make the decision in three years.
The committee also thought that the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security should have the power to suspend interviews because of noncompliance or impropriety. The government says that ASIO should make that decision. We think having ASIO inspect itself is a little bit rich. What are they going to do—slap themselves on the wrist and say, `Naughty, naughty; don't do it again'? Maybe they will just not look at it at all. That is not meant to be unfair to the agency. As I said in my previous speech, I think the people who run the agency at present are about the best we have ever had running the security agencies in this country. But I am very worried about making what could be a bad law just because we have good people administering it. I do not know that I would like Charles Spry running this sort of legislation.
The joint committee was measured and, we thought, reasonable in its response. We did not seek to throw the legislation out; we sought to suggest amendments that would make it work. The government chose to go part of the way, but that is not good enough. The committee genuinely tried to balance the needs of the security forces in Australia to intervene and attempt to prevent terrorist activity with the rights of all Australians to be protected from oppressive laws.
No other country with which we seek to align ourselves, such as the US, the UK, Canada or New Zealand, has legislation as draconian as what the government is proposing. The only thing that comes anywhere near it is the UK legislation. Those members of the government who got up during this debate, drew comparisons with legislation such as the US Patriot Act and said, `This isn't as bad as that' obviously do not know what they are talking about. The US Patriot Act does not apply to US persons. Under the US legislation a `US person' is a US resident, a US citizen or a US company. As I said on 5 June when debating the committee's report, if we can get a unanimous decision across a parliamentary committee, that is a good thing. Apparently, the sense of that has eluded the government.

"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,2002-09-23,"—Notwithstanding the comments in today's press by the Attorney-General and the contribution this evening by the honourable member for Fadden, I have followed the debate on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 here in this place, in the press and through contributions from my constituents. I am concerned about authorising ASIO to detain Australians in secret, without charge and even without suspicion of wrongdoing. Despite the improved operational changes recommended by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD and the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee and agreed to by the government, this bill still has the potential to undermine some very basic principles of Australian democracy. They include freedom from arbitrary detention without reference to the judicial process, separation of powers, freedom from a quasi-secret police force with a considerable lack of accountability, and freedom of speech and association.
I have heard many references in this debate to the ability of the ASIO bill to defend the population of this country against fear and to protect their liberty. There is no doubt that national security and fundamental human rights must be protected. That is something of a juggling act, but it was achieved in the terrorism bills earlier this year—but only after heavy editing and amendment on the basis of the recommendations of a parliamentary inquiry. I suggest that Australians are justified in their concern that this bill poses a great threat to those values and rights it purports to protect. That is the tenor of many submissions that I have received from my electorate.
This government refuses to adopt the joint committee's recommendation that the legislation be subjected to a three-year sunset clause. A sunset clause would serve as a powerful accountability mechanism compelling the parliament to debate and the government to defend the continuation of such a controversial law. It is a very inexact and loosely assembled piece of legislation which would bring about a permanent change to law enforcement in Australia, with the notion that the detention of people is an appropriate tool for gathering information about suspected criminal activity.
In a nutshell, the bill allows for someone to be taken off the streets under the direction of ASIO and disappear incommunicado for 48 hours without legal representation. The Attorney-General refuted claims that ASIO has power to take people into custody under this bill, saying this is only carried out by police. Regardless of who carries out the action of taking someone into custody, it is on ASIO's instruction and with the use of ASIO's resources that the action is prosecuted, and it is ASIO who carries out the questioning. Neither the authority who issues the warrant nor the prescribed authority who attends the questioning—the AAT—has the power to change the conditions of a warrant issued under this bill. Any changes to conditions under such a warrant may be directed by ASIO and approved by the minister in writing.
Following 48 hours of detention, a person can be detained for a further five consecutive days with only the presence of a security cleared lawyer who has no right to intervene in the questioning itself. That person so detained is not allowed to inform family, friends, their employer or their own lawyer of their detention. Their detention is in fact carried out in secret. If the detainee does not provide the information or thing requested, or if the information is false or misleading, they may be imprisoned for five years. 
The government have agreed to some amendments that are ostensibly to allay the concerns of the Australian people. While I do believe that the worst case scenarios that have been painted about the likely ramifications of this legislation are highly unlikely and in view of the views of the previous speaker about the quality of our ASIO personnel at the moment, there are questions to be raised about what would be legally allowed under this proposed legislation. There are some very valid questions.
Children may still be detained under this legislation. Originally, the bill allowed a situation where 10-year-olds could be detained and questioned without family contact. The amended bill allows children between 14 and 18 years old to be detained for up to two weeks with an approved person present. This is only a minor concession—a 14-year-old is still a child. And this is still contrary to the joint house committee report's recommendation. Though 14- to 18-year-olds are recognised as having criminal responsibility under criminal law, this bill is not about crime, it is about deterrence and involves potential detention without charge. I consider this a fundamental difference when it comes to this bill's treatment of the underaged.
Consider the non-English speaking parent who might vent their fears and anger at such treatment of their child and then, under this amended, better version of the legislation, be required to leave because the prescribed authority considers them unduly disruptive? Not only this but a parent may be imprisoned for two years should they divulge their situation to a third party while their child is detained. A person now may not be held for the indefinite period allowed by the bill in its original form; they may be detained for a maximum of seven days after which they must be either charged or released. Reading that line, Guantanamo Bay comes to mind. Seven days imprisonment for someone who does not even have to be suspected of anything, without permission to let anyone know of their experience, is still not acceptable in my book.
What happens to the distraught families who contact police or media because their daughter or mother is missing without word? Again, at least a testing of such a provision against a sunset clause would be advisable. Further, the amendment still allows denial of legal advice for the first 48 hours of questioning. It raises questions about what may happen to a detained person in that initial two-day period if their right to a lawyer is denied. After 48 hours, a legal representative is to be chosen from a list of approved lawyers who will not be allowed to communicate to anyone else while the person is detained without permission of the prescribed authority—the same authority who may authorise the warrant in the first place. Breach of this order would carry a penalty of two years imprisonment. 
The lawyer would not allowed to intervene in the questioning and would not be allowed to discuss matters with the detained person without the presence of an ASIO officer. This seriously undermines the value of having access to a lawyer in the first place and still represents a significant erosion of the basic right to fair treatment when in detention. It also impinges upon the common law right to a fair trial which is itself a fundamental part of our criminal justice system. On the one hand, the government have made a positive change in that any admissions made during detention under warrant will now not be admissible as evidence against that person. On the other hand, this bill restricts the right to silence by asserting that a failure to provide information requested is an offence for which the accused can be imprisoned for five years.
Other amendments agreed to by the government still do not address a number of very important and fundamental issues. The bill raises significant questions about the separation of powers and the appropriateness of the executive ever detaining an Australian to gain information about the activities of another person without any reference to a citizen's rights under common law. Arbitrary detention or the detention of a person without charge or review is contrary to basic democratic principles and indeed our existing laws. Traditionally, the High Court has declared that to make imprisonment lawful the power of detention must be subject to the supervisory jurisdiction of the courts, other than well-known exceptions relating to issues such as mental illness and infectious disease. This fact is implicit in the constitutional separation of powers to guard against abuses by government against the freedom of its people, and it is a mechanism we should never be willing to put aside. Yet, unbelievably, this legislation confers a power on the executive to detain any Australian citizen who has not committed or necessarily even been suspected of having committed an offence. Under this bill, ASIO may request consent from the Attorney-General to issue a warrant to detain a person who might be useful to their inquiries. The request and consent is given to the prescribed authority, who then issues the warrant.
Under proposed amendments to the bill, a federal magistrate, federal judge or an authority prescribed by regulation can issue a warrant. Warrants that result in detention of more than 96 hours are to be issued by a federal judge or, again, an authority prescribed by regulation. The authority prescribed by regulation may be a deputy president or legal practitioner of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal appointed by the minister. According to the government, this gives them a fall-back position if a federal judge or magistrate is not available or willing to volunteer to issue warrants. I believe it is a serious abrogation of basic democratic and judicial principles where an Australian government and its intelligence organisation, through the Attorney-General and the AAT, would be allowed to detain its citizens, avoiding any fair and independent process through the courts. The potential to abuse such a power is very real, as evidenced recently by American judges who found that the FBI and US Justice Department supplied false information for search warrants and wire taps as well as improperly sharing information with prosecutors in charge of criminal cases.
While any issuing of warrants should rightly fall upon the judiciary, this bill is also likely to be unconstitutional by involving federal judges in the granting of warrants that bypass the judicial process. This would threaten the very integrity of the judiciary by requiring it to ignore the identification, adjudication or enforcement of widely held legal rights. Further, the limitations on the discretion to vary the terms of the warrant or potentially have some sort of control over the questioning and detention is likely to further undermine public confidence in the judicial system. It has been pointed out that judges could find themselves challenged in the High Court and this new legislation declared invalid at the very time it is being applied—assuming, of course, that there is knowledge of the detention in the first place.
Currently ASIO does not have any policing powers. It is a covert intelligence-gathering agency and not a law enforcement body. However, this bill gives to ASIO the coercive powers currently granted only to police but without the same scrutiny and control, despite the accountability provisions and despite government proposals to penalise with up to two years imprisonment ASIO officers who fail to comply with the yet to be developed protocols about the treatment of those detained. Such accountability measures are incompatible, as ASIO operates in secrecy. It just does not seem possible that ASIO could be held accountable to the level necessary for it to act with such policing powers. Indeed, section 92 of the existing ASIO act provides that it is illegal to identify ASIO officers. The faceless men who determine who is to be pulled in, detained and questioned are not allowed to be identified under law. How can this possibly be in keeping with notions of accountability and fairness? 
What would have happened under this law to the intrepid journo who was after the scoop with the Fretilin fighters in East Timor? What about the idealistic protestor who broke into Lucas Heights dressed in a koala suit? What about the aspiring businessman who attends a meeting about investing in some company based in a country consequently determined to be an enemy of the West? Do not forget the Franklin Dam protestors were stated to be a threat to national security not all that long ago. We should build on existing laws using existing processes that ensure accountability and the rights to which we believe we are entitled. An alternative is that the law should make it an offence to fail to report information about terrorism. This would place the onus on Australians to come forward and would allow the arrest and questioning of people who do not do so. Terrorism could be investigated and prosecuted within the existing justice system without establishing ASIO as a secret police force, without undermining our judiciary or compromising the ideals so incredibly important to democracy. Why not ensure ASIO has the resources to do its existing job as well as it possibly can? I quote the Bills Digest:
... if the full weight of the criminal justice system were brought to bear on terrorism, the only contribution that these measures would make would be the immediate detention of non-suspects who might have information that is `important in relation to a terrorism offence'.
September 11 was horrendous. Terrorism anywhere in the world—America has no mortgage on the pain of terrorism—can permeate every sector of society, and it does so. But we must not confuse the fight against terror with blind revenge, for that will mean an attack on our cherished freedoms. It will mean a giving in to fear and a sacrificing of those freedoms won by the blood of our service men and women—at one stage with vital US support, no doubt—achieved in a century of conflict and great sacrifice. This bill allows fear to prevail. It lessens our freedoms. Instead of encouraging vigilance and caution, it emphasises unfounded proaction, secrecy, unfounded suspicion and a climate quite antithetic to that which should prevail in Australia, of all places. The price of freedom is eternal vigilance, but not at the price of putting freedom second in line to denying freedom. As it stands, I cannot support this legislation.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2002-09-23,"—I am glad to have the opportunity to speak on the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 because it gives me the chance to highlight, as others have done, the government's general disregard for established legal principles and its abandonment of what we on this side of the House regard as our fundamental civil rights. The bill also shows the government's disrespect for basic human rights and—of great concern to me and I know to my colleagues—its willingness to try to score cheap political points that only serve to degrade the very fabric of our Australian society. This is a matter that was commented on earlier this evening by the Leader of the Opposition. This is one of the messages that was brought home to all Australians during the Tampa crisis and during the `children overboard' debate. Here we have a government that is prepared to take every opportunity to create within the community a wedge that it sees as advantaging itself.
In my own experience of this parliament, this particular piece of legislation is certainly one of the most controversial pieces that I have ever been asked to consider. The Joint Standing Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD stated, `The ASIO terrorism bill is the most controversial piece of legislation ever reviewed by the committee.' That, I think, says a great deal about its import. But this legislation is so controversial because, in its attempts to fight terrorism, it sacrifices the basic rights of every citizen of this nation—and this is where the myopia of the government is revealed. By sacrificing the basic rights of citizens of Australia, the government has, in a sense, conceded victory to the very people that it purports to fight. 
The audacity of some of the measures in the original legislation presented to this House were indeed breathtaking. There were provisions which would have made it possible to detain a child incommunicado for an indefinite time, with no legal representation, on just the mere suspicion that the child might know something about a crime that was yet to happen. What do you think could have gone through the minds of the people who drafted that piece of legislation? How could the Attorney of this country sit down and put his name to a piece of legislation that would have us detain children incommunicado? One wonders what was beavering through the Attorney's mighty brain on the night he signed off on that document.
I am outraged that this could have been proposed, and I am even more outraged that the government could even contemplate bringing that sort of draconian legislation into this parliament. I had the view that somehow we may have moved further in this country. I thought we had left those notions behind in the 1950s. I note the Leader of the Opposition's reference to the Prime Minister saying what a great service was done to the country by ensuring that the attempts by Menzies to outlaw the Communist Party were defeated. Yet we have a Liberal Party Prime Minister, John Howard, the member for Bennelong, with the Attorney-General, putting to this parliament a piece of legislation so draconian that it would have actually allowed children to be held incommunicado.
This legislation is part of a suite of antiterrorist legislation which was introduced in the wake of last year's attacks on the World Trade Centre and the Pentagon. Other bills in this suite are the Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 [No. 2], the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism Bill 2002, the Border Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2002, the Criminal Code Amendment (Anti-hoax and Other Measures) Bill 2002 and the Criminal Code Amendment (Suppression of Terrorist Bombings) Bill 2002. The bill seeks to amend the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979, from which ASIO derives its authority, to give that organisation sweeping new powers.
It is clear that the world has changed inexorably since the attacks of 11 September. Those attacks have changed the way we see ourselves and the way we see the world. But let it be said: the attacks have not changed the scale of terrorism that has existed in this world for some time. The focus and the targets have been different, but we should not delude ourselves into thinking that somehow or another acts of terrorism were at their peak on 11 September. It was a murderous and tragic event, but let it be said that there have been similar murderous and tragic events—not, it is fair to say, on the United States but in other parts of the world. There have been mass gassings of people: Iraq is but one example. We have seen genocide: Rwanda. It seems to me that we are aware of the terrorism which has been pervading the international system certainly for the last 25 or 30 years, when great acts of horror have been perpetrated against individuals and groups of people and, indeed, countries.
But these attacks on 11 September have simply revealed to us in the West—not only here in Australia but also, and particularly, in the United States—that the threat of terrorism is real; these attacks have revealed to the world the scale of the problem that already existed. The reaction to the attacks has become known as the war on terrorism, but we need to be very careful that we understand what this war on terrorism is. One thing is certain: it is a campaign unlike any other that we have seen. This is not a campaign against another country; it is not nearly that tangible. This is a campaign against those who have no respect for basic and fundamental human values. In this campaign we are fighting for values and principles; we are fighting and campaigning for basic human rights and freedoms; and we are fighting for freedom from terror—and therein is the contradiction. With the introduction of the ASIO bill, it is apparent that this government is prepared to sacrifice the freedoms of each and every Australian to pursue, on the face of it, an argument that somehow or another this legislation will provide some guarantee for the values and principles of our democracy. In fact, with this piece of legislation it is accomplishing the aim of the terrorists, in part at least, by taking away rights and freedoms from each and every one of us, thus undermining those very values and principles.
The Australian Labor Party will do all in our power to make sure that the rights of individual Australians are not sacrificed by passing legislation that could form the basis, it is fair to be said, of a police state. We believe that it is possible to increase Australia's ability to protect itself against the threat of terrorism without sacrificing basic principles at law. Yet it is clear, even now that this legislation has been amended, that there are a number of powers that remain in this bill that are of grave concern to me and to my colleagues in the Labor Party—and they are why I will be voting against the passage of the legislation.
The bill gives ASIO powers that contravene basic human rights and affords ASIO a new role for which it was not established. I cannot support the bill because it gives ASIO the ability to detain and question people who are not even suspects, it gives ASIO the power to detain people without affording them the very basic right to legal advice, it permits the detention of children under the age of 18 under the same conditions as adults and it radically changes ASIO's role in the defence of Australia. The bill changes ASIO from being essentially an intelligence-gathering agency to one that involves itself in criminal law and has the power to detain.
It should be noted that the unamended legislation was audacious enough to give ASIO the power to detain people incommunicado and indefinitely—and, as I pointed out earlier, including even children. Only after the pressure of the report of the Joint Parliamentary Standing Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD was the government prepared to change this amazing power that would have been the envy of many a police state. The joint parliamentary committee made a number of recommendations, most of which the government has accepted. The committee's recommendations include: the requirement for legal representation by security-cleared lawyers, the establishment of strict guidelines for the detention and interview of detained persons and oversight by a parliamentary committee, protection from self incrimination, the prohibition of the detention or interrogation of anyone under the age 18, accountability and reporting measures in relation to warrants, and a three-year sunset clause.
While the government has acceded to most of the recommendations of the JPC, there are still five points where the legislation remains unacceptable. The first is access to legal advice. The joint parliamentary committee recommended that all persons subjected to warrants be provided with lawyers who had been security cleared. Under the legislation presented to the committee, persons held in detention had no right to representation. The government has proposed an alternate and unacceptable regime where it would only be mandatory for detained persons to have legal representation after the first 48 hours. The second is the protocols for detention. The government is still insisting that the bill come into effect before such time as protocols on the detention and questioning of detainees are in place. There is no small irony in the fact that it took the government six months from 11 September last year until it introduced any anti-terrorism legislation and a further six months to debate the bill. Yet it is now rushing to make the powers in the bill operational without allowing sufficient time to put proper protocols in place.
The third is the detention of children. The government continues to insist that children under the age of 18 should be able to be detained. The fourth is a sunset clause. The government is resisting any sunset clause in the bill. However, there must be a formal process for review of this bill given the sweeping nature of the changes it makes. The fifth is that the government does not consider that is appropriate that the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security should have the power to suspend interviews because of noncompliance or impropriety. Without making all the changes to the bill recommended in the joint parliamentary committee's report, Labor cannot support the bill because it infringes basic human rights.
One question which we might want to ask is: do any of the recommendations that the government has not accepted substantially reduce Australia's ability to fight terror? Clearly and most obviously the answer is no. There are ways to fight terrorism and to uphold the basic human rights that we are fighting for. It is this path that we must take. There are a couple of other issues that I want to touch on briefly. One of the issues that I am particularly concerned about is the proposal to detain persons who are not suspects. As I understand it there is no legal precedent for the detention of persons who are not suspected of involvement in a crime. In fact, it flies in the face of accepted legal principles. I do not think that the Australian community would tolerate that sort of measure. 
It should be said that society will be judged by how it treats the weakest, including those it seeks to incarcerate. I have grave concerns for how we will be judged if we allow the detention of children without suspicion of being involved in a crime. This is not just a gross injustice; it is wrong. Any injustice visited on anyone by Australia as a nation debases each of us. That is why we must fight injustice, not only for the sake of those subjected to it but also for our collective sake. Similarly, there is a basic level of respect which we must give to those who break the law. They have rights which need to be addressed and must be accommodated.
One of the fundamental changes that this legislation makes to the defence structures in Australia is that it gives ASIO sweeping new powers and, in so doing, gives ASIO a new role. ASIO is properly an intelligence-gathering organisation and that is what it should remain. The government's plans under this bill would give ASIO the power to interrogate and detain. It is not a police force and it is certainly not a question which has been fully discussed throughout the community. Before these sorts of unprecedented powers for ASIO are passed into law they should at least be the subject of very wide public debate and discussion. As yet, there has not been sufficient debate or indeed public discussion about the role that ASIO should play in our nation's security.
Furthermore, other organisations—in other words, police forces—that have the power to detain and interrogate have well established protocols governing the treatment of those who are detained. There are no such protocols established in this legislation. For the most part, ASIO is outside legislation concerning the treatment of detained persons, legislation in which these principles have been established elsewhere. You do not have to be Einstein to work it out. This puts ASIO in an unprecedented position of power, not only of coercion but of intimidation. It leaves the door wide open for abuse.
The joint parliamentary committee recommended that the provisions of the bill not come into effect until such time as protocols for the detention of persons are established. I cannot for the life of me understand how the Attorney or the government could not accept the validity of this argument. After all, we are supposed to be advocates of a modern democracy where fundamental civil and human rights are protected and respected. As I said earlier, what we are seeking to do here, or what the government seeks to do here, undermines those basic civil rights. For that reason, and for a number of other reasons, I will not be supporting this legislation.
I do commend to the House the second reading amendment moved by the member for Banks. This amendment notes the government's response to the report of the joint parliamentary committee, notes that the government proposes that Australians not suspected of any offence can be detained by ASIO for questioning, notes that the government proposes those detained by ASIO do not have the right to legal advice for the first 48 hours of their detention, notes that the government proposes children can be detained by ASIO for questioning and notes that the government proposals will significantly change the role of ASIO by giving it powers of coercion and detention. The amendment expresses the view that this bill contains serious compromises to civil liberties and that alternative approaches should be more thoroughly explored in place of the measures proposed in the bill. I support the opposition's amendment. I oppose the legislation.",REPS,<title>AUSTRALIAN SECURITY INTELLIGENCE ORGANISATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,21,1
"Williams, Daryl, MP",LP,2002-09-23,"—In winding up this debate I would like to thank honourable members for their contributions to it. A number of issues were raised by members opposite on which I would like to offer some comment. The Leader of the Opposition has accused the government of playing wedge politics with the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002. I reject this absurd suggestion outright. The government have gone to extraordinary lengths to work with the opposition on this bill. We provided the opposition with confidential drafts of the bill and briefings throughout the process of developing it. We have endeavoured to work with the opposition on the amendments that I will be moving to the bill. We have offered to meet with the opposition to discuss the government's amendments and any residual concerns that they have with the bill but that offer has yet to be taken up by the opposition. This is not about winning or losing political points. It is much more serious than that. This is a question of community safety. The government's aim with the ASIO bill is clear: to protect the community against terrorism.
Opposition members have argued that the government's response to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD's report is inadequate but we have in fact accepted the majority of recommendations in whole or in part. Where we have not been able to agree with a recommendation, we have put forward a workable and operational sensible alternative. Now the opposition are raising additional issues that were not raised by the parliamentary joint committee, which included senior members of the opposition. These additional issues were not raised with us by the opposition despite our repeated attempts to engage them on their concerns.
Labor has sought to portray the government's willingness to listen and respond to public and parliamentary concerns about our counter-terrorism package as `backing down'. The government have consistently taken a responsible approach to strengthening Australia's counter-terrorism capabilities. We are open and have been open to any reasonable proposals for new safeguards that do not weaken the key aim of the legislation, which is to strengthen our armoury against terrorism. Our record on amendments to the counter-terrorism package speaks for itself. The opposition, on the other hand, refuses to engage seriously on community safety. This important legislation is destined for political limbo in the Senate, where it will do little good for authorities trying to identify terrorist plots, because Labor refuses to engage seriously on the subject of community safety.
Opposition members have argued that the government intends to deny people detained under the bill access to a lawyer for 48 hours. That is not correct. All persons detained under the bill will have access to a security-cleared lawyer. Only in limited circumstances can that access be delayed and then only for up to 48 hours—delayed, not denied. The delay in accessing a lawyer can only occur if the Attorney-General is satisfied that a terrorism offence is being or is about to be committed. The delaying of access to a lawyer is a measure of last resort to protect the community from a terrorist act. Delaying access to a lawyer can only be done in relation to adults. A young person's access to a lawyer cannot be delayed, and the bill does not apply to persons under 14 years at all.
The member for Banks and other members opposite made some extraordinary statements about the way children may be dealt with under the bill. They suggested that children will be treated like terrorists. They suggested that children would be held incommunicado. They paint a picture of worried parents not knowing where their children are. The member for Banks knows full well that this is not what is proposed and so should his colleagues equally know.
The government is mindful of the need to protect the interests of young people. That is why young people, it is proposed, will always be able to contact a security-cleared lawyer and a parent or guardian. They will not be able to be questioned unless the parent, guardian or other representative is present nor will young people be able to be questioned for longer than two hours without a break. Most importantly of all, young people will not be detained unless the Attorney-General is satisfied that it is likely that the young person will commit, is committing or has committed a terrorism offence.
The opposition have criticised the government for not agreeing to include a three-year sunset clause in the bill. They want the bill to automatically expire after three years. Do the opposition think that the threat of terrorism will have disappeared after three years? Do they think terrorists are just going to give up? International experts on terrorism agree that one thing we know about terrorists is that they are patient. They have time on their side and they can wait for the circumstances to be right to perpetrate a terrorist crime. Just because they have not acted in the past year does not mean that they do not have the capability or intent to do so. The armoury we build against terrorism must, therefore, be both strong and enduring. Of course, as the threat environment evolves, we will need to review the appropriateness of our tools in the fight against terrorism. That is why the government proposed a sensible alternative to the committee's recommendation. We proposed that, three years after it commences, the legislation be reviewed by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. This would allow the new measures to be reconsidered, without unnecessary and arbitrary time pressures.
We have also been treated to a range of comparisons between the bill and similar laws in other countries. According to the opposition, this bill goes further than any other law. This ignores the differences in the rationale for this law and the rationales for the laws in other jurisdictions. This bill is about the gathering of intelligence. The laws in other countries referred to by members of the opposition generally concern criminal investigations. If a person has information relevant to the gathering of intelligence in relation to a terrorism offence, the community can legitimately expect that that person should provide that information to the authorities. The opposition ignore the safeguards that are included in the bill and have no international parallel—the strict warrant procedure, for example, and the enhanced role for the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. Instead, the opposition have chosen to misrepresent the legislation and the extent of the safeguards we have included.
The most serious allegation made by the members opposite is that the bill will create the apparatus of a police state. I reject this suggestion outright. The opposition have chosen to cloud the debate by saying that it is not appropriate for ASIO to have powers of detention, conveniently ignoring the fact that it is already a condition of the bill that the police, not the officers of ASIO, take the people to be questioned into custody under these warrants. This is an obvious red herring. The enhancement of ASIO's powers contained in the bill are a measured response to the new security environment. They provide ASIO with appropriate tools to protect the Australian community and, importantly, they are subject to safeguards which protect the fundamental rights and liberties of all Australians. The government have consistently taken a responsible approach to strengthening Australia's counter-terrorist capabilities. The government's aim with the ASIO bill is clear: it is to protect the community against terrorism.
This bill is an important element of the government's counter-terrorism legislative package. On its passage, we will have a strong piece of legislation that will help us to attack terrorism at its source and to deal with terrorists. While there is no specific threat to Australia, our profile as a terrorist target has risen and we remain on heightened security alert. Our interests abroad also face a higher level of terrorist threat, as evidenced by the plan to attack the Australian High Commission in Singapore and the fact that recently we have seen the Australian Embassy in East Timor closed temporarily as a result of a terrorist threat.
To respond to this new security environment, we need to be well placed in terms of our operational capacities, infrastructure and legislative framework. Terrorism is not like ordinary crime. The way that terrorist networks are organised and the destruction that acts of terrorism can cause distinguish terrorism from other types of crime. The Howard government takes very seriously its responsibility to do everything it can to protect Australians and Australian interests against the threats of terrorism. In order to prevent potential perpetrators of terrorism offences from carrying out their crimes, we must enhance the powers of ASIO to gather relevant intelligence in relation to terrorism offences. Although ASIO can seek other types of search warrants, it is not presently empowered to obtain a warrant to question a person. In order to prevent terrorist attacks, it is crucial that we are able to question would-be perpetrators of terrorist offences or those who may have knowledge of planned terrorist attacks. The bill establishes a warrant process to allow ASIO to question a person who may have important information relating to a terrorist attack. A person subject to a warrant may be detained by police for up to 48 hours, in order to allow ASIO to question them. All persons detained under a warrant will have the right to access a security-cleared lawyer, unless exceptional circumstances exist to delay access for a maximum of 48 hours.
Warrants will also specify others with whom the person may communicate in addition to a security-cleared lawyer. Warrants issued under the bill will be the tools of last resort. It is anticipated that they will be used rarely and only in extreme circumstances. The government is mindful of the important balance between the protection of national security and individual rights. The bill strikes an appropriate balance. We have worked hard to develop safeguards to ensure that ASIO's powers are exercised reasonably and that individual rights are protected. For example, the bill expressly provides that the person subject to a warrant must be treated with humanity and respect for human dignity and must not be subjected to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. It contains significant penalties for officers who do not follow the stringent processes and safeguards set out in the bill.
The bill has been subject to substantial scrutiny by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD and by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee. The parliamentary joint committee's careful consideration of the bill was invaluable in assisting the government to refine it. The government listened to the concerns raised by the parliamentary joint committee and responded by adopting the majority of the committee's recommendations, either in whole or in part. Where the government could not agree to particular recommendations, we developed appropriate alternative amendments, designed to implement the committee's intention while ensuring the operational effectiveness of the bill.
Unlike the opposition, the government are committed to protecting Australia's national security and punishing those who threaten Australia's interests. It is disappointing that the opposition is not supporting the bill. The amendment moved by the member for Banks in this second reading debate shows the deep divisions within the opposition over this issue. The matters raised in that amendment do not indicate opposition to the government's response to the committees' reports; they indicate a fundamental opposition to the bill itself. If the opposition are opposed to the bill, they should show their true colours to the Australian people and oppose the bill outright. Instead, the opposition choose to misrepresent the legislation and the additional safeguards we have included. The government have offered to discuss these proposals with the opposition. The offer is yet to be taken up by the opposition.
Instead of making the tough decisions, the opposition have indicated their intent to refer the bill to yet another committee for consideration. The bill has already been closely examined by two parliamentary committees which have included senior Labor members and have taken into account extensive public submissions. Instead of facing up to the tough decisions and letting government get on with the job of protecting the community, they have chosen to hide behind on open-ended review. It is worth noting that neither of the two previous committees that have considered the bill thought such a review was necessary. The opposition are not ready, willing or capable of working with us to develop important tools to prevent and deter terrorist activity and better protect the community in the new security environment.
The opposition's position is disingenuous at best. The opposition has been aware of the purpose of the bill since it was first proposed. It knows that the purpose of the bill is to arm ASIO with the tools it needs to gather important intelligence in relation to terrorism and to prevent potential perpetrators from carrying out their terrorist crimes. Senior members of the opposition have publicly supported this purpose, including the opposition members on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. The opposition is now raising concerns about the proposed role of ASIO—concerns that were not raised by the parliamentary joint committee. The opposition is also proposing to explore alternatives. Again, this was not thought necessary by the parliamentary joint committee.
The opposition conveniently ignores the significant safeguards in the bill. It conveniently glosses over the additional controls that apply to the questioning of children. Instead, it has chosen to quote selectively from the government's proposals and emotively from commentary on previous versions of the bill, conveniently ignoring the extensive additional safeguards proposed.
The ASIO bill is an important element of the package developed following the extensive review of Australia's counterterrorism arrangements. This legislation was not created on a whim but in response to an identified need. Once again, Labor has no answers and has resorted to cheap shots at the government. Labor's proposal to refer this bill to a third parliamentary committee with an open-ended invitation to reinvent the wheel is a cynical attempt to cover its own lack of policy when it comes to protecting the Australian community. In developing this legislation and the rest of the government's counterterrorism legislative response, the government has shown its resolve to put in place measures to address the challenges we face both domestically and internationally, while being committed to the protection and preservation of human rights. We reject suggestions that in doing so we somehow traded security and human rights.
The counterterrorist legislation is needed to protect human rights. The victims of September 11 had rights too, such as the rights to life, physical security, freedom of association and freedom of religion. These rights were not respected by the terrorists and are as deserving of protection as any other right. When the bill is enacted, we will have appropriate laws to protect the community from terrorism and to ensure that the rights of individuals are not unnecessarily impeded. It is vital that Australia does not forget the catastrophic results of terrorism. We must not become dangerously complacent. The bill delivers on the Howard government's commitment to ensure we are in the best possible position to protect Australians against the evils of terrorism. I commend the bill to the House.

"Melham, Daryl, MP",ALP,2002-09-23,"—Today I attended the mass of thanksgiving for Jack Ferguson. It was a moving service. Much has been said and written about the life of Jack Ferguson. Tonight, I want to share with the House some personal reflections. I joined the ALP because of the vision of Gough Whitlam. Within the ALP, I joined the Left in New South Wales because of Jack Ferguson and his family.
In particular, I remember my first associations with both Laurie and Martin in Young Labor. They always maintained principled positions within the ALP. It was not hard to support the Fergusons and what they stood for, both within the ALP and in terms of the people whom they fought for and represented. Jack never forgot his roots. Rodney Cavalier reminded me today that the last official ALP function that Jack Ferguson attended was a garden party in Bowral, at Rodney's home. It was a fundraiser for the Southern Highlands branch of the ALP. Neville Wran was the guest speaker and I was fortunate to have been there. Jack Ferguson and Neville Wran were a dynamic duo and were unbeaten in three successive elections.
The experiences that I had with Jack gave me an insight into what a marvellous human being he was. I marvelled at Jack's ability to communicate with people from all walks of life. He enjoyed a beer and a pie with the battlers in the leger and the paddock. I watched him telling stories in the committee rooms of the Australian Jockey Club at Randwick. He had a remarkable memory for detail, he never forgot a face and was good with names. The memories that I have are similar to those of any son being taken out for the day by his dad. Jack and I liked going to the races. I feel privileged to have experienced that side of Jack. I would then deliver him home to his wonderful wife, Mary, and would delight in the wonderful family atmosphere of the Ferguson home.
Even though you have gone from us, Jack, rest assured you are with me every day of my life. I extend my deepest sympathy and condolences to Jack's wife, Mary—I know that her faith sustains her at this time—and to Jack's children, Laurie, Martin, Deborah, Andrew and Jennifer, and to the rest of the Ferguson family.
