"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2012-02-08,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (09:31):  The opposition opposes this motion. The effect of the motion will be to significantly constrain the capacity of the estimates committees next week to examine portfolios. In particular, that will occur as a result of the reallocation of responsibilities for tertiary education into the economics committee without any compensating allocation of additional time for the examination of the economics agencies. That is a disgrace.


As recently as yesterday the Prime Minister said during question time in the other place that she wanted the debate this year to be about the economy. She said: 'Bring it on. We want the debate this year to be about the economy'. This is one of those rare occasions where there is unanimity between the government and the opposition, because we in the opposition would like nothing better than for the political debate throughout 2012 and potentially—if the government does not collapse in the meantime—into 2013 to be foursquare about the economy. Yet the very next morning after the Prime Minister made that declara­tion, what does the government do here in the Senate? It moves what appears on the face of it to be an innocuous procedural resolution which will significantly constrain the capacity of this parliament—and in particular of the Senate through the Senate estimates committees—to debate the economy by examining the Treasury and the economic agencies.


This motion bizarrely proposes that examination of the tertiary education and vocational education and training portfolios be moved from the education committee—or, to give the committee its full title, the Senate Education, Employment and Work­place Relations Legislation Committee—and placed in the Senate Economics Legislation Committee. I served for five years as the chair of the Senate economics committee, and I know better than most people in this chamber just how heavy the work of the economics committee is. The Senate eco­nomics committee examines the Treasury. It examines all of the great agencies of economic regulation: the Australian Compe­tition and Consumer Commission, ASIC, APRA and various other economic agencies. It examines, importantly, the Australian Taxation Office. The entire range of fiscal, macroeconomic and microeconomic policy of the government is exposed three times a year for public view and parliamentary scru­tiny before the Senate economics committee. 


As all of us in this chamber know from our experience as participants in the estimates process, there is always a great deal of time pressure. I venture to say that in no committee are the time pressures so acute as they are in the Senate economics committee—not merely because of the centrality of economic policy to the political debate and not merely because of the multiplicity of agencies that report to that committee but also because of the extremely technical character of the evidence that must be adduced and examined in that committee. I do not remember a time in government or in opposition when the Senate economics committee had enough time to do its work. At the very time when the government says it wants to focus the debate foursquare on the economy, it allocates time away from scru­tiny in the economics committee by building into its program the examination of agencies within the tertiary education sphere—which are perfectly well accommodated and have always been accommodated where they ought to be—in the education, employment and workplace relations committee. 


The lack of interest of the Gillard government in education is notorious. It was made manifest shortly after the 2010 election when the Prime Minister announced her new ministerial line-up. For the first time in recent Australian history—for the first time in the half a century since the coalition government of Sir Robert Menzies recognised education as a Commonwealth priority by appointing then Senator John Gorton as the minister for education in the early 1960s—we had an Australian gover­ment without a minister for education. I say it again: when the Gillard ministerial line-up was announced after the 2010 election, for the first time in half a century there was no member of the government described as the minister for education. We had the hapless Mr Peter Garrett, who was described as the minister for Schools, Early Childhood and Youth, and we had our friend Senator Evans, who was described as the Minister for Jobs, Skills and Workplace Relations. You might think to yourself, 'Schools are obviously part of education. Senator Brandis is engaged in a quibble here.' But there was no minister with responsibility for tertiary education. There was not even a mention in the portfolio title or the departmental name. If I could let you in on a secret, Mr Deputy President, that is one of the many reasons why my friend Senator Mason, when he was made a shadow minister, was given the title 'minister for universities and research'. Whereas the coalition is interested in universities—no-one more so than Senator Mason—the government's indifference to the university sector was manifest in the fact that there was not even a minister with ministerial responsi­bility for it. Shamed by that act of inadvert­ence, the government had to change the titles of Mr Garrett and Senator Evans. So, as an afterthought, Mr Garrett was called the Minister for Education, Schools, Early Childhood and Youth, and Senator Evans had the words 'tertiary education' added to his portfolio responsibilities as Minister for Jobs, Skills and Workplace Relations. We know that as a victim of the flailing knife of the Prime Minister he has lost a lot of that portfolio in more recent times. 


The Australian people who are listening to this broadcast this morning need to know that when Julia Gillard, who prides herself on being a Prime Minister for whom education is the first priority, and who had in the Rudd government—the government, let it be remembered, of the man she knifed in breach of her solemn undertakings to support him; but that is another story—been the minister for education, first got the chance to form a government, she was so interested in tertiary education that it was added to Senator Evans's portfolio title as an afterthought. That is how serious they were.


Now we come to the consideration of the additional estimates for 2012. As I said earlier, at a time when the Prime Minister, as recently as yesterday afternoon, declared economic policy debate to be the central ground of contest for Australian politics this year, she has foreshortened the time of the economics committee to examine the economic portfolios; and Senator Arbib, through his motion, proposes to segregate the consideration of education by leaving the consideration of schools and early childhood where it ought to be and always has been—the education, employment and workplace relations estimates committee—and to move the examination of tertiary education and vocational education and training to the economics committee. Why would you do that, unless you were trying to foreshorten the opportunities of the Senate, through its estimates committee process, to engage in the economic debate and to hold the economic bureaucrats and the heads of the economic agencies to account? For what rational reason, when you have an estimates committee that has been established for the purpose of examining education, would you move consideration of the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency to the economics committee? For what purpose would you move examination of the Australian Skills Quality Authority from the education committee or the National Advisory for Tertiary Education, Skills and Employment agency?



Senator Lundy interjecting—




Senator McEwen:
  Lucky you're there!




Senator BRANDIS:
  Senator Mason will speak later in the debate. That is, as I am sure Senator Mason will explain, the principal agency responsible for assessing tertiary standards. Why would that not be considered in the education committee, where it always has been, rather than in the economics committee? There is no rational reason for this change—and when there is no rational reason, one looks for a malign reason. That is what the Gillard government has taught us. Senator Arbib is monkeying around with the arts and sport portfolios by putting them into the regional and rural affairs committee, but that is another story. I will come to that if I get time. Not only is the Gillard government making a dog's breakfast of the consideration of educational policy but also next week in the estimates process, by segregating out into an alien committee the consideration of tertiary education and vocational education and training, about a quarter of the time that would otherwise be available to consider the economic agencies and the Treasury will be lost. Under the guidelines or draft program prepared by, I am told, the secretariat, we will now have less than two hours to consider the macroeconomic group of Treasury. We will have no more than two hours to consider the fiscal group.




Senator Lundy:
  That's your choice!




Senator BRANDIS:
  No, it is not our choice, Senator Lundy. It is not our choice to give the Senate Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Committee insufficient work to do and to overburden and therefore to use the time of the economics committee so that the time for consideration of all of these economic agencies is foreshortened. I like you, Senator Lundy. You are a very good person, but you are not a very frequent participant in the Senate economics estimates committee. If you were, you would know that under the particularly expert scrutiny of Senator Mathias Cormann and Senator David Bushy, if I may single out two colleagues, the forensic examination of this govern­ment's policy and its policy failures through the examination of bureaucrats—or, I should say, senior public servants—in the macro­economic group has taken hours. These are not hours wasted but hours of fruitful inquiry. These have revealed, among other things, the scandal of the minerals resource rent tax where the assumptions, as it was revealed the year before last in the economics committee, did not stack up.


The modelling on which the forecasts were based was revealed to be wholly inade­quate, and the same or similar revelations were made about the carbon tax. The capaci­ty for the economics estimates committee to scrutinise at length in a forensic way the detail of economic policy and the assumpt­ions underlying that economic policy will be denied to it next week—and this at a time when the Prime Minister says she wants the economy to be front and centre.


The Senate estimates committees next week, if you add up all the different portfolios across the different estimates committees, will go for roughly 80 hours. Do you know how much time in that 80 hours, as a result of the motion Senator Arbib brought before the chamber, will be allowed for the examination of taxation and revenue?




Senator Fifield:
  No.




Senator BRANDIS:
  Two—there will be two hours for the examination of the revenue group of Treasury and the Australian Taxation Office. The great issues in Australia today, as the Prime Minister herself said, are the economic issues. Within those economic issues perhaps the greatest issue of all is the imposition on this country of a carbon tax, in defiance of a solemn promise not to introduce one, at the bidding of Senator Bob Brown. Yet to examine the tax policies of this government, the economic assumptions that underlie them and the consequences of them for Australian households, the Senate proposes to allow no more than two hours. It is a disgrace. The process of this chamber has been traduced in order to enable this government to attempt to avoid scrutiny. 


I notice that Senator Mark Arbib, whose face I recognise—he is often described as one of the faceless men—




Senator Fifield:
  Not to us!




Senator BRANDIS:
  He is not a faceless man to us, Senator Fifield; we see him all too often. We notice that in the latest episode of political butchery by the Prime Minister he has displaced Senator Ludwig as the Manager of Government Business, so he is responsible for this outrage. I thought Senator Ludwig was a very hard player, but not even Senator Ludwig, I fear, would have been so shameless as to say that the consideration of taxation policy at the additional estimates—and in the year when the Prime Minister has declared economics and tax policy to be front and centre of the political argument—should not go for more than two hours. It is shameful.


Consideration of the arts and sport and local government—perhaps local govern­ment is not so objectionable—has bizarrely been moved into the regional affairs portfolio. It used to sit in the Prime Minister's office where, and I say this with some feeling as a former minister in that field, it might have attracted some priority. But now it has been sent to what is, at least in this government's eyes, the backwater of regional affairs.


This monkeying around with the Senate estimates committees, particularly the economics committee, has been done for one reason and one reason only: to prevent the opposition from holding this government to account for its shameful mismanagement of the economy.

",Senate,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Allocation of Departments and Agencies</title>,COMMITTEES,0,1,speech
"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2012-02-08,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (09:51):  At first blush, the motion which is before us would appear to be innocuous. We do see from time to time, before estimates committee hearings, motions to rearrange agencies within the various committees and between the various committees. I might say, we have seen that a fair bit under this government. It would be fair to say that they have had more than their fair share of reshuffles—some occasioned by the odd change of Prime Minister, others not. We have seen, I think, a larger than usual number of changes of responsibilities for estimates committees in motions presented to the Senate.


And there has been a bit of sloppiness in that. I do take Senator Brandis's point that there might be some inappropriate motives for some of the changes to these committees but I also think there is a little bit of sloppiness. We have seen some of that sloppiness before in ministerial reshuffles and ministerial arrangements. As Senator Brandis mentioned, there was that, 'Oops, I forgot,' moment when the current Prime Minister forgot to appoint an education minister. That was not the only thing that she forgot to do in that particular reshuffle. In my own portfolio of disabilities she forgot to appointment anyone with responsibility for disabilities, initially. Then there was a change in title for Senator McLucas; she had disabilities added. And in the last reshuffle Minister Macklin had disabilities added to her title, which I think is a good thing. Again, I put that down to sloppiness. I do not put that down to bad intent; I just put it down to good old-fashioned administrative incompetence—nothing more than that; nothing less.


So we have seen a bit of a pattern under this government. I do not want to refer to the area of social inclusion but I will. We have had an occasion where the government have remembered to appoint someone to a portfolio but that person does not actually know what the portfolio means. When asked, 'What does it mean?'' Minister Butler now famously said of his portfolio, social inclusion, 'It means different things to different people.' But that is a separate issue. It is a portfolio. Someone has been appointed but they do not actually know what their job is.


The very significant concern which we have is that of the transfer of responsi­bilities—particularly tertiary education and VET—from the education committee to the economics committee. I know that there would be those in the government who would say VET and the tertiary sector are very economically significant. I know that Senator Mason is always saying how economically significant tertiary education and VET are and how tertiary education is one of Australia's major export industries. There is no greater advocate for the economic significance of the tertiary education sector than Senator Mason. So I would not be surprised at all to hear those on the other side say, 'It is logical, really; these are economically significant portfolios.' But there are a whole heap of economically significant portfolios. 




Senator Brandis:
  Transport.




Senator FIFIELD:
  You could mount that argument about transport, as Senator Brandis said. But we have an education committee. I can imagine vice-chancellors tuning into the Senate education estimates committee. I am sure they often do, Senator Mason. They will be waiting, waiting, waiting, and they will not get to see Senator Mason. They will be bereft! They will be very disappointed.


I made that point with some humour but there is a serious point there: we have an education committee and it really defies logic why you would not have the tertiary and VET components of that portfolio in the education committee. The economics committee has a very heavy workload. And you may not have noticed but Senator Cormann and Senator Bushby in particular have no shortage of questions to ask in that committee. They do a sensational job of holding the government to account in the best Westminster traditions. They are truly forensic in their working through of the portfolio outcomes.


That committee has some very important public policy matters before it. There is the carbon tax and the MRRT, and then there is that little old issue of the budget surplus—whether we are going to get back into budget surplus. That is just a very minor issue of public policy that the economics committee looks after! Those very important areas of consideration are going to be squeezed out by tertiary education and VET. No offence to tertiary education and VET; they should have their place, but their place is in the education estimates committee. 


Senator Brandis touched on something which I think is a factor in the government's consideration—that is, seeking to deny time and space for the consideration of the effects of the carbon tax on the Australian economy and the effects of the MRRT on the Australian economy, particularly in Western Australia. If there is one thing that this government wants to provide the absolute minimum of time for it is examining the likelihood of the budget going into surplus in the next financial year. That is an examination which this government is terrified of. And I think that what we see before us today is an indication of that. 


There is, unfortunately, a growing tendency by this government to abuse the Senate estimates process. You may recall that once upon a time Senate estimates committees would meet through the night. They would sometimes sit until 3 am in the morning. 




Senator Ludwig:
  You weren't here then.




Senator FIFIELD:
  I was not here. That is why I am posing the question to someone who may have been, Senator Ludwig.




Senator Brandis:
  Senator Macdonald was. He speaks about it.




Senator FIFIELD:
  Senator Macdonald certainly was. There was at that time, I understand, an informal agreement reached between the then government and the then opposition. It was: we will not sit until three in the morning; we will finish at 11 o'clock at night. But the quid pro quo was that while that would be to the benefit of the government of the day the time in estimates would fundamentally be for the opposition. Of course, all senators have the right to ask their questions but the government recog­nised that Senate estimates is fundamentally a time for the opposition. In recognising that, the Senate supported one of the important accountability mechanisms of this place. That was the understanding; that was the compact which was entered into. There has been an erosion of that compact over recent years under this government, where, increas­ingly, government senators have sought, in effect, to put dorothy dixers to government ministers at the table—not genuine quest­ions, not questions seeking information, not questions seeking to represent a constituent and not questions seeking to hold a minister to account, which it is quite legitimate for people of the same party to seek to do from time to time. That is not the purpose of these questions—and you have almost come in on cue, may I say, Senator Cameron, to the subject matter of my discussion! But I will go no further on that because I do not want in any way to reflect on the chair, Senator Cameron.

The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Cameron
) (10:00):  Thank you.




Senator FIFIELD:
  Senate estimates is essentially an opposition forum and we have seen that eroded. In fact, Senator Faulkner, one of the substantial figures of this chamber, has always said that estimates is an opposition forum. So I cite no higher authority than Senator Faulkner on this matter. I think it is important that we return Senate estimates to being an opposition forum—to being what they should be, which is one of the great accountability mechan­isms not just of this parliament but of parliaments worldwide. Our estimates committee process is recognised as one of the best and one of the most robust accounta­bility mechanisms in any parliament and we need to reinforce that. I think this realloca­tion of portfolio responsibilities between committees is yet another subtle undermi­ning of the role that our committee system should play.


We have seen this pattern over the life of this government. We saw it with the carbon tax legislation. It was bad enough that that legislation was presented to this parliament by a government which formed office on the back of a lie—that was bad enough. What was also outrageous was the fact that this Senate denied that package of legislation the opportunity for scrutiny by the committees of the Senate. Legislation of such signifi­cance has always gone to Senate committees. The goods and services tax legislation and the A New Tax System package of legisla­tion went through multiple Senate committ­ees simultaneously for the best part of six months, yet that economically significant package of carbon tax legislation was denied the opportunity for that scrutiny. That is just another example of where the various forums of this parliament are continually undermi­ned by this government in subtle and not so subtle ways. We are seeing this here again.


We have another curious element to this motion: the reallocation of arts and sport to the rural and regional affairs portfolio. Minister Arbib, who is in the chamber, is the Minister for Sport, and when I look at him I do not see a regional figure—I have to say that. I do not think regional when I look at Minister Arbib, the sports minister.




Senator Brandis:
  He is in the region of Sussex Street.




Senator FIFIELD:
  That is right. I know as a senator for New South Wales he represents the whole state, but I suspect he has a particular focus on more metropolitan areas of the state.




Senator Mason:
  I'm very regional, Mitch.




Senator FIFIELD:
  As opposed to Senator Mason, who is very rural. The rural and regional affairs committee is a very curious location for the arts and sports portfolio. But our main concern is that of the overburdening of the economics committee. I know you take a close interest in the economics committee, Senator Cameron.




Senator Brandis:
  There has to be a socialist voice!




Senator FIFIELD:
  That is right. The committee is a place for alternative points of view and, boy, you sure provide an alternative point of view, Senator Cameron. But, in all seriousness—and, I think, Mr Acting Deputy President, we probably have some sympathy for this view—the economics committee really is one of the flagship committees of the Senate estimates committee system. It looks at monetary policy, fiscal policy, competition policy, Corporations Law, financial services and retirement incomes—there is no significant area of economic regulation or economic policy that it does not have coverage of. If there is one committee that this parliament should think very carefully about when it comes to allocation of responsibility and ensuring that there is adequate time for appropriate scrutiny, it is the economics committee.


We have heard time and again from the government that they are good economic managers. We have heard time and again from the government that they, supposedly, saved Australia from the effects of the global financial crisis. We have heard time and again from the government that they are good budget managers. We have heard all these things—no-one believes them, but we hear them frequently. The Senate economics committee is the place for those propositions to be examined and challenged—to challen­ge the proposition that the govern­ment saved Australia from the full effects of the global financial crisis. I would contend that they did not, that it was not a massive spend on school halls and pink batts that saved Australia but that it had perhaps a little more to do with the fact that we have a floating exchange rate, that there was strong demand from China, that Australia has some of the best prudential regulatory arrangements in the world, courtesy of the Howard-Costello government, and that we have an independ­ent Reserve Bank and monetary policy did a fair bit of the heavy lifting in the face of the global financial crisis. Monetary policy could have done more. There could have been more space provided for the stimulatory effects of lower interest rates, but the massive spend by this government denied that opportunity. Those are things which still should be fully examined by the Senate estimates process. This government have told us time and again that they are good fiscal managers, that they will have this budget back in surplus in the next financial year. Again, no-one believes that. It may well be that on budget night the Treasurer stands up and declares that he forecasts a surplus for the next financial year. But, as we know, a forecast in a budget speech counts for nothing. In Wayne Swan's very first budget speech he forecast a surplus. We have not seen a surplus from this government.


What really matters is the final budget outcome, and we need to examine in Senate estimates the assumptions on which the next budget will be based. We need to probe and examine those, and that opportunity should not be denied as a result of the Economics Committee being overburdened with other tasks of examination of the VET portfolio and of the tertiary portfolio. We need to have that opportunity.


We need to have the opportunity in the Senate estimates committee to look at the effects of the carbon tax. This government are still not being forthcoming with all of modelling work behind the design of the carbon tax. We need to examine the focus that the Leader of the Opposition has put on this in the last few days, where we know from Treasury's own work that there will be a $1 trillion cumulative hit on the economic output of the nation up to 2050.




Senator Cormann:
  That was discovered at a great Senate inquiry.




Senator FIFIELD:
  I should give credit to Senator Cormann. We need to further examine that matter. We need to further examine the MRRT. Senator Cormann quite rightly sought to suspend standing orders yesterday in order to move a motion which would prevent further consideration of that legislation until such time as the government has complied with the orders that this Senate has already passed to provide information on the MRRT. That was appropriate for Senator Cormann to do. Unfortunately, the Senate did not grant a suspension of standing orders and we did not have the opportunity to move that motion. But the opportunity to vote on that motion will present later this week.


These are all very serious matters of public policy, and the opposition takes its job of holding the government to account very seriously. The opposition takes very seriously the role of the Senate as a house of review. As I said the other day, often when it comes to legislation and often when it comes to matters of public policy those in this chamber are often the first people to turn their mind to it. They do not always do so over in the other place. They do not always do so in the caucus. They do not always do so in the cabinet. Often it is the case that the first time that a matter of public policy or a piece of legislation is seriously examined and seriously probed is in this place and in the committees of the Senate. We take that responsibility very seriously.


It is for that reason that we think it is inappropriate that tertiary and VET be transferred from the education committee to the Economics Committee. We do think it is a little inappropriate that the arts and sports area finds its way into the Rural and Regional Affairs portfolio. We do need to take our committee system seriously. We should not support the subtle and not so subtle undermining of the Senate estimates committee process and of the other accountability mechanisms of this place. We are unable to support a motion that seeks to do that. We will not be supporting the motion. I would recommend to the govern­ment that they reconsider this portfolio reallocation. It is not too late for them to do so. They can simply say, 'Look, we didn't actually have any bad intent here; this was just good old-fashioned incompetence, something which we are well known for,' and I think everyone would accept that and recognise that as a statement of truth. For those reasons, we will not be supporting this motion.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2012-02-08,"



Senator MASON
 (Queensland) (10:11):  Acting Deputy President Cameron, it might have been one of your friends, Senator Lionel Murphy, who back in the 1970s introduced the notion of Senate estimates committees, and he did so, of course, Sir, as an accountability measure. It is perhaps the most important modern justification for the Senate. What it does is put the executive and senior public servants on the spot. And constitutionally it provides the following link. The parliament votes money to the executive for expenditure on government programs. That is what we do, and that is what the Constitution says. The parliament then wants to see how the executive has spent the money that it voted to them. It as simple as that, and that is what Lionel Murphy said. So there are constitutional reasons for the estimates process, and they are critical to the way our system performs.


My eloquent colleagues, Senator Brandis and Senator Fifield, said that estimates committees are good for the opposition—and that is true. Senator Faulkner and Senator Ray—when I used to try to chair them in the finance and public administration committee many years ago; and I did it very unsuccessfully I might add—said that it was the opposition's show. But I do not think they were quite right. There is much more to it than that. I actually think it is a tool for government, because governments often find out in estimates committees what is not going so well and where the holes are in their programs. And I mean that. That might seem self-serving but I honestly believe that—that ministers and senior public servants think, 'Gee, I didn't know about that,' or 'That isn't going so well.' So, sure, it is a forum for the opposition—I accept that; of course it is—but it is also a place where governments can learn about failures in the delivery of their own programs.


If I can throw in a quick partisan note: one of the great criticisms that the opposition has of this government is the implementation of their programs. If you had to summarise our criticisms of the government it is the implementation of government programs. It is not the aspirations. In my field of education, I would agree, as you know, Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, with many of the aspirations of the government. But I do criticise consistently the way programs have been implemented—whether it is the Building the Education Revolution, compu­ters in schools, digital education revolution and so forth. We can have that debate later on, but certainly the argument from our side has always been that the implementation of government programs is where the government is weak. Finally, I honestly believe it is good for the country. I think it is good for the country that the government of whatever persuasion is put on the spot. I was only very briefly a parliamentary secretary before we lost government, but even in that very brief six months I found the experience of sitting in Senate estimates committees unnerving and uncomfortable. It is probably a very good thing. One day—and I do not know when it will be—we will probably be back in government and then we will be uncomfortable again. But that is probably not a bad thing either. I think the whole process of Senate estimates is good for the opposition. I do not quibble with that, and I am not trying to pretend it is not—it is our forum—but I do think it is good for government in the sense that it lets them know where the holes are, where they are making mistakes and where they are not delivering services well. Finally, it is good for the country because the country—if it cannot rest assured—can be more assured that the taxpayers' money is being well spent. So our general principle from this side is that these are really important processes.


Senate estimates are vital to accountability and integrity and we think that the Senate should do all it can to facilitate that process. I know my friends in the Greens would agree with us because they have always been very keen to push integrity and accountability in the Senate, so I am hoping they will support us when this motion is finally put to the vote. Senator Brown always tells the Senate—and he is right—that Senate estimates are vital to keep governments of whatever persuasion and the executive in check. Let us face it: when we had a Senate majority briefly in the Howard era the only check in that period, because the Senate itself was not a check, was Senate estimates. You will recall that, Mr Acting Deputy President.


To in any way compromise the capacity of Senate estimates to do their job is a very bad thing. I know my words are now going on the record for all time and I will be held to account for them, but I believe they are right. My colleagues have known me for long enough to know that I can be as partisan as they come. I know that, and I am not trying to hide that, but there is an issue that is even higher than partisanship and that is good government. Estimates provide for better government for all of us. 


Senator Fifield and Senator Brandis put this very well before. My area is tertiary education and Senator Nash looks after vocational education and training and skills. Let me explain what it meant under the original budget estimates for this year that came out before the government had the reshuffle and changed the administrative arrangements from the first draft for DEEWR, the Department of Education, Employment and Workplace Relations, which moved tertiary education into the Economics Legislation Committee. Under the original draft, which I have before me, we had higher education and vocational education and training commencing at 9 am and finishing at 2.15 pm. If you take the lunch hour out—that is fair enough—you are left with four hours and 15 minutes. That is a pretty typical draft of how the education committee operates in estimates for voca­tional education and training and also tertiary education. That makes allowance for the lunch break. Under the draft program for the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, tertiary education and vocational education and training are reduced to 1¾ hours, from 3.45 pm to 6.00 pm. So we have a reduction from four hours and 15 minutes down to 1¾ hours. That is much less than half—about 40 per cent of the original time. 


Some people probably think that it does not matter. Who cares about tertiary educa­tion and vocational education and training? I know that Senator Evans does and I know that Senator Carr does. Indeed, I know that the Prime Minister does. I criticise the Prime Minister frequently, but I have never, ever criticised her enthusiasm and her support for education and education reform publicly or privately. I think she has done a great service to the nation in promoting education and educational outcomes as a really important industry. You are right that I have criticised her consistently for the delivery of educati­onal programs but never, ever her intentions or aspirations. I think she is well motivated.


As Senator Brandis said, I sound like a broken record, and I know this, but higher education is our largest export services industry and worth about $18 billion to this country. It is enormous, just behind minerals, iron ore, coal and now gold. It is a huge export industry. It is the largest export industry for the city of Melbourne. Senator Fifield knows that. You go to Melbourne and there are international students all over the place. We are talking about an industry that is absolutely vital to our nation's future. 


Let us face it: when the mining boom finishes or softens—and one day it will—if we want a resilient economy that really works, an economy where people are trained and are productive and an economy where things like the GFC, a strong Australian dollar and competition from other education providers do not buckle it, it will largely come down to how well Australians are trained and how well they are educated. If you want to bolster Australia's productivity and supercharge outcomes, you do it with training and education. I see Senator Cormann sitting there. I know he is from Western Australia and a great advocate of the mining industry but, even with the greatest respect to him, one day demand for our resources may diminish or may soften. In building a resilient economy that can ride those waves, education will be absolutely critical, so we are talking about a really vital issue. It is pretty simple.


I always say, Mr Acting Deputy President, and I think perhaps my friends Senator Carr and Senator Evans would actually agree with me: we, Australia, are a superpower in just a few things. We are a superpower in sport and we are superpower in mining; that is true. We are a superpower in agriculture and we are a superpower in higher education. We educate per head of population more kids from overseas than any other nation on earth. In English-speaking countries we are the third largest provider. It is an extraordinary achievement. It is not a partisan achieve­ment; it is an extraordinary achievement for this country. So we are talking about an industry here that makes us a world superpower. We are not a superpower in many things, but we are in the delivery of higher education, right throughout the world.


Let us face it, Mr Acting Deputy President, you know, I know and the govern­ment knows that Australia is perfectly positioned to take advantage of a booming middle class in Asia. I have no doubt that the white paper that the government is producing at the moment on our engagement with Asia will look at tertiary education. We can provide tertiary education at the highest level for potentially hundreds of thousands more young kids from Asia. It is not just great for our economy—of course it is good for our economy; it even has the effect of cross-subsidising research and learning in this country. I know and accept that, but it also has other profound effects—for example, diplomacy. It increases Australia's soft power.


I was in Malaysia not so long ago and I swear that half the Malaysian cabinet was educated in Australia. That gives us enormous political purchase, emotional purchase and soft power in countries like Malaysia. So over the next few years—and to give them credit, I know the government are looking at this—Australia will be perfectly positioned. We used to say we were going to become the 'salad bowl' for Asia. We really can be the education provider for Asia, and we are perfectly positioned, better than anyone else in the world, to provide those services. That is why it is so critical.


These estimates are at a time—and Senator Evans says this all the time, and he is right—of significant reform in higher education. You would be aware, Mr Acting Deputy President Cameron, of the Bradley reforms. Professor Bradley's review came out a few years ago now and the first year of the demand driven system is this year. It is 2012—it has just commenced. The caps have come off for all qualified young Australians. They can attend university and the Common­wealth will support a place for them. This is a significant reform in tertiary history. The government's belief is that this is a way to provide access for kids who otherwise would not have had a chance—kids from disadvantaged backgrounds, Indigenous young Australians and young Australians from regional areas. 


This is a significant reform. It is an expensive reform. You would have heard that I have some reservations about imple­mentation, standards and quality. I accept that. As a general proposition, subject to certain riders, the opposition supports it. I was going to ask a lot of questions about that. Of course I would because it is an expensive operation and it is vital for Australia's future, but I am not going to have the time now that tertiary education is being moved to the economics committee. I know it is a great committee and that Senator Bushby and the chair do a great job, but the fact is that there will not be sufficient time. The time has been cut by more than 60 per cent. For the first year of very significant reforms in the area, there will not be sufficient scrutiny.


You would also be aware, Mr Acting Deputy President, of TEQSA—the Tertiary Education Quality and Standards Agency—that has just started. This is the way the government hopes to ensure that standards are kept in this country. Because more young Australians are coming into university the way the government wants to ensure that standards do not drop is through TEQSA. Again, it is vital that questions be asked of TEQSA. They took up their statutory obligations on 1 February and I have many questions to ask of the chairman of TEQSA. They are vital questions about how they are going to monitor standards and quality in tertiary education in this country. These are very important questions because the one thing that will compromise Australia's higher education system is the perception anywhere in the world—particularly in Asia—that our standards are dropping. If there is any hint that Australian standards are dropping in our universities in this country, then the export industry—the fourth largest in this country and the greatest services export industry—will either be compromised or all over. So TEQSA is a vital agency to ensure that standards do not drop. That is why it is important for the opposition to ask questions. To be fair, I know that the Greens have questions. I think my good friend Senator Rhiannon, who is looking after this area, has questions about TEQSA. It is a vital agency for the regulation of standards in higher education. It is absolutely critical. 


Late last year, Dr Jane Lomax-Smith brought out the base funding review which talked about how much the course fees should be for young Australians at university and how much the government should provide. Is that a critical issue? Absolutely, because it impacts on all the young Australians who want to go to university. How much will they be paying? Dr Lomax-Smith had some ideas. Without getting into the debate about who is right and who is wrong—I accept that is for another time and another place—it is an issue that has to be ventilated, and estimates is the best place for it. As you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, I like nothing better than coming into the Senate and having a quiet chat to the chamber but I think the government is better served by opposition senators in estimates than it is by any rhetorical display by me or any of my colleagues. I mean that but we are going to be denied that. So the base funding review that Dr Lomax-Smith chaired, which raised really interesting and important issues about the future of higher education and funding, again will not be addressed. I should not forget vocational education and training, Mr Acting Deputy President, which I know you are very interested in. I know that Senator Carr, Senator Evans and indeed the Prime Minister have all spoken about training and skills often. When we talk about productivity the government talks about training and skills, as it should; but there is no time in the schedule to examine those issues. I know the shadow minister, Mrs Ley in the other place, and Senator Nash, the opposition spokesperson here in the Senate, have many questions they want to ask about that because vocational education and training has a new national regulator to regulate standards in the VET sector. Is that important? It is critically important for the VET sector. However the opposition wants to characterise it, the government has not stood still in higher education. I have never said it has stood still. I disagree with how it has implemented policy, but it has not stood still and there is plenty of fertile territory for estimates. Again, the way things are going we are not going to get there. In fact we are not going to get anywhere near talking about the new regulator for vocational education and training.


I know my friend Senator Cormann wants to spend time in the economics committee examining the carbon tax and the mining tax, as he should. I know it is politically combustible and I accept all that. It comes to this: in the end this is a matter of a govern­ment setting a precedent. I honestly do not think it is a good precedent. I do not know if it is advertent or inadvertent. Senator Brandis used the word 'maligned'. I do not know whether it is maligned or simply uninten­tional, but it sets a very bad precedent when the opposition is unable to address really critical issues, whether they are about the mining sector or about the carbon tax or in my area where there has been significant reform in universities and vocational education and training.

"Bushby, Sen David",LP,2012-02-08,"



Senator BUSHBY
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (10:31):  The Prime Minister tells us that she wants to put the economy front and centre in 2012, yet it is incredible to me that the first thing her government does this year is place further limits on the ability of this parliament to scrutinise economic issues. One of the strengths of our system of government over the past 110 years has been the accounta­bility of the executive—the government of the day—to its parliament. It is a strength which has helped deliver largely stable and corruption-free government regardless of which party has been in power over the history of our nation. That is not something that you can necessarily say about all countries in the world. One of the key aspects that has helped us to deliver—and I underline that—is the accountability of government to this parliament.


Over the last 40 years, the estimates system has been developed. My colleague Senator Mason went through some of the history of that and noted some of the think­ing behind it and some of its advantages. It has certainly enhanced the ability of this parliament to hold the government to account and to scrutinise its activities and the programs that the government of the day seeks to deliver and the way those programs are being implemented.


Traditionally in the development of estimates over the last 40 years the skills balance between those who are the inquisi­tors and those who are being subjected to questions usually leads to—and I know there is a bit of cut and thrust and a bit of parrying between the two opposing sides—relatively balanced outcomes where failings of governments of the day, the failings of their programs and the failings to implement them in a way that is cost effective and deliver the outcomes properly and well, are exposed and those activities of government that do need to be kept relatively close to government have been managed to be kept that way. It is a balance, and there is a need for balance in that. There are some things government does which need to be kept fairly close to its chest, and there are other things which need to be exposed to the public and which the public needs to hear about. Estimates has provided a traditional balance and a very effective way of ensuring that those things which should come into the public domain do come in for the betterment of our system of government and for the betterment of the Australian people. However, I would note that this government has taken evasion and deflection, which is a usual tactic in esti­mates, to new heights and has been putting that balance at risk. The approach by this government is starting to seriously under­mine the level of scrutiny that estimates can deliver for the benefit of the Australian public. The proposal we are debating this morning takes that deterioration in the effectiveness of estimates and makes it worse.


Estimates is important. It is a vital tool in ensuring that the activities of government are properly scrutinised. That is even more so in my view, speaking as deputy chair of the Economics Legislation Committee, for the economics committee. In estimates we have the opportunity to examine the performance of the economy, the fiscal position of the government—which has been of huge public importance over recent years—and issues such as interest rates, government debt, the impacts of international developments on the Australian economy and so on. These issues are central to the government of Australia—more so over the last few years than they have been traditionally. The economics committee is where these issues get aired.


It is appropriate, it is proper and it is good for the people of Australia that there is proper opportunity for the issues to be aired and for the elected members of this parlia­ment, the Senate, to inquire of the govern­ment about these issues. Estimates provides the only forum in which the members of the Senate have that opportunity. We all know the realities of question time, whether in the Senate or in the other place, when very few questions get answered in detail or properly, but Senate estimates traditionally has provided the opportunity for questions of importance and relevance to be answered. Generally and traditionally the questions do get answered and it is the appropriate forum for this to be done. The economics committee in estimates deals with issues of central importance to all Austra­lians. Any change that limits the ability of that committee to properly examine these issues is a retrograde step which can only fail to serve the interest of Australians.


Over and above the issues central to the economy, as I have mentioned, the econo­mics committee also traditionally looks into other Treasury portfolios: the Australian Office of Financial Management, which manages the issuance of government debt; the Australian Prudential Regulation Author­ity, which looks at the prudential regulation of banks, the superannuation industry and the insurance industry; the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, which looks into a very broad range of issues relating to corporate regulation, superannuation and financial services; the ACCC; the Common­wealth Grants Commission; and a number of other agencies, including as the Department of Industry, Innovation, Science, Research and Tertiary Education and—importantly once again for the performance of the Australian economy—the Department of Resources, Energy and Tourism. That is its current load; that is what it already does, and it tries to pack that into two days. What we are talking about now is taking something we have heard from Senator Mason, taking more than half a day off a different estimates committee and packing that into a two-day program in the economics committee where we are already pushed and hard-pressed finding time to properly deal with the portfolio agencies that we already have. Not only does that fail to do justice to the tertiary education and vocational education areas, which quite clearly deserve that half-day that they traditionally have had in the education committee, but it undermines the ability of the economics committee to consider those issues that it already has. It is a lose-lose for everybody


I would not mind having a look at what we actually do in the economics committee but I think I will probably cut my time short in view of keeping the debate short. I note that the economics committee rarely, if ever, has finished early. I come down at 11 o'clock at night after estimates has finished and the day is finished and I note that some of the other estimates committees have finished early and have gone home. I am quite envious of the fact that they have managed to get out before 11 o'clock—and, Mr Acting Deputy President Cameron, as a member of the economics committee, you would be aware that we rarely get out before 11 o'clock. That is because we never, ever have enough time to adequately deal with the issues and questions that need to be asked of the agency portfolios in the economics estimates committee. I end up putting probably hundreds of questions on notice at the end of estimates, because there is so much that I think needs to be asked and there is no time to ask it. 


Senator Mason very eloquently explored the reasons why vocational and tertiary education need the time that traditionally they have been allocated and the importance of those areas to the Australian economy and the Australian people. To take all of that and to squeeze and poke it into an agenda that is already inadequate in terms of the time that is available to explore the issues that it is charged with exploring, is, I think, an indication of either gross mismanagement or, in the context of a Prime Minister who wishes to explore the economy to a greater extent, something a little less noble than mismanagement.


So what are we looking at? Over the last few weeks since we found out that this change was going to be put before the Senate—and probably, depending on the outcome of the Greens' vote, likely to proceed—we have tried to manage by looking at where we can cut time from the existing agenda and which of those portfolio agencies we can take some time from. In some cases, some agencies will just be excused and not called because in terms of the overall priorities we will not be able to deal with them. That is not good for scrutiny of government. These are all agencies that do good things. They should appear before the committee and should be properly scrutin­ised. But given we are trying to squeeze a half-day program from another committee into our two-day program, we have gone through that and tried to make it work.


I commend the chair of the committee, Senator Mark Bishop, who is being quite reasonable in trying to work with us to fit all this in so that we can try to get those agencies before us that we really need to have and to maximise the time for each of them. But the reality is, as hard as we have tried and as accommodating as the chair has been, we have ended up with an outcome that is a very, very poor outcome for delivering the benefits and proper scrutiny of these areas so that we can make sure that the government in these areas is as it should be.


It is a very, very disappointing end, and I will just pull out a few examples of what we are looking at. There are four major Treasury areas: the Treasury Macroeconomic Group, the Treasury Fiscal Group, the Treasury Markets Group, and the Treasury Revenue Group which appears with the ATO, the Australian tax office. As Senator Brandis noted, the Macroeconomic Group has in itself taken half a day or more because of the issues that it deals with. In macroeconomics we look at the broader issues of the impact on the Australian economy of things like the global financial crisis, the impending threats that are coming out of the current European situation and the impacts of interest rates and all those types of issues. Those issues get looked at in the macroeconomics area. As a result of the changes we have now, we have allocated one hour and 45 minutes to deal with the overall macroeconomic issues. That is appalling in terms of the relevance and the importance of macroeconomic issues to all Australians.


Treasury Fiscal is about how the government spends the taxpayers' money that it collects. We have got two hours to go through spending right across all areas of government. That is grossly insufficient time to have any hope at all of looking into the issues of the spending of this government. 


Similarly, there are two hours to look at the Markets Group. The Treasury Markets Group looks at the operation of all the different markets, like the banking market or the housing market, or whatever it might be right across Australia. There are a plethora of different markets that Treasury has oversight of, and yet we have two hours to go right across all markets in Australia. It is grossly insufficient time to do justice to examining the state of those markets, all of which feed into the economy, all employ people, and all create wealth for the people of Australia. Yet we have no opportunity other than these two hours to look at that.


Then of course there is the Treasury Revenue Group in the ATO. The government has argued—and this is all about taxes of course—that the reason it is in such a poor fiscal position is because of the collapse of revenue. This is the opportunity to examine that issue. This is the opportunity to examine new taxes like the government's mining tax and the carbon tax. It is also the opportunity to look at the Australian Taxation Office and how the Australian tax office deals with individuals and companies around Australia in raising those taxes. The two hours and 30 minutes which we have managed to negotiate for that is grossly inadequate. I could go on right through this program and talk about the importance of each of the portfolio agency areas and the need for more time to examine them. I could justify it for each one of those with a very, very strong case. But the reality is that, in summary, we have had to squeeze all of them. We have had to limit the ability for parliament to scrutinise them properly and, at the same time, tertiary education and vocational education lose because we do lose the opportunity to properly scrutinise this area. This is an appalling decision by this government, and I strongly support the position that the coalition has taken in not supporting it.

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2012-02-08,"



Senator CORMANN
 (Western Australia) (10:45):  This government is incompetent, it is divided, it is deeply dysfunctional. It has senior ministers either at each other's throats or with knives in each other's backs. The motion that the government has put before the Senate today to change the program of Senate estimates less than a week before we fulfil that very important function of ours of holding the government to account is just another demonstration of the government's incompetence, the government's division and the government's deep dysfunction.


We have a Prime Minister under pressure. We have a Prime Minister who stuffed up the reshuffle. We have a Prime Minister who broke her promise to the Australian people not to introduce a carbon tax. We have a Prime Minister who stuffed up the mining tax deal. And, no doubt, because the Prime Minister is under so much pressure one of her spin doctors—perhaps the guy that she imported over from Britain, who used to be Tony Blair's spin doctor—said to her, 'Prime Minister, if you want to get rid of some of this pressure and if you want to get yourself into a better position you should try and shift the debate onto the economy'. This is extraordinary advice. It is advice that could only have come from somebody who has not experienced firsthand the disastrous economic and fiscal policy track record of this government over the past four years, consistent with the disastrous fiscal and economic track record of previous Labor governments.


But the Prime Minister took the advice. The Prime Minister tried to shift the debate onto the economy. Yesterday in the other place she said, 'Bring it on. Bring on the debate.' And at the first opportunity to engage on the economy and to put her government forward to the scrutiny of parliament on the performance of the government on the economy, what does the government do? They try to weaken the capacity of the Senate and they try to under­mine the capacity of the Senate Economics Committee to submit the government's performance in the economic area to some proper scrutiny.


The government claims that Australia is in so much better economic shape because of the actions of the Gillard Labor government. If that is the case, why are they not prepared to submit themselves to some proper, detailed and forensic questioning about that during Senate estimates? The reason the government does not want to submit themselves to some forensic questioning in Senate estimates is because they know that the claim does not stand up to scrutiny. They know that the claim that the Gillard govern­ment is somehow responsible for Australia's superior economic position in the world does not stand up to scrutiny.


The government know that four years ago they inherited a $22 billion surplus and a $70 billion net asset position by the Common­wealth. They know that over the last four years Labor has delivered $167 billion worth of accumulated deficits. They know that between the 2010-11 budget being announ­ced and the 2010-11 budget outcome—eventually—the budget position had deteriorated by more than $8 billion. They know that in 12 months the 2011-12 deficit deteriorated under this government from $12.3 billion to $22.6 billion to $37.1 billion by the time of the midyear economic and fiscal outlook.


This is a very important point, because this government, which is so afraid of public scrutiny of its economic performance, deliberately delayed the release of the midyear economic and fiscal outlook until after the parliament rose for the summer break in order to minimise scrutiny of the figures in that midyear economic and fiscal outlook.


The estimates Senate Economics Committee next week will be the first oppor­tunity to submit Treasury and the govern­ment to some detailed questioning about the figures in the midyear economic and fiscal outlook. And what does the government do? The government takes something out of the Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Committee—tertiary education, which has never been part of the Economics Committee—and puts it into the Economics Committee in order to squeeze down the time that we have to question the govern­ment about its economic performance. It is completely inappropriate.


It is not as if we have time to spare in the Senate Economics Committee. The Senate Economics Committee always runs out of time. There are always more important questions to be asked than what we have time for. And, of course, there is a lot of time wasting in the Senate Economics Committee because Labor senators, desperate to protect the weak, incompetent, divided and dysfunctional government, run interference whenever they can. And there is a lot of ducking and weaving going on, avoiding questions—taking 20 minutes to explain why a particular question cannot be answered before taking it on notice.


Here is this government's track record on openness and transparency after we were promised by the Prime Minister back in August 2010 that this would be a new era of openness and transparency: in the last Senate economics estimates Treasury took 851 questions on notice; today 303 of those questions remain unanswered. As we go into the estimates next week to scrutinise the midyear economic and fiscal outlook and to scrutinise the government's bad performance across the economic policy and fiscal areas; and as we go into estimates next week to scrutinise issues, initiatives and proposals like the bad mining tax, the carbon tax and all of the other revenue measures of the government, the government has allocated two hours. This is a high-spending, high-taxing government and it gives us two hours to ask questions about all of its various tax grabs. If you are going to be a high-taxing government you have to provide proper time for the parliament to be able to ask questions about all of your various tax measures. So 35.6 per cent of the questions taken on notice by Treasury remained unanswered; this is pretty concerning.


I will focus on a particular issue. The Senate is well aware and, Mr Acting Deputy President Cameron, you are well aware that I have a particular interest in the implications of Labor's bad mining tax, which came out of a bad process. In order to make the Senate economics estimates committee process as constructive and as productive as possible, before the last estimates I wrote to Secretary to the Treasury Dr Martin Parkinson to advise him specifically about a series of issues that I wanted to ask questions about in order to ensure that Treasury officials would be in a position to provide answers. 


Mr Acting Deputy President, as you are well aware, the government has so far refused to release the mining tax revenue assumptions, commodity price assumptions, production volume assumptions and so on even though that is information that is readily released as part of the budget process in states like Queensland and Western Australia, whose revenue is sensitive to variations in those variables, as would be the case for the Commonwealth budget if the mining tax becomes law. For Treasurer Wayne Swan it is a national secret. He is not prepared to share the mining tax revenue assumptions; no doubt because he has something to hide and no doubt because the serious questions that have been raised about the credibility of the mining tax revenue estimates are justified.


I wrote to Dr Parkinson a week before the last estimates and said: 'The government has attached all of these promises to the mining tax. They have attached a promise to increase the superannuation guarantee from nine to 12 per cent; the superannuation tax rebate for low income earners; a 50 per cent discount on interest income; the increase of concessional contribution caps for over-50s; the phasing down of interest withholding on financial institutions; early company tax cuts for small business; small business instant asset write-offs; standard deductions for work related expenses; the lowering of company tax rates; and the regional infrastructure fund.' The government has never provided the proper costings over the forward estimates for these measures. When the initial Rudd version of the RSPT package was announced many of these measures only had one year to run in the forward estimates. Since then we are into yet another budget cycle and we now have three years where these particular measures are going to be part of the budget.


So we said we wanted to have the costings of each measure that the government has attached to the mining tax over the forward estimates. That is a very reasonable question to ask. We gave the Treasury secretary a week's notice before the last Senate estimates. When Senate estimates came along we thought, 'The senior Treasury official should be in a position to answer these questions,' and guess what? They spent 20 minutes explaining why they were not in a position to answer. When you look through all of the mumbo jumbo and the weasel words you find it was because the government did not want Treasury to provide answers to those questions. 


Ultimately, Treasury took the questions on notice, and guess what? As of this morning answers to these questions have still not been provided. The government is refusing to let the Australian people know what all the promises it has attached to the mining tax will cost the budget, and we know why. The reason the government wants to hide this from the Australian people is it knows that its mining tax package is a fiscal train wreck in the making, and it is trying to cover it up and avoid the scrutiny.


I am sure that Treasury officials are telling the government privately what I am telling the Senate now, which is that the mining tax revenue is highly volatile and is downward trending over time. Right now we are in a situation where we have record terms of trade—the best terms of trade in 140 years. Revenue is at a high. It will be highly volatile because of commodity price changes, exchange rate changes and product­ion volume changes. It is highly volatile and downward trending. The cost of all the promises that Labor has irresponsibly attached to the mining tax is fixed and increasing over time. Over the medium to long term the mining tax package will seriously put the structural stability of the budget at risk.


Over the current forward estimates, based on the best available information put to the Senate inquiry into the mining tax and extracted from Treasury in various hearings, our best estimate is that already the cost of all the promises Labor has attached to the mining tax exceeds the revenue by more than $3 billion. Added to that is the fact that the Gillard government made a promise to the three big mining companies that it would credit all state and territory royalties against any mining tax liability. There you have another $3 billion black hole.


We will stand corrected, but in our estimation right now the mining tax package will leave the budget worse off to the tune of $6 billion over the current forward estimates. That is $2 billion in state royalty increases out of Western Australia, which the government has to credit against the MRRT, $1 billion because the New South Wales state government is increasing royalties on coal, and the three billion dollar difference between the cost of all the promises Labor has attached to the mining tax and the revenue it says it will generate. And there is a serious question mark about whether it will raise revenue at all because the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and the Minister for Resources and Energy, in their secret, exclusively negotiated mining tax deal, gave those three big mining companies a significant upfront tax deduction by giving them the opportunity to use the market valuation method. There is a serious question mark as to whether it will raise any revenue at all over the current forward estimates.


These are the sorts of questions that are appropriately pursued in the Senate economics committee, along with a series of other questions. Of course, these are the sorts of questions that the government continues to avoid. Here we have it: yesterday the mining tax bills hit the Senate. But to this day, on the three key issues we are confront­ing—how much the mining tax will raise, how much the promises that Labor has attached to the mining tax will cost and what the net effect on the budget is—the govern­ment is ducking and weaving to avoid scrutiny. Not only have they refused to answer the questions put to them in Senate economics estimates; they have also completely and flatly ignored a Senate order for the government to provide that information passed on 1 November 2011. So much for the promise by the Prime Minister of a new era of openness and transparency. I think it is fair to say that we can put that particular promise into the very, very long list of broken promises by this incompetent Prime Minister who does not know where to turn next to put out yet another bushfire.


We now have the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook for 2011-12, which was released in December last year—just two or three months ago. It showed that the deficit in 12 months went from $12.3 billion for 2011-12 to $37.1 billion. That is a tripling in the course of 12 months. Clearly we need to explore in great detail the reasons for that. We have also seen there that the net debt position is now expected to go over $130 billion. In the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook three months ago the government said that their expectation was that unemployment would be at 5.5 per cent in both 2011-12 and in 2012-13. Less than two months later the acting Treasurer, the would-like-to-be-Treasurer-soon, Mr Bill Shorten—who would like to probably be anything from Prime Minister down, however close he can get to it—conceded that the unemployment rate was expected to balloon to six per cent this year. So here we have the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook in December 2011 which says the government expects unemployment to go to 5.5 per cent—up from 4.2 per cent when we were in government, by the by—both this financial year and next financial year, and less than two months later the acting Treasurer says, 'No, sorry; it's six per cent.' This government is all over the place. What are the implications of that for the budget bottom line? What does it mean for the government's claim that it will deliver a surplus in 2012-13? The $1.5 billion surplus they are claiming for 2012-13 is already a wafer-thin surplus.


To put that into context, the government's budget position deteriorated by more than $8 billion in 2010-11. It has so far deteriorated by more than $25 billion in 2011-12. But the government wants us to believe that, in the context of increasing unemployment and all of the wasteful spending that the government is pursuing on a regular basis as part of their DNA, somehow there is going to be this magical turnaround in 2012-13 and there is not going to be any deterioration whatsoever in the face of a $1.5 billion claimed surplus. 


I would have thought that these are the sorts of areas that deserve proper scrutiny. But these are, of course, the sorts of issues that this government is desperate to avoid scrutiny on, which is why we get this stunt today where the government, with less than a week to go, comes into this chamber and tries to further squeeze down the time that this Senate has to ask important questions about the state of the economy, the state of the budget and the government's fiscal performance, if you can call it that. We get less than two hours to ask questions about all of Labor's new taxes and all of Labor's revenue measures, less than two hours to talk about the state of the economy and less than two hours to talk about all of the additional red tape that the government wants to impose on the financial services sector. This is just not serious. If the Prime Minister were serious about 'bringing it on', she would make sure that the Senate Economics Legislation Committee had a proper opportunity to scrutinise the government's performance.

"Heffernan, Sen Bill",LP,2012-02-08,"



Senator HEFFERNAN
 (New South Wales) (11:05):  I do not know whether this parliament is confused, but certainly my Rural Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee is. We were told, Minister, that because of your schedule and availability you and Senator Conroy could not fit into the estimates program. I have no idea what that means, but I do know the effect. The rural and transport committee deals with a whole range of very serious matters, presently ranging from coal seam gas and all sorts of things like that to the conduct of the wheat authorities. I have never really been confused about some things in life, but I am pretty confused about what opera, ballet and basketball have to do with an engine failure on a Qantas flight out of Canberra the other day—and that is what you are expecting us to mix together. Some people are confused about what an exit portal is and what an entry portal is. I am not, but I am certainly worried about what is proposed. I think it would be nice to get an explanation of why you cannot put sport into an appropriate area and instead have to lump it in with tractors, sheep, cattle, trains and God knows what else. Does that indicate a downgrading of the importance of agriculture, transport, airline safety and a whole range of other things in the eyes of the government?


There is a whole range of other things. What about the conflict that is occurring up in Gladstone Harbour? We would like to know what that is all about. I would love to get free tickets to the opera and that. Given that my mother was a ballet teacher, I want to go to the ballet when Alan Ramsey's daughter Tosca makes it to the Australian Ballet. She is on her way. When she gets there, I want to be there. Alan and Laura will have something to be really proud of there.


As for the sense of importance, you have lost the plot by putting sport and the arts in with trucks, trains and transport. They did try to stick it in with DAFF, but we managed to win that little battle—DAFF is a full program all day. They tried to stick it on the end of that. These portfolios have no home. You have shopped them around the various committees and we have been lumbered with them. I would like an explanation of that. Does it mean you do not consider the portfolios which the rural and transport committee deals with to be important?


Sport and the arts are important portfolios. It is a great privilege to be the minister for sport. I suppose you would get sick of going to the various boxes for the various games, but it is all part of the privilege. We really want to spend as much time as we can at estimates on the things that we in the committee can directly relate to, and we do not have a relationship with sport and the arts, even though they are important.


We think it is equally important to find out what went wrong with the engine on that QantasLink flight to Sydney the other day. I am sure the lady who took the video through the window when the engine stopped would like to know what caused that to happen, and we would like to be given enough time to find answers to all those questions.


We had a hearing last night where the might of the CSIRO came and gave evidence which I thought was embarrassing. Senator Waters was there. They said they have 452 scientists backing them, but they could not give us some simple answers on some of the propositions around water extraction for coal seam gas. We would like to be able to spend all the time that we can drilling into those sorts of issues. I think it is fair to say that the committee itself was pretty surprised—wouldn't you say, Senator Waters?—that we got landed with sport and ballet. These are important issues, but we wish there was a way that the government, in its wisdom, could find a more suitable home for them and give us more space for the things that we have dealt with for some years as a committee.


We recently put out a unanimous report, which the committee is very proud of, on the issues around coal seam gas. In what I call political blackmail, which I realise is strong language, Tony Windsor—God bless him; he is a smart bushie—got $200 million to go to some sort of overview of the issues around mining and coal seam gas. We put the appropriate people under scrutiny last night as to why it was $200 million, $50 million of which is going to the states and $150 million of which is going to a process which nobody knows anything about—they have no idea. The people who were there said: 'We've set up an expert committee to give advice as to how we're going to spend the $150 million. We don't know what we're going to spend it on, nor do we know why we made it $150 million.' But that shut down the objection to the mining tax by getting the support of Mr Windsor, and good luck to Mr Windsor; he is a pretty good horse dealer. But we would still like to know the ins and outs of that. 


These things take time at estimates. I think this allocation of portfolios is a phoney proposition. It means you are either lowering our powers of scrutiny or you are lessening the importance of the arts and sport. I am afraid that we are at a loss to understand it. My view is that this debate is quite appropriate because some of the decisions are obviously made on the advice of some bureaucrat who would not know which end of a cow is the exit portal. I think you ought to reconsider this. I think it is an insult to rural Australia, agriculture and the transport industry to lump sport and the arts in their portfolio areas when one of the most important tasks of the Senate is to put government funding under scrutiny through the estimates process.


I had better not say what I really think about this because I will have to withdraw it. But this is blowing in the face of agriculture. It is downgrading the signal to all the hardworking farmers out there who want to know where we are going with the various issues around agriculture. Where are we going to end up—with the intermingling of mining? What are we going to do with the 20 million tonnes of salt that is going to come out of coal seam gas if we allow it to? This is not an issue at this time for the federal government. But the Queensland government, against the advice of their own bureaucrats, went ahead and gave British Gas, Santos and Origin permission to mine up there with no idea at all of the consequences for the environment. They knew that there were going to be consequences, but they gave that permission not knowing how to solve the problem of what you do with four million tonnes of salt from one tenement, which is a pile of salt 25 kilometres long. How do you store that safely, given what has just happened in Queensland with the rain and floods? They want to store it in agricultural areas, allegedly in safe storage.


We want to know the answers to all this stuff, and the one process we have available to us is to ask questions at estimates. I am sure the government does not know the answer either. In a preliminary hearing yesterday the CSIRO, backed by 452 scientists, did not know the answer. With great respect to the minister and the government, I think this is an insult to agriculture. I think it is an insult to infrastructure and transport, safe flying, biosecurity and a whole range of other issues that our committee deals with very fervently—and, to the credit of the committee, very rarely do we have a dissent­ing report. When we were in government we gave our government as much stick as we give the present government based on the merits of the issue, because we do not like to play politics with people's livelihoods. But, Minister, with this decision, you are playing politics with people's livelihoods.

"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2012-02-08,"



Senator ARBIB
 (New South Wales—Assistant Treasurer, Minister for Small Business, Minister for Sport and Manager of Government Business in the Senate) (11:15):  That is an hour and 45 minutes lost that could have been used for debate on legislation. There is a large legislative list, and again the tactics of the coalition are quite obviously to delay and delay further so that they can talk about issues which they believe are important. I will now try to respond to a couple of the points that were raised and try to move this debate on. This is a procedural debate—it is a standard debate that happens after ministerial reshuffles. With a ministerial reshuffle you need to adjust the work that happens in estimates and in committees. This motion matches the new portfolio allocations to the committees and ensures that the pattern established by the portfolio list is reflected in the committee structure. This greatly assists both ministers and departmental and agency officials to understand which committees they will appear before, particularly for estimates. It should be a non-contentious motion for the chamber, as it assists the operations of the committees. That Senator Brandis and coalition senators are seeking to make this an issue today only indicates again their preference for making every issue a political point-scoring exercise. It also means that the time of the chamber is again taken up by procedural matters. Without using up more time, I hope the chamber will recognise the logic of aligning portfolios with committees. If there are substantive issues of workload between committees, these should be raised and resolved in the Procedure Committee, which is the appropriate place for such discussions. I have had no indication that this is the opposition's preference, though I am happy to accommodate the discussion after next week's additional estimates hearings using the allocation proposed today.


On the economics committee, my understanding is that extra time has already been apportioned to allow discussion to take place on the Friday morning. But committees are able to take extra time if they think they need it. In response to Senator Heffernan's points about sport and the arts, I say as the sports minister that my ministry is very important to the social fabric of this country. It is an insult for him to say that people in rural Australia would find it insulting that sport sits in the regional affairs committee. Sport is cherished by all Australians, particularly those in regional and rural Australia. The same goes for the arts. I see that day in, and day out when I travel around the country, so I think it is appropriate that those areas lie with the regional affairs committee.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the motion moved by Senator Arbib be agreed to.

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2012-02-08,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (11:26):  I continue my speech from yesterday. Given the decades that we have known that tobacco is deadly, there can be no more excuses about advertising of tobacco in any of its forms when we all know that they are advertising a deadly product. It is interesting that Australia has moved some way when it comes to tobacco advertising, and now the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amend­ment Bill 2010 addresses those mobile devices, tablets and other technological devices that advertising can still filter its way through.


Other countries are not quite up to where Australia is, and that is why a number of countries look to Australia for guidance as to how we move forward when it comes to tobacco advertising. It is quite humorous, I suppose, but interesting and alarming in a sense that recently at a cricket match here in Australia, with India playing, there were some Indian spectators in the crowd holding up signs, some of which we probably thought were supporting their Indian team players, which I am sure they were there for. But actually they were holding up signs written in Hindi supporting tobacco companies and tobacco advertising so that those watching back in India could see certain tobacco products being supported and displayed through the broadcasting that was done here in Australia, which is an interesting take on advertising and an interesting way to advertise tobacco and tobacco products by our Indian friends. However, this is something that is not permitted in Australia, and I understand that as soon as the officials were made aware of this those placards and signs were taken down.


But what we are talking about today is not the advertising of tobacco at our sports fields. We have ended that some time ago, as I talked of earlier. Today is about prohibiting the advertising of tobacco on our other technological devices—our mobile phones, our iPads or tablets and any other kinds of technological devices that come into the market as we move into this technological age. As we find ourselves ever more relying on the world wide web for increasing amounts of information, we can clearly see the need for a review of rules and regulations pertaining to advertising in such mediums, such as those referred to in this amendment bill. 


This bill introduces some very important changes. They will put a stop to big tobacco promoting and advertising their products in our online environment. The President of the Australian Council on Smoking and Health and antitobacco advocate, Mike Daube said:


Cigarettes are now being heavily promoted on the Internet, and there are serious concerns that both online advertising and social networking sites are being used to promote tobacco to young people. 


We must head them off; beat them to the punch. We know that big tobacco are sneaky and we have to continue to play tough. And we have been doing that. We have been going there to win this fight to ensure that we reduce the amount of advertising out there when it comes to this deadly product of tobacco.


This bill will go some way in doing just that. It will take away yet another avenue for this deadly product to be promoted. Let us not forget that when this product is used as intended by its manufacturers it will kill. This is a product that is legal by default. Should a company try and introduce such a product in Australia today, it simply would not be considered, not even for a moment. I commend this bill to the Senate and encourage all my parliamentary colleagues to support it.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2012-02-08,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:31):  I strongly support the government's intentions in relation to the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amendment Bill 2010. The internet and electronic media are fast becoming the biggest loophole across many areas of government regulation. The internet has stretched to cover every facet of our lives. We email instead of talk. We can share photos and music and movies with the tap of a finger. And we even use the word 'google' as a verb. We can now carry the world in our pocket. But, like the real world, the virtual one has its dangers. 


Contrary to what some vested interests say, I am not in favour of a nanny state. I do not support excessive government regulation, and I think most people are able to make up their own minds. But I do not agree that dangerous products should be easily available or that they should be promoted as fun or fashionable. I think Senator Singh in her contribution and Senator Urquhart before her well outlined the health risks involved in smoking and the terrible human toll.


Everyone knows that tobacco is highly addictive. Everyone knows the chemicals in cigarette smoke slowly destroy you from the inside out. According to figures from the medical journal the Lancet, over five million people die from tobacco related illnesses each year. It is the world's leading cause of preventable death. I do not think anyone could argue that we should not discourage people from smoking and that we should not regulate the sale and advertising of what is a legal product. We already have measures in place to do this in the real world. It follows that in the virtual world, which is now so integrated with the real world, we should have the same measures in place.


According to the Interactive Advertising Bureau Australia, online advertising revenue in Australia reached $1.256 billion for the six months to 30 June 2011. That represents a growth of 19 per cent compared to the same period in 2010. By comparison, the broader Australian advertising industry grew just 1.1 per cent, using the same time periods. The IAB also predicted that the online industry would grow exponentially to over $3 billion this year. We should not discount the power of advertising in social networks where word of mouth can spread to literally thousands of people every time someone update their status. The dream endorsement for many companies is no longer a quote from a movie star or sports­man or woman, but from a blogger or even everyday citizens tweeting about how much they like their product. This kind of 'real' promotion is the new gold standard, because people are more likely to believe their friends than advertisers. Of course, some advertisers try to buy in to this promotion, paying well-known bloggers to promote products or by creating what seem to be 'spontaneous' campaigns. What people may not believe if it comes from advertisers, they may believe if it comes from their friends or someone they look up to.


I congratulate the government for recognising the need for reform in this area and for targeting this dangerous product. However, there are other equally important loopholes to close. Online sports betting is now pervading almost every aspect of sport, from advertising on the field and during breaks in the telecast to odds being quoted in the commentary. It is good to see that there is some movement in relation to dealing with that. Unscrupulous operators promoting their games through Facebook or other social networking sites encourage players to buy virtual objects with real money, including gambling chips that can never be cashed out. To paraphrase the Reverend Tim Costello, gamblers can now lose their homes without ever having to leave them.


This sector is urgently in need of greater regulation and protection for consumers. If the government acknowledge that there needs to be greater regulation in internet advertising as part of a comprehensive harm minimisation strategy, they also need to consider the effect of unregulated or poorly regulated gambling activities on the net. This bill constitutes an important reform. I congratulate the government, but I ask them to look further. I will be doing my bit to assist the government by introducing legislation to tighten up the regulations for online advertising for gambling products. That must be the next step. I also look forward to hearing from the government how they will be monitoring the success of these regulations by monitoring tobacco take-up rates, particularly amongst young people. Presumably that information will be available as part of ongoing health surveys. I think this is a good piece of legislation. I hope it is as successful as it is intended to be. I think it will be largely successful. The next step must be online gambling advertising promotion.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2012-02-08,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (11:35):  I rise in support of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amendment Bill 2010. The Gillard government is committed to the health of the Australian people. That is why we are investing money in improving health services and we place such a strong emphasis on preventative health. We want to prevent illness and disease because we know that it is cheaper than treating illness and will avoid unnecessary suffering by those with illnesses.


In 2009, the then Minister for Health And Ageing, the Hon. Nicola Roxon, MP launched the National Preventative Health Strategy. This strategy provides a plan for tackling the burden of chronic disease caused by obesity, tobacco and excessive consumpt­ion of alcohol. It focuses on primary prevention and uses all relevant arms of policy and points of leverage from both the health and the non-health sectors. The strategy comprises three parts: an overview, a roadmap for action and technical papers focused on the three key areas of obesity, tobacco and alcohol. The Council of Australian Governments has agreed to attempt to reduce the daily smoking rate among adults to 10 per cent by 2018 and to halve the daily smoking rate among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. In order to achieve this target, we still have some work to do, and that is why this bill is before the Senate. Approximately three million Australians smoke every day. We know that smoking is destructive. Cigarette smoking is the major cause of lung cancer. It is responsible for causing up to 90 per cent of lung cancer. Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in Australia. Across the nation 15,000 people die each year as a result of smoking and it costs the Australian economy over $31 billion per annum. The burden of disease and illness resulting from smoking should be regarded as a national public health crisis. This bill is one of a raft of preventive health measures this govern­ment is using to tackle this crisis.


The bill will ensure consistency when it comes to tobacco advertising and will achieve a number of positive changes. It will amend the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 to accommodate the changes in technology that have occurred since that legislation was passed. The bill will make it a specific offence to advertise or promote tobacco products on the internet and all other electronic media, including future technolo­gies. We all know how quickly the rate of technological change is occurring. Unless advertising complies with state and territory legislation or Commonwealth regulations, it will be an offence to advertise. It will also allow for regulations of internet tobacco advertising and online sales to be similar to those placed on over-the-counter sales. The legislation will also make changes to online tobacco sales so they are governed by the same rules as the sales made in shops. 


This bill will improve the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992, the TAP Act, which was introduced by the Keating Labor government. The TAP Act was designed to comprehensively ban tobacco advertising in Australia. Now that we are in the 21st century we have new technology and the current legislation does not cover all advertising media. This is a key area we need to rectify. We know that young people love their technology and this, combined with the fact that modern methods are exempt from advertising prohibition, means that they are exposed to tobacco advertising. We need to have a consistent approach to the advertising prohibition on tobacco to protect people from the temptation advertising often presents. The bill will allow regulations to be made which could cover aspects such as size, content, format and location of internet tobacco advertisements. It will also be possible to regulate for the inclusion of health warnings, warnings about age restrictions on the sale of tobacco products as well as information about fees, taxes and other charges that may be incurred when purchasing the product. Age restricted access systems for allowing people to access tobacco advertising may also be regulated. After all, what parent with a young child wants them exposed to tobacco advertising online?


The bill will ensure that penalties for internet advertising will be consistent with those applied to other types of advertising. The penalties for failing to observe tobacco advertising regulations will be set at a maximum of 120 penalty units, and this is equivalent to $13,200 at present. This is a large amount of money to most people and, hopefully, the prospect of a fine will make most people think twice about disregarding the regulations. The bill will complement other measures the government has introduced and the ones we are still working to implement. 


The Gillard government values the health of all Australians and we want people to make informed decisions about their health and to do what they can to prevent illness. One thing people can do is choose not to take up smoking. Those people already smoking can choose to cut back or, better still, stop altogether. In 2010 this government increa­sed the excise on tobacco by 25 per cent. On its own, this measure is expected to cut the number of Australians smoking by around 87,000. Last year the government offered smokers support to quit by subsidising nicotine patches and the anti-smoking drug known as Champix through the Pharmaceut­ical Benefits Scheme for the first time. This was just another way to reduce the smoking rate in Australia. We have a history of coordinated plans at federal and state level to reduce smoking. Through historic bans on smoking in workplaces and public areas and through prohibiting advertising, we are making it less likely for people to take up smoking. As has been said, this is particularly important for our young people as we want them to not smoke to begin with. We all know it is better to not start smoking than to become addicted and then have to work hard to give it up. We are also making record investments in anti-smoking social marketing campaigns.


The government also implemented plain-packaging legislation to make tobacco products less attractive to consumers. On 31 May last year I joined the then Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon MP, and my colleague Senator Carol Brown, who is in the chamber at the moment, to sign the plain-packaging pledge in Canberra on World No Tobacco Day. On 21 April I joined with Minister Roxon and, once again, my federal parliamentary colleague Senator Carol Brown and the then Chief Executive of the Cancer Council Tasmania, Mr Darren Carr, at the Royal Hobart Hospital to promote plain packaging. The legislation passed through parliament on 10 November last year. The government's plain-packaging legislation means that from 1 December consumers will see cigarette packs with no colours or logos. Instead they will see more prominent health warnings and each time they see these warnings they will be forced to think about the damage that their smoking is doing to their health. They will know that each cigarette is doing damage and that, ultimately, their life will be shortened by smoking. It is estimated that the cost to Australia's economy from the impact of smoking is more than $31 billion per year. The savings we can make by reducing the number of smokers mean that there will be more money available to improve treatment of other illnesses. Our motivation for this legislation, as I said, is a healthier Australia and to avoid costs that a healthier nation will no longer have to meet or that can be redirected to other areas.


Let me recap exactly what this Labor government has done in preventative health since coming to office. We sought to establish a preventative health agency so that we had a national approach to health strategies and research. We have protected people, especially young people, from the dangers of binge drinking by introducing a tax on premixed drinks as well. In our first term in government we invested more money in preventative health than our predecessors, the Howard government, did in their almost 12 years in power. Interestingly enough, the Labor Party no longer accepts political donations from tobacco companies. We decided it was not ethical to accept money from these companies when their products cause such harm to consumers. Because of this, the tobacco companies know that they need to get the support of the opposition if they are to stop the government from passing our legislation. It seems that those opposite do not have the same problem accepting money from tobacco companies, which is a shame. In the last election campaign, $5 million was spent by the tobacco industry to target the Labor Party. There was one reason for this campaign and one reason only: the industry knew that their profits would be negatively impacted if the legislation was passed.


The coalition does not share the Gillard government's passion for preventative health. It has blocked many health reform bills put before the parliament, including the Australian National Preventative Health Agency Bill 2010. Only recently it tried to block the government's plain-packaging legislation. Fortunately, it did not succeed on this occasion. My colleague from the other place the Hon. Craig Emerson MP, Minister for Trade, recently said, 'The Liberal mantra is why put off to till tomorrow what can be put off forever,' and that does seem to be the approach that those opposite take on a lot of these tough decisions. If we all shared that sentiment, we would not achieve anything in this parliament.


Thankfully, on this side we believe in getting things done. We think this is very important to the future health of Australia, to the health of individuals within our great nation. We do not want to see people unnecessarily ill or, in a worst case scenario, dying. We think it is important that this legislation is passed by the Senate. I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers) (11:46):  I start by thanking senators for their contributions to the debate on this Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amend­ment Bill 2010. The passage of this bill is another important step towards reducing the national smoking rate to 10 per cent of the population by 2018 and halving the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander smoking rate in that time—the goal of our government. Since the passage of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act in 1992, the use of the internet and other electronic means as advertising mediums has become increasingly widespread. Unregu­lated internet advertising undermines the effectiveness of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act. It can weaken tobacco controls by allowing sales to minors, promoting smoking and permitting the purchase of cigarettes without graphic health warnings.


The amendments we are dealing with today will make it a specific offence to advertise or promote tobacco products on the internet and all other electronic media and future technologies unless compliant with state and territory legislation or Common­wealth regulations. They will also enable the making of regulations in relation to internet tobacco advertising to be similar to those placed on over-the-counter sales and online sales will no longer be different.


I welcome the comment of the member for Boothby during the passage of the legislation through the other place when he said:


The coalition are supporting the passage of this legislation because we recognise there is more to be done in the area of preventative health and there is still more to be done in the area of tobacco control.


The member for Boothby is absolutely correct. There is still more to be done. I encourage him to start by looking in his own backyard. Let him start by getting the Liberal Party to break its own expensive habit with big tobacco. Let us recall that in 2009-10 the Liberal Party accepted over $292,000 from big tobacco in political donations. In 2008-09, the Liberal Party accepted nearly $300,000 from big tobacco. That is over half a million pieces of silver from big tobacco swelling the coffers of the Liberal Party. Half a million dollars may be the price for this opposition for hire, but what is the price paid by the many thousands of Australians who have died as a result of smoking? Even their own side have been finding them embarrassing. The Premier of Western Australia supports the Labor position of not accepting donations from big tobacco. The position of the opposition on tobacco controls lacks legitimacy and I am afraid is an embarrassment.


Senator Fierravanti-Wells attempted to attack the former Minister for Health and Ageing, Ms Roxon, in her contribution. I thought her attack somewhat hollow. Let us recall the recognition that Minister Roxon has received from the Australian anti-smoking community and internationally as a result of her extraordinary leadership around the question of tobacco control. She received the Nigel Gray Medal, awarded every two years by the Australian tobacco control community to recognise an individual who has made an outstanding contribution to tobacco control. She also received the World Health Organisation Director-General's Special Recognition Certificate recognising Minister Roxon's unwavering leadership in the field of health which described the proposal to introduce plain packaging as a bold and breakthrough approach. They are not awards given lightly and they are awards given to a minister we have had in a government that is committed to preventative health in this nation and particularly through limiting the use of tobacco products.


Our government is committed to imple­menting comprehensive strategies to further reduce smoking rates in Australia. These reforms put Australia at the forefront of international action on tobacco control and build our commitment to world-first legislation to mandate plain packaging of tobacco products by July 2012; a 25 per cent increase in tobacco excise from 29 April 2010; a record $85 million investment in anti-tobacco social marketing, including a $61 million campaign launched on 30 January showing that every cigarette you smoke brings cancer closer; access to nicotine patches through the PBS; and a $5 million investment in Quitline services. I am afraid the choice could not be starker;  the choice could not be easier. I commend this bill to the Senate.

Other countries are not quite up to where Australia is, and that is why a number of countries look to Australia for guidance as to how we move forward when it comes to tobacco advertising. It is quite humorous, I suppose, but interesting and alarming in a sense that recently at a cricket match here in Australia, with India playing, there were some Indian spectators in the crowd holding up signs, some of which we probably thought were supporting their Indian team players, which I am sure they were there for. But actually they were holding up signs written in Hindi supporting tobacco companies and tobacco advertising so that those watching back in India could see certain tobacco products being supported and displayed through the broadcasting that was done here in Australia, which is an interesting take on advertising and an interesting way to advertise tobacco and tobacco products by our Indian friends. However, this is something that is not permitted in Australia, and I understand that as soon as the officials were made aware of this those placards and signs were taken down.


But what we are talking about today is not the advertising of tobacco at our sports fields. We have ended that some time ago, as I talked of earlier. Today is about prohibiting the advertising of tobacco on our other technological devices—our mobile phones, our iPads or tablets and any other kinds of technological devices that come into the market as we move into this technological age. As we find ourselves ever more relying on the world wide web for increasing amounts of information, we can clearly see the need for a review of rules and regulations pertaining to advertising in such mediums, such as those referred to in this amendment bill. 


This bill introduces some very important changes. They will put a stop to big tobacco promoting and advertising their products in our online environment. The President of the Australian Council on Smoking and Health and antitobacco advocate, Mike Daube said:


Cigarettes are now being heavily promoted on the Internet, and there are serious concerns that both online advertising and social networking sites are being used to promote tobacco to young people. 


We must head them off; beat them to the punch. We know that big tobacco are sneaky and we have to continue to play tough. And we have been doing that. We have been going there to win this fight to ensure that we reduce the amount of advertising out there when it comes to this deadly product of tobacco.


This bill will go some way in doing just that. It will take away yet another avenue for this deadly product to be promoted. Let us not forget that when this product is used as intended by its manufacturers it will kill. This is a product that is legal by default. Should a company try and introduce such a product in Australia today, it simply would not be considered, not even for a moment. I commend this bill to the Senate and encourage all my parliamentary colleagues to support it.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2012-02-08,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (11:31):  I strongly support the government's intentions in relation to the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amendment Bill 2010. The internet and electronic media are fast becoming the biggest loophole across many areas of government regulation. The internet has stretched to cover every facet of our lives. We email instead of talk. We can share photos and music and movies with the tap of a finger. And we even use the word 'google' as a verb. We can now carry the world in our pocket. But, like the real world, the virtual one has its dangers. 


Contrary to what some vested interests say, I am not in favour of a nanny state. I do not support excessive government regulation, and I think most people are able to make up their own minds. But I do not agree that dangerous products should be easily available or that they should be promoted as fun or fashionable. I think Senator Singh in her contribution and Senator Urquhart before her well outlined the health risks involved in smoking and the terrible human toll.


Everyone knows that tobacco is highly addictive. Everyone knows the chemicals in cigarette smoke slowly destroy you from the inside out. According to figures from the medical journal the Lancet, over five million people die from tobacco related illnesses each year. It is the world's leading cause of preventable death. I do not think anyone could argue that we should not discourage people from smoking and that we should not regulate the sale and advertising of what is a legal product. We already have measures in place to do this in the real world. It follows that in the virtual world, which is now so integrated with the real world, we should have the same measures in place.


According to the Interactive Advertising Bureau Australia, online advertising revenue in Australia reached $1.256 billion for the six months to 30 June 2011. That represents a growth of 19 per cent compared to the same period in 2010. By comparison, the broader Australian advertising industry grew just 1.1 per cent, using the same time periods. The IAB also predicted that the online industry would grow exponentially to over $3 billion this year. We should not discount the power of advertising in social networks where word of mouth can spread to literally thousands of people every time someone update their status. The dream endorsement for many companies is no longer a quote from a movie star or sports­man or woman, but from a blogger or even everyday citizens tweeting about how much they like their product. This kind of 'real' promotion is the new gold standard, because people are more likely to believe their friends than advertisers. Of course, some advertisers try to buy in to this promotion, paying well-known bloggers to promote products or by creating what seem to be 'spontaneous' campaigns. What people may not believe if it comes from advertisers, they may believe if it comes from their friends or someone they look up to.


I congratulate the government for recognising the need for reform in this area and for targeting this dangerous product. However, there are other equally important loopholes to close. Online sports betting is now pervading almost every aspect of sport, from advertising on the field and during breaks in the telecast to odds being quoted in the commentary. It is good to see that there is some movement in relation to dealing with that. Unscrupulous operators promoting their games through Facebook or other social networking sites encourage players to buy virtual objects with real money, including gambling chips that can never be cashed out. To paraphrase the Reverend Tim Costello, gamblers can now lose their homes without ever having to leave them.


This sector is urgently in need of greater regulation and protection for consumers. If the government acknowledge that there needs to be greater regulation in internet advertising as part of a comprehensive harm minimisation strategy, they also need to consider the effect of unregulated or poorly regulated gambling activities on the net. This bill constitutes an important reform. I congratulate the government, but I ask them to look further. I will be doing my bit to assist the government by introducing legislation to tighten up the regulations for online advertising for gambling products. That must be the next step. I also look forward to hearing from the government how they will be monitoring the success of these regulations by monitoring tobacco take-up rates, particularly amongst young people. Presumably that information will be available as part of ongoing health surveys. I think this is a good piece of legislation. I hope it is as successful as it is intended to be. I think it will be largely successful. The next step must be online gambling advertising promotion.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2012-02-08,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania) (11:35):  I rise in support of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amendment Bill 2010. The Gillard government is committed to the health of the Australian people. That is why we are investing money in improving health services and we place such a strong emphasis on preventative health. We want to prevent illness and disease because we know that it is cheaper than treating illness and will avoid unnecessary suffering by those with illnesses.


In 2009, the then Minister for Health And Ageing, the Hon. Nicola Roxon, MP launched the National Preventative Health Strategy. This strategy provides a plan for tackling the burden of chronic disease caused by obesity, tobacco and excessive consumpt­ion of alcohol. It focuses on primary prevention and uses all relevant arms of policy and points of leverage from both the health and the non-health sectors. The strategy comprises three parts: an overview, a roadmap for action and technical papers focused on the three key areas of obesity, tobacco and alcohol. The Council of Australian Governments has agreed to attempt to reduce the daily smoking rate among adults to 10 per cent by 2018 and to halve the daily smoking rate among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. In order to achieve this target, we still have some work to do, and that is why this bill is before the Senate. Approximately three million Australians smoke every day. We know that smoking is destructive. Cigarette smoking is the major cause of lung cancer. It is responsible for causing up to 90 per cent of lung cancer. Smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in Australia. Across the nation 15,000 people die each year as a result of smoking and it costs the Australian economy over $31 billion per annum. The burden of disease and illness resulting from smoking should be regarded as a national public health crisis. This bill is one of a raft of preventive health measures this govern­ment is using to tackle this crisis.


The bill will ensure consistency when it comes to tobacco advertising and will achieve a number of positive changes. It will amend the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992 to accommodate the changes in technology that have occurred since that legislation was passed. The bill will make it a specific offence to advertise or promote tobacco products on the internet and all other electronic media, including future technolo­gies. We all know how quickly the rate of technological change is occurring. Unless advertising complies with state and territory legislation or Commonwealth regulations, it will be an offence to advertise. It will also allow for regulations of internet tobacco advertising and online sales to be similar to those placed on over-the-counter sales. The legislation will also make changes to online tobacco sales so they are governed by the same rules as the sales made in shops. 


This bill will improve the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act 1992, the TAP Act, which was introduced by the Keating Labor government. The TAP Act was designed to comprehensively ban tobacco advertising in Australia. Now that we are in the 21st century we have new technology and the current legislation does not cover all advertising media. This is a key area we need to rectify. We know that young people love their technology and this, combined with the fact that modern methods are exempt from advertising prohibition, means that they are exposed to tobacco advertising. We need to have a consistent approach to the advertising prohibition on tobacco to protect people from the temptation advertising often presents. The bill will allow regulations to be made which could cover aspects such as size, content, format and location of internet tobacco advertisements. It will also be possible to regulate for the inclusion of health warnings, warnings about age restrictions on the sale of tobacco products as well as information about fees, taxes and other charges that may be incurred when purchasing the product. Age restricted access systems for allowing people to access tobacco advertising may also be regulated. After all, what parent with a young child wants them exposed to tobacco advertising online?


The bill will ensure that penalties for internet advertising will be consistent with those applied to other types of advertising. The penalties for failing to observe tobacco advertising regulations will be set at a maximum of 120 penalty units, and this is equivalent to $13,200 at present. This is a large amount of money to most people and, hopefully, the prospect of a fine will make most people think twice about disregarding the regulations. The bill will complement other measures the government has introduced and the ones we are still working to implement. 


The Gillard government values the health of all Australians and we want people to make informed decisions about their health and to do what they can to prevent illness. One thing people can do is choose not to take up smoking. Those people already smoking can choose to cut back or, better still, stop altogether. In 2010 this government increa­sed the excise on tobacco by 25 per cent. On its own, this measure is expected to cut the number of Australians smoking by around 87,000. Last year the government offered smokers support to quit by subsidising nicotine patches and the anti-smoking drug known as Champix through the Pharmaceut­ical Benefits Scheme for the first time. This was just another way to reduce the smoking rate in Australia. We have a history of coordinated plans at federal and state level to reduce smoking. Through historic bans on smoking in workplaces and public areas and through prohibiting advertising, we are making it less likely for people to take up smoking. As has been said, this is particularly important for our young people as we want them to not smoke to begin with. We all know it is better to not start smoking than to become addicted and then have to work hard to give it up. We are also making record investments in anti-smoking social marketing campaigns.


The government also implemented plain-packaging legislation to make tobacco products less attractive to consumers. On 31 May last year I joined the then Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon MP, and my colleague Senator Carol Brown, who is in the chamber at the moment, to sign the plain-packaging pledge in Canberra on World No Tobacco Day. On 21 April I joined with Minister Roxon and, once again, my federal parliamentary colleague Senator Carol Brown and the then Chief Executive of the Cancer Council Tasmania, Mr Darren Carr, at the Royal Hobart Hospital to promote plain packaging. The legislation passed through parliament on 10 November last year. The government's plain-packaging legislation means that from 1 December consumers will see cigarette packs with no colours or logos. Instead they will see more prominent health warnings and each time they see these warnings they will be forced to think about the damage that their smoking is doing to their health. They will know that each cigarette is doing damage and that, ultimately, their life will be shortened by smoking. It is estimated that the cost to Australia's economy from the impact of smoking is more than $31 billion per year. The savings we can make by reducing the number of smokers mean that there will be more money available to improve treatment of other illnesses. Our motivation for this legislation, as I said, is a healthier Australia and to avoid costs that a healthier nation will no longer have to meet or that can be redirected to other areas.


Let me recap exactly what this Labor government has done in preventative health since coming to office. We sought to establish a preventative health agency so that we had a national approach to health strategies and research. We have protected people, especially young people, from the dangers of binge drinking by introducing a tax on premixed drinks as well. In our first term in government we invested more money in preventative health than our predecessors, the Howard government, did in their almost 12 years in power. Interestingly enough, the Labor Party no longer accepts political donations from tobacco companies. We decided it was not ethical to accept money from these companies when their products cause such harm to consumers. Because of this, the tobacco companies know that they need to get the support of the opposition if they are to stop the government from passing our legislation. It seems that those opposite do not have the same problem accepting money from tobacco companies, which is a shame. In the last election campaign, $5 million was spent by the tobacco industry to target the Labor Party. There was one reason for this campaign and one reason only: the industry knew that their profits would be negatively impacted if the legislation was passed.


The coalition does not share the Gillard government's passion for preventative health. It has blocked many health reform bills put before the parliament, including the Australian National Preventative Health Agency Bill 2010. Only recently it tried to block the government's plain-packaging legislation. Fortunately, it did not succeed on this occasion. My colleague from the other place the Hon. Craig Emerson MP, Minister for Trade, recently said, 'The Liberal mantra is why put off to till tomorrow what can be put off forever,' and that does seem to be the approach that those opposite take on a lot of these tough decisions. If we all shared that sentiment, we would not achieve anything in this parliament.


Thankfully, on this side we believe in getting things done. We think this is very important to the future health of Australia, to the health of individuals within our great nation. We do not want to see people unnecessarily ill or, in a worst case scenario, dying. We think it is important that this legislation is passed by the Senate. I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers) (11:46):  I start by thanking senators for their contributions to the debate on this Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Amend­ment Bill 2010. The passage of this bill is another important step towards reducing the national smoking rate to 10 per cent of the population by 2018 and halving the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander smoking rate in that time—the goal of our government. Since the passage of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act in 1992, the use of the internet and other electronic means as advertising mediums has become increasingly widespread. Unregu­lated internet advertising undermines the effectiveness of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act. It can weaken tobacco controls by allowing sales to minors, promoting smoking and permitting the purchase of cigarettes without graphic health warnings.


The amendments we are dealing with today will make it a specific offence to advertise or promote tobacco products on the internet and all other electronic media and future technologies unless compliant with state and territory legislation or Common­wealth regulations. They will also enable the making of regulations in relation to internet tobacco advertising to be similar to those placed on over-the-counter sales and online sales will no longer be different.


I welcome the comment of the member for Boothby during the passage of the legislation through the other place when he said:


The coalition are supporting the passage of this legislation because we recognise there is more to be done in the area of preventative health and there is still more to be done in the area of tobacco control.


The member for Boothby is absolutely correct. There is still more to be done. I encourage him to start by looking in his own backyard. Let him start by getting the Liberal Party to break its own expensive habit with big tobacco. Let us recall that in 2009-10 the Liberal Party accepted over $292,000 from big tobacco in political donations. In 2008-09, the Liberal Party accepted nearly $300,000 from big tobacco. That is over half a million pieces of silver from big tobacco swelling the coffers of the Liberal Party. Half a million dollars may be the price for this opposition for hire, but what is the price paid by the many thousands of Australians who have died as a result of smoking? Even their own side have been finding them embarrassing. The Premier of Western Australia supports the Labor position of not accepting donations from big tobacco. The position of the opposition on tobacco controls lacks legitimacy and I am afraid is an embarrassment.


Senator Fierravanti-Wells attempted to attack the former Minister for Health and Ageing, Ms Roxon, in her contribution. I thought her attack somewhat hollow. Let us recall the recognition that Minister Roxon has received from the Australian anti-smoking community and internationally as a result of her extraordinary leadership around the question of tobacco control. She received the Nigel Gray Medal, awarded every two years by the Australian tobacco control community to recognise an individual who has made an outstanding contribution to tobacco control. She also received the World Health Organisation Director-General's Special Recognition Certificate recognising Minister Roxon's unwavering leadership in the field of health which described the proposal to introduce plain packaging as a bold and breakthrough approach. They are not awards given lightly and they are awards given to a minister we have had in a government that is committed to preventative health in this nation and particularly through limiting the use of tobacco products.


Our government is committed to imple­menting comprehensive strategies to further reduce smoking rates in Australia. These reforms put Australia at the forefront of international action on tobacco control and build our commitment to world-first legislation to mandate plain packaging of tobacco products by July 2012; a 25 per cent increase in tobacco excise from 29 April 2010; a record $85 million investment in anti-tobacco social marketing, including a $61 million campaign launched on 30 January showing that every cigarette you smoke brings cancer closer; access to nicotine patches through the PBS; and a $5 million investment in Quitline services. I am afraid the choice could not be starker;  the choice could not be easier. I commend this bill to the Senate.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2012-02-08,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (12:45):  I rise today to speak about a health issue that is of the utmost importance to each and every woman regardless of their age or their family history and that is ovarian cancer, a disease that affects far too many Australian women. I take this opportunity to speak briefly about the signs and symptoms of the disease so that we can all be more aware of it. I note that there is a motion on the red today relating to Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month. Most of us were in this place when the late Senator Jeannie Ferris succumbed to ovarian cancer. She was a great advocate for raising awareness. Others in this place are likely to have been touched by this, whether in their family or among their friends or within their community. I sincerely believe that we need to be better equipped, we need more knowledge of the warning signs and symptoms, and women should have these discussions with their friends and families, with their daughters, with their mothers and with their grandmothers.


Ovarian cancer is often a silent disease in its early stages, which means that many women have no symptoms at all or symptoms that are difficult to recognise. Some of the more common symptoms associated with ovarian cancer are unexplai­ned abdominal or pelvic pain, increased abdominal size or persistent abdominal bloating, difficulty eating or feeling full quickly, needing to urinate often or urgently and a change in bowel habit. As women in this chamber and those listening would know, many of those things are fairly common symptoms for many women, but the key point that I would make is that the symptoms that precede ovarian cancer are new to you and different for your body. I urge all women to be aware of the changes and to seek advice from their GP if they are concerned.


When it was brought to my attention I was pleased to learn that Ovarian Cancer Austra­lia provides a freely accessible symptoms diary. This is a document that women can use as a tool to follow any symptoms that they are concerned about and to keep track of how they are feeling daily over a four-week period. The diary gives them a documented history they can present to their GP. I have downloaded a copy of it, and it really is very useful. It is easy to use and I urge women in the community to check out the website. That simple document may well be the first step in saving your life.


Unlike many other forms of cancer, ovarian cancer has no population screening, so it is important that as women we take charge of our health, seek help and increase awareness about the symptoms, because we know that early detection and increased awareness is important in winning the fight against ovarian cancer. It is simply a fact of life that some women will have to fight a personal battle with this disease. 


What happens if you are diagnosed with ovarian cancer? From recent discussions, I have been assured that there are some fantastic counselling and support groups that have been specifically set up around the country to help those battling ovarian cancer. Last week I met Karen Campbell, a lady who is instrumental in Tasmania in supporting women undergoing this journey of recovery from ovarian cancer and many other forms of cancer. From the discussion, it was reassuring to learn that these support groups play an enormously important role not only during the treatment period but more importantly after the treatment has finished. Those of us who have had cancer in one form or another are constantly living with the knowledge that we have had cancer and there is always the threat that it will return. It is not because our loved ones do not understand, do not care or do not want to hear, but all too often it is only in a support group that we are able to open up and articulate how we are actually feeling without the feeling that we are going to burden our family and friends even further. In the lead-up to treatments and when you go back to your specialist to find out whether the treatment has been successful or whether the cancer has spread to other areas, anxiety can heighten. These support groups are so essential. I commend Karen Campbell and her organisation for the work that they are doing. 


In Launceston in northern Tasmania, a regular support group meets at Women's Health North, and in Hobart they meet monthly at the Cancer Council. These support groups provide a vital service for those who have been touched by cancer to meet and talk to others who share a similar experience. I think an experience shared and a burden shared are always lightened. I encourage everyone to visit the Cancer Council of Australia's website to find out where these groups are meeting in their local area. Another form of support for women who have been diagnosed with cancer that it has been so impressive for me to hear about is Look Good…Feel Better. This is an initiative that helps women to regain control of the way they look during their cancer treatment. The Look Good…Feel Better organisation characterises itself by saying:


Look Good…Feel Better is a free community service program dedicated to helping Australians cope with the appearance related side-effects of chemotherapy and radiotherapy such as hair loss and changes to the skin.


Cancer treatment, and the ensuing appearance changes, can be a very difficult period of time for many of the thousands diagnosed with cancer each year in Australia.


The aim of the Look Good…Feel Better program is to help cancer patients manage these side-effects and to help restore their appearance and self image.


Chemotherapy can affect the way we look in many different ways, from a change in skin tone or thinning eyelashes to perhaps the most extreme effect, total hair loss. The key message Look Good…Feel Better conveys to women is that these are temporary changes and there is so much that you can do to restore your appearance to something more familiar and similar to the way you normally feel and look. We all know about those days—and I have them—when you do not feel so great and when you look in that dreaded mirror and you think, 'Oh, I look as bad as I feel inside.' So I think anything we can do to help women in this case feel better about themselves and realise that what they are going through is a temporary process with their recovery is very important. That program has helped over 90,000 women already, so I encourage Australian women to keep up with these sorts of programs and be aware that that support is there in your community, because I think it is a great initiative. Its website is www.lgfb.org.au.


The strength of the women who have conquered ovarian cancer was evident to me when I read through their personal stories on the Ovarian Cancer Australia website. The stories are inspiring with their honesty and made me better appreciate the importance of getting the message of ovarian cancer awareness out there. One particular story that really hit home for me was of a women who was initially diagnosed with early menopause. She knew there was something more to it than that and insisted on having further tests. It was later discovered that she had a one-kilogram cyst on her ovary. The message there is: if you do not feel that your GP or your doctor is listening to you and you are not confident in their diagnosis then seek a second opinion. To me, this simply reaffirms the point that each and every one of us knows our body better than anyone else and that we have to be aware of those symptoms.


As I said, the symptoms diary is a great asset and tool for us to document so we can take it to our doctor. As I said earlier—I am repeating myself—it is so important to talk to your daughters, your mother, your nieces or your friends so that they are aware, because, as I said, these symptoms are so common for a lot of women who experience them during their lifetime that we cannot afford to overlook those symptoms. We need to continue to educate the community so that we can have very early intervention, because early intervention is so critical in reducing the number of women who die from this disease. Statistics demonstrate the import­ance of that, particularly now. For instance, there has been an increase from 833 Australians dying from this disease in 1982 to 1,266 in 2007.


It is often assumed that a family history of cancer will be the primary indicator of who will be affected. However, 90 to 95 per cent of ovarian cancer is diagnosed in women who have no family history. Ovarian cancer is considered to be in the early stages when it is still confined to one or both ovaries. As the cancer becomes more advanced it may be found in other pelvic organs, such as the uterus or the fallopian tubes. Advanced stage ovarian cancer occurs when the cancer has spread from the primary site—in this case the ovaries—to other distant sites; it can travel to the liver or the lungs. The prognosis for an individual diagnosed with ovarian cancer depends on what stage it has developed to. We know that the earlier we can intervene the better the outcome is going to be. For individuals who are diagnosed with ovarian cancer still in its early stages and confined to the ovaries, the prognosis is good and suggests that 93 per cent of these patients will still be alive in five years.


The greatest risk factor connected to ovarian cancer is considered to be age. Unfortunately there is nothing we can do about getting older; however, there are a number of other risk factors that are thought to influence an individual's chance of being affected by ovarian cancer. It is important to be aware of these risk factors, which include family history and genetics—this accounts for only around 10 per cent of ovarian cancers, but it is something we should be mindful of—having no or few full-term pregnancies, smoking cigarettes, eating a high-fat diet, and being overweight or obese.


I am very pleased to have been able to speak on this issue here today, because I think it is important to raise the profile of ovarian cancer. We know that breast cancer has had very high public awareness, and I pay full credit to the organisations and public figures that promote that very important battle that we have. Therefore, speaking today about Ovarian Cancer Awareness Month, I would encourage those in the chamber and in our communities to visit the Ovarian Cancer Australia website and to get involved in the events this month. We know that 29 February is Teal Ribbon Day for ovarian cancer. We are holding a morning tea here in Parliament House, and there are other functions around the country that are going to be organised. I would encourage people to get involved. Get a few girlfriends together or get your family members together so you can have a discussion and raise awareness and, at the same time, raise some badly needed funds for this important battle. In Tasmania we already have registered four or so events where they are expecting to raise $2,000. Every dollar is so valuable in terms of making people more aware and bringing it to the forefront. So together we can raise the profile of ovarian cancer, we can raise awareness and in turn we can help to decrease the devastating effect that this cancer has on Australian women. I was not involved in the notice of motion, but I would like to put on the record once again that we in this chamber have been personally affected, both indirectly and directly, by people with ovarian cancer. I want to pay credit to Senator Ferris for the work she did. It is nice to know that the hard work she put in has not been forgotten. It is back on the Notice Paper, and I am sure there will be other contributions on this important issue during this month. But it is not just about being aware in February. Ovarian cancer, like all cancers, affects Australians every day of every month. Personally, having the experience of family members with cancer, whether they have good news or bad news, I know it is something they live with every day, so we need to support these networks.

I refer the minister to the fact that, under the Rudd-Gillard Labor govern­ment, productivity has stagnated so that, last year, for the first time in 20 years, there was no net increase in jobs; $70 billion in net Commonwealth assets has been turned into $133 billion of net Commonwealth debt; and a $20 billion budget surplus has turned into four consecutive budget deficits, the four largest in Australia's history, to a cumulative total of $167 billion worth of deficits. Given Labor's run of budget deficits and economic failure, and the fact that it cannot make a promise without breaking it, why should the Australian people have any confidence that the government's latest promise, to deliver its first ever budget surplus, will not be yet another broken promise?

I want to remind those opposite of something they really do not like to hear, and it is this: under this government, we have created over 700,000 jobs since we came to government. Under this government, we have come through the global financial crisis with one of the strongest economies of any of the advanced economies anywhere in the world and one of the strongest fiscal positions anywhere in the world. We have an unemployment rate of 5.2 per cent. In the eurozone it is 10.4 per cent. These are the facts that those opposite do not want to hear.



Honourable senators interjecting—




The PRESIDENT:
  Senator Wong, please resume your seat. I need to hear the answer. When you are ready, we will proceed.




Senator WONG:
  These are the facts that those opposite do not want to hear. All they want to do is talk down the Australian economy—how irresponsible of you.


I was also asked by Senator Brandis about surpluses. I am very happy to have a discussion about surpluses, but I am very surprised that this got through the tactics committee, because what we have seen in these last days from the opposition's economic team is completely embarrassing. They are a circus over there. One wonders what Senator Sinodinos must be thinking as he watches my counterpart, Mr Robb, say, 'We can't even say we'll come back to surplus, were we elected, in our first term.' He could not even indicate they would come back to surplus by 2017. Mr Hockey today was again all over the place. Remember, Mr Hockey used to say you would come back to surplus earlier. Now you do not even know when you would. (Time expired)

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (14:04):  Senator Brandis asked me about the mid-year review, and he might recall, if he actually read it, that what that showed was $5 billion less in tax receipts than we anticipated because of what was occurring in the global economy. It also showed that we had to pay $2.3 billion more for natural disasters, and I would have thought that would not have been an expenditure that would be controversial in any debate in this parliament.


But, if those opposite want to talk about numbers, I suggest they have a look at the $70 billion that they have to find in the budget just to get to the starting line. Their backbench may not know this, but $70 billion is the equivalent of Medicare payments for four years. They are the sorts of cuts you have to find because of your lack of discipline. It is equivalent to two years of the age pension. That is the sort of cut you would have to find because of your lack of discipline. (Time expired)

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Minister for Finance and Deregulation) (14:06):  When it comes to the economy, we know the opposition only have two things that they can talk about: one is the $70 billion of cuts that they do not want to talk about and, of course, the other is the carbon price. When you manage the economy you do have to make choices. You have to make decisions about what is in the best interests of the nation. We have made our decisions very clear. We do believe in spreading the benefits of the boom to all Australians. We do believe in supporting jobs. We do believe in moving to a clean energy future because we know a first-rate economy has to deal with the issue of climate change and reduce our pollution. The priorities of those opposite are demonstrated by the fact that they put the profits of wealthy miners above the interests of working families and small business. Remember, it is this side of the parliament that wants to give small business a tax cut. The only tax cuts those opposite want to give are for the wealthy mining companies.

They have the support of 79 per cent of Australians—that is according to the latest Nielsen poll—and fewer than one in five people actually support the position that the Liberal Party is pursuing on this issue.

But there are also 117 component manufacturers in Victoria who will enjoy the support of that plan. There are of course families who depend upon the success of these policies. These families will be the first to suffer under Mr Abbott's approach.

They have heard what Mr Abbott has said. They have seen Mr Abbott front up to factories across this land and appeal to them for support for his campaign. The workers are saying to him, 'Did you mean that, or was that yet another fraud?' It is another fraud, because the policy the Liberal Party is pursuing would see the destruction of the automotive industry in this country. Not only would we see $500 million taken out of the industry but we would also see a further $1 billion go as a result of the policies of the Liberal Party.

Australia will host the next full TPP negotiating round from 1-9 March 2012 in Melbourne.


The TPP negotiations aim to establish a comprehensive, ambitious FTA that eliminates tariffs and other barriers to trade and investment.


In the Trade Policy Statement the Gillard Government made clear that Australia will no longer seek investor-state dispute settlement in trade agreements—including the TPP.


Nor will Australia support provisions in the TPP that would constrain our ability to regulate legitimately on important public policy matters, including in relation to the pharmaceutical benefits scheme or to our health system more generally.

Senator LUDWIG
 (Queensland—Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister Assisting on Queensland Floods Recovery) (15:05):  I thank Senator Abetz for the question. Question No. 673, asked on 30 May, related to contraband and weapons in immigration detention centres since 1 January 2008. The answer to this question was due to be tabled on 30 June 2011. The question seeks detailed information on a number of complex and sensitive issues; the details are contained within narrative reporting prepared by officers of the Department of Immigration and Citizenship's detention service provider.


It has been necessary for departmental officials to go through and closely examine all situation reports dating back to 1 January 2008. As a consequence, these situation reports are produced after each relevant incident and cover details of major, minor and critical incidents. Every single one of these reports is examined fully and with appropriate care to ensure that the Senate receives an accurate and full answer. At this juncture the response is being carefully checked to ensure that all information provided is current and addresses the matters raised by Senator Abetz in his question.


Even though the department has not yet provided the answer to Senator Abetz, it remains fully committed to providing an answer to the question as soon as possible. As a consequence of Senator Abetz raising it today, I will again let Minister Bowen know that this issue has been raised, that Senator Abetz is seeking a response to the question and that we should encourage the department to provide the answer as early as possible.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2012-02-08,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:07):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the explanation.


The question that I asked was as follows: 


What measures and/or procedures are in place to prevent contraband or weapons being brought into detention centres.


This is pretty straightforward, I would have thought. The second question is:


Since 1 January 2008, have any contraband or weapons been detected in detention centres …


I would have thought this would be another pretty simple question. It continues:


… if so, can the following in relation to each detention centre be provided: (a) what items were found; (b) where those items were found; (c) on what date they were found; and (d) what action was taken against the person or persons identified as being involved.


That was asked on 30 May 2011. Patient fellow that I am, I waited until 19 July to write to the minister, Mr Bowen, indicating that the answer was now 50 days outstanding, almost twice the Senate's 30-day rule. There was no answer to that letter. So I wrote again on 1 September 2011 advising the minister that these questions had now been outstanding for 90 days, three times the Senate's 30-day rule. I therefore advised the minister's office that I would be raising this in the Senate, and I did so on 19 September 2011 using the mechanism that I am using today. The then Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Carr, told us on 19 September, virtually word perfect, that which Senator Ludwig has just read out to the Senate all these months later.


In my response at that time, I indicated that the questions, with respect, are not that complex. If there are aspects of questions that are complex then by all means tell us which parts are complex and which parts might take longer to answer than others. But I would have thought that by now the Department of Immigration and Citizenship under this incompetent government would have had measures and/or procedures in place to prevent contraband or weapons being brought into detention centres. That is a complex question for this government. This is a question that the government now needs some nine months to come to grips with. Are we to believe that there are no protocols, measures or procedures in place to prevent contraband or weapons being brought into detention centres? But that was the issue I raised in my speech on 19 September last year.


Finally, 105 days after I first wrote to Mr Bowen, Mr Bowen finally responded, apologising for the delay but saying that these were complex issues. We received that letter on 2 November, and it would appear that our letters crossed, because I wrote to Mr Bowen again on 2 November asking him to respond and noting that these questions had been on the Senate Notice Paper for 156 days. Today they have been on the Senate Notice Paper for 204 days.


So what we have, on top of the government's failed border protection policies, is failed administration by the minister. That is why this government is in the hopeless position it is in. It has hopeless policies combined with hopeless administr­ation. What is the excuse that it takes a minister 105 days to respond to a letter and say, 'We are not going to answer your question'? Here we are now, 204 days later, on an issue that is clearly of national significance. The border protection policy of this country is clearly a national interest policy. It is a policy that most people who are serious about national politics have a view on. As a result of the government's failed border protection policy, we now have all these detention centres scattered from Christmas Island, in the most north-westerly corner of Australia, right through to my home state of Tasmania, in the most south-easterly corner of Australia. They are scattered all around the countryside, bursting at the seams with excessive numbers of detainees. So, if ever you wanted a proof of the failed border protection policies of this government, just look at the numbers in the detention centres.


Given that we have had riots, given that we have had assaults such as Senator Cash was referring to and given that we have had detention centres burning down, it does make good sense to ask what measures are there to stop contraband and weapons being brought into detention centres, and we cannot be told. It is too complex a problem for Mr Bowen. Well, if that is too complex a problem for Minister Bowen, he should not be a minister and, quite frankly, he should not even be in the parliament if it is such a complex issue for him. Indeed, one would wonder how he could hold down a job. Surely there are protocols and measures in place to try to at least limit contraband and weapons coming into our detention centres. But what the Australian people have been told by this non-answer—now for 204 days—is that the government not only has no idea on border protection but has no idea on the significant issue of how to deal with detainees in the detention centre. Given the sort of environment in which the detention centres operate, I would have thought the No. 1 priority would be ensuring that weapons and contraband do not get into those detention centres. But it would seem they have no policy. They have no guidelines, they have no protocols on how to deal with it. Why is that and why is it that the government is so anxious to ensure that we are not told about the assaults, about the injuries? Because it will embarrass the government even further; that is the reason. We would see failed border protection policy, failed detention centre policy combined with maladministra­tion by this minister and by this government.


I would have thought that a genuine response, rather than the arrogant treatment that the Senate is being subjected to, would have been to say: 'There are a number of issues:'—if we are to believe what the minister tells us at face value—'these are the aspects that are complex, these are the aspects that are not and here is a preliminary answer to those matters that we can provide an answer to.' But to deliberately obfuscate and deny for 204 days shows the arrogance and the contempt with which this government treats the opposition.


It is noteworthy there is not a single Australian Green in the Senate. It is noteworthy that for the Australian Greens this sort of contempt for the parliament—and, might I say, for the Independents in the other place—does not make them concerned, albeit they signed up with Ms Gillard to a policy of transparency, accountability and we were told sunlight was good, if you remember that wonderful line. 'Sunlight is a good disinfectant; we should open everything up and allow the people to see.' Two hundred and four days of nonresponse is keeping the drapes closed; it is not allowing the sun to shine in in any way, shape or form.


Sure, the government is embarrassed by its border protection policies, as it ought to be. Sure, the government is embarrassed by its detention centre failures, as it ought to be. It now seems that the government is also embarrassed by its administrative failures through its minister, Minister Bowen, as it ought to be as well. But you do not overcome that embarrassment, you do not overcome those failures by simply stonewalling. You do not overcome these problems by simply not providing an answer. You actually have to man-up and provide an answer and treat the parliament with the courtesy it deserves; 204 days for outstanding answers is completely and utterly unacceptable. We look forward, as a matter of urgency, to getting the answers, I say to Minister Ludwig. I know he is not personally responsible, but when you have made contact with the minister's office courteously, not once or twice but now five times over a period of nine months, that is administrative failure writ large.


The sad thing is, Minister Bowen is now being talked about as a potential running mate to become the Deputy Prime Minister of Mr Rudd.




Senator Cormann:
  And Treasurer!




Senator ABETZ:
  And the federal Treasurer of this country. He cannot run border protection. He cannot run detention centres. He cannot sign letters. He cannot answer questions. And here we have Mr Bowen potentially becoming the Deputy Prime Minister, albeit he will be hip-and-shouldered out of that by Senator Bob Brown, because we know Senator Bob Brown is well ensconced in that role. Really Mr Bowen's failure in policy and administra­tion is unacceptable. I indicate to the government I will be pursuing this, not every two months but now on a weekly basis.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (15:19):  Clearly the government is embarrassed by its whole border protection regime and the fiascos we have seen under the Rudd government and the Gillard government. But that is no reason for this government deliberately withholding from this chamber answers to questions that have been properly asked. This chamber, as a representative of the Australian people, has the right to ask questions and to have those questions answered in a timely fashion. This government is so embarrassed by its border protection policy that it refuses to give any information which will make it even more embarrassed and which will cause the Australian people to be even more concerned about the fiasco that is border protection. I think all of that is fact. As Senator Abetz has very clearly and concisely pointed out, the questions are not all that difficult to answer. They concern information which any depart­ment of state would have practically at their fingertips. It is an abuse of the parliamentary process that this government deliberately withholds from the chamber information to which the Australian public is entitled.


I finish by referring to the Greens. You notice they scamper out of here every time they are called upon to keep the Labor Party honest, to keep—as their predecessor party, the Australian Democrats, once famously said—the bastards honest. We would expect the Greens, in keeping with the persona they put around to the Australian public as the upholders of everything that is good and moral about the parliamentary system, to do so. If you look back through their speeches in the times when the Liberal Party was in government, you would see how speeches that the parliament was entitled to information flowed off their tongues day after day. Yet here we have a process where, since 30 May last year, we have been attempting to get quite reasonable and easily obtained answers, and the Greens simply will not join with us in forcing their running mates in the Labor Party to provide the sort of information to which the Australian public is entitled. I say to those who might be listening that this again demonstrates the absolute hypocrisy of the Greens political party. They are not an independent political party; they are simply the ultra left wing of the Australian Labor Party. They always have been and those of us in this chamber know that. But I think the general public, who do not follow politics perhaps as closely as those of us in this chamber do, are now beginning to understand that in the Labor Party you have a right wing, you have a decreasing number of moderates and you have a left wing. You have people like Senator Sherry. Clearly he is the best minister that has been in this chamber from the Labor Party for many years, but he is a man who swung in the breeze by himself. He did not have a real faction to support him.




Senator Cormann:
  That sounds like Senator Feeney.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  He did not have Senator Feeney to support him on that side. He did not have Senator Arbib to support him. He did not have Senator Carr to support him—not that Senator Carr's support would be worth much; he could not even look after himself. You do see how the Labor Party is so factionalised. But there is this other faction, this quite shadowy faction, that Senator Sinodinos mentioned today and I draw senators' attention to that very good speech in case they missed it. You almost have that ultra left wing of the Labor Party masquerading as the Greens, which is in effect a de facto communist party in Australia. The Greens are not here to keep Senator Feeney on track and are not here to keep Senator Arbib up to the mark because they are part of that same left-wing, ultimately socialist government—a government that believes Big Brother is better able to direct me on how I should conduct my life than I am, that believes Big Brother is better able to spend my money than I am and that believes Big Brother should take my money and help the disadvantaged rather than allow me to help the disadvantaged as I and most Australians do with our own money. That is the shame of this. The Greens, who should be in here demanding that the parliament have supremacy over the executive government, disappear. I think, I hope and I trust that the Australian public are rapidly understanding that the Greens are no more than a hypocritical wing of the Labor Party and therefore part of the current government.

Senator HUMPHRIES
 (Australian Capital Territory) (15:42):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation (Senator Wong) to a question without notice asked by Senator Brandis today relating to the economy.


In case senators have forgotten what this is about, Senator Brandis asked about delivery of a budget surplus, the carbon tax and the accuracy of budget forecasts. In answer to the question, Senator Wong was happy to reaffirm that the Gillard government intended to deliver a budget surplus in 2012-13. It is good that they are determined to deliver this budget surplus. They have wavered a bit in the last few months. It was an aspiration at various stages, but they seem to be back on track now. 'We're going to deliver a budget surplus,' they tell us.


I think we are justified in asking the question: why the big deal about this? The Howard government delivered 12 budgets, and almost all of them were budget surpluses. It did not seem to have so much trouble doing it. The reason delivering a budget surplus under this government is such a big deal is that, in trying to deliver a surplus, the ALP is fighting its nature. It is fighting its history and it is fighting its very DNA as a political party, because Labor governments do not like to deliver surpluses. It is not what they do. It is not their modus operandi. I know that because I look back over 20 years of political history, and at the federal level I do not see a single Labor budget surplus—not one. I look back over 20 years, even at state and territory Labor government level, and I see very few budget surpluses, because it is not what the ALP does. The ALP does certain things very predictably in office. It offers support for trade unions, it increases government spending, it increases taxation levels—preferably through introducing new taxes—it runs up deficits and it runs a debt. That is what Labor governments do. But right at the moment the ALP has a particular problem, particularly at the federal level, because the electorate is now much more sensitised to the question of budget surpluses. They want to see governments running balanced budgets. They want to see budget surpluses, probably because under the Howard government they saw how effective those surpluses were in delivering important social and economic outcomes—tax cuts, more spending on health and education, a stronger defence force, and so on. They want to see governments which can sustainably offer support for important social and economic goals in this country, and they are judging governments by their ability to offer surpluses. This government are huffing and puffing over delivering a $1.5 billion surplus next financial year. That is less than half of one per cent of total Commonwealth outlays projected for 2012-13. A budget surplus half of one per cent is miniscule and wafer thin. It is because it is so thin that the government are in all sorts of trouble right now, when basic economic conditions and assumptions are not working out for them. They planned a deficit for the present financial year of $22 billion but, unfortunately, it has blown out to a $37 billion deficit—a 68 per cent variation in just six months. That is pretty much the case for all the deficits they have brought down in the last four years. They do not work out as the government plan them to. Perhaps they are hoping that, if their deficits are inflating each year beyond expectations, maybe the surpluses will as well after 2012-13. Unfortunately, the more your deficits inflate, the less large your surpluses are likely to be. At $1.5 billion you do not have much of a margin for error.


This government are desperately trying to defeat their own history—their own legacy—of mistakes and extravagant spending. We know that they took a $70 billion net positive position in the Commonwealth in terms of assets and money in the bank and turned it into $133 billion of net debt in just the last four years. That is what the Labor government are fighting, not the global financial crisis as Minister Arbib just said and not other extraneous things. They are fighting their own history of being unable to contain spending, reduce taxes and return budgets to surplus. That is why we are entitled to say that we are sceptical about this government's capacity to deliver a surplus. People do not need to be sceptical about the coalition's ability. We showed it in almost every budget we brought down. We delivered surpluses, we delivered them strongly and they grew and grew. Under this government you simply cannot make the assumption that the same thing will happen.

Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (15:47):  I rise to take note of answers given by Minister Wong. It is noted from time to time that, unfortunately, the Senate and senators are not adequately consulted by our brothers and sisters in the House of Representatives, and it does seem that this is one of those occasions when the opposition Senate team did not get the memo from their team in the House of Representatives. You may not be aware of this, Senator Humphries, but your party, the coalition, is presently embarked on a process of crab-walking away from its own commitment to a surplus. You say that we are fighting our past; I say that you are fighting your present. But, from the Labor Party's point of view, no matter how hard any day gets we know we always have Joe Hockey working hard for us. As you would be well aware—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Feeney, before we go any further there are two matters. Please direct your remarks to the chair and refer to people in the other place by their correct name, title or by the salutation of mister.




Senator FEENEY:
  As this parliament is well aware and as has been discussed extensively in the public debate, the opposition's policy proposition is teetering on the brink of ridicule and destruction. I admire the courage of the opposition for dragging it in here for us to survey today. The opposition's very own documentation was leaked to the press and revealed the frenzied mutterings of its razor gang as they sought to come to terms with the fact that their very own future prescription for this country was $70 billion short.


Here we have the spectacle of Senator Humphries condemning us for a real surplus that is not large enough when the coalition's imaginary surplus is going to be $70 billion in the red. How is it that it is $70 billion in the red? That number deserves some study. It will cost the opposition $27 billion to axe the carbon tax. As part of that $27 billion expenditure we find the economic vandalism of those opposite exemplified by Tony Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, recommending that Australian business neither purchase carbon permits nor participate in the scheme. Of course, $3.2 billion of that $27 billion will fund the opposition's direct action plan. It is a direct action plan which, as you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, was inspired by the public policy offerings of 1980s East Germany and 1970s Romania—a command economy model whereby Labor's market is swept aside so that the tsars of the coalition can sit in council and decide which of their friends around Australia receive plans and moneys to abate carbon.


But wait; that's not all! We find that there is $24 billion in the coalition's imaginary budget which is required to refund big polluters for carbon permits. It will be an extraordinary spectacle to see a future coalition government handing $24 billion back to the companies whose carbon emissions, the coalition tells us, its own policy is trying to abate. But we should not be too shocked at the spectacle of the coalition handing back government revenues to big polluters. In fact, $11.1 billion of a future coalition budget would be lost revenue because of the coalition's resolve to hand back moneys raised through the minerals resource rent tax. We will see the extraordinary spectacle of would-be Prime Minister Abbott handing a cheque for billions of dollars to some of the wealthiest people in Australia—in fact, as has been revealed recently, perhaps the wealthiest person on the planet. The Liberal Party insist that their resolve to hand back these moneys is a matter of virtue when every Australian can see that pulling $11 billion out of the federal budget to reward those who are already billionaires serves no public policy process and amounts to no public virtue. It is simply a dogmatic resolve by those opposite not to accept the moneys raised by the minerals resource rent tax and to zealously protect and preserve their friends. In addition to all of this, the coalition is maintaining its commitment to $8 billion in pledged tax cuts. How is it that those opposite have the gumption to come in here and dare cast aspersions on our real surplus when their own imaginary and shadow budget is $70 billion in the red? Of course the answer is: they dare not have their own numbers studied. 


If they were to have their own numbers studied, then two possibilities reveal themselves. The first possibility is that these nonsensical utterances in opposition will not be honoured, that the $11 billion will not be handed back. That is, perhaps, what I hope for, but I cannot underestimate— (Time expired)

"Edwards, Sen Sean",LP,2012-02-08,"



Senator EDWARDS
 (South Australia) (15:52):  I rise to take note of answers given by Senator Wong and I cannot avoid addressing some of the issues that Senator Feeney has just raised. The budget surplus is maths; it is not science. You have manipulated science to create a revenue with your carbon tax. We know how you can manipulate things.


The finance minister has only one response when she is questioned on anything in relation to this—just slag the opposition. Senator Feeney has just made an art form of addressing my colleague in the lower House, the shadow Treasurer, Joe Hockey—blame the opposition for everything. It is as if Senator Feeney and Senator Wong think that we actually are the government. I remind the minister that the coalition has been out of office since November 2007—4.25 years ago—and they are still referring to it. 


Minister, take responsibility for your own actions and the actions of the Labor-Greens government you represent. Stop bagging all those on this side of the chamber for your mismanagement of the economy. We have not had the treasury bench for 4.25 years! As a finance minister, you have direct responsibility for the spending in other portfolios of the Gillard-Brown administra­tion. How about directing your attention to curbing the spendthrift impulses of your ministerial colleagues? The problem is that Labor and the Greens believe the only way to govern is by spending the money of taxpayers. It is not your money. It is raised from every Australian that pays taxes. You would not run your own bank account by spending more than you earn, so adopt the same approach to the finances of govern­ment. It is very simple.


I know that a surplus in the budget is not a concept that the Rudd-Gillard governments are familiar with. My colleague, the member for Longman, Wyatt Roy, reminded me only last night that he was not even alive when the Labor Party delivered its last surplus, and he is in his 22nd year. It is called a balance—you have got to find a balance—and for the sake of all Australians you have got to get back to it.


Senator Feeney talked about 'crab-walking'. It is economics 101. Hands up on the other side those who have ever run a private company that has done a capital raising. Let the record show that no hands go up! Hands up on the other side those who have ever had to have a repayment—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order, Senator Edwards! Again I have to remind you, as I did Senator Feeney, to direct your remarks to the chair. You cannot ask questions of the government across the chamber. Please continue, Senator Edwards.




Senator EDWARDS:
  It would be interesting to know how many hands would go up if I was able to ask any on the other side if they had ever gone back to a banking institution with a capital repayment program. I notice no hands go up, Mr Deputy President.


We are a party that understands business on this side. As my good colleague, Senator Humphries, referred to, it is endemic and enduring in the Labor Party that they cannot understand, and do not understand, what surpluses are. A surplus, for the edification of those opposite, is where you have an operating profit. That is what it is termed in private practice, an operating profit which you can then return to your shareholders, in this case, the people of Australia, in the way of more services. However if you deliver a deficit, that means you have to borrow more. In the case of Australia, that means that you have to compete with Australians for borrowings from offshore, putting the price of money and capital for the small businesses that you protest you are looking to protect, beyond reach, doing them great harm with these deficits. The capital raising that you are doing out there to fund this project, the $37 billion debt that you talk about, will come at a great cost to all Australians.

"Marshall, Sen Gavin",ALP,2012-02-08,"



Senator MARSHALL
 (Victoria) (15:57):  I assure Senator Edwards that no-one on the side of the chamber thinks that the opposition is the government and he would be well served not to believe their rhetoric. This government does not believe that the economy is a shambles. This is a myth that you are trying to promote.


Australia's economy is the envy of the developed world. It is now in its 20th consecutive year of economic growth, a record unmatched by any other advanced economy. Senator Edwards, do not go—you should stay and you should listen to this. Australia's GDP is significantly higher than its pre-GFC level, while many advanced economies are still struggling to make up lost ground. The unemployment rate has fallen to around five per cent and is now lower than all but one major advanced economy, and Australia has lower government debt and lower budget deficits than any of the other major advanced economies and will return to a budget surplus sooner than any other advanced economy. So I really find it quite puzzling that the opposition would come in here and take note of this particular question. 


I suppose that it is a symptom of predetermining before question time which question you will take note on, because Senator Wong simply wiped the floor with the opposition in respect of the economy. And she said, behind every falsehood and every wrong assertion lies a $70 billion black hole of the opposition. I understand why Senator Edwards struggled so much in any defence of the position put because he must have been well and truly embarrassed by his side in their feeble attempts to actually score any points on economic grounds against this government—this government, that has done more to defend this economy than any other. If we had done what the opposition wanted to do at the beginning of the global financial crisis this country would still be deep in recession. We would have hundreds and hundreds of thousands more people unemployed. They would not care about that; they would rip the guts out of this economy. That was their plan: to let the market rip, and no Australian should ever forget that.


This was the government, this was the Treasurer and this was the team that actually defended this country from economic ruin—something that you opposed, and that the Australian people will remember. As I said earlier, we enjoy and are the economic envy of the rest of the developed world, and we will continue to maintain that position. We will bring this budget back to surplus—something that Senator Humphries finally got around to agreeing with, even though he started by saying that we would not bring it back to surplus, but that when we did, it would only be wafer thin because it would only be $1½ billion. By the time he ended his contribution he had actually talked himself into the position of accepting that we would in fact be in surplus.


But here we are, this is the Liberals; they want to pretend that there was no global financial crisis, no turmoil in Europe, no natural disasters last year and no high dollar. It is the same economic team whose advice would have sent Australia into recession and would have sent unemployment skyrocketing. The Liberal Party has failed the budget test countless times, and their credibility is in absolute tatters.


Only recently we saw the Leader of the Opposition saying that they may not get a budget surplus in the first year or anywhere after that if they are elected. After giving previous commitments that they would move into a budget surplus quicker than the Labor government, they are now walking away from that promise. In fact, it is an aspiration. A budget surplus for the Liberal Party has become an aspiration. Why is it an aspiration? Because they know they can never get there. They can never get anywhere near there because behind all their rhetoric and behind all their promises is a $70 billion black hole of commitments and promises they have made which they know they cannot fund. They know they cannot fund them. But in order to try and buy their way into an election victory they will promise everything. They will promise a spend of $70 billion at the moment, and the election campaign has not even started for them. We know that that $70 billion will continue to grow. They are economically irresponsible. (Time expired)

"Kroger, Sen Helen",LP,2012-02-08,"



Senator KROGER
 (Victoria—Chief Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:02):  I have to say that Senator Marshall really lives in his own little world over there. To suggest that Senator Wong wiped the floor with her responses to questions on the economy just defies belief. I do not know where he was during question time, but he clearly was not listening to Senator Wong's responses.


To the suggestion that this government has saved the country from economic ruin, all I can say to Senator Marshall is, 'Thank goodness you had a coalition government that handed you a large surplus so that it bankrolled the government spending for its first few years in office'. Not all governments are so fortunate.


I also just have to pick up for a moment on a couple of comments and observations that Senator Feeney made earlier on. He seemed to talk about the opposition only. He was given an opportunity to talk about the government's response—Senator Wong's response—to questions and all he could talk about was the opposition; what our vision was for the country and what we would do if we were in office. I was sitting back thinking that it really was not surprising that he did not want to talk about what the government had achieved because what they have done is indefensible.


Since the election in November 2007 they only have a record of incompetence, spending and increasing debt. So what could he talk about? Why would he not want to deflect attention away from the government's track record and focus on the opposition's? So I am not surprised that he talked about the coalition's vision and plans, which he did, because to talk about the government's achievements would be incredibly embarrassing for him.


We do live in a great nation, but it could be so much better. We could be world leaders in industry and innovation, but what is holding this country back is the incompetence and the ineptness of this Gillard government. We have raised before and during questions—and Senator Wong would not address the fact—that the Treasurer, Mr Swan, said last year that this year, the year ahead, would be all about jobs, jobs and more jobs. But only last week we heard that another Australian bank has reported 1,000 jobs being lost over the last few months. This is on top of the reports from Westpac and the ANZ in relation to other job losses in January.


Only today, at an aluminium smelter near Geelong—the Port Henry aluminium smelter—the operators have announced that they are conducting a review of that smelter that is essentially putting the jobs of 600 people there in limbo. They will be very, very concerned as we speak now about what their job security is and what this next 12 months holds for them. And for good reason: the Prime Minister and those on the other side continue to ignore the fact that the carbon tax is going to cost more jobs. She continues to ignore the fact that it will reduce economic growth in Australia and is just going to hurt us more and, in particular, hurt real wages.


In the 2010-2011 financial year the Gillard government said that their budget deficit would be $12 billion, and yet we saw MYEFO estimate that the budget deficit would be $25 billion. And what do we see? The actual deficit was $37 billion. They are not particularly good at managing. The last few years have been another demonstration of what an ALP government actually delivers when in office, and economic strength and viability of the country is not one of them.


This government has turned $70 billion in net Commonwealth assets into $133 billion of net Commonwealth debt. To the people of Australia I say: bring on an election; get rid of the Prime Minister you have because this country will be in a crisis if you keep with it.

Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



This Bill will remove the mandatory minimum sentencing provisions which currently operate over certain Commonwealth people smuggling offences under the Migration Act 1958.  Under the current mandatory sentencing regime, a person who is convicted of one of these four offences must be sentenced to imprisonment for a minimum five years with a non-parole period of three years. There is no scope for the presiding Magistrate or Judge to take into account the circumstances of the offence and sentence the accused accordingly.


There are very few instances of mandatory minimum sentencing for Commonwealth offences because it is – correctly – widely accepted to be an infringement of judicial independence and separation of powers. Mandatory sentencing is regarded globally to be a breach of civil and political rights, and for that reason is subject to various international covenants which seek to discourage it in the criminal laws of signatory nations.




Background



The arguments against mandatory minimum sentences were clearly raised when Federal Parliament toughened Commonwealth regulation of people smuggling sentencing in 2010. At that time, the Australian Greens opposed the enactment of the mandatory minimum sentencing regime.  Contrary to the rhetoric of the current and previous governments, there is no justification for the legislature enforcing minimum jail sentences for people smuggling offences. There is nothing exceptional about these offences that make it worth going against our commitment to fair legal process because, as the past two years of Commonwealth prosecutions have demonstrated, the imposition of minimum five year sentences has had little or no impact on deterring people smuggling. The five year sentences have been principally borne by impoverished boat crew who are the least culpable link within people smuggling operations.


This Bill affects the mandatory minimum sentences that apply to the offences of: aggravated people smuggling, that is, the bringing to Australian of at least five non-citizens who have 'no lawful right to come'; smuggling a person in such a way that a person will be exploited, or subject to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment, or exposed to risk of serious harm or death; presenting false documents or misleading information to an Australian official in the context of the immigration of five of more non-citizens; and dealing with documents that may be used by unentitled persons to come to Australia.


This Bill removes the key section that imposes a mandatory minimum sentence in respect of the aforementioned offences. It is a simple amendment but it will have a significant impact in returning fairness and justice to this area of the law.




Punishing boat crew rather than organisers



The Australian Greens are opposed to mandatory sentencing on principle. The punishment meted out by the state must fit the crime and the fettering of judicial discretion amounts to a breach of the separation of powers.


However, the urgent need for reform in this area arises from practicality as well as from principle. Submissions to an inquiry into related legislation in 2011 elicited compelling evidence from the lawyers who are working at the coalface of people smuggling prosecutions. So far, charges against people smuggling organisers have only made up around 2% of all prosecutions. The Senate inquiry was advised that, instead, it is asylum seeker vessels' boat crew who are bearing the brunt of the five year minimum sentences.


Evidence from the legal representatives of boat crew suggests that these individuals are generally from traditional fishing villages in the Indonesian archipelago. They tend to be impoverished, ill-educated, and unaware of Australia's preoccupation with border security. The crew are recruited from their community by the 'kingpin' people smugglers – the organisers – with offers of lucrative fishing work or even sightseeing.  Sometimes the boat crew are unexpectedly transferred from the fishing trawler onto a leaky asylum seeker vessel while out on the open water.  If the asylum seeker vessel safely reaches Australian waters it is intercepted and the boat crew taken into Australian immigration detention.  Meanwhile their families at home are deprived of a breadwinner while the boat crew member, often a young person now convicted as an aggravated people smuggler, serves out a grossly disproportionate five year sentence in Australia.




Little deterrence impact



This Bill does not soften or affect Australia's border security, nor does it seek to encourage the practice of seeking asylum in Australia by unauthorised boat arrival. The Australian Greens recognise that arrival by boat poses a significant risk to the personal safety of asylum seeker passengers. Under this Bill, people smuggling remains illegal. The relatively high maximum jail sentence of 20 years attached to the offences affected by this Bill reflects the fact that this is a serious public policy issue. The 20 year maximum indicates the significance of the Commonwealth offence to the sentencing judge, and the court is empowered to impose a length of imprisonment up to that maximum and arrived at on the basis of well-established sentencing principles.


There is nothing in this Bill that seeks to tie the hands of any court that decides to impose a significantly long sentence on a convicted people smuggler, including where the offender is an organiser and profiteer from the enterprise. Similarly, there is nothing in this Bill that stops the court from appropriately punishing a boat crew member who has been convicted of people smuggling.


This Bill seeks to restore the ability of courts to sentence people smugglers for less than five years if that is deemed appropriate in the view of the sentencing judge. Many Australian judges have expressed their preference to sentence for less than the mandatory minimum. In doing so, it is unlikely to result in a sudden influx of boat arrivals.  It was made clear to a Senate inquiry in 2010 that the mandatory minimum sentences, falling as they do on the shoulders of impoverished boat crew, have little or no general deterrence effect on stopping the arrival of boats. Desperate people seeking Australia's protection will continue to arrive here in any way they can and at risk to themselves. More significantly, the boat crew are not in a position to understand the legal ramifications of their involvement. As a member of the Northern Territory Supreme Court recently commented in handing down an minimum sentence ""but for the mandatory minimum sentences which I am required to impose, I would have imposed a much lesser sentence than I am now required by law to do "".  A NSW District Court member commented ""deterrence needs to be considered in the context of illiterate and poor fishermen from remote islands of the Indonesian archipelago where there is no electricity, no television and no radio”. It is apparent that the current system of mandatory minimum sentencing is not working – it is not cost effective, it leads to crowded prisons, it is not supported by the legal profession or the judiciary, and it is discriminatory and unjust.




Support for reform



The lawyers who are appearing in people smuggling prosecutions told the Senate inquiry in 2011 that, of the 353 people smuggling prosecutions on foot around Australia at that time, only six were cases mounted against organisers.  Evidence was given to the Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into the deterring people smuggling bill last year that of the 493 individuals arrested between 2008 and 2011, only 10 were accused as organisers.  The overwhelming majority of the people charged with people smuggling in Australia are those whose were recruited on to the boats to steer, crew or cook. It was said by Victorian Legal Aid to a Senate inquiry in 2010 that the boat crew are as dispensable to the organisers of people smuggling as the boats that get burnt off the coast of Christmas Island and Ashmore Reef.


This Bill takes action to address the problem identified publicly by the judiciary: that the current regime is out of kilter with sentences handed down for offences with much greater moral culpability such as violent or sexual crime.


In introducing this Bill, I am acting on principle and in accordance with the Australian Greens' commitment to fair judicial process, the rule of law and the independence of the courts. But I am also acting in response to growing momentum from the community, particularly the legal community and the judiciary.  The mandatory minimum sentences set out in the Migration Act do not allow for differentiation between serious and minor offences or for consideration of the particular circumstances of the individual. Under Article 9(1) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, this renders the minimum sentence of imprisonment as arbitrary. This Bill unshackles the Court and restores due discretion for the sentencer to apply crucial sentencing principles which take into account things like mental illness, remorse, hardship, age, lack of prior offending, degree of involvement and level of culpability. Judicial discretion is crucial to natural justice and the rule of law.




Conclusion



In the development of this Bill I have spoken to lawyers, barristers and human rights advocates and I thank them all for their assistance.


I look forward to these reforms proceeding as they are necessary to put an end to the unfairness and disproportion of the current system of mandatory minimum sentences. This Bill provides a way for the Federal Parliament to reinstate a fairer model of dealing with convicted people smugglers, recognising that most of them are less culpable boat crew, by allowing the court to take into account the facts and circumstances of each case. I commend the Bill to the Senate.

 (Queensland) (16:45):  I move:


That the Senate—


(a) notes the passing and recognises the inspirational life and achievements of Vaclav Havel, the dissident playwright and first post-communist President of Czechoslovakia, who:


   (i) as Warsaw Pact tanks invaded Czechoslovakia in August 1968, improvised resistance by setting up a clandestine radio station and distributing leaflets,


   (ii) resisted the corruption of communist rule with plays and essays dedicated to human dignity and independence,


   (iii) co-authored the human rights charter, called Charter 77, which brought him international recognition as the leader of opposition in Czechoslovakia,


   (iv) endured years of persecution and imprisonment,


   (v) in writings, for which he was jailed, warned communist leaders that by attempting to stifle the human urge for freedom, they were dooming their own system,


   (vi) led his nation through the bloodless Velvet Revolution that toppled the brutal Soviet-backed communist regime in the then Czechoslovakia,


   (vii) was elected President of his country on 29 December 1989, the day after Alexander Dubcek was elected speaker of its federal parliament,


   (viii) presided over his country’s transition to a free economy, steered his country into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and prepared the way for its entry into the European Union,


   (ix) guided his nation through the slow and difficult process of recovery from the spiritual damage caused by four decades of communist totalitarian rule,


   (x) received the United States Presidential Medal of Freedom, the Philadelphia Liberty Medal, the Order of Canada, the Freedom Medal of the Four Freedoms Award, the Ambassador of Conscience Award and many other distinctions,


   (xi) was a founding signatory of the Prague Declaration on European Conscience and Communism that proposed the establishment of the European Day of Remembrance for Victims of Stalinism and Nazism, and


   (xii) advocated collective action to end ethnic cleansing in Bosnia and Kosovo and supported democratic activists in Cuba, Zimbabwe, China, Burma and elsewhere; and


(b) conveys its condolences to the people of the Czech Republic.

Senator MASON:
  Vaclav Havel, the first president of post-communist Czechoslovakia, was one of the most remarkable freedom fighters of the 20th century. He was a playwright; he was a writer; he was a poet; and he was an intellectual. He was imprisoned, beaten and brutalised by the communist dictatorship. Unlike far too many in the West, he never romanticised or made excuses for commu­nism. I hope all senators, including the Greens, understand that. Havel understood from painful personal experience commu­nism's horror, degradation and the cancer it is to the human spirit.


I had the good fortune to meet President Havel in New York in 2006. I handed him a copy of a book he wrote called Living in Truth. He was good enough to sign it for me using a green pen. Then he took out a red pen and he drew a little red heart underneath it. He winked at me and he said one word: 'Love'. I thought we had made some connection. What struck me was his apparent innocence, an innocence that even communism could not belt out of him. But his innocence was truly luminous. It lit his face, his smile, his native Czechoslovakia and all of central Europe and all those who love and yearn for freedom.

  I very much support this motion. I was invited by a number of news organisations to respond to the president's death and did so nationally. I agree with the senator moving this motion that Havel is another example of a great soul who can inspire all of us. But he would not have wanted his death used for political or petty pointscoring in the Australian Senate. I thought the mover of this motion, a good motion and a good point of view to be put, demeaned this occasion by his comment on the Greens. It was very unworthy of him and he should have done better than that. Havel would have blown the whistle on that.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2012-02-08,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (16:50):  There is no doubt that Fair Work Australia's investigation into the Health Services Union is a debacle. It is like that long-running TV program Blue Hills; just when you thought there surely could not be another episode or another twist in the saga, yes, there was. This reflects very poorly on Ms Gillard who established Fair Work Australia, and appointed the personnel to Fair Work Australia and the administration of Fair Work Australia. People now know the salacious allegations in relation to the Health Services Union, allegations made by other union officials not the coalition. The allega­tions are that about $100,000 worth of union funds were expended in an inappropriate manner, to put it mildly. The suggestion is, and it is not disputed, that the union's funds were used for, amongst other things, the procurement of prostitutes.


The Health Services Union in particular is allegedly an organisation that looks after the interests of workers who, in general terms, are low-paid workers. These people, looking after their interests, seek to make a contribution to the Health Services Union only to find that their trust in their union has been abused in this sordid manner. As a result—




Senator Jacinta Collins:
  You've determined it, have you?




Senator ABETZ:
  No. Isn't it amazing how the Labor Party just so readily interject and come to the defence of the Health Services Union? And that a female Labor senator could seek to support the allegations against the member for Dobell using union funds for the procurement of prostitutes is another example that the Labor Party will stop at nothing in defending the member for Dobell.




Senator Ronaldson:
  It probably explains the shovel on the front doorstep too.




Senator ABETZ:
  Senator Ronaldson is right, the shovel that was left on the front doorstep of the person who blew the whistle was a none-too-subtle manoeuvre. But this investigation has been going on for three years. Let us just cast our mind to the allegations that President Nixon, no less than a president of the United States, faced. Watergate, from beginning to end, was wrapped up in 18 months. They were dealing with the President of the United States. But here we have an investigation into the activities of a trade union official taking twice as long, a period of three years. I am not going to make any allegations here. There is a stark choice. I am not sure which choice we should take. Either we have a display of gross administrative incompetence or an institutionalised go-slow, and what motivates that is another question.


But there is no doubt that something is wrong in Fair Work Australia. Indeed, the former industrial registrar, Mr Doug Williams, has taken the unprecedented action of going public to indicate that under his stewardship such an investigation would not have taken so long and would have been concluded by now. So if a former industrial registrar can come to that conclusion, why can't Fair Work Australia?



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—




Senator ABETZ:
  We have Senator Collins interjecting, asking was he an appointment by a certain person? The problem, Senator Collins, is this: the member for Dobell is allegedly also complaining as to why this is taking so long. Ms Jackson is complaining as to why it is taking so long. Indeed, yesterday, we had the Australian editorialising that possibly this is worthy now of a royal commission to get to the bottom of this terrible go-slow.


In our own experience in dealings with Fair Work Australia on this issue, given the reluctance and deliberate obfuscation by the minister at the table at Senate estimates and by the then manager of Fair Work Australia, Mr Tim Lee, we undertook an FOI, a freedom of information request. It was completely denied by Fair Work Australia, categorically rejected. They would not even tell us what documents they would not give us access to. They just would not tell us anything. So what did we do? We had to go to the Information Commissioner. The Information Commissioner basically forced Fair Work Australia to finally disclose some documents. What do those documents reveal? Well, no wonder they did not want to tell us about them. One of them is an email to Fair Work Australia. It says:


I am the Acting Commander, New South Wales Police Fraud Squad.


I have left messages throughout the day with both—


name deleted and name deleted. I am deleting these names because I do not think they should be on the public record at this stage—


from your office requesting that you contact me. I have been told by—


name deleted—


that the best way to contact you is to send an email.


So here we have the commander of the fraud squad in New South Wales reduced to emailing the manager of Fair Work Australia to get his telephone calls returned. Not one, not two, but numerous calls on that day were not responded to. I simply pose the question—chances are Senator Collins would agree with this, but I am sure all the listeners would—that if any of us in our offices or in our homes got a call from the commander of the New South Wales Police fraud squad, would we ignore it? You know what? I reckon that would get priority for a return phone call. I think most people would react like that. But, no, not Mr Tim Lee, the manager of Fair Work Australia. 'We'll ignore that. We'll ignore that. We'll ignore that.' So he reduced the acting commander of the fraud squad to sending an email.


After three years of this obfuscation, knowing that this was about to blow and that the coalition and the public were about to pursue this, what does Labor do? This manager of Fair Work Australia quietly gets appointed as a commissioner of Fair Work Australia to make sure that he can no longer appear before the Senate estimates committ­ee process to account for these three years of delay. That is why, just moments ago, I put a motion before this place to have Mr Lee brought before Senate estimates to explain his behaviour of the past three years. Isn't it interesting the parties that say they are always for openness and transparency, namely the Greens and the ALP, voted en bloc as their Green-Labor alliance to deny access. We had the real representative of the Labor Party, the Democratic Labor Party, and Senator Xenophon voting with us. At least the Democratic Labor Party knows how to look after Labor voters, unlike the Australian Labor Party, which is now engaged with the New South Wales Right and the Australian Greens in deliberately obfuscating, deliberately not answering questions and deliberately seeking to avoid the issues. We know what is at stake here. If you can keep the member for the Dobell on political life support, he in turn will keep the Gillard government on political life support, and everything is being done by the government to delay this and ensure that it drags out until the next election. This is a matter of great public interest and great public concern. When you have former industrial registrars saying this is highly inappropriate, when you have the Australian newspaper editorialising for a royal commission and when you have the person that laid the complaint complaining, this is a matter that needs to be taken seriously, and we in the coalition do so.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2012-02-08,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (17:00):  This proposal is about the oppo­sition's appalling attempts to interfere in and politicise an independent inquiry by Fair Work Australia into the Health Services Union. Fair Work Australia is currently investigating possible irregularities in the financial accounts of the Health Services Union. These investigations are ongoing and, I stress, completely independent from the government. I find it entirely inappropriate that the Senate is debating an ongoing investigation by an independent authority and that the opposition is labelling it a debacle. 


It follows opposition attempts in estimates to pre-empt and compromise an appropriate outcome by exposing details of the investiga­tion. It would be entirely inappropriate for the parliament to second-guess Fair Work Australia or to interfere in any way. The allegations being investigated are serious. These are public servants—professionals—trying to do a job which can only be done without political interference. The govern­ment recognises that it is import­ant that unions and employer organisations remain accountable to their membership for how the funds of the organisations are expended. These are important matters. But I stress that the provisions in the Fair Work Act remain the same as those which were introduced under the current Leader of the Opposition, Tony Abbott.


There are financial reporting requirements set out the Fair Work (Registered Organisa­tions) Act 2009. These are modelled closely on laws applying to company directors in corporations law and are the same now as they were when introduced by Tony Abbott when he was the minister for workplace relations. Let us be clear here: these laws are the same as the laws of the coalition. 


On another matter of consistency, I note the former Prime Minister John Howard's attitudes to similar matters. When he was questioned regarding three MPs facing investigation back in 2007 by the AFP, his response was:


A lot of people who are under investigation end up having nothing to answer for.


It is a police investigation and the appropriate thing for me to do is to let the police investigation run its course and then, if it is appropriate, I will have something to say.


The opposition's actions here are quite absurd. One day they baselessly accuse the government of interference, and the next day they demand intervention. On the matter of interference, the government has nothing to hide. There has been no interference in any way by the government in this matter. A detailed account has been given which the coalition has chosen to ignore. If the opposition has any evidence backing up their claims they should provide it, not simply refer to one person or another.



Senator Brandis interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Pratt
):  Order, Senator Brandis!




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  If you have evidence, you should provide it rather than recycle old claims. At the moment all we see are baseless and recycled allegations.


Fair Work Australia officials were examined through Senate estimates process­es, and, as recently as December last year, they confirmed there had only been two contacts, neither of which could possibly be construed as inappropriate interference. The first of these contacts was detailed in Senate estimates back in April 2010. The opposition alleged inappropriate contact between Fair Work Australia and the government. I refer you to Senator Arbib's explanation in the Senate of 13 May 2010 on page 3192 which details and explains that no inappropriate information concerning the investigation was conveyed to the minister or to the office of the Prime Minister.


The only other communication between Fair Work Australia and the government has also been explained. Fair Work Australia was contacted by a ministerial media adviser following inquiries about the accuracy of a Channel 7 news report back in August last year. In October last year, the minister provided a detailed explanation of these events to a Senate estimates hearing. This information was also provided to the opposition in answers to questions on notice, but again they recycled old and dealt-with allegations. It is entirely reasonable for the staff of ministers to contact relevant agencies for the purpose of establishing facts when responding to issues raised by the media. To suggest otherwise is laughable.


The opposition today was seeking that Mr Tim Lee, the former general manager at Fair Work Australia, appear before the Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Legislation Committee. While he was the general manager of Fair Work Australia, Mr Lee was present at a number of Senate estimates hearings and therefore has already answered opposition questions. We have detailed on more than one occasion any communication between the government and Fair Work Australia during Mr Lee's time as general manager. There is now an acting general manager who is available to answer questions at estimates. Let us make today's stunt very clear: Senator Abetz made no case at all for his motion. It had not even been addressed by the Senate committee. It was simply a timely stunt. The opposition's claims overall are similar: they are simply bizarre. As stated previously, they have criticised the government for interfering while also demanding intervention on timing or intervention on the public release of the report. Let me deal with the issue of timing. I appreciate that the investigation involving the HSU has been long-running—although it has not been three years, as Senator Abetz exaggerates—but it is important that Fair Work Australia be allowed to conduct a thorough investigation free from interference and commentary. When Fair Work Australia investigations into the Health Services Union matter are complete, the investigating officer will deliver their final reports to the general manager of Fair Work Australia. The time frame within which this will occur is—



Opposition senators interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! There is a conversation going on to the left of me that is a little bit too loud.




Senator JACINTA COLLINS:
  When the investigation is finalised, the report will be given to the general manager of Fair Work Australia. This is entirely a matter for Fair Work Australia. I note that they released a public statement on 27 January to confirm that the investigation was nearing its conclusion.


In answer to the questions about incompe­tence, I highlight that this is a complex investigation about the financial reporting of a large organisation. Fair Work Australia has publicly said there are over 6,000 documents involved. We know that other independent investigatory agencies, such as the ATO and ASIC, have on occasion taken long periods to work through complex investigations.


I turn now to the question of the release of the report. It is for Fair Work Australia to decide whether its report should be made public based on proper administrative law principles. Fair Work Australia will no doubt consider all relevant legal matters in deciding whether to release its report and whether such a release may be prejudicial to any further proceedings. Although there may be an expectation that Fair Work Australia's investigation will lead to sanctions for any individuals who have been found to have misused union funds, such sanctions may flow from related criminal investigations conducted by the police. Doesn't the opposition realise they could potentially prejudice this case if Fair Work Australia's investigation leads to a criminal investigation? Is this what you really want?


The principle of natural justice requires that a fair and proper procedure be used when making a decision. It is entirely appropriate for an independent authority such as Fair Work Australia to be able to conduct their investigations free of political pressure. They are an independent authority and should be allowed to conduct their investigation accordingly. It is time that the opposition stopped grandstanding on this matter and let Fair Work Australia do their job. It is appropriate to let this investigation conclude. The opposition should stop throwing mud and instead focus on what is important to the Australian public.

Senator RONALDSON
 (Victoria) (17:10):  What an utterly duplicitous piece of government spin written by the Prime Minister's office to defend the indefensible in this matter. It continues the behaviour of the Prime Minister and senior government ministers in protecting one of their own, because the demise of one of their own would mean the potential demise of this illegitimate government.


I will go through a number of matters again today, and then I will finish on what I think is another extremely serious allegation about this government's behaviour. I think it has been in the press that this inquiry started in April 2009. Today I looked at the evidence of Mr Nassios.



Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—




Senator RONALDSON:
  The parliamentary secretary herself does not know, because she said 'March'. Indeed, back on 10 February last year, Mr Nassios, the investigator, admitted that this inquiry started in January 2009. What honourable senators may not be aware of is that there was a pre-inquiry inquiry which went for nearly 15 months—there were nearly 15 months of a preliminary inquiry before they moved to the formal investigation. That is an outrageous time delay. The explanation by Mr Nassios was straight out of an episode of Yes, Minister. It said:


The Fair Work Act is structured in a way that requires me as a delegate to inquire as to whether there are reasonable grounds for me to actually proceed to an investigation. I am actually not at the moment investigating, and it may be that there will be no investigation. I am inquiring.


It was 19 months. To Mr Nassios I said:


Mr Nassios, you have now had this matter for 13 months and you are telling us you still actually have not decided, so it is an investigation into whether you are doing to investigate the matter. Is that what you are telling committee?


This is absolutely outrageous. There were 15 months of a pre-investigation inquiry, and two years later it has not been finalised. But what is open to the Australian community and what is open to everyone involved in this matter is to see what some of those involved have said about this inquiry.


My colleague Senator Abetz quite rightly quoted some comments from Mr Doug Williams, the former industrial registrar, who started this investigation and wrote a memo that the government refused to release just prior to his departure—which happened the end of June 2009, according to my recollection. They refused to release that memo. Mr Williams criticised Fair Work Australia for its unaccountably protracted investigations into the allegation of the use of Thomson's HSU cards. Mr Williams warned that Fair Work Australia's reputation could suffer because the investigation of the HSU and Thomson was taking too long. It was 'unaccountably protracted', according to the man who commenced this investigation back in early 2009. Let us consider the comments of Kathy Jackson. The behaviour of some in the Labor Party towards this woman has been an utter disgrace. When did the last Labor woman stand up and say, 'We do not think it is acceptable behaviour for a woman from the union to have a shovel shoved on her front door step in the middle of the night'? The utter cowardice of those opposite on the question of the defence of this woman is extraordinary. The Australiannewspaper reported recently that Kathy Jackson said:


… that while she had no direct evidence, she suspected there had been government interference in the Fair Work Australia investigation into the HSU. ""I suspect it because of what I am hearing around town. Just watch this space,"" …


What was she suspecting? What did she allege? She alleged that there was government involvement with the Fair Work Australia investigation into the the HSU and Craig Thomson. 


Kathy Jackson went on to say that she told Doug Williams when he was the industrial registrar of the AIRC that there might be political interference in the inquiry. It is alleged that Mr Williams said: 


I know that the allegations against Craig Thomson can bring down the government and that there are powerful people in the ALP who might make an attempt to nobble the investigation from the inside after I leave …


When talking about nobbling, you need go no further than the behaviour of the former minister who is in the chair at the moment and is indeed the acting general manager.


Mr Nassios has control of this investi­gation. Mr Nassios was quite happy, in the early part of last year and the later part of the year before, to answer matters that were not going to interfere with his inquiry. He was quite circumspect about this, but he was prepared to at least answer questions. As soon there was a change over to the acting general manager, the acting general manager refused to allow Nassios to answer a single question. She nobbled him. What I want to know, what this parliament wants to know and what the Australian people want to know is: on whose direction was Nassios nobbled? Who in the government spoke to the acting general manager and demanded of her that she nobble Mr Nassios? That is the question that is outstanding. 


There is one further question which I raise now in the limited time left to me. Back in October, I said to the acting general manager, 'Are you going to release publically the findings of Mr Nassios, as it was referred to you, and the public information surround­ing it?' At that stage, the acting general manager refused to answer the question and took it on notice. We now know from AAP reports on 3 February that the final report on Craig Thomson may not be publically released—what an absolute outrage.


I will go through some of the things that I think should be immediately released. We believe that the sworn statements which were taken from Mr Thomson and others should be released, because we want to see what Mr Thomson said on oath about Fair Work Australia and what he said in his statement about the defamation proceedings he took against Fairfax, which he dropped in the most cowardly of fashions. We want to compare the evidence he gave in the Fairfax matter to the evidence he gave to Fair Work Australia. We want to see the BDO Kendall report which the government and Fair Work Australia refuses to release. We want to see all the information from the Fairfax defamation proceedings so we can again compare what was said in that civil case with what was said to Fair Work Australia.


This Prime Minister can run from this matter, but she can no longer hide. It goes to the core of this government's integrity. It goes to the core of this government's claim about openness and transparency. It has taken fourteen months for an inquiry to decide whether there would be a further inquiry and an investigation. This investi­gation has taken over two years. We were told in the middle of last year that the investigation would be finalised by the end of 2011. We were then told it would be finalised by the middle of January 2012. We are now told it will not be finalised until March this year. 


This government must own up to the fact that this inquiry has taken far too long. This government has to own up to the fact that it has nobbled a senior member of Fair Work Australia for its own cheap political purposes. There is not one person in this country who does not believe that the government is actively involved in ensuring that Craig Thomson remains the member for Dobell for as long as possible in order to prevent what would otherwise be inevitable. This Prime Minister tried to cover up for what may potentially be the forced retire­ment of Mr Thomson by going to Mr Slipper and getting him to cross sides. It shows just how desperate this government is. You must immediately acknowledge that every single document must be released to the Australian community and that it must be done now.

"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2012-02-08,"



Senator FURNER
 (Queensland) (17:21):  I rise this afternoon to contribute to this motion about the alleged debacle of the Fair Work Australia investigation into the Health Services Union. I think we should be reminded that this is a new year when those opposite will try to prosecute this conspiracy theory. They go out there and try to scare the public. They run a scare campaign around something that has no substance. They have not been able to provide any substance or any proof here this afternoon or in the past. I imagine that will remain the case in the future. 


We should always remind ourselves that Fair Work Australia is an organisation we should never second-guess. It is independent. We should not interfere with the investiga­tions in any shape or form. That goes for the opposition as well as for the government. That is why we have not interfered. It is quite absurd when you listen to the argument of the opposition on this matter, where we have the opposition accusing the government of interference one day and then the next day demanding intervention over the timing of the public release of the final Fair Work Australia report. You cannot have your cake and eat it. You have to work out what you want in this outcome. 


With respect to timing in the matter of Fair Work Australia, the short answer is that they want to be thorough. As most of us would realise, certainly all of us on this side, Fair Work Australia is a professional organisation. I had some experience with the industrial relations system for 20 years before I began my career here as a senator for Queensland, and I realise the complexity, the workload and the timing of decisions of the industrial relations system in our country. And here we have the opposition trying to fast-track it and get bits of pieces of evidence, whether it be statements or correspondence, prior to a decision being made. That is not the way it operates. It operates on a conciliatory and professional basis that all of us on this side know will be thorough, complete and delivered in a timely manner.


Oddly enough, you never hear the opposition talking about the good things that Fair Work Australia does—or the good things the industrial relations system delivers to our society, to our working-class families and to people who are vulnerable. I refer to the equal pay decision recently involving 150,000 mostly female workers who, in many circumstances, look after the most vulnerable people in our society. You never hear the opposition championing those sorts of outcomes when they come in here. It was not that long ago when Senator Abetz, I think it was, sought to move a disallowance notice on a regulation that would have awarded those pay increases last year. This is the approach they take when it comes to looking after vulnerable workers in our society. It is not a case of embracing them and making sure their conditions are guaranteed and safe. It is a case of pushing them away.



Senator Abetz interjecting—




Senator FURNER:
  We know your form on industrial relations, Senator Abetz, and your form is well known throughout this country. That form was repeated in question time today when an opposition senator from South Australia questioned the government about what we are doing about making sure our roads are safe, making sure that the drivers who drive those vehicles along our highways do not end up in circumstances where they will, unfortunately, one day if the circumstances permit, end up in a terrible accident. The senator questioned why we are looking at awarding those people fair and reasonable wage increases and conditions of employment whilst they drive those heavy vehicles along our highways. That is an example of what is ahead of us should this opposition ever gain government again. 


As for other circumstances that Fair Work Australia deal with, we know that the Fair Work Ombudsman ensures that workers get the pay they are due, and we know about Fair Work Australia's proactive education and compliance campaigns. Hundreds of thousands of employees and employers in every state in the country bargain, negotiate and reach outcomes that are suitable and agreed to in their workplaces. When it comes to the policy position of the opposition on industrial relations, you will find them wanting, because they have not and they will not—up until the next election—table any form of policy on industrial relations. Why won't they do that? We know what happened last time they had their hands on industrial relations and they brought in Work Choices. It was the most terrible type of legislation and we know of the insidious effects that it had on workers in our society and how it stripped away the conditions of the most vulnerable people in our working class families. More than four million workers lost basic protections and more than a million suffered real pay cuts of up to $90 a week through one of the most instrumental parts of Work Choices—Australian workplace agreements. 


Many Australian workplace agreements cut penalty rates, overtime, public holidays, shift allowances and rest breaks. Young workers, women and casuals were worst affected, and 2.8 million Australian workers lost protection against unfair dismissal. That is where the opposition want to return to; that is what they spoke about today in question time when they questioned the government about why we were looking at protecting workers who drive heavy rigs down the highway and awarding them pay increases. They do not care for blue-collar workers—




Senator Brandis:
  Yeah, we do! Most of them vote for us!




Senator FURNER:
  That is not the case at all. You might dream that or wish that, but that is not the case, Senator Brandis.


When it comes to the arguments the opposition has used when questioning the competence of Fair Work Australia or why this is dragging out, we only need to look at some of the history and certainly the recent annual report of Fair Work Australia to understand their workload. A lot of this annual report has to do with Work Choices, because we had to come in here and fix a history of concerns about things like unfair dismissals, and we had to make sure that workers were allowed a fair go—'a fair go' is one set of words you will never hear coming out of those opposite—in their workplaces and that they were protected from unfair dismissals. If we look at one circumstance here in the annual report: as a result of bargaining and agreement-making back in the days when Work Choices was in place, only 189 agreements were approved or varied. Come 2009-10, there were 24,053. It demonstrates that there were a whole heap of people wanting to get out of Australian workplace agreements and it also demonstrates the ability of workers and their employers to make agreements. That is one capacity that has been resolved and granted through the introduction of the Fair Work Australia Act. This is an act we have been proud of, to make sure there is fairness in the workplace.


Returning to the MPI today, we should also remember that it is important that unions and employer organisations are accountable, and that is the framework of the Fair Work Australia Act—to make sure that accountability exists. I am sure that at the end of the day, when Fair Work Australia comes down with an outcome on this particular examination, there will be a concise and competent response in respect to its investigations. That is why there are financial reporting requirements in the act, the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009. They are modelled closely on the laws that apply to company directors of corporations. They are the same now as they were when introduced by Tony Abbott, when he was the industrial relations minister. We should remind ourselves that they are something he introduced. 


It is something we have adopted and carried on to make sure that transparency exists for these sorts of issues. We should remember that in the allegations we are talking about here—these are the words Senator Abetz commenced with——no one has been found guilty. You opened your address here, Senator Abetz, admitting these are allegations and the true purpose of the law should be completed before anyone sledges anyone or claims that someone has done anything wrong in the circumstances of this particular case.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (17:31):  Labor senators who have spoken in this debate are obviously very proud of the Fair Work Act. 




Senator Furner:
  Yes!




Senator BRANDIS:
  Thank you, Senator Furner. Let me refer you, Madam Acting Deputy President Pratt, to section 577 of the Fair Work Act of which they are so proud. It lies in that part of the act which establishes Fair Work Australia. This is what it says:


Fair Work Australia must perform its functions and exercise its powers—


in a manner which:


(a) is fair and just; and


(b) is quick, informal and avoids unnecessary technicalities; and


(c) is open and transparent; and


(d) promotes harmonious and cooperative workplace relations.


I defy anyone to assert in good faith that the investigation by Fair Work Australia into the affairs of the Health Services Union and the involvement in those affairs of its former professional officer Mr Craig Thomson has been either quick or open and transparent. 


As Senator Abetz and Senator Ronaldson have pointed out, this investigation began in January 2009—more than three years ago—and now, in the fourth year of the investigation, there is still no end in sight. On no view is that a quick, open and transparent investigation and it is nonsense for Senator Jacinta Collins to assert that by criticising the obvious delay that has beset this investigation the opposition is in some manner seeking to politically interfere with an independent agency. Fair Work Australia is not a court, it is an agency, and as an agency of the executive government it is entirely answerable to the scrutiny of the parliament and the committees of the parliament, including the Senate estimates committees. 


It is also, as an agency of the Common­wealth, answerable to a writ of mandamus under section 75 of the Constitution if it fails to discharge its statutory obligations. So for the parliament to insist that a statutory agency which is evidently delaying the performance of a statutory function—in breach of the requirements of its own act, that it proceed with those functions in a quick and efficient manner—is nothing more than this parliament and this Senate doing its job is nonsense, as is saying that to criticise a defaulting, non-compliant statutory agency is to do other than what the parliament is meant to be doing.


As we know, at the core of the Fair Work Australia investigation lies the role of the man who was, at the time, the national secretary and is now the member for Dobell—Mr Craig Thomson. And as we know, if Mr Craig Thomson were to forfeit his seat in parliament, on conviction for an indictable offence, the Gillard government would fall. Does anybody in Australia seriously believe that the delay in concluding the investigation into Mr Craig Thomson is not related to the fact that he is the one vote upon whom the fate of the Gillard government depends? You would have to be very gullible to believe that.


Senator Abetz has already said so but let me repeat it: the Fitzgerald inquiry in our state, Mr Acting Deputy President Furner, which you will remember, subjected the entire political and policing system of the state of Queensland to what was effectively institutional open-heart surgery. It examined hundreds of thousands of documents. It examined hundreds of witnesses. It was the most complex commission of its kind, certainly the most consequential commission of its kind, in Australian history. It did not take three years. 


The Wood royal commission in New South Wales, which examined the police force of that state and dealt with numerous transactions and an extremely complex web of criminal activity, did not take anything like three years. And yet this is essentially the audit of expenses engaged in by one individual over the course of a few years in the discharge—'discharge' is perhaps not the best word to use in the circumstances—of his obligations as a senior union official. Senator Collins showed her naivety about these matters when she said, 'There are 6,000 documents.' Six thousand documents in a large piece of litigation or a complex inquiry is as nothing. It does not take three years to examine 6,000 documents. If it were being done industriously and with the proper dedication of resources to it, it would take about three weeks.


We have had inconsistent evidence to Senate inquiries by Mr Nassios, to whom Senator Ronaldson referred, and other officers of Fair Work Australia, about both the conduct of the investigation and the likely completion date of the investigation. And, now, scandalously, there has been a suggestion that if the investigation—well into its fourth year—were to come to a conclusion, that report would not be made public. Because the fate of the government depends upon this man, the delay in the prosecution of justice is a political scandal. Those concerned in this delay will not escape with their reputations intact if, on a careful review of their activities, it appears—as has been credibly alleged by Ms Kathy Jackson, the person who, other than Mr Craig Thomson, knows more about the affairs of the Health Services Union than anyone else—there has been political interference by the Rudd and Gillard governments, as well as institutional delay on the part of Fair Work Australia.


Justice delayed is justice denied. It is as much an outrage for there to be a deliberate delay in the prosecution of an investigation as for there to be a premature conclusion to that investigation. Where there is a political motive—where that fate of the government depends upon delay, when there are credible allegations of political interference, where there is a host of inconsistencies between the very limited accounts that those officers have given to the parliament—then we, the parliament and the Australian people, are entitled to conclude that Mr Craig Thomson is being protected by the very people who have a statutory function to engage in a quick, open and transparent investigation into his affairs. Because of their conduct, the Australian people will find it very difficult to maintain their confidence in the integrity of those involved.

"Thistlethwaite, Sen Matt",ALP,2012-02-08,"



Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (17:41):  Here we go again. Despite all of the uncertainty in the global economy and a government dealing with issues associated with keeping our economy strong and supporting jobs; despite the uncertainty that the business community faces—being worried about a two-speed economy and how the benefits of the mining boom are going to flow to them—despite the fact that there is a review going on into Fair Work Australia at the moment; despite the fact that manufacturing is dealing with the pressures associated with a high Australian dollar and the government is supporting manufacturing in this country; despite the fact that in important sectors of this economy we face a skills shortage, and the govern­ment has a comprehensive set of reforms to promote vocational education and training in our economy; despite the fact that constitutional recognition of Indigenous Australians is high on the agenda in this parliament at the moment; despite the fact that the eyes of the nation are on this parliament, its politicians and its plans for the future, you might think that the opposition, in the limited time that they have available to discuss matters of so-called public importance, would try to direct some of that attention to a policy issue.


Perhaps they might want to enunciate an alternative vision for government in this country—to outline some of their policies and plans to deal with some of the issues that I mentioned earlier. But, no, for the second day in a row they have come into this place and resorted to gutter politics. They have resorted to mudslinging again—a highly inappropriate and unprecedented pressure that they are trying to exert on an independ­ent authority regarding the conduct of an investigation that is currently underway.


Those opposite have also been involved in putting highly inappropriate pressure on the New South Wales Police Force regarding the conduct of an investigation into that matter. In that respect I draw the Senate's attention to a letter that was written by none other than Senator Brandis in September 2011 to the Police Commissioner in New South Wales, Andrew Scipione, in which he states:


I am writing to you to request that, in accordance with your standard procedures, you make an assessment and, if appropriate, direct your officers to make an investigation into those allegations in order to determine whether an offence against the law of New South Wales has been committed ...


It was highly inappropriate for a member of the Senate—a politician in this country—to be putting such pressure on a police commissioner to conduct an investigation.


I must take issue with the reference that Senator Brandis made earlier to the Fair Work Act. One would expect that someone of Senator Brandis's standing and esteem in this place and high standing within the Liberal Party—he is a former barrister; in fact, I believe he may even be a QC or an SC or whatever they call themselves these days—would be able to read in context the provisions of the Fair Work Act. Senator Brandis came in here quoting section 577 of the Fair Work Act, which is about the performance of the functions of Fair Work Australia. He outlined that Fair Work Australia:


… must perform its functions and exercise its powers in a manner that:


(a) is fair and just; and


(b) is quick, informal and avoids unnecessary technicalities; and


(c) is open and transparent; and


(d) promotes harmonious and cooperative workplace relations.


What Senator Brandis failed to explain and understand was that those functions which are spoken of in section 577 are well out­lined in section 576. That section is detailed and deals with the functions conferred by that act on Fair Work Australia in relation to the National Employment Standards, modern awards, enterprise agreements, workplace determinations, minimum wages, general protections, unfair dismissal, industrial action, right of entry, extension of the National Employment Standards, unlawful termination and, indeed, other matters. The functions in section 577 do not deal with the manner in which Fair Work Australia conducts investigations. In fact, the current investigation being conducted by Fair Work Australia is not being conducted under the provisions of the Fair Work Act—the provisions that Senator Brandis referred to are not the provisions under which this investigation is being conducted. The investigation is being conducted under the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act 2009, a completely separate act. Yet Senator Brandis comes in here and attempts to mislead by stating that the provisions of the Fair Work Act apply in this case.


When the Constitution of this nation was written and when the nation was federated, our forefathers believed in certain principles. One of them was the separation of powers—and for good reason. They believed in liberty, justice, due process and the presumption of innocence. Those principles are being impinged upon by the opposition in the undue pressure they are attempting to place on an independent authority and the New South Wales police service with regard to this matter. This was an issue that was understood by the former Prime Minister John Howard. He said, and Senator Collins outlined this earlier, in relation to a police investigation being undertaken in 2007:


It's a police investigation and the appropriate thing for me to do is to let the police investigation run its course, and then, if it is appropriate, I will have something to say.


The former Prime Minister John Howard was exactly right. He was spot on.




Senator Bernardi:
  He didn't offer his full support.




Senator THISTLETHWAITE:
  He was spot on, Senator Bernardi. Perhaps we could ask Senator Brandis whether he agrees with this statement of the former Prime Minister John Howard. Perhaps that was one of the reasons Senator Brandis allegedly referred to the former Prime Minister John Howard as a 'lying rodent'.


What happened to the once respectable Liberal Party? What happened to the great and mighty Liberal Party of the days of old? It was the party that agreed with liberal ideals, natural justice and due process—but no longer. Under Tony Abbott, the current Leader of the Liberal Party, they resort to muckraking and gutter politics. On the subject of the Fair Work Australia investiga­tion, Tony Abbott said in August last year:


The Fair Work Australia investigation has taken one hell of a long time, two years at least, and I think it's high time that investigation was brought to a conclusion.


Again the Leader of the Liberal Party was placing undue pressure on Fair Work Australia about an investigation that is currently underway.


In August 2011 Senator Ronaldson joined in. I have a lot of respect for Senator Ronaldson, but I think he overstepped the mark on this issue when he, in a media release in August 2011, said:


Workplace Relations Minister, Senator Chris Evans, must step in and instruct Fair Work Australia to finalise their investigations …


This is highly inappropriate. There are good reasons that Senator Evans and the govern­ment have not stepped in: Fair Work Austra­lia is an independent statutory authority, and it is highly inappropriate for any government or politician to seek to direct or influence an independent authority to conclude an investi­gation once it is underway. It must run its proper course free of political interference.


The great irony here is that the opposition accuses the government of undue interfere­nce and then the next day comes out and says that we should be interfering; that we should be pressuring Fair Work Australia to conclu­de its investigations. The govern­ment's actions have been entirely appropri­ate, consistent with Fair Work Australia's independent authority, which was established by—importantly—the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Act. We have allowed them to conduct a proper investigation and that investigation must secure all the facts and be allowed to run its proper course.

 (Victoria) (17:53):  I seek leave to move that the Senate take note of the report.

Senator RYAN:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.


This report only just tabled has an absolute wealth of history of this government's abuse of the advertising guidelines. There will be much more to say on this matter, but it is worth recounting the period that this report covers.


This report covers the period when the government declared a national emergency in order to have a mining tax campaign. The guidelines that they had lauded and preached from the rooftops—the guidelines they had said would guarantee that they would not use money for partisan or political purposes—were shredded the minute the mining tax became a PR disaster for then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. The government gave this particular advertising campaign an exempt­ion on the grounds of an emergency—which was one of the criteria it could use—in order to fund an extraordinary campaign to try to buy public support with what had to be some of the most boring and ineffective ads in advertising history, as if putting ads of a PowerPoint slide was somehow going to excite people and change their opinion.


This report is very important. I have only had time to briefly read some short parts of it. As I said, I am sure my colleagues will have more to say on this in the future. This report, in various parts, in a masterful level of understatement that only the ANAO could be capable of—as all good auditors are—said that 'there was not the same level of discipline evident in the processes where the campaign exemptions were granted'. That is extraordinary. That is a very, very under­stated way of saying that the govern­ment trashed everything else it had said it would stick to and that it had trashed any principles of not using taxpayers' money for partisan political purposes. It did so in order to save its own political skin and, particu­larly, the skin of the then Prime Minister.


Of course, what happened after the change in the prime ministership in June 2010 was that the new Prime Minister announced that the mining tax advertising campaign would cease immediately—and it did. It ceased mainly in order to stop an ineffective advertising campaign generating even more public outcry against a badly designed tax which was bad for the economy. It was merely another example of trying to save the political skin of the Labor Party. Further on, the summary of this report said that the Treasury was required to fast-track develo­pment of the so-called tax reform campaign in order that 'the advertising is able to go to air more quickly'. That statement alone explains what the real purpose of this advertising campaign was. It was a political and partisan advertising campaign.


But there are other issues that are relevant here. The advertising agency which was given the contract for this was named Shannon's Way. I believe that was its name at the time but that it subsequently changed its name to something like 'Go Shannon'. This advertising agency is fired by its Labor traditions. I was working in the Victorian parliament at the time that it was embroiled in a scandal about tenders for state govern­ment contracts there. What is notable about this agency is its long-term ALP links. Its founder, Mr Bill Shannon, was a founder and a director of the Progressive Business Association—Labor's fundraising arm in Victoria. It has donated to the Labor Party over many years, including—according to the releases which came out just last week from the Australian Electoral Commission—$25,000 in the 2010 election year.


I now seek leave to continue my remarks so that I can have more time to read the full Auditor-General's report, because I am sure that a short reading to create clarity around this government's agenda will provide more and I know that my colleagues will have more to say as well.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

The speech read as follows—



The Australian Research Council (ARC) is a statutory authority within the Australian Government's Innovation portfolio. Its mission is to deliver policy and programs that advance Australian research and innovation globally and benefit the community.


In seeking to achieve its mission, the ARC provides advice to the Government on research matters and manages the National Competitive Grants Program (NCGP), a significant component of Australia's investment in research and development.


Through the NCGP, the ARC supports the highest-quality fundamental and applied research and research training through competitive selection processes across all disciplines, with the exception of clinical medicine and dentistry.


This is an appropriation bill to support the ongoing operations of the ARC. It will fund the high-quality research we need to address the great challenges of our time, to improve the quality of people’s lives, to support the development of new industries and to remain competitive in the global knowledge economy.


Bills to amend the Australian Research Council Act 2001 to receive administered funding occur each year. The Bills are generated to apply indexation to existing appropriation amounts, create an additional forward estimate and may also contain new funding for new initiatives.


The amendments proposed in this bill change only the administered special appropriation; they do not alter the substance of the Act or increase departmental funds.


The ARC is the major source of funding for the innovative, investigator-driven research that has underpinned inventions ranging from the Bionic Ear to the Jameson Flotation Cell, which saves the coal industry hundreds of millions of dollars each year. 


ARC funded research has and continues to play an important role in improving the lives of Australians and addressing the big issues of our time. This includes, for example, our need to transform our manufacturing industries to create greener, healthier and more resilient processes and products. The Government is proud that stronger steel and cleaner, safer cars could soon be manufactured in Australia thanks to research made possible with funding from the ARC.


On-going funding for the ARC is essential to the vitality of the Australian higher education system and our commitment to strengthen Australia’s research workforce. Excellent researchers across all areas of the university system must be able to compete for funding if we are to keep world-class academics in Australia, working in our universities and teaching the next generation.


It is important to note the key role the ARC has been and is playing in attracting more Indigenous Australians to academia and keeping more women in research careers. This includes through the Discovery Indigenous scheme, the addition of two new Australian Laureate Fellowships specifically for women and the introduction of Research Opportunity and Performance Evidence (ROPE) to enable assessors to take into account any career interruptions, including those for childbirth and caring responsibilities. 


Through these initiatives and through the whole NCGP, the ARC is helping us to reduce research career barriers and ensure the nation reaps the benefit of all of its research talent.


And the ARC is not only supporting quality research and research careers, it is helping the Government measure our research investment and assure taxpayers that their money is being invested wisely.


In January 2011, the Government announced the outcomes of the first full Excellence in Research for Australia evaluations. Developed and implemented by the ARC, ERA allowed us, for the first time, to see exactly how our country’s research efforts compare to the rest of the world. This is giving the Government a clear idea of the research areas we need to focus on for improvement and continued excellence.


ERA is a key element of the Government’s ten year Innovation Agenda, Powering Ideas.


Through this important legislation, the ARC will continue to advance our efforts to build a fairer and more prosperous Australia through innovation and education.


I commend the Bill.

Senator MARSHALL
 (Victoria) (18:59):  I rise today to provide a voice to some of Australia's most vulnerable people. I refer to outworkers within the textile, clothing and footwear industry. The plight of outworkers in the TCF industry comes as a great source of shame to me as a representative of the Australian people. For decades now TCF workers in Australia, often women with poor English skills, have been ruthlessly exploited. I have seen photos of sweatshops that exist in our own country where women are sometimes locked up for whole days in appalling conditions. These women work for as little as $4 or $5 an hour until they become crippled by work-related injuries, and any senators here could have walked past one of these sweatshops and not even known. They are behind garage doors or blank walls in suburban streets and shopping centres. This is really why I have been moved to speak here today, because a lot of the exploitation in this industry flies under the radar.


I should point out that not all TCF manufacturing businesses are guilty of this exploitation. There are good Australian companies that do not deserve to be tarred with the same brush. However, the exploitation that I speak of is so insidious that even well-meaning businesses can be surprised to learn of the appalling workplace conditions that exist within their own supply chains. If the public of Australia had seen what I have seen, they would be outraged. But, as I said earlier, the workers in this industry are some of Australia's most vulnerable. Many of them feel unable to speak out for fear of reprisals. But there are two workers from this industry, Anh and Susan, who showed enormous courage last week and testified before the Education, Employment and Workplace Relations Committee of which I am chair. Speaking as part of the Textiles, Clothing and Footwear Union of Australia delegation, these brave women shared their stories in the hope that women such as themselves would no longer be subjected to blatant exploitation. I was deeply moved by their sincerity and modest hopes for the future, so much so that I wish to repeat some of the testimonies of Anh and Susan in the Senate chamber today for my fellow senators and fellow citizens to hear. This is Anh's testimony:


My husband passed away when my only daughter was four years old. I went to school to study and got an aged care certificate, but I could not find a job. So, because I needed to find money to raise my child, I had to learn sewing and became an outworker. I have been working for one employer for four years, but I have not got any entitlements. My employer pays me about $5 per hour. Whether I can make enough money or not depends on how difficult the job is. Sometimes I have to work day and night but I cannot make enough money because the work is so difficult to do. I virtually have to work 12 hours per day, including weekends. I do not have enough time for my daughter. I do not have enough time for myself. With the little money, not only do I need to spend very carefully on my living expenses but I also need to pay for other working expenses such as power, cotton, machine and other costs when the machinery is broken. My boss normally pays me two or three weeks after the delivery. If the work has any mistakes for any reason, I do not get paid until I have fixed all the orders. The employer wants me to show him my ABN before I can get the job. My life is so difficult. Sometimes I ask the boss for more money but he says he can't pay more. If I ask too much he would stop the work and give it to other people. I do not want to stop working or find another job because of my age. My daughter is in year 10 and I have to keep working to make money to raise her and pay for the rent.


I hope my work is more stable and I can make enough money for my living and have some rights and entitlements so I do not have to worry so much if my boss stops his work or makes me redundant.


I really want to have more time for my family, for myself and I really want to get rid of all the cash-in-hand people so I can have more work. Thank you very much.


Like Anh, Susan has a difficult life, but holds humble hopes that she might one day receive a fair day's pay for a fair day's work, the same as other Australians receive as a matter of course. She says:


In 2006 I discovered that my first son had autism. That was the time I started working from home. At the end of 2006 I gave birth to my second son and he also had the same problem as the first one. The reason I work from home is because I want to look after both of my two sons.


My husband left because he could not put up with his sons. My life is so difficult. Over the years I worked for different labels, different factories. They pay me by piecework. I estimate my pay to be about $4 an hour without any other entitlements. Recently some employers asked me to have an ABN number—to set up a company to have a propriety limited—and employ some other workers in my home. Since they know it is hard for me to get to work, they were able to convince me to get paid in cash, but the cash pay is much lower. I have to work from home but, because of the low pay, I have to work very long hours—between 12 and 15 hours per day without holiday pay or super or other entitlements. On one occasion my employer did not pay me for four months, which they blamed on the fact that the principal company had not paid them. After that, my employer said they would pay me a bit at a time until they caught up. I am working here in Australia where workers have entitlements and rights, but unfortunately I do not have those. I hope that I can get the same rights and entitlements as the workers in the factory.


My fellow senators, outworker exploita­tion in the textiles, clothing and footwear industry is the subject of a current inquiry, and I do not wish to pre-empt the findings of the committee. But I do ask you all to think about the words of Anh and Susan and to draw your own conclusions about whether we, as elected representatives of the Austra­lian people, are doing enough to protect people like Anh and Susan. I think there is little doubt about what the Australian public would make of Anh's and Susan's statements. I commend them once more for their courageous efforts to lift the garage door on sweatshop conditions and improve the life of their fellow workers.


This is not a problem that has just arisen. It is a problem that has been the subject of many, many inquiries of the Senate. Yet we as legislators have failed to act to prevent this exploitation that is happening in this rich country. That is a national disgrace for us. I hope that the proposed legislation that we are inquiring into at the moment will finally give rights for organisations such as the union FairWear and the Fair Work Australia inspectorate to have the power and the ability to end this sort of exploitation and ensure that these workers get at least minimum wages and minimum entitlements, that they are not bullied and held to ransom with the threat of work being taken away from them and that they have some dignity in life.It is a national disgrace. It is time that this parliament took the appropriate steps, moved the appropriate legislation to end this terrible exploitation that creates enormous suffering in our community—suffering that mostly goes unseen.I hope senators, when the legislation comes before us, will think long and hard about what sort of country we want and whether we think it is acceptable that just because these people are hidden from view that they should work in such appalling conditions for such miserable rates of pay and that we bring justice to them.

In addition to the human rights web portal project, the Commission is currently engaged in a project to develop social marketing tools to address cyber-bullying among 12-14 year olds. 


The Commission has engaged Edith Cowan University's (ECU) Child Health Promotion Research Centre. ECU has subcontracted Primary Communication, a social marketing company, to develop communication elements of the project.  


Phase 1 of the project was completed in October 2011. It involved:


conducting research to identify, and then report on, effective strategies for the target group to take positive bystander action when they witness cyber-bullying, including identification of the most effective messages for communicating bystander strategies and how to disseminate these through online and social marketing platforms


provide recommendations to the Commission on a social marketing campaign that encourages young people to take safe and effective action when they witness cyber-bullying.


Phase 2 of the project will last until mid-2012 and involves developing the social marketing tools and campaign, including prototypes and strategies for launch in 2012.
