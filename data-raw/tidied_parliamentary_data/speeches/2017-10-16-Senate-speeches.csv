Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (10:01):  Labor supports the Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2017 because, in principle, we support transparency in the operations of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection and the Australian Border Force, and of course that should also extend to the contractors who provide services to them. In particular, we have long called for greater transparency in the conduct of Australia's onshore detention centres and the offshore immigration processing centres. The bill does not directly concern those centres, of course, but it is important in the context of the operation of the department. This bill provides a clearer and narrower definition of information that is protected and what is protected from disclosure. It also clarifies people's capacity to disclose non-protected information, and it adds three new permitted purposes for which personal information can be disclosed under the Australian Border Force Act, to include intercountry adoptions, the protections of national security and the locations of missing persons. 


Existing secrecy and disclosure provisions in the act were adapted from the now repealed Customs Administration Act. Labor supported those provisions at the time but, since the act was passed, there has been some confusion about what information is protected and what information can be disclosed. Labor referred this bill to a Senate inquiry to allow stakeholders to have their say about its consequences. Submissions to that inquiry generally supported the narrowing of the kinds of information that should be protected. But submitters raised concerns about the provision in the bill, as it was originally drafted, which allowed the Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection to prescribe by legislative instrument additional information that could be protected from disclosure. Labor shared these concerns, and we are pleased that the bill was amended in the House of Representatives.


The amended bill now before the Senate gives the minister, not the secretary, the power to prescribe additional protected information by legislative instrument. The instrument is subject to disallowance, as it was in the original form of the bill. The amended bill is a great improvement on the original because the power to prescribe protected information should not rest with an unelected public servant; it is properly exercised by the minister, who can be held accountable by parliament. This was not the only concern for Labor in the original form of the bill. 


During the Senate inquiry into the bill, the chair, Senator Macdonald, said—and I don't often quote Senator Macdonald: 


I'm uncomfortable with the fact that public servants, albeit the highest public servant in the area, is making these legally binding rulings. I accept that if the minister did it he would do it on the advice of the secretary.


The power to add to protected information by legislative instrument exists to deal with unforeseen changes in circumstances. In response to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee report, the minister cited these examples of the information that might come under new powers: the internal tools for visa decisions that, if disclosed, could increase a person's prospect of being granted a visa for which they might not otherwise be eligible; or the internal procedures for assessing applications for Australia's trusted trader status under the Customs Act that, if disclosed, could lead to an entity receiving this status that otherwise might not have been given. The minister should always be willing to be held accountable and to justify any decisions to protect information from disclosure. The bill in its present form now makes that clear. 


I have had to say too many times in this chamber: there must be greater transparency in the administration of Australia's detention centres and Australian-funded offshore processing centres. The government's mismanagement of these offshore processing centres, particularly in regard to issues of welfare and garrison support have been subject to two scathing Australian National Audit Office reports. In September 2016, Labor initiated a Senate inquiry into allegations of serious abuse and neglect and instances of self-harm as outlined in the Nauru files, because the government had failed to act. Labor deplores the government's complete failure to act in the 3½ months since the inquiry's report and its recommendations. 


Manus Island and Nauru were set up as regional transit processing facilities but have become places of indefinite detention because the government has not found third-country resettlement options. It has in many ways, I think, placed great emphasis on a single agreement with a former US administration about which the present administration has been far from enthusiastic. Refugees should be removed from the offshore centres and resettled to third countries as soon as possible. Malcolm Turnbull and Peter Dutton need to get on with the job of making that happen, and Labor would support them in genuine attempts to do that, as we support this bill. 


While I'm on my feet, may I also draw attention to the commencement today of the full bench of the Fair Work Commission for its hearing into the pay dispute between the Department of Immigration and Border Protection and their staff. They're critical to the implementation of many of these measures before the chamber at the moment. The dispute has now been underway for four years, and during that time thousands of Immigration and Border Protection staff have had to fight tooth and nail, both in the Abbott and the Turnbull governments, over pay and conditions, while suffering real wage cuts. These are the people we look to to protect Australia's borders at sea, in airports and at ports. These are the people we look to maintain our visa system, to process citizenship applications and to protect Australians from the importation of dangerous and prohibited goods. They have a critical role to play. They've got a focal point on providing the security on which this country so depends. Yet they are subject to constant antiworker agendas by this government. We have had four years of that assault.


The government has sought to provide minimum pay rises for its own employees. It offered 3.4 per cent, which was rejected by 81 per cent of the department's workforce. In the various ballots that have been held the government clearly has not been able to maintain the support of its workforce. This is in the context where the most senior executives, who are on pay rates of well over $600,000 a year, are receiving pay rises well in excess of that that's being offered to the rest of the department. So four per cent is being offered to the most senior executives, but only 3.4 per cent to the other ranks. There seems to be a fundamental injustice in that disparity. Little wonder that this dispute has gone on for so long. It is important that the full bench of the Fair Work Commission are able to hear this matter, and I trust that they're able to do so in a speedy manner.


You would have thought that the government ought to be championing the rights of its employees instead of, in fact, doing exactly the opposite—maintaining this confrontational cost-cutting antiworker ideology. We rely heavily upon the public servants in the Department of Immigration and Border Protection to protect Australians, to provide us with safety and security. You would have thought that the least we could do was provide a proper basis for ensuring that they get at least the same remuneration and are treated on the same basis as the senior executives within the government department. If it's good enough to offer four per cent to the senior executive service and the secretary, surely it's good enough to offer the rest of the department the same rate.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2017-10-16,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (10:13):  The Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2017 revises the secrecy and disclosure provisions contained within the Australian Border Force Act 2015. The explanatory memorandum states:


This revision is necessary to clarify the policy intent and simplify the administration of the provisions.


The explanatory memorandum further states:


This Bill clarifies the policy and legislative intent, which is to protect certain information from unauthorised disclosure to prevent harm to national and public interests, while meeting the expectations of the Australian community of transparency and accountability within the Australian Government. This balance is needed to appropriately manage information disclosures and preserve public confidence in government.


While the Greens won't be opposing this bill, we believe that the explanation given by the government is complete and utter rubbish and demonstrably so.


It's worth going back through the history of these provisions. On 20 May 2015 the Australian parliament passed the Australian Border Force Act. This act came into force on 1 July 2015. Section 42 of that act provides that it's an offence for someone who is or has been an entrusted person to make a record of or disclose protected information. The maximum penalty for the offence is imprisonment for two years.


This provision—which still exists as we debate here today, with a minor amendment delivered by the government with regard to medical professionals—was designed by the government and supported by the Labor Party, for no other reason than to suppress the true horrors of what is happening on Manus Island and Nauru and inside Australia's onshore immigration detention regime. It was designed to have, and had, a chilling effect on freedom of speech in this country. It was designed to prevent people from speaking out about what they witnessed, including many people who had either a professional or a moral obligation to do so. The current section 42 is a draconian measure, designed, as I said, to keep secret the horrors of what is happening on Manus Island and Nauru and inside Australia's onshore detention regime.


When the act was introduced, many people working in detention centres and offshore processing centres raised concerns about its potential to undermine their capacity to do their jobs. They would basically be at risk of two years imprisonment for publicly expressing concerns. And, remember, those so-called freedom-of-speech warriors on the government side of this chamber—who purport to care about freedom of speech when in fact they're using that issue as another weapon in the ongoing culture wars in this country—all voted for section 42 as it currently stands.


When the act commenced in 2015, a group of doctors, nurses, teachers and other then-current and former detention centre workers on Nauru and Manus Island wrote an open letter to the then Prime Minister, Tony Abbott; to Minister Dutton; and to the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten. In part, this letter stated:


We have advocated, and will continue to advocate, for the health of those for whom we have a duty of care, despite the threats of imprisonment, because standing by and watching sub-standard and harmful care, child abuse and gross violations of human rights is not ethically justifiable.


If we witness child abuse in Australia we are legally obliged to report it to child protection authorities.


…   …   …


If we witness child abuse in detention centres, we can go to prison for attempting to advocate for them effectively.


The Australian Greens couldn't have put it any better ourselves.


This was a provision—and it remains in force today as we debate this amendment—that was designed with no other end in mind than to allow the government to continue its cover-up of what is happening, particularly on Manus Island and Nauru. It was designed to drape a cloak of secrecy over the horrors of indefinite offshore detention, a regime that is supported by every single member of this Senate from the Labor, Liberal and National parties. That's what it was designed to do, and you know what? To a large degree, it worked. I've spoken personally to a number of people who've been staff members on Manus Island and Nauru. I've spoken personally to people who worked in those places and who wanted to tell the truth about what they saw there. Some of them even took legal advice about what the implications would be if they spoke the truth about what they saw there. But they couldn't, because they were facing up to two years in prison for simply talking about the horrors that they witnessed. Section 42 as it currently stands is an absolute disgrace.


The concerns articulated in the open letter written by former detention centre workers on Nauru and Manus Island culminated in the filing of a constitutional challenge to some provisions of section 42 by Doctors for Refugees on 27 July last year. As I alluded to earlier, on 30 September 2016, the secretary of the Australian government Department of Immigration and Border Protection amended the determination in order to exclude health practitioners from the application of the secrecy provisions. I note that, even though the determination exempts health professionals, Doctors for Refugees have subsequently confirmed that the High Court proceedings are ongoing.


Here's the real reason that this amendment bill is before the parliament today: the government knows that it hasn't got a constitutional leg to stand on here. The government knows that it is going to lose in the High Court, and that's why the government has brought this amendment bill into the parliament. Nothing has actually changed since the Labor and Liberal parties supported the current provisions of section 42 of the Border Force Act. If the government expects this Senate to believe that it has suddenly had an attack of conscience, well, pull the other one—because we're not buying it. The reason this amendment bill has been brought in is that the government knows it's going to lose in the High Court. There is no other reason. And that's the reason for the retrospectivity elements contained in this legislation. I mean, pull the other one, Minister; it's got bells on it.


It's worth pointing out that, even though medical professions were exempted, other workers, including teachers, counsellors and social workers, are still caught by the current provisions. Many people have described the current section 42 as having a chilling effect, and they are absolutely right—as it was designed to do. Section 42 had a chilling effect on freedom of speech in this country and a chilling effect on our democracy. People felt that they were unable to speak out about what they witnessed on Manus Island, on Nauru and in onshore detention centres. The provisions contained in section 42 prevent people from making legitimate criticisms of government policy—a clear breach of the implied freedom of political communication contained in our Constitution. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights noted in a report that:


… in continuing to criminalise the disclosure of information, the secrecy provisions as amended by the Bill continue to engage and limit the right to freedom of expression. 


It's worth pointing out here that the current existence of section 42 is yet another example of why Australia needs a charter of rights.


We are the only Western democracy in the world without either a legislated charter of rights or a constitutionally embedded bill of rights. So we're the only Western democracy that does not protect the basic rights and the basic freedoms of its people either through legislation or in the Constitution. I have no doubt that, had we had a charter of rights when this section was brought in in 2015, we would not be in this place debating section 42 of the Border Force Act today.


In the many statements that were put forward by the right-wing culture warriors of this place—the self-anointed great defenders of freedom of speech—during the debate about whether we should repeal or amend the provisions of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, not one of those purported great defenders of freedom of speech mentioned section 42 of the Border Force Act. It simply was not advanced as an argument by them because, of course, to do so would not have suited their real agenda, which actually had nothing to do with freedom of speech and had everything to do with allowing their mates to use the 'N' word in public debate in this country. They didn't want the veil of secrecy over what is happening on Manus Island, on Nauru, on Christmas Island and in onshore detention centres lifted; they wanted it to stay in place.


It's worth recalling that Amnesty International reported in 2016:


The abuses on Nauru have been facilitated by the deliberate policy of secrecy, again established by the government of Australia ... This has had a chilling effect on disclosures about human rights abuses, and many service-providers and asylum seekers were too scared to speak with Amnesty International researchers.


There you go—that's why section 42 was in place: to stop people speaking out. The same report from Amnesty International said:


The conditions on Nauru—refugees' severe mental anguish, the intentional nature of the system, and the fact that the goal of offshore processing is to intimate or coerce people to achieve a specific outcome—amounts to torture.


That is, torture delivered by the Labor and Liberal parties in this place to thousands of people who've done nothing wrong. As we sit here today, the Australian government is waiting to hear whether we've been elected to the United Nations Human Rights Council—along with the Philippines, I might add, for those who are thinking that a seat on the Human Rights Council means the international community is in some way indicating that countries that have a seat there have a good human rights record. When Australia was lobbying for that seat, I wonder whether they mentioned that they were involved in torturing people who sought Australia's protection and would imprison, for up to two years, people who spoke out about it?


I was a member of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee that conducted an inquiry into serious allegations of abuse, self-harm and neglect of asylum seekers in relation to the Nauru and Manus Island processing centres. As I said during the course of that inquiry, I was contacted by many present and former staff on Manus Island and Nauru who wanted to raise their concerns and make submissions or speak to the inquiry. Without exception, they were in a range between apprehensive and bloody terrified about speaking to the inquiry because of section 42. It was only the comfort offered by parliamentary privilege that allowed some current and former staff to come forward and make submissions to that inquiry.


Michel Forst, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, referred, in his end of mission report in 2016, to the stifling Border Force Act. He further stated:


... the Act's existence and government actions aimed at censoring and intimidating advocates has had a chilling effect on the disclosure of information about violations in off-shore processing. And I have received evidence of significant consequences for [people who] blew the whistle. I met several doctors, teachers, lawyers and journalists, who either spoke out or covered conditions in offshore detention places and who have been under heavy surveillance.


In September 2015, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, Mr Francois Crepeau, announced that he would postpone his official visit to Australia due to 'the lack of full cooperation from the government regarding protection concerns and access to detention centres'. Mr Crepeau stated that he had sought a written guarantee from the government that no-one meeting with him during his visit would be at risk of any intimidation or sanctions under the Border Force Act and that this written assurance was not provided.


I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the former workers on Manus Island and Nauru who have gone public about the conditions and treatment of asylum seekers and refugees in those places. At great personal risk, they have spoken out and should be applauded for doing so. Make no mistake, section 42 of the Border Force Act delivered by the Labor and Liberal parties in Australia was deliberately designed to have a chilling effect on our democracy and a chilling effect on freedom of speech in this country, and to draw a veil of secrecy over the horrors of Australia's offshore and onshore detention system. It prevented many people from speaking out about what they'd witnessed, including many who had a professional or moral obligation to do so. So to everyone who stood up for transparency, to everyone who was prepared to risk imprisonment to speak the truth, to everyone who fought Labor and Liberal draconian measures, this is a win for you today. The terrible truth of what the Labor and Liberal parties have done to people on Manus Island and Nauru in the name of all Australians will come out eventually—that terrible truth—and then, finally, some of the wounds will begin to heal. Until then, we can be heartened that there are many, many Australians who will continue to fight tenaciously for this to happen.


Doctors for Refugees stated in evidence to the committee inquiry into this legislation that, while they welcome changes that limit the way the Australian Border Force Act impacts on workers who provide care and services to refugees and asylum seekers, their position remains that imposing criminal sanctions on people who speak out against conditions in detention has no place either in Australian democracy or in the provision of health care. Refugee Legal submitted that, even with the passage of the bill, the Australian Border Force Act will continue to have a 'chilling effect' on disclosures that may in fact be in the public interest.


As I've said, we won't be opposing this legislation, because it does somewhat improve section 42 of the Border Force Act. But I want it firmly on the record that we're still not happy with section 42, even if it is amended as proposed in this legislation, and we are still not happy with a range of other sections of the Border Force Act in this country.


I move the second reading amendment circulated in the chamber:


At the end of the motion, add:



""but the Senate notes the chilling effect that section 42 of the Australian Border Force Act 2015 has had on the immigration debate in Australia and condemns the Government and the Opposition for introducing and supporting the existing section.""

"Singh, Sen Lisa",ALP,2017-10-16,"



Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (10:33):  I welcome the Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2017 and the small step that it takes towards increasing transparency within Australia's offshore detention centres. I have, though, been very much appalled by the Turnbull government's lack of transparency and by its attempts to suppress whistleblowers and staff from highlighting significant concerns, instances of abuse, and the mistreatment of asylum seekers on Manus Island and in Nauru.


This bill will have the practical effect of narrowing the definition of information that is protected from disclosure. It removes the broad definition of 'protected information' and gives greater clarity as to what private information is actually protected. Labor, of course, supports this move for increasing transparency—which we have been calling on for such a long period of time—into Australia's onshore detention centres and offshore immigration processing or detention centres. This bill means that individuals who have been involved in Australia's offshore detention system as contractors or employees of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection, such as Save the Children workers, social workers, psychologists, doctors and lawyers, will be able to speak more freely about their experiences without fear of prosecution and without fear of up to two years imprisonment.


The Turnbull government's mismanagement of offshore processing centres and welfare and support contracts has been already the subject of two scathing reports by the Australian National Audit Office. Both reports have clearly shown that greater transparency was needed. I have been contacted over and over by people who are angry and upset—and rightly so—at the release of the Nauru files, where 26 former Save the Children workers on Manus Island and Nauru detailed what they saw and described as allegations of sexual assault and self-harm in the Nauru detention centre. This was towards women; it was towards children. It was an absolute and utter disgrace. One of the workers stated, 'You feel you can't talk about it, even though you know you should talk about it'. If it is not in the public interest to hear the experience from these workers of what is happening in our name, in Australia's name, in these offshore detention facilities, then I don't know what is. The files, which the government shrouded in secrecy, included reports of genital mutilation against young women, people sewing their lips shut, self-immolation, sexual violence, and gross mishandling of incidents by private contractors. That is what the government wanted to keep secret. That is what the government did not want the Australian public to know was happening.


In September 2016, off the back of the information and experiences detailed by these workers, Labor initiated a Senate inquiry to investigate these allegations of abuse, self-harm and neglect. The Turnbull government had failed to act. The government's total inaction for the past four months on the chair's conclusions and the recommendations from that Senate inquiry is extremely appalling. It is extremely disappointing. Part of our democracy is to inquire and investigate—through the parliament and through the Senate committee process—these government failings and issues. The government needs to respond to the recommendations in that report. It has failed so far to do so.


Let's remember that the Australian Border Force Act has previously been used by the Abbott government to attempt to prosecute Save the Children workers after they revealed serious allegations of abuse of women and children. Here are workers on the ground, contracted by government to do a job. When they experience and see firsthand what is going on in these government-funded, government-run immigration detention facilities, what does our government do? When the workers report these serious allegations of abuse of women and children, what does our government do? It attempts to prosecute them. These workers were removed from the island and referred to the Australian Federal Police—by Minister Morrison, the minister for immigration at that time—for allegedly breaching section 70 of the Crimes Act. I hope this amendment will mean that this can never happen again—that a non-government organisation, contracted by a government to do a job, that saw, in the course of their work, abuse being carried out, and that, instead of being able to report and be transparent and open about their work and their job and what they saw, were suppressed—and, in fact, threatened—by a government, which said, 'Well, you go ahead and do that and we will prosecute you.' That is an absolute disgrace. That is shameful. That is why Labor very much supports this amendment to ensure that this can never happen again. 


Beyond this bill there are other things that this issue raises. This is a government that has systematically maligned asylum seekers and refugees and mismanaged offshore processing on Manus Island and Nauru. Indeed, there has not been any processing for the last four years. No-one in this chamber, I am sure, can possibly believe that people who sought our asylum should still be on Manus Island and Nauru in these detention facilities some four years on. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection have sat on their hands for too long in failing to explore every possible alternative to asylum seekers being stuck and locked up on Manus Island and Nauru. So this bill is a good step in increasing transparency in our offshore detention system.


I was very pleased to hear earlier this year when the government finally agreed that it would ratify the optional protocol against torture, which also requires more monitoring and investigation of what goes on in Australia's prisons and detention facilities. But I think what has been very clear to me is that, whilst we have argued for this government to lift its game in this appalling policy area of immigration detention, we are not alone here. We stand here with the voice of our own communities. Indeed, my community in Tasmania has always been an extremely outspoken one when it comes to the issues of refugees and asylum seekers. I've received hundreds and hundreds of letters, protesting not only the conditions of Australia's offshore detention centres but also the secrecy that Australia's offshore detention regime has been shrouded in. That is why this government has been basically dragged kicking and screaming to bring this amendment forward today, to backflip on its original position—because of lobbying by civil society, by the Labor Party and by people in our community who have said that this cannot go on.


The issue of transparency and accountability in the work undertaken by these staff is critical to the trust and integrity that Australians have in our immigration and humanitarian programs. That is why this bill is so important, in that it tangibly means that individuals who've been involved in Australia's offshore detention system in any way—contractors, social workers, psychologists, departmental staff, doctors; you name it—will be able to speak more freely about their experiences and what they've seen with less fear of prosecution. 


In winding back the government's total suppression of so-called whistleblowers and staff speaking out on Australia's offshore detention regime, this bill is a good thing. It does highlight why independent monitoring is so important. The chairperson of the UN Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture, Sir Malcolm Evans, said:


This is why we think independent monitoring is so important—transparency is one of the greatest protections here. Where there's a lack of transparency, naturally there will be concerns things are not as they ought.


It pretty much is common sense. Hiding or shrouding a practice in secrecy means there must be something that the government wants to hide in the first place.


There have been a number of parts of civil society that have led to the government having to back down in its policy of secrecy, and I would like to acknowledge them. I would like to acknowledge the work of Save the Children in particular for originally speaking out; the work of Guardian Australia in the release of the Nauru files; the ongoing important work of the UNHCR; and, indeed, other parts of community and society, like Doctors for Refugees, the Refugee Council of Australia and so many other NGOs working every day to help rebuild the lives of refugees—people who have already suffered enough.


Finally, I would like to recognise that there is critical work going on not just in those particular facilities but also here in Australia for those who have been deemed refugees, have refugee status and have been able to settle. They are members of our community who work each day, who volunteer, to make sure that we as a country put humanity first and act humanely to ensure that people can rebuild their lives after fleeing persecution and after the suffering that they've endured.


I want Australia to be recognised as a welcoming, humane country for those people right now and also into the future. The only way that can happen is if this sad and sorry chapter of the last four years comes to an end for those who have been trapped on Manus Island and Nauru without any hope or any future in sight for settlement. It is a failure of this government that they have not settled these asylum seekers and refugees—shame on them. It's time that this ends. Let's hope this bill is only the beginning of that becoming a reality.

"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2017-10-16,"



Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (10:47):  I thank all senators for their contribution to the debate on the Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2017. Part 6 of the Australian Border Force Act 2015 regulates the protection and disclosure of information held by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection. The Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill amends part 6 and related provisions to clarify the original intent of the legislation, which is to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of information that could cause harm to the national or public interest.


The aim of the measures in this bill is to ensure that immigration and border protection information is not only provided with the necessary level of protection in a targeted manner but is also able to be disclosed when it is appropriate to do so. The bill provides assurances for the Australian public, business, government and foreign partners that sensitive information provided to the department will be appropriately protected.


The bill acknowledges the balancing of the competing interests of transparent, open and accountable government with the necessary interest of protecting information from disclosure which would lead to identifiable harm. The retrospective application of the bill, backdated to the enactment of the Australian Border Force Act 2015, will provide the necessary certainty that only information which could harm the national or public interest if disclosed is to be protected and will be regarded as ever having been protected under the Australian Border Force Act. With those comments, I commend the bill to the Senate.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Gallacher
):  The question is that the second reading amendment moved by Senator McKim be agreed to.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,2,1,speech
"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2017-10-16,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (10:57):  by leave—I move the amendments standing in my name on sheet 8251:


(1) Schedule 1, item 1, page 3 (lines 9 to 31), omit the definition of Immigration and Border Protection information, substitute:



Immigration and Border Protection information means information of any of the following kinds that was obtained by a person in the person's capacity as an entrusted person:


(a) information the disclosure of which would or is reasonably likely to damage the security (within the meaning of section 4 of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979), defence or international relations (within the meaning of section 10 of the National Security Information (Criminal and Civil Proceedings) Act 2004) of Australia;


(b) information the disclosure of which would or is reasonably likely to prejudice the prevention, detection or investigation of, or conduct of proceedings relating to, an offence or contravention of a civil penalty provision;


(c) information the disclosure of which would or is reasonably likely to prejudice the protection of public health, or endanger the life or safety of an individual or group of individuals;


(d) information the disclosure of which would or is reasonably likely to found an action by a person (other than the Commonwealth) for breach of a duty of confidence and is damaging to the regulatory function of the Department;


(e) information the disclosure of which would or is reasonably likely to cause competitive detriment to a person;


(f) information of a kind prescribed in an instrument under subsection (7).


Note: See also subsections (4) to (7).


(2) Schedule 1, item 5, page 4 (line 16) to page 5 (line 7), omit the item, substitute:




5


At the end of section


4



Add:


(5) Without limiting the definition of Immigration and Border Protection information in subsection (1), information that has originated with, or been received from an intelligence agency is taken to be information the disclosure of which would or is reasonably likely to prejudice the security, defence or international relations of Australia.


(6) Without limiting the definition of Immigration and Border Protection information in subsection (1), information that was provided to the Commonwealth pursuant to a statutory obligation or otherwise by compulsion in law is taken to be information the disclosure of which would or is reasonably likely to found an action by a person (other than the Commonwealth) for breach of duty of confidence.


The amendments proposed reflect the recommendations made by the Australian Human Rights Commission and the Law Council of Australia in their submissions to the inquiry into this bill. The recommendations from the Australian Human Rights Commission aim to advance the bill's stated objective and enhance the bill's compatibility with human rights. The unauthorised disclosure of information under section 42 of the Australian Border Force Act carries a penalty of up to two years imprisonment. The Australian Human Rights Commission submitted that, given the adverse consequences associated with a criminal conviction, criminal penalties should only attach to the unauthorised disclosure when it harms essential public interests. 


The term 'would or could reasonably be expected to' potentially criminalises the disclosure of information where there is a reasonable possibility but not the reasonable likelihood of prejudice. Using prejudice broadens the application to include disclosures that disadvantage rather than harm or damage. Prejudice could be about protecting the reputation of the department rather than causing any actual damage to the department. There are multiple definitions of 'security' in federal legislation, and security is not confined to the Australian Border Force Act. For clarity and consistency, the definition of security in the ASIO Act describes security in specific terms. The term 'international relations' is also undefined. Using the definition in the National Security Information (Criminal and Civil Proceedings) Act 2004 would lessen the chance that unauthorised disclosures that simply embarrass the government without causing any real damage would fall outside the scope of the offence.


In relation to the duty of confidence: the Australian Human Rights Commission submitted that there must be compelling justification to support secrecy provisions that criminalise the unauthorised disclosure of information that is not reasonably likely to harm essential public interests. While it's accepted that people and companies will provide sensitive information that they expect the department to keep confidential, the provision as currently drafted is too broad. The Australian Law Reform Commission stated:


The category of information protected should be narrowly defined, so that the secrecy provision is not so wide as to cover information that would not harm the regulatory functions of the agency.


Competitive detriment is, once again, an extremely broad provision. Civil law remedies such as contractual, common law and equitable remedies are available to address the problem of improper disclosure of commercial information. Extending criminal liability to the unauthorised disclosure of information that would or could cause competitive detriment is inappropriate.


The Australian Human Rights Commission considers that the deeming of information with a security classification as information requiring protection—without any consideration of the context of the information or whether it has been correctly classified—is a blanket provision that unduly restricts freedom of expression, political communication and legitimate public scrutiny.


So there you have it. The Greens are attempting to improve this legislation, to narrow the scope of what can be determined to be protected information. We are doing so in order to lessen the effect on freedom of communication that the Australian Border Force Act will have, even should the amendments currently before the Senate be passed.

Senator CASH
 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (11:02):  The government will not be supporting the Australian Greens amendment. The government considers that its proposed definition of immigration and border protection information strikes the correct balance between transparent, open and accountable government and protecting information from disclosure that would lead to identifiable harm. The explanatory memorandum provides a clear outline of what is covered by security, defence and international relations in the context of the bill. Therefore, there is no need to refer to other legislation to define these terms.


I do note that the government has given effect to the recommendation of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. Mr Temporary Chair Leyonhjelm, you'd be aware that the committee made one recommendation, and that the government accepted that recommendation, such that the minister will now have the power to prescribe additional kinds of immigration and border protection information instead of the secretary, as had been originally drafted.


With those comments, I reiterate that we will not be supporting the Australian Greens amendment.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (11:04):  The opposition will not be supporting these amendments. The amendments that have been moved by the Greens do not come with the support of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee's inquiry into the bill. As I understand it, the essential difference that is being proposed here is that the Human Rights Commission suggested the bill be amended to delete the words:


… would or could reasonably be expected to prejudice the security, defence or international relations of Australia


and to replace those words with, 'reasonably likely to damage the security defence or international relations'. We have a difference from 'prejudice' to 'damage', so there is a fine difference. Upon legal advice, the opposition has taken the view that the proposition in the bill stands, and we support that notion.


Consistent with a number of submissions that were made to the Senate inquiry, we welcome the legislation for what it does in narrowing the scope of information that would be protected and offering greater clarity about the types of information that could be publicly disclosed. That included support from the Refugee Advice and Casework Service and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. Dr Joyce Chia from the Refugee Council of Australia provided testimony to the public hearing of the Senate inquiry, stating:


Like others who have made submissions, we believe this is a welcome and long-overdue bill …


Labor support the bill before the Senate as it stands because we support the additional transparency and accountability that will be provided. It is important to clarify any real or perceived confusion about whether or not the information is actually protected. Labor agrees that people should have the right to disclose non-sensitive information where appropriate and where required. This is crucial to the trust and integrity that Australians have in our immigration and humanitarian programs. We'll continue to hold the government to account on these matters, particularly in regard to its failure in the management of Australia's offshore processing arrangements. The amendments the Greens are proposing do not change people's capacity to disclose non-protected information, so Labor will be opposing this amendment.

Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (10:01):  Labor supports the Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2017 because, in principle, we support transparency in the operations of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection and the Australian Border Force, and of course that should also extend to the contractors who provide services to them. In particular, we have long called for greater transparency in the conduct of Australia's onshore detention centres and the offshore immigration processing centres. The bill does not directly concern those centres, of course, but it is important in the context of the operation of the department. This bill provides a clearer and narrower definition of information that is protected and what is protected from disclosure. It also clarifies people's capacity to disclose non-protected information, and it adds three new permitted purposes for which personal information can be disclosed under the Australian Border Force Act, to include intercountry adoptions, the protections of national security and the locations of missing persons. 


Existing secrecy and disclosure provisions in the act were adapted from the now repealed Customs Administration Act. Labor supported those provisions at the time but, since the act was passed, there has been some confusion about what information is protected and what information can be disclosed. Labor referred this bill to a Senate inquiry to allow stakeholders to have their say about its consequences. Submissions to that inquiry generally supported the narrowing of the kinds of information that should be protected. But submitters raised concerns about the provision in the bill, as it was originally drafted, which allowed the Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection to prescribe by legislative instrument additional information that could be protected from disclosure. Labor shared these concerns, and we are pleased that the bill was amended in the House of Representatives.


The amended bill now before the Senate gives the minister, not the secretary, the power to prescribe additional protected information by legislative instrument. The instrument is subject to disallowance, as it was in the original form of the bill. The amended bill is a great improvement on the original because the power to prescribe protected information should not rest with an unelected public servant; it is properly exercised by the minister, who can be held accountable by parliament. This was not the only concern for Labor in the original form of the bill. 


During the Senate inquiry into the bill, the chair, Senator Macdonald, said—and I don't often quote Senator Macdonald: 


I'm uncomfortable with the fact that public servants, albeit the highest public servant in the area, is making these legally binding rulings. I accept that if the minister did it he would do it on the advice of the secretary.


The power to add to protected information by legislative instrument exists to deal with unforeseen changes in circumstances. In response to the Scrutiny of Bills Committee report, the minister cited these examples of the information that might come under new powers: the internal tools for visa decisions that, if disclosed, could increase a person's prospect of being granted a visa for which they might not otherwise be eligible; or the internal procedures for assessing applications for Australia's trusted trader status under the Customs Act that, if disclosed, could lead to an entity receiving this status that otherwise might not have been given. The minister should always be willing to be held accountable and to justify any decisions to protect information from disclosure. The bill in its present form now makes that clear. 


I have had to say too many times in this chamber: there must be greater transparency in the administration of Australia's detention centres and Australian-funded offshore processing centres. The government's mismanagement of these offshore processing centres, particularly in regard to issues of welfare and garrison support have been subject to two scathing Australian National Audit Office reports. In September 2016, Labor initiated a Senate inquiry into allegations of serious abuse and neglect and instances of self-harm as outlined in the Nauru files, because the government had failed to act. Labor deplores the government's complete failure to act in the 3½ months since the inquiry's report and its recommendations. 


Manus Island and Nauru were set up as regional transit processing facilities but have become places of indefinite detention because the government has not found third-country resettlement options. It has in many ways, I think, placed great emphasis on a single agreement with a former US administration about which the present administration has been far from enthusiastic. Refugees should be removed from the offshore centres and resettled to third countries as soon as possible. Malcolm Turnbull and Peter Dutton need to get on with the job of making that happen, and Labor would support them in genuine attempts to do that, as we support this bill. 


While I'm on my feet, may I also draw attention to the commencement today of the full bench of the Fair Work Commission for its hearing into the pay dispute between the Department of Immigration and Border Protection and their staff. They're critical to the implementation of many of these measures before the chamber at the moment. The dispute has now been underway for four years, and during that time thousands of Immigration and Border Protection staff have had to fight tooth and nail, both in the Abbott and the Turnbull governments, over pay and conditions, while suffering real wage cuts. These are the people we look to to protect Australia's borders at sea, in airports and at ports. These are the people we look to maintain our visa system, to process citizenship applications and to protect Australians from the importation of dangerous and prohibited goods. They have a critical role to play. They've got a focal point on providing the security on which this country so depends. Yet they are subject to constant antiworker agendas by this government. We have had four years of that assault.


The government has sought to provide minimum pay rises for its own employees. It offered 3.4 per cent, which was rejected by 81 per cent of the department's workforce. In the various ballots that have been held the government clearly has not been able to maintain the support of its workforce. This is in the context where the most senior executives, who are on pay rates of well over $600,000 a year, are receiving pay rises well in excess of that that's being offered to the rest of the department. So four per cent is being offered to the most senior executives, but only 3.4 per cent to the other ranks. There seems to be a fundamental injustice in that disparity. Little wonder that this dispute has gone on for so long. It is important that the full bench of the Fair Work Commission are able to hear this matter, and I trust that they're able to do so in a speedy manner.


You would have thought that the government ought to be championing the rights of its employees instead of, in fact, doing exactly the opposite—maintaining this confrontational cost-cutting antiworker ideology. We rely heavily upon the public servants in the Department of Immigration and Border Protection to protect Australians, to provide us with safety and security. You would have thought that the least we could do was provide a proper basis for ensuring that they get at least the same remuneration and are treated on the same basis as the senior executives within the government department. If it's good enough to offer four per cent to the senior executive service and the secretary, surely it's good enough to offer the rest of the department the same rate.

"McKim, Sen Nicholas",AG,2017-10-16,"



Senator McKIM
 (Tasmania) (10:13):  The Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2017 revises the secrecy and disclosure provisions contained within the Australian Border Force Act 2015. The explanatory memorandum states:


This revision is necessary to clarify the policy intent and simplify the administration of the provisions.


The explanatory memorandum further states:


This Bill clarifies the policy and legislative intent, which is to protect certain information from unauthorised disclosure to prevent harm to national and public interests, while meeting the expectations of the Australian community of transparency and accountability within the Australian Government. This balance is needed to appropriately manage information disclosures and preserve public confidence in government.


While the Greens won't be opposing this bill, we believe that the explanation given by the government is complete and utter rubbish and demonstrably so.


It's worth going back through the history of these provisions. On 20 May 2015 the Australian parliament passed the Australian Border Force Act. This act came into force on 1 July 2015. Section 42 of that act provides that it's an offence for someone who is or has been an entrusted person to make a record of or disclose protected information. The maximum penalty for the offence is imprisonment for two years.


This provision—which still exists as we debate here today, with a minor amendment delivered by the government with regard to medical professionals—was designed by the government and supported by the Labor Party, for no other reason than to suppress the true horrors of what is happening on Manus Island and Nauru and inside Australia's onshore immigration detention regime. It was designed to have, and had, a chilling effect on freedom of speech in this country. It was designed to prevent people from speaking out about what they witnessed, including many people who had either a professional or a moral obligation to do so. The current section 42 is a draconian measure, designed, as I said, to keep secret the horrors of what is happening on Manus Island and Nauru and inside Australia's onshore detention regime.


When the act was introduced, many people working in detention centres and offshore processing centres raised concerns about its potential to undermine their capacity to do their jobs. They would basically be at risk of two years imprisonment for publicly expressing concerns. And, remember, those so-called freedom-of-speech warriors on the government side of this chamber—who purport to care about freedom of speech when in fact they're using that issue as another weapon in the ongoing culture wars in this country—all voted for section 42 as it currently stands.


When the act commenced in 2015, a group of doctors, nurses, teachers and other then-current and former detention centre workers on Nauru and Manus Island wrote an open letter to the then Prime Minister, Tony Abbott; to Minister Dutton; and to the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Shorten. In part, this letter stated:


We have advocated, and will continue to advocate, for the health of those for whom we have a duty of care, despite the threats of imprisonment, because standing by and watching sub-standard and harmful care, child abuse and gross violations of human rights is not ethically justifiable.


If we witness child abuse in Australia we are legally obliged to report it to child protection authorities.


…   …   …


If we witness child abuse in detention centres, we can go to prison for attempting to advocate for them effectively.


The Australian Greens couldn't have put it any better ourselves.


This was a provision—and it remains in force today as we debate this amendment—that was designed with no other end in mind than to allow the government to continue its cover-up of what is happening, particularly on Manus Island and Nauru. It was designed to drape a cloak of secrecy over the horrors of indefinite offshore detention, a regime that is supported by every single member of this Senate from the Labor, Liberal and National parties. That's what it was designed to do, and you know what? To a large degree, it worked. I've spoken personally to a number of people who've been staff members on Manus Island and Nauru. I've spoken personally to people who worked in those places and who wanted to tell the truth about what they saw there. Some of them even took legal advice about what the implications would be if they spoke the truth about what they saw there. But they couldn't, because they were facing up to two years in prison for simply talking about the horrors that they witnessed. Section 42 as it currently stands is an absolute disgrace.


The concerns articulated in the open letter written by former detention centre workers on Nauru and Manus Island culminated in the filing of a constitutional challenge to some provisions of section 42 by Doctors for Refugees on 27 July last year. As I alluded to earlier, on 30 September 2016, the secretary of the Australian government Department of Immigration and Border Protection amended the determination in order to exclude health practitioners from the application of the secrecy provisions. I note that, even though the determination exempts health professionals, Doctors for Refugees have subsequently confirmed that the High Court proceedings are ongoing.


Here's the real reason that this amendment bill is before the parliament today: the government knows that it hasn't got a constitutional leg to stand on here. The government knows that it is going to lose in the High Court, and that's why the government has brought this amendment bill into the parliament. Nothing has actually changed since the Labor and Liberal parties supported the current provisions of section 42 of the Border Force Act. If the government expects this Senate to believe that it has suddenly had an attack of conscience, well, pull the other one—because we're not buying it. The reason this amendment bill has been brought in is that the government knows it's going to lose in the High Court. There is no other reason. And that's the reason for the retrospectivity elements contained in this legislation. I mean, pull the other one, Minister; it's got bells on it.


It's worth pointing out that, even though medical professions were exempted, other workers, including teachers, counsellors and social workers, are still caught by the current provisions. Many people have described the current section 42 as having a chilling effect, and they are absolutely right—as it was designed to do. Section 42 had a chilling effect on freedom of speech in this country and a chilling effect on our democracy. People felt that they were unable to speak out about what they witnessed on Manus Island, on Nauru and in onshore detention centres. The provisions contained in section 42 prevent people from making legitimate criticisms of government policy—a clear breach of the implied freedom of political communication contained in our Constitution. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights noted in a report that:


… in continuing to criminalise the disclosure of information, the secrecy provisions as amended by the Bill continue to engage and limit the right to freedom of expression. 


It's worth pointing out here that the current existence of section 42 is yet another example of why Australia needs a charter of rights.


We are the only Western democracy in the world without either a legislated charter of rights or a constitutionally embedded bill of rights. So we're the only Western democracy that does not protect the basic rights and the basic freedoms of its people either through legislation or in the Constitution. I have no doubt that, had we had a charter of rights when this section was brought in in 2015, we would not be in this place debating section 42 of the Border Force Act today.


In the many statements that were put forward by the right-wing culture warriors of this place—the self-anointed great defenders of freedom of speech—during the debate about whether we should repeal or amend the provisions of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, not one of those purported great defenders of freedom of speech mentioned section 42 of the Border Force Act. It simply was not advanced as an argument by them because, of course, to do so would not have suited their real agenda, which actually had nothing to do with freedom of speech and had everything to do with allowing their mates to use the 'N' word in public debate in this country. They didn't want the veil of secrecy over what is happening on Manus Island, on Nauru, on Christmas Island and in onshore detention centres lifted; they wanted it to stay in place.


It's worth recalling that Amnesty International reported in 2016:


The abuses on Nauru have been facilitated by the deliberate policy of secrecy, again established by the government of Australia ... This has had a chilling effect on disclosures about human rights abuses, and many service-providers and asylum seekers were too scared to speak with Amnesty International researchers.


There you go—that's why section 42 was in place: to stop people speaking out. The same report from Amnesty International said:


The conditions on Nauru—refugees' severe mental anguish, the intentional nature of the system, and the fact that the goal of offshore processing is to intimate or coerce people to achieve a specific outcome—amounts to torture.


That is, torture delivered by the Labor and Liberal parties in this place to thousands of people who've done nothing wrong. As we sit here today, the Australian government is waiting to hear whether we've been elected to the United Nations Human Rights Council—along with the Philippines, I might add, for those who are thinking that a seat on the Human Rights Council means the international community is in some way indicating that countries that have a seat there have a good human rights record. When Australia was lobbying for that seat, I wonder whether they mentioned that they were involved in torturing people who sought Australia's protection and would imprison, for up to two years, people who spoke out about it?


I was a member of the Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee that conducted an inquiry into serious allegations of abuse, self-harm and neglect of asylum seekers in relation to the Nauru and Manus Island processing centres. As I said during the course of that inquiry, I was contacted by many present and former staff on Manus Island and Nauru who wanted to raise their concerns and make submissions or speak to the inquiry. Without exception, they were in a range between apprehensive and bloody terrified about speaking to the inquiry because of section 42. It was only the comfort offered by parliamentary privilege that allowed some current and former staff to come forward and make submissions to that inquiry.


Michel Forst, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights defenders, referred, in his end of mission report in 2016, to the stifling Border Force Act. He further stated:


... the Act's existence and government actions aimed at censoring and intimidating advocates has had a chilling effect on the disclosure of information about violations in off-shore processing. And I have received evidence of significant consequences for [people who] blew the whistle. I met several doctors, teachers, lawyers and journalists, who either spoke out or covered conditions in offshore detention places and who have been under heavy surveillance.


In September 2015, the United Nations Special Rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, Mr Francois Crepeau, announced that he would postpone his official visit to Australia due to 'the lack of full cooperation from the government regarding protection concerns and access to detention centres'. Mr Crepeau stated that he had sought a written guarantee from the government that no-one meeting with him during his visit would be at risk of any intimidation or sanctions under the Border Force Act and that this written assurance was not provided.


I would like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the former workers on Manus Island and Nauru who have gone public about the conditions and treatment of asylum seekers and refugees in those places. At great personal risk, they have spoken out and should be applauded for doing so. Make no mistake, section 42 of the Border Force Act delivered by the Labor and Liberal parties in Australia was deliberately designed to have a chilling effect on our democracy and a chilling effect on freedom of speech in this country, and to draw a veil of secrecy over the horrors of Australia's offshore and onshore detention system. It prevented many people from speaking out about what they'd witnessed, including many who had a professional or moral obligation to do so. So to everyone who stood up for transparency, to everyone who was prepared to risk imprisonment to speak the truth, to everyone who fought Labor and Liberal draconian measures, this is a win for you today. The terrible truth of what the Labor and Liberal parties have done to people on Manus Island and Nauru in the name of all Australians will come out eventually—that terrible truth—and then, finally, some of the wounds will begin to heal. Until then, we can be heartened that there are many, many Australians who will continue to fight tenaciously for this to happen.


Doctors for Refugees stated in evidence to the committee inquiry into this legislation that, while they welcome changes that limit the way the Australian Border Force Act impacts on workers who provide care and services to refugees and asylum seekers, their position remains that imposing criminal sanctions on people who speak out against conditions in detention has no place either in Australian democracy or in the provision of health care. Refugee Legal submitted that, even with the passage of the bill, the Australian Border Force Act will continue to have a 'chilling effect' on disclosures that may in fact be in the public interest.


As I've said, we won't be opposing this legislation, because it does somewhat improve section 42 of the Border Force Act. But I want it firmly on the record that we're still not happy with section 42, even if it is amended as proposed in this legislation, and we are still not happy with a range of other sections of the Border Force Act in this country.


I move the second reading amendment circulated in the chamber:


At the end of the motion, add:



""but the Senate notes the chilling effect that section 42 of the Australian Border Force Act 2015 has had on the immigration debate in Australia and condemns the Government and the Opposition for introducing and supporting the existing section.""

Senator SINGH
 (Tasmania) (10:33):  I welcome the Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2017 and the small step that it takes towards increasing transparency within Australia's offshore detention centres. I have, though, been very much appalled by the Turnbull government's lack of transparency and by its attempts to suppress whistleblowers and staff from highlighting significant concerns, instances of abuse, and the mistreatment of asylum seekers on Manus Island and in Nauru.


This bill will have the practical effect of narrowing the definition of information that is protected from disclosure. It removes the broad definition of 'protected information' and gives greater clarity as to what private information is actually protected. Labor, of course, supports this move for increasing transparency—which we have been calling on for such a long period of time—into Australia's onshore detention centres and offshore immigration processing or detention centres. This bill means that individuals who have been involved in Australia's offshore detention system as contractors or employees of the Department of Immigration and Border Protection, such as Save the Children workers, social workers, psychologists, doctors and lawyers, will be able to speak more freely about their experiences without fear of prosecution and without fear of up to two years imprisonment.


The Turnbull government's mismanagement of offshore processing centres and welfare and support contracts has been already the subject of two scathing reports by the Australian National Audit Office. Both reports have clearly shown that greater transparency was needed. I have been contacted over and over by people who are angry and upset—and rightly so—at the release of the Nauru files, where 26 former Save the Children workers on Manus Island and Nauru detailed what they saw and described as allegations of sexual assault and self-harm in the Nauru detention centre. This was towards women; it was towards children. It was an absolute and utter disgrace. One of the workers stated, 'You feel you can't talk about it, even though you know you should talk about it'. If it is not in the public interest to hear the experience from these workers of what is happening in our name, in Australia's name, in these offshore detention facilities, then I don't know what is. The files, which the government shrouded in secrecy, included reports of genital mutilation against young women, people sewing their lips shut, self-immolation, sexual violence, and gross mishandling of incidents by private contractors. That is what the government wanted to keep secret. That is what the government did not want the Australian public to know was happening.


In September 2016, off the back of the information and experiences detailed by these workers, Labor initiated a Senate inquiry to investigate these allegations of abuse, self-harm and neglect. The Turnbull government had failed to act. The government's total inaction for the past four months on the chair's conclusions and the recommendations from that Senate inquiry is extremely appalling. It is extremely disappointing. Part of our democracy is to inquire and investigate—through the parliament and through the Senate committee process—these government failings and issues. The government needs to respond to the recommendations in that report. It has failed so far to do so.


Let's remember that the Australian Border Force Act has previously been used by the Abbott government to attempt to prosecute Save the Children workers after they revealed serious allegations of abuse of women and children. Here are workers on the ground, contracted by government to do a job. When they experience and see firsthand what is going on in these government-funded, government-run immigration detention facilities, what does our government do? When the workers report these serious allegations of abuse of women and children, what does our government do? It attempts to prosecute them. These workers were removed from the island and referred to the Australian Federal Police—by Minister Morrison, the minister for immigration at that time—for allegedly breaching section 70 of the Crimes Act. I hope this amendment will mean that this can never happen again—that a non-government organisation, contracted by a government to do a job, that saw, in the course of their work, abuse being carried out, and that, instead of being able to report and be transparent and open about their work and their job and what they saw, were suppressed—and, in fact, threatened—by a government, which said, 'Well, you go ahead and do that and we will prosecute you.' That is an absolute disgrace. That is shameful. That is why Labor very much supports this amendment to ensure that this can never happen again. 


Beyond this bill there are other things that this issue raises. This is a government that has systematically maligned asylum seekers and refugees and mismanaged offshore processing on Manus Island and Nauru. Indeed, there has not been any processing for the last four years. No-one in this chamber, I am sure, can possibly believe that people who sought our asylum should still be on Manus Island and Nauru in these detention facilities some four years on. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Immigration and Border Protection have sat on their hands for too long in failing to explore every possible alternative to asylum seekers being stuck and locked up on Manus Island and Nauru. So this bill is a good step in increasing transparency in our offshore detention system.


I was very pleased to hear earlier this year when the government finally agreed that it would ratify the optional protocol against torture, which also requires more monitoring and investigation of what goes on in Australia's prisons and detention facilities. But I think what has been very clear to me is that, whilst we have argued for this government to lift its game in this appalling policy area of immigration detention, we are not alone here. We stand here with the voice of our own communities. Indeed, my community in Tasmania has always been an extremely outspoken one when it comes to the issues of refugees and asylum seekers. I've received hundreds and hundreds of letters, protesting not only the conditions of Australia's offshore detention centres but also the secrecy that Australia's offshore detention regime has been shrouded in. That is why this government has been basically dragged kicking and screaming to bring this amendment forward today, to backflip on its original position—because of lobbying by civil society, by the Labor Party and by people in our community who have said that this cannot go on.


The issue of transparency and accountability in the work undertaken by these staff is critical to the trust and integrity that Australians have in our immigration and humanitarian programs. That is why this bill is so important, in that it tangibly means that individuals who've been involved in Australia's offshore detention system in any way—contractors, social workers, psychologists, departmental staff, doctors; you name it—will be able to speak more freely about their experiences and what they've seen with less fear of prosecution. 


In winding back the government's total suppression of so-called whistleblowers and staff speaking out on Australia's offshore detention regime, this bill is a good thing. It does highlight why independent monitoring is so important. The chairperson of the UN Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture, Sir Malcolm Evans, said:


This is why we think independent monitoring is so important—transparency is one of the greatest protections here. Where there's a lack of transparency, naturally there will be concerns things are not as they ought.


It pretty much is common sense. Hiding or shrouding a practice in secrecy means there must be something that the government wants to hide in the first place.


There have been a number of parts of civil society that have led to the government having to back down in its policy of secrecy, and I would like to acknowledge them. I would like to acknowledge the work of Save the Children in particular for originally speaking out; the work of Guardian Australia in the release of the Nauru files; the ongoing important work of the UNHCR; and, indeed, other parts of community and society, like Doctors for Refugees, the Refugee Council of Australia and so many other NGOs working every day to help rebuild the lives of refugees—people who have already suffered enough.


Finally, I would like to recognise that there is critical work going on not just in those particular facilities but also here in Australia for those who have been deemed refugees, have refugee status and have been able to settle. They are members of our community who work each day, who volunteer, to make sure that we as a country put humanity first and act humanely to ensure that people can rebuild their lives after fleeing persecution and after the suffering that they've endured.


I want Australia to be recognised as a welcoming, humane country for those people right now and also into the future. The only way that can happen is if this sad and sorry chapter of the last four years comes to an end for those who have been trapped on Manus Island and Nauru without any hope or any future in sight for settlement. It is a failure of this government that they have not settled these asylum seekers and refugees—shame on them. It's time that this ends. Let's hope this bill is only the beginning of that becoming a reality.

 (Western Australia—Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service, Minister for Employment and Minister for Women) (10:47):  I thank all senators for their contribution to the debate on the Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill 2017. Part 6 of the Australian Border Force Act 2015 regulates the protection and disclosure of information held by the Department of Immigration and Border Protection. The Australian Border Force Amendment (Protected Information) Bill amends part 6 and related provisions to clarify the original intent of the legislation, which is to prevent the unauthorised disclosure of information that could cause harm to the national or public interest.


The aim of the measures in this bill is to ensure that immigration and border protection information is not only provided with the necessary level of protection in a targeted manner but is also able to be disclosed when it is appropriate to do so. The bill provides assurances for the Australian public, business, government and foreign partners that sensitive information provided to the department will be appropriately protected.


The bill acknowledges the balancing of the competing interests of transparent, open and accountable government with the necessary interest of protecting information from disclosure which would lead to identifiable harm. The retrospective application of the bill, backdated to the enactment of the Australian Border Force Act 2015, will provide the necessary certainty that only information which could harm the national or public interest if disclosed is to be protected and will be regarded as ever having been protected under the Australian Border Force Act. With those comments, I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (14:00):  My question is to the Minister representing the Prime Minister, Senator Brandis. Following the release of the Finkel review, the Prime Minister sold the clean energy target, telling Australians that it had 'very strong virtues' and a lot of merit and would certainly work. Does the Prime Minister stand by these statements?

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (14:01):  Senator Moore, the Prime Minister stands by everything he said. And, in particular, what the Prime Minister stands by is a commitment to the Australian people that, as a result of the policies of this government, electricity will be more affordable and more reliable than it ever would be under a Labor government. It is interesting that some statistics were published this morning by the ACCC that indicate that, in the last decade, electricity prices rose by 63 per cent—63 per cent. Almost the entirety of that increase occurred during the period of the Labor government, on Mr Rudd's watch and Ms Gillard's watch.




Senator Kim Carr:
  Rubbish! Rubbish!




Senator BRANDIS:
  And, if you look at the charts, Senator Carr, that the ACCC has produced, that will demonstrate that to be the case. So we're not going to be taking any lectures from the Australian Labor Party or dinosaurs like you, Senator Carr, about keeping electricity prices low. We're not going to be taking any lectures about electricity pricing from the party which, in the state of South Australia, has presided over the most catastrophic policies of any state in the Commonwealth—a state government, under the leadership of the Labor Premier, Mr Weatherill, that cannot keep the lights on. And the reason for that is: you are wedded to ideology and we are not, Senator Carr. We are wedded to pragmatism; we are wedded to good economics; we are wedded to decent engineering solutions, because the Australian people will always know that electricity prices will be lower and supply will be more reliable under a coalition government than it ever would be under a Labor government. If anyone ever had any doubt about that proposition, just look at South Australia.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (14:03):  Senator Moore, I assume you are referring to some observations that Mr Abbott made during a lecture to a think tank in London last week. I haven't actually read Mr Abbott's speech, but I've seen reports of his remarks, and I actually saw some extracts from his speech on the Insiders program yesterday morning. He made some interesting anthropological observations about people sacrificing goats to volcanoes or something like that, and I note what Mr Abbott had to say. Mr Abbott is entitled to his views. But, Senator Moore, life is too short to read everything that all of one's political colleagues may have to say, no matter how interesting they may be. But you may rest assured, Senator Moore, that the views of the Australian government are the views of the Prime Minister and his cabinet, not the views of a backbencher.

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (14:04):  We are focused on outcomes. And the outcome on which we are focused is the suite of policies that will make energy prices—and, in particular, domestic electricity prices—more affordable and electricity supply more reliable. That is what we are focused on. And, as you know, we have had a discussion within the government. We have considered a variety of points of view, but we will be focused with laser-like focus on two things and two things only: how to make electricity prices more affordable and how to make electricity supply more reliable.


What we don't want to do, and will not do, is see Australia repeat the catastrophe that the Labor government has wrought upon the people of South Australia, where the Labor Party cannot even keep the lights on. We're not going to have that outcome in other states. We will be settling on a suite of policies that makes power more affordable and supply more reliable.

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (14:06):  I thank Senator Duniam for his question and for his particular interest in relation to the importance of gas and gas supply in the Australian energy market, which is of course so critical to the operation of many manufacturing businesses as well as to households and businesses across Australia insofar as they impact on electricity prices.


Indeed, wholesale gas prices make up an estimated 15 to 30 per cent of total residential gas bills and household gas bills. These increase with increases in those prices flowing through the market—some five per cent per $2 per gigajoule increase in New South Wales, for example, according to the ACCC. That's why it's important, and that's why the Turnbull government has taken action to ensure that the supply-and-demand imbalance that appeared to be emerging in the Australian gas market is being rectified.


The Prime Minister has secured agreement with the heads of the three big east coast gas companies to ensure that there is sufficient gas supply to meet the projected shortfall in the Australian market and to ensure that there is sufficient gas supply to guarantee that in the future Australian consumers, be they businesses or households, have the gas to meet their needs. Indeed, the commitment from gas companies will see an estimated 54 to 108 additional petajoules of gas come into the Australian gas market. This is incredibly significant because, if you look at gas usage in a regional town, such as Warrnambool or Wollongong, or at a major industrial manufacturer, they would use just one petajoule per annum. The action we are taking is guaranteeing many times that—between some 54 and 108 additional petajoules entering the market.




Senator Cameron:
  At what cost?




Senator BIRMINGHAM:
  'At what cost?' Senator Cameron says. Well, what we've seen is that the spot price for gas has come down thanks to the Turnbull government's actions. It's down around $12 a gigajoule now to some $8 a gigajoule. That is significant movement down, and as more supply comes into the market we're confident that it will further drive down prices for Australians. (Time expired)

Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (14:08):  I can. Indeed, the report released today by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission—their preliminary report into retail electricity pricing—demonstrates very clearly that the largest impacts in terms of household and business energy bills, and the largest growth impact on those bills over the last decade, have been related to network costs. I am very pleased that shortly before question time this chamber passed the Turnbull government's legislation to abolish the limited merits review process that the network operators had been gaming. They had been gaming it to the tune of some $6½ billion of extra costs that had been fed into the Australian electricity system because of the abuse of the limited merits review process. It was the Turnbull government which took the action—despite opposition from some states and despite delaying tactics by the Labor Party—to abolish this, which can have some of the most significant impacts on keeping prices down into the future.

 (South Australia—Minister for Education and Training) (14:10):  We're taking action across every step of the supply chain. In terms of generation, we're taking action to make sure that new dispatchable sources that can bring prices down when it matters, such as pumped hydro, come online in future years. In terms of the networks, which I just spoke about, we have taken action through the abolition of the limited merits review process, delivering, of course, a system that will ensure network operators can no longer game the system. In terms of the retail sphere, we have taken action to guarantee that retailers offer the best deal to consumers and that consumers—around two million households around the country—will be better able to access those best deals around retail opportunities. Also, as the ACCC report highlights, as a coalition government we took the action to abolish the carbon tax, putting real downward movement in electricity prices at the time, as well as making reforms in relation to the Renewable Energy Target to make sure that it was achievable and affordable for the future rather than the exaggerated target that was in place.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2017-10-16,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (15:07):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Attorney-General (Senator Brandis) to questions asked by Senators Moore and Carr today relating to energy policy.


Today in question time, Senator Brandis was asked a question concerning the outgoing BlueScope CEO, Mr Paul O'Malley, who last week told his company's AGM that BlueScope's electricity costs would rise by 93 per cent between 2016 and 2018. And I further asked the minister could he confirm that, after four years of Liberal National government, power prices have never been higher. The minister indicated in response he could not confirm either proposition. Can I perhaps draw the minister's attention to page 13 of the ACCC report, which the government has provided to every newspaper in the country today, which clearly indicates that the electricity prices in this country are at their highest level ever this year.


I might also indicate that the outgoing CEO of BlueScope, Mr Paul O'Malley, in fact, did tell his AGM last week that the price for BlueScope's electricity costs are expected to rise by 93 per cent. And I also draw to the chamber's attention that the government's favourite newspaper, The Australian, has been provided with modelling which suggests that when gas prices are used the wholesale price of electricity spikes from $70 a megawatt upwards to $120 a megawatt, a cost that is ultimately passed on to consumers. So what we're seeing in this country is that Australia's largest energy users have been warning us that an estimated $9 billion in additional electricity and gas costs will feed through to the broader economy, threatening jobs and investments as business drives the pressures on Canberra to ease what has been a predicted power shortage.


Now, the major companies, including brickmakers, supermarkets, soft drink bottlers and poultry producers, have all indicated that they are feeling the great pressures of the rise in energy prices right now, and that over the next two years these pressures will only grow because of the government's failure to recognise its role in terms of developing a coherent energy policy. Now, the surge in energy prices has forced businesses to defer investment decisions, with some of them actually thinking that they might have to move abroad. So we see the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry—people who are not normally associated with supporting Labor—and Mr James Pearson making this point repeatedly. We see:


We risk a double effect with energy prices hitting investment decisions, affecting demand for labour while also putting pressure on margins impacting the affordability of wage rises.


Mr Pearson said that recently.


What we've got is the Prime Minister saying that he's prepared to meet with the gas companies. He has, of course, met with them on several occasions now—he's had a good cup of tea with them. Instead of relying upon taking action, he has relied upon their good intentions to actually produce more gas for the Australian economy. And rather than taking action, we find the situation now in the spot price market that gas remains cheaper in Tokyo than it does in Australia—despite the claims made by the gas producers.


What we do know is that the market domination by the energy generators is such now that we have 40 per cent price hikes—of course, doubling the increases that were announced in June. We see the situation in New South Wales—the Liberal state of New South Wales—with the Small Business Commissioner yesterday warning that power prices were rising far more than the expected 20 per cent surge. So what we've got is a government that has commissioned the Chief Scientist to come forward with a report to put a political fix in place. And this government has been offered the support across this parliament to put in place a national policy that will actually provide the investment certainty to secure downward price pressures. But it is a government that can't negotiate with itself, let alone negotiate across this parliament. What we've got is a government that is paralysed: paralysed by indecision and paralysed by fear—fear that this Prime Minister will be deposed by the knuckle draggers on the far right of the Liberal Party. They are now dominating the policy positions of this government rather than the national interest. Rather than a preoccupation with getting the national interest set into a policy framework, this is a government preoccupied with its own survival. (Time expired)

Senator SESELJA
 (Australian Capital Territory—Assistant Minister for Social Services and Multicultural Affairs) (15:13):  It's always good to follow Senator Carr—




Senator Kim Carr:
  I'm sure you love it! You just love it!




Senator SESELJA:
  I do! I love it, because I love it when he fires up. The louder he is, often the less sense he makes.


Can I go to the substance of the issue? If we cast our minds back to last summer when we saw the statewide blackout in South Australia, I think that there was great shock around the nation that a whole Australian state could actually be blacked out. I was reminded, as I contemplated it, of the Greens politician who said, 'We don't want to take you back to the caves just yet,' because that is the type of policy that Labor under Bill Shorten—and certainly Labor under Jay Weatherill—have been implementing. It is a policy that is about taking our nation backwards. It is a policy that is about de-industrialising Australia due to an absolutely mindless energy policy—which is now the national Labor policy—where we see the mindless pursuit of a 50 per cent renewable energy target in South Australia. That is Bill Shorten's policy and I'll get to the—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Seselja, I remind you to refer to people by their—




Senator SESELJA:
  Thank you. That is Mr Shorten's policy—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Seselja, let me finish, please. I remind you to refer to people in the other place by their correct titles.




Senator SESELJA:
  Indeed. Referring to Mr Shorten by his correct title, unfortunately, does not improve his policies at all. It does not improve the fact that the 50 per cent Renewable Energy Target, the 45 per cent emissions reduction target and the policies for forced closures of coal-fired power plants will take us back as a nation to a place where we don't want to be. They will take the South Australian blackout model and put that on a national stage.


We were asked about electricity prices. Let's look at what they were under the Labor Party when they were last in government, because we know that if they come back it's going to be worse. But this is what happened when they were in coalition with the Greens last time. We saw national average residential electricity prices increasing by an average of 10.3 per cent a year between 2009-10 and 2013-14. We saw the average price increase from 19.4c to 28.6c per kilowatt hour. Then, of course, due to the repeal of the carbon tax, we saw residential electricity prices fall between 2013-14 and 2015-16. So, if you look at the policy decisions that have been taken by the coalition government, things like repealing the carbon tax, they lead to a reduction in price. As we see, the policy decisions that were taken by the former Labor government, including a carbon tax, saw massive increases in electricity prices across the board.


The alternative couldn't be clearer. The coalition policy is about gas reservation policy, abolishes limited merits review, has Snowy Hydro 2.0, and seeks to work with power companies to keep coal-fired power stations open longer so that we can get the kind of base load that we need, that our industries need, that workers in this country need and that householders need in order to keep prices down—or we could go to the alternative model that has been put forward by Mr Bill Shorten, the Leader of the Opposition, and the Australian Labor Party nationally. Their policy is the South Australian Labor policy, which has seen statewide blackouts and sees South Australia having the highest energy prices in the nation. Mr Bill Shorten wants to take that policy nationally with a 50 per cent renewable energy target. There is no modelling as to what that might cost. Fancy an alternative Prime Minister going to the Australian people and saying, 'Look, we've got this you-beaut new policy; it's been tried in South Australia, it's led to the highest energy prices in the country and it's led to statewide blackouts and South Australia becoming the butt of national jokes as a result of its energy policies'! Mr Bill Shorten is saying, without telling us how much it's going to cost, that he wants to make that policy national. Well, we can guarantee one thing: it's going to cost a lot. It's going to push prices up. It's going to see more blackouts. It's going to see less energy security. This is the policy platform being put forward by the ALP, and we will certainly not be matching it. (Time expired)

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2017-10-16,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (15:18):  I too rise to take note of the answers by Senator Brandis to the questions from Senator Moore and Senator Carr during question time today. Senator Seselja has got on that familiar high horse and is attempting to kick South Australia, but people really need to understand the situation in South Australia. In 1997, it was the Liberal Premier John Olsen who went to an election promising not to privatise the Electricity Trust of South Australia. He promised. He got elected, and in 1998 he privatised it. Straight in, breaking his election promise to the South Australian people, he privatised the Electricity Trust of South Australia. With 20-20 hindsight, we know it was an incredibly dud deal. To get the highest price he possibly could, he rejected Riverlink, which would have connected South Australia with New South Wales. He rejected that for short-term financial gain for his Liberal government, and that has cost South Australians $1 billion to $2 billion in increased prices. That's the reality of the situation in South Australia. The South Australian Liberal government promised not to privatise and then privatised and sold us a dud into the future, guaranteeing that the new owners would roll in cash and that we weren't properly connected to the National Electricity Market. Those are the actual facts of the matter.


There was a one-in-50-years storm which knocked over kilometres of lines and pylons and caused a lot of blackouts in South Australia. But what happened? What happened is that the National Electricity Market encourages major operators to sit out of the market so the price goes from $30 or $50 a megawatt-hour to $10,000. I can prove this. Snowy Hydro, the only supplier in the nation that has been fined by the regulator for sitting out of the market or failing to follow the instruction of the regulator, was fined $400,000 for breaching the rules. And guess what? It's owned by the federal government, the New South Wales government and the Victorian government. And it's quite clear: in its original statement of claim, the regulator stated Snowy Hydro deliberately ignored dispatch instructions so it could take advantage of an unforeseen and unforecast increase in demand. That's the electricity market that we have.


When there is a demand like was occasioned by this storm in South Australia, does the regulator come in and put everybody on the board? There are allegations that a gas power station in South Australia deliberately waited until there was a blackout so it could make more money. This is the market we have got. It's not about wind. It's not about solar. It's about a broken electricity market which encourages major operators to sit out of the market until there's an unforeseen event or an unforeseen demand and the price goes from $30 a megawatt-hour or $50 a megawatt-hour to $10,000. That great icon of Australia, the Snowy Mountains Scheme, sitting up there paid for by generations of taxpayers, works at 14 per cent of capacity. It has turbines that can connect to the grid in 90 seconds. Are they doing that on a regular basis? No, they're sitting there waiting for a spike in demand caused by an unfortunate event like a weather outage or a seasonal demand of electricity for air conditioning. They're not contributing in an even flow. Fourteen per cent of capacity—check their annual report. To add insult to injury, an entity owned by the federal government, New South Wales government and the Victorian government has been fined for not following the regulator's requirements.


So it's not fair for Senator Brandis to come in here and say: 'The South Australian government made wrong decisions about wind and solar. The South Australian government has made the wrong decisions about clean energy.' Have a look at the real problem: there is generating capacity in Australia that is not contributing on an even basis. You sit out of the market until there's an event and you profit as much as you can. And the Liberals brought it in. (Time expired)

"Williams, Sen John",Nats,2017-10-16,"



Senator WILLIAMS
 (New South Wales—Nationals Whip in the Senate) (15:23):  Senator Gallacher was quite amazing! What happened to Port Augusta? The renewable energy target was taken to 20 per cent and some 44,000 gigs by the Rudd Labor government, Senator Gallacher. One turbine at Jamestown, where I grew up, gets a $700,000-a-year subsidy for renewable energy certificates. At $82, it spins for eight hours a day at three megawatt-hours. That is $700,000 for a wind turbine before they sell one watt of electricity, so it allows them to sell it cheaply. Yes, the national market is crazy, but why did the Port Augusta coal-fired power station go broke? It was because of the wind turbines and the huge subsidies that everyone is paying for when they pay their power bill.


What amazes me is that the Labor Party and the Greens are on about the clean energy target. I refer to Dr Finkel's recommendation of 42 per cent. You see, the reason the Labor Party and the Greens want a clean energy target that's high is that it means they can drop their carbon tax come the next election. That's what it's all about. If there's not a large clean energy target—and I hope there's not because the cost is too outrageous for business and will shift businesses overseas—the Labor Party will go to the next election saying, 'We'll fix energy; we'll fix the environment; we'll bring in a carbon tax.' It's quite amazing. The whole story of how the Greens are going to block the Adani mine is amazing. There are 621 units of coal-fired power generation being constructed around the world, as I speak now. A unit is one generator. There are 299 units of coal-fired generation being constructed in China now to add to their 2,107 units already operating. Those 299 units of coal-fired generation being constructed in China now will produce 670 million tonnes of CO2. All emissions in Australia total about 550 million tonnes, but let's not sell them clean Australian coal—oh, no, block the coalmines!


The Greens and the Labor Party must realise these coal-fired generators being constructed are going to burn—what? Believe it or not, they're going to burn coal. They're trying to block Australia from providing that coal, so China will use their dirty brown coal, which they're actually a net exporter of, and then buy dirty brown coal off Indonesia. If the Labor Party and the Greens have their way, China won't buy Australia's clean coal from Adani. They won't buy black coal, which is more effective, produces more heat and, hence, produces more electricity. No, we should shut all the mines down here. It's beyond me why the CFMEU donate to the Labor Party—and they've donated to the Greens before as well, by the way. Why have they donated to a party that does not support mining, construction, forestry or energy? Apparently, we're going to change the planet. While everyone's building these coal-fired power generators, we're not going to supply them coal. Of course they're going to get coal from elsewhere. Are we going to change the 1.4 per cent of the world's CO2 that Australia emits? No. It is a green religion that will lead us to the land of poverty. That's what it'll do. The costs are already going up. 


A 50 per cent clean energy target is being pursued in Victoria and South Australia, where I grew up—how embarrassing it is. A new battery is going to be built at Jamestown, where I grew up and where my great-great-grandfather settled in the 1800s. The battery will run the state for about 4½ minutes. When things shut down there will be no coal-fired generation—the Hazelwood power station is gone—and South Australia will, once again, become the darkened state. The amazing cost of electricity down there is outrageous. What will we do then? We'll close businesses down in Australia and shift manufacturing businesses overseas, just like we've done in the motor vehicle industry. There are clean energy targets, renewable energy targets, carbon taxes, costs et cetera. You have General Motors America shutting Holden down, Ford America shutting Ford Australia down and Toyota Japan shutting Toyota down and you wonder why.


In this country we wallow in energy, whether it is nuclear, coal or gas, yet we're paying some of the most expensive energy prices of all the OECD countries. What's Labor's solution? It is a 50 per cent clean energy target, a carbon tax and more of the South Australian treatment. It's more of what you've done to the state of South Australia. You've put the costs through the roof and kept the subsidies going. Renewable energy is a good thing and it goes on for a long time, but if renewables want to grow in Australia they must compete on a level playing field, not be paid $700,000 for one wind tower a year. Pensioners and businesses are paying—everyone's paying. This can't go on and we need to change the whole attitude. A 42 per cent clean energy target would also be hugely expensive.

Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:28):  Back on 1 February, the Prime Minister stood up in the National Press Club and he said that energy would be the defining debate in this parliament. Well, it has been the defining debate, although, probably not quite in the way that Mr Turnbull might have hoped because it is, in fact, the debate around energy that has completely and, I suspect, fatally defined Mr Turnbull. It's defined him as a leader who has completely lost control of his party and is unable to act on rational policy advice, whether it is received from academics, from our professional scientists or from the business community. Mr Turnbull is paralysed in relation to the energy debate because he is beholden to the people in his party who are determined to act against all rationality. They are determined to continue to insist that the future of energy in this country lies in coal, when, in fact, what everybody tells us is that all that is required is a certain investment framework and industry will do the rest. But a policy that will do that, like the clean energy target that was proposed by Mr Finkel and that was until very recently endorsed by the Minister for Energy, can't stand up because in the coalition party room people have the gravity-defying belief that our future lies in new coal-fired power generation.


There hasn't been much action this year—no action on energy, despite the fact that this is a crisis that's engulfing business and it's engulfing households. What we have had are a lot of reports. We've had reports from the AEMC, we've had reports from AEMO and we've had a report from Mr Finkel. And today, of course, we had a report from the ACCC. Well, I've looked carefully at that report today and I'll tell you what it does contain: it contains a lot of stories about the impact that rising prices are having on businesses. Today, we asked the minister about BlueScope. The report says that BlueScope has achieved $300 million in cost savings across their Australian steel operations in the last couple of years, and that's an extraordinary result. But, despite that, they are faced with a near doubling of their electricity costs since 2016.


Now, all of the bluster in the world can't sheet that home to Labor. Last time I looked, in 2016 the coalition was in power. Companies like BlueScope are faced with a genuine crisis in the cost inputs to their businesses. What you also won't find in that report is the assertion made again and again by Senator Brandis that the drivers of these cost increases are environmental costs, because that's not what the report says at all. The report says that the drivers of these costs are network costs. It actually found that in terms of the entire cost of electricity, environmental related costs make up only seven per cent of the cost that people are paying. And, in that context, this argument that if we could only get rid of our environmental commitments we'd have cheap electricity is ludicrous. The key components of the cost increases have not been associated with environmental schemes.


We'd do much better, in fact, to rely on Mr Frydenberg, the Minister for the Environment and Energy—plagued of course by being constantly undermined by the hardliners in the coalition. Fairly recently, Mr Frydenberg made a presentation to the coalition party room and he indicated that he endorsed the Finkel review's conclusions that there would be a 10 per cent saving for households against business as usual if we implemented a clean energy target. He provided the other conclusion that Finkel came up with through his modelling, which was that there would be a 16 per cent reduction in costs against business as usual for business if we implemented a clean energy target.


The truth is that everybody in industry knows this to be true. All that is required is some policy certainty, a policy that links together our objectives around energy, our objectives around environment and our objectives around competition in that market. But we have been waiting for four years. This government is in its fifth year; there has been no action and it is principally because the Prime Minister has his hands tied behind his back.

"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2017-10-16,"



Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (15:44):  I rise to speak on this issue today, and it's an important issue because we know that right here in this place there is a member of this Senate, Senator Pauline Hanson, who has suggested that young people aged between 18 and 21 should not be allowed to vote. She's said it several times. She said it on national television only two weeks ago. She was given an opportunity to clarify, and she doubled down. Senator Pauline Hanson thinks that young people do not deserve the right to vote. She wants to strip Australians aged 18, 19 and 20 of their right to vote, a right they currently have. That's almost a million young people that Senator Hanson believes don't deserve to have their say, apparently because, in her own words, they don't have jobs, they don't pay taxes and they know nothing about politics. What a load of rubbish! In Australia, of course, you can be working long before you're aged 21. You can get married. You can run a business. You can even sit in the federal parliament currently, and, of course, you can even serve in the Australian Defence Force. It is just unthinkable that Senator Pauline Hanson would suggest that young people don't have a right to have their say.


If it came down to the arguments that Senator Hanson has put out as to why young people shouldn't have a right to vote—she says they're not informed enough to vote and they lack experience, knowledge or intelligence—I tell you what: I wonder what Senator Pauline Hanson would do being right here. She would be the first out the door if it came to having to be informed about the issues that we debate in this place—and quickly after her, may I point out, Senator Malcolm Roberts as well, and probably the rest of her merry, silly men.


The truth is young people are engaged in politics. They desperately want to have their say, and they have every right to. Just in the last couple of months, we've seen almost 100,000 young people sign up to the electoral roll so that they could have their say in the marriage equality postal survey. The majority are voting yes. The question is: why would Senator Hanson want to strip these young people of their right to have their say? Well, it's just like how One Nation want to gag and cut funding to the ABC because they don't like what the ABC reports, and so it follows. One Nation don't like what young people think, what they care about and how they vote. Because they don't like it, they don't want them to have their say.


Once this issue was made public, once Senator Pauline Hanson and One Nation confirmed they didn't think young people should have the right to vote, the phones in electorate offices ran hot, letters to the editor were typed out and the social media frenzy was on. Young people across this country are outraged that they risk having their right to vote taken from them.


You might think this is some fringe, crazy idea, but, of course, One Nation sit in this chamber and negotiate day in, day out with the government. They say all the time, 'We want to get our policy through.' They demand concessions from the government. They wanted to cut the ABC. They wanted to beat up on the ABC and the public broadcasters. Now look what's happened: the government have rolled over for them.


So we can't be complacent. Young people have every right to feel terrified and angry that Senator Pauline Hanson and One Nation want to disenfranchise them come the next election. It is simply unfair that we live in a nation where we could send somebody to war, where we sign young people up to be in the Defence Force, and yet we have a senator in this parliament who says those same young people don't deserve a right to have their say in a democracy.


It is just mean-spirited, pathetic and gutless that One Nation would say these young people don't deserve their right to have their say because One Nation don't think that young people vote for their political party. Well, guess what: not every person in Australia believes and agrees with what the Greens say, not everybody agrees with and believes in what the government says and not everybody agrees with what any political party in this place says, but that doesn't mean they don't have a right to have their say and a right to cast their vote. It is a democracy.


At a time when we should be encouraging more people to participate, particularly young people, it is just gutless and pathetic to have a leader of a political party in this place suggest that over a million current voters should have their vote stripped from them. The arguments for it are that they don't have a job; they don't pay taxes; they don't have any idea of what's going on. Okay, we all know that that's rubbish and not true, but who comes next then?


Once One Nation have stripped the rights for young people to vote, who will they come after next? Will it be Muslim Australians? Asian Australians? If it's about not paying taxes, will it be people on the disability pension? We heard Senator Malcolm Roberts say earlier today that he thinks that people on welfare live better than kings did 200 years ago. Are we going to start taking the right for people to vote away from those who are on welfare benefits?




Senator Dastyari:
  Let them eat cake!




Senator HANSON-YOUNG:
  Is it simply: no vote, but let them eat cake? Are these the bright ideas coming from the One Nation political party? You don't like what people say and you don't like how they vote, so you're going to gag them, disenfranchise them and ban them from the electoral roll. It's pathetic, but it's dangerous. Senator Pauline Hanson and One Nation are no friends of young Australians.

"Paterson, Sen James",LP,2017-10-16,"



Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (15:51):  I find myself in an interesting position in this debate, in the middle of two equally silly propositions. On one side we have One Nation, which is very naively and ridiculously proposing to disenfranchise young people by removing their right to vote—to turn back the clock more than 40 years and take away the rights of about a million Australians to vote. That is obviously a ridiculous and silly proposition and, I'll say from the outset, not one that the government endorses or will entertain or will enact.


But equally, on the other side of the coin, we have, in my view, an equally silly notion from the Greens that we should lower the voting age to include 16- and 17-year-olds. I only came in halfway through Senator Hanson-Young's contribution, so I'm not sure if she referred to it in this speech—she certainly didn't in the second half of her speech—but it's an idea that the Greens have promoted in the past that we should lower the voting age to include 16- and 17-year-olds.


We're smack bang in the middle of this debate. On the government benches we believe that, if it ain't broke, don't fix it. The existing voting age of 18 years makes eminent good sense. There is no need to increase it or lower it. There's no need to disenfranchise young people who already have the vote. To be honest, these ideas are so silly I think I'm going to seriously struggle to fill the 10 minutes that I've been allocated in this debate, but I will do my very best, and there are some important issues that can be discussed here.


As we all know, it's outlined in the Commonwealth Electoral Act that 18 years is the age at which you become entitled to vote. This issue was examined after the 2007 federal election when the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters discussed what the appropriate minimum age should be for provisional enrolment. They did recommend that the minimum age for voluntary provisional enrolment be lowered from 17 to 16 years but did not recommend lowering the voting age.


We believe that 18 is the right and appropriate age and should remain the legal age, because it is the age at which you are considered an adult in so many other areas of life. It is the age at which you are allowed to legally purchase alcohol. You're allowed to legally gamble. You're allowed to become a company director or to sign a contract. It's an age where, if you wish to enlist in military service, you are most commonly first allowed to do so. These are very important decisions in someone's life, and we recognise that at 18 years of age you've amassed sufficient life experience, skills and knowledge to exercise those. It was last changed in 1973 to lower the age to 18, and we don't think that there's any need to revisit that.


My experience when I talk to young people—being a younger person myself—is that the age at which they have a right to vote is not their No. 1 concern. There are certainly plenty of precocious 16- and 17-year-olds—as I was once, as I know Senator McGrath was once, as I know Senator Dastyari was once, not all that long ago—that are very excited and anticipating their right to vote for the first time when they turn 18 and can't wait to have their say. None of them have seriously suggested to me that we should lower the voting or age or have lobbied seriously to do that. What they do approach me about is the issues that impact them. They're more interested in the way government impacts on their lives and the policies that government has that impact their lives than in the process and the detail of how it does so.


When I talk to young people, what I hear from them most consistently is concern about their economic future and a desire to know that, when they graduate from high school or university or any other study that they do, there will be a good job for them to find that they will be able to apply for and receive. They tell me about their concern about their ability to enter the housing market and their ability to pay off a mortgage. They are worried about housing affordability. They raise that with me consistently. They also raise with me the amount of debt that current generations are leaving to future generations.


I make these observations not in any partisan sense. These have always been the concerns of young people. I suspect they always will be the concerns of young people. If we are, in all seriousness, interested in addressing the things most important to young people, we would be much better advised to focus on these practical, real things that impact their lives.


That's why I'm proud to be part of a government that has a very strong focus on providing jobs and a strong performance in providing jobs. In the last 12 months 300,000 jobs were created, which is a remarkable achievement and which will ensure that young people finishing study and looking to enter the workforce for the first time have something to look forward to, a bright economic future to be excited about and something to apply for and strive for.


On housing, we all acknowledge that housing affordability is not good in this day and age. Young people do struggle with it, and my friends and people in my age group are chief amongst those who struggle with it. That's something this government takes very seriously and is addressing. One of the measures in the most recent federal budget was the First Home Super Saver Scheme, which allows young people to utilise the tax-preferred superannuation system to save for a deposit for their first home. This will allow them to save for a deposit more quickly and more easily than they otherwise would have been able to.


On debt, I noticed in the financial statement issued by the finance minister last week that gross debt is now at $560 billion. That's more than anyone in this place should be comfortable with and more than anyone in this place should want. It is something that we should all be working much harder to address and to lower. It is not moral at all to leave young people growing up today with the burdens of debt that this generation has accrued by spending more on consumption today than we have been raising in revenue to meet the costs of. There is nothing moral about that at all. It's something that needs, in my view, far stronger action to address. It's certainly something this government has attempted to address. Had it not been for our attempts, the state of the budget and state of debt would have been far worse today than they are. We've been able to significantly bring down the trajectory of debt increases that were bequeathed by the former government. We've managed to rein that in substantially, and we should be very proud of that, but that doesn't mean that there isn't more work to do.


It is incumbent on this chamber in particular to consider its role in assisting the government to do that. In recent years, many attempts the government has made to reduce spending in order to reduce the deficit and ultimately to begin paying back the debt and reducing the debt within our lifetimes have been thwarted by this chamber or, more accurately, by parties who used their numbers in this chamber to stop the government's attempts. I think they should reflect on that when they come into this place and say that they're here to be advocates on behalf of young people and young people's interests. They should think very carefully about the votes they have made in this place in recent years which have gone very much against the interests of young people who will soon, when they do graduate and take on jobs, begin to pay back not just the expenses of running the government of the day in their lifetimes but the expenses of running the government of our day in our lifetimes because we weren't able to do so. That's a profoundly immoral thing.


To re-emphasise, the government has no plans to lower or increase the age of voting. We think it's a distraction. We think it's unnecessary. We think we should be focused on much more practical and pragmatic issues that are on the top of the minds of most young people—particularly those who don't follow politics every day, who don't watch question time every day and who don't follow us on Twitter but who just want to get on with their lives. They're much more interested—




Senator Dastyari:
  Whoa!




Senator PATERSON:
  It's a hard concept to wrap your head around, Senator Dastyari! I know you in particular would be mortified to know there are young people who haven't seen one of your Facebook videos, but it's true. They are out there, and they're not particularly interested in your videos or my videos or in the voting age. What they are interested in is the economic security they hope to have when they grow up and the economic security they hope to have for their children when they eventually have them. It's worth pointing out the delicious irony, when we hear about the higher rates of engagement of young people with the marriage survey and, of course, the record enrolment of all people—but particularly young people—on the electoral roll as a result of the marriage survey, that those things came about due to a policy staunchly opposed by those opposite and those on the crossbench. In a funny way, young people have been motivated more by participating in this survey than any normal election, than any normal choice between political leaders, because it is an issue that affects them and their friends and they want to have their say on it. I encourage them and congratulate them for doing so.


The government will not be engaging in any consideration of this, recognising that it is, of course, really an attempt from One Nation to play to their base and the Greens to play to their base, when it's incumbent on parties of government to be sensible on these issues and not change things that don't need changing.

"Dastyari, Sen Sam",ALP,2017-10-16,"



Senator DASTYARI
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (16:01):  I think it's incumbent upon me to begin by addressing the slanderous, offensive and hurtful comments of Senator Paterson moments earlier, when he seemed to say that there are young Australians out there who aren't interested in the social media videos of Australian politicians! I think the senator should take some time to reflect on those comments and perhaps give a personal explanation later in the chamber!


The ridiculousness of the proposition that we're going to actually look at increasing the voting age in this era is a demonstration of how obscenely out of touch One Nation are with a generation of future voting Australians. Not only are their views on issues like climate change clearly out of the ordinary, not only do their views on issues like marriage equality and other matters set them apart from young Australians, but they go so far as to try to disenfranchise them from participating in the political process. I have a different view than my party has on the issue of voting age. I have consistently had a different view from the Labor Party. And, of my many failures in Australian politics and certainly in Labor politics, one of them has been my inability to convince the Labor Party to lower the voting age from 18 to 16. It's a position I have had for a long period of time, it's one I have argued in party circles and it is one for which I have consistently lost every senior party vote that I've tried to win.


But I live in faith and I live in hope. I do believe there is a generation of young Australians that should be enfranchised, a generation of young Australians that can be enfranchised, and I'm sick and tired of this idea that we hear in politics a lot: that young people are not interested in politics or not interested in this and that. I think Senator Paterson was correct when he made the point that they may not be interested in organised politics as we know it but are certainly engaged on issues. They're certainly engaged on issues that matter to them. Have a look at the amount of energy and excitement involved in the postal survey, a survey that many of us believe shouldn't happen and doesn't need to happen. We kept hearing reports that young people weren't going to vote, that they weren't going to participate, that they weren't going to show up, and every bit of anecdotal and empirical evidence—that's right, empirical evidence—that we have available to us shows that they do care, they are interested and they want to engage.


Housing affordability is an issue across Australia. In particular it's an issue in our capital cities. Within our capital cities, perhaps in Sydney more than anywhere else, it is a huge issue. It is another issue where a generation of young Australians does care, is passionate and is interested. The notion that we will change our voting age in this vibrant, successful democracy for the sole purpose of disenfranchising more people is a ridiculous assertion. Frankly, I'd like to one day be in a position where we could be voting to lower it rather than to increase it.


On the issue of lowering it, I want to make one observation on the record. I note that, in cases like the Scottish independence referendum and at other times, there have been trials where different nations have been looking at 16- and 17-year-olds participating in the democratic process. I note that there is a slight misconception that younger voters are necessarily more progressive. I think an interesting observation—there's quite a bit of data that shows this—for those of us on the left of politics who may look at an age group of 18 to 24 and say, 'Well, 16- to 17-year-olds are likely to vote that way,' is that the data that exists actually shows they're disproportionately more conservative and less left wing than their counterparts who are a little bit older than them. There seem to be a lot of conspiracy theories that, when everyone talks about lowering the voting age, it's simply an attempt to put on more centre-left voters with the objective of stacking the system. Frankly, the data proves that it's not.


There is issue after issue that we need to be dealing with as a nation. There are long-term decisions on issues like climate, education, equality, simple economic sensibilities and the burden that will be placed on future generations if we have either debt growing the way it has been or increasing inequality and the consequences of that. To say that in this day and age the response to this should be excluding people from participating in the process, I think, shows just how out of touch One Nation is. Those who are 18 to 21 are making big decisions about their lives, and they have a big role to play in the future of this country.


But I tell you what makes it even more outrageous to be having this debate: today is the day that the New South Wales HSC has started. Can I just say to the many students who are going through the HSC today: it's not as big a deal as you think it is, but I'm glad I never have to go through it again. Still, 15 years later, I will occasionally wake thinking I have a HSC exam that I'm late to.


I admit I don't come to this with the best of records when it comes to attendance. In my final year of school I dishonourably graduated with 100 unexplained absences. That's right: I failed to show up to school on 100 different occasions, which, considering 12 weeks of leave and weekends, is quite an achievement in itself. How I was never expelled remains a mystery, and I'm using the Senate now to thank my year 12 principal, Tony Fugaccia from Baulkham Hills High School, for either having faith in me or realising the paperwork of expulsion wasn't worth it. I went on to university, where I failed at med school. I got kicked out of Sydney Law School by the dean, Gillian Triggs herself, unfairly for the sole transgression of not having shown up to five years of classes. This is the same Gillian Triggs who came on to become Human Rights Commissioner. I say to those in this chamber who speak ill of her: if you think you have a problem with Gillian Triggs, consider what it's like to be kicked out of law school by her. Finally, I finished my studies at the amazing Macquarie University.


My message is that we live in a land of better chances. Even though I wasn't good enough for high school, med school or law school—a decision that Gillian Triggs re-endorsed when recently launching my book—the good people of New South Wales, in their great wisdom, decided that they were going to give me the toughest punishment of all: they'd send me to the Australian Senate to be with you lot. Kids, good luck and best wishes. If you truly, really mess things up, I look forward to welcoming you to the Australian Senate.

Senator HINCH
 (Victoria) (16:09):  I'm sure I can't even attempt to match Senator Dastyari's school and university pranks and liveliness, because I didn't know what a high school dropout was until I went to America and discovered that I was one!


I'm in two minds even about standing up and saying anything today in this debate, because I don't want to give any credence to such a loopy One Nation policy as this one. But I will have a go at one area, and that is that Senator Hanson has said that people shouldn't be voting at 18, 19 or 20 because they don't pay taxes. Well, there are some of us here who have been paying taxes since we were 15, when we left school and started work. I suspect that there were teenagers working at Senator Hanson's fish-and-chip shop who probably paid taxes, unless she was paying them under the table. There are a lot of kids who pay taxes at the ages of 15, 16 and 17. Certainly, they should be allowed to vote at 18. I don't agree with the Greens and Senator Dastyari about lowering the age to 16; I think that it should stay at 18. I certainly don't believe in lifting it to 21, but at 18, as other senators have said, you can vote, you can drive and you can get married. If you commit crimes then you will be tried in an adult court. You can gamble and you can go to the pub—all those sorts of things. And also at 18 you can enlist in the military and die for your country. You should be allowed to have the right to vote at any time that an election is called.


All I would say to Senator Hanson is that, when she says that 18-, 19- and 20-year-olds shouldn't have the right to vote in this country, she should go to Gallipoli. Go there, as some of us have done on Anzac Day, and walk through the graveyards in Gallipoli. See those tombstones at the bottom of the cliff there and see the ages of some of those young men who died for us and for the right to vote. They were 19 and 20, and some of them probably even lied about their age and they may have been 17 or 18. So we should leave the voting age at 18 years. I think this is a loopy idea.

Senator HUME
 (Victoria) (16:11):  I rise today to speak in response to the matter of public importance submitted by Senator Siewert, a parliamentary colleague from Western Australia. Senator Siewert would like the chamber to discuss the suggestion—the suggestion—that young Australians aged 18, 19 and 20 be blocked from participating in democracy by raising the voting age to 21. I'm very pleased to be standing here tackling the big issues facing Australia today. I've been particularly entertained by Senator Dastyari's demonstration of his consistent lack of interest in any intellectual development over his lifetime, a record that he continues in the Senate today!


On this matter of public importance, we've heard some very sensible points raised by Senator Paterson, of course. But, as usual, we've heard some pretty serious nonsense—and headline-seeking nonsense at that—from those opposite and also from the Australian Greens. Wasn't it wonderful to see Senator Dastyari and Senator Hanson-Young on a unity ticket, providing the chamber with living proof of the very wise assertion of the poet Ogden Nash that you are only young once but you can stay immature indefinitely.



An honourable senator interjecting—




Senator HUME:
  Did you like that? In considering Senator Siewert's highly-loaded question, I note for the chamber that the most significant and memorable postwar changes to the Australian electoral system were to reduce the voting age from 21 to 18, which our parliament legislated in 1973.


We weren't the first country to do this. After World War II this policy was one that was rapidly expanded, echoed and implemented across established democracies worldwide. Switzerland was the final major democracy to lower the voting age from 21 way back in 1991. The Turnbull coalition government strongly believes that a legal voting age of 18 remains the appropriate marker, as at this stage it is the age at which a person is considered an adult in Australia.


I have nevertheless heard the numerous arguments for adjusting the current voting age. Those have pulled in both directions, and there are those, such as Senator Hanson, who argue that a legal voting age of 21 should be reinstated—that young Australians, and I am going to quote Senator Hanson here, 'Don't have any idea, they've never had a job and they have no understanding of politics.' This attempt by Senator Hanson to tar all 18- to 21-year-olds with the same brush, in my view, ignores the contributions that many young adults have made to our nation's development and prosperity over many years.


A reversion of the voting age to 21 is nothing more than a form of social regression. Since as far as back as the Boer War, we have sent Australians under the age of 21 to fight for our country and indeed—as Senator Hinch mentioned—to die for our country. Hundreds of thousands of employed Australians are between the ages of 18 and 21. They pay taxes, and they employ others. Also, over 165,000 young Australians under the age of 21 undertake voluntary work in our community. These are people that deserve a say. Reinstating the voting age to 21 is contrary to parliamentary democracies worldwide and will only hurt Australia's young adults who have made an active choice to participate in our nation's future. They have earned that right through their vast contributions to our country. It would be absolutely ludicrous to take that right away. As far as Senator Hanson is concerned, I think we can look upon this as a cheap attempt to bar, potentially, what she may consider as an unfavourable slice of our population from electoral participation.


True autonomy for most Australians is gained at the age of 18. We can marry at 18. We can drink at 18. We can gamble at 18. We may participate in a contract at 18. We may also appear in an adult court. The line must, however, be drawn somewhere, and common sense alone tells us that the age of 18 is an appropriate point for that line. Society has long accepted this to be true. Yet common sense is only one side of the story.


Another often parroted argument by those who advocate a lower voting age is that by doing so we would encourage political participation among our younger citizens. If this were the case, if there were evidence of this claim, don't think that the Turnbull government would not be looking at it. The Turnbull government would weigh it up. It would consider its implications, and it would make a balanced decision that delivered the greatest overall benefit to our country. This approach is what our party stands for. But, unfortunately, evidence of this claim of potential increased participation does not exist. A previous ANU study looked into this very matter and found that allowing 16- to 17-year-olds the vote would not actually make young people more politically engaged or create a fairer democratic system. This result echoes the findings of a Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters which, in its inquiry into the conduct of the 2007 federal election, found that the voting age of 18 remains appropriate.


Improving the accessibility of our political system and encouraging young people to get involved with politics are an essential issue for the Turnbull government. This is reflected through more than 16 million people now being enrolled to vote. This is the largest electoral roll since Federation. It includes over 900,000 enrolment transactions just recently processed, between 8 August and 24 August alone.


I therefore advise Senator Hanson, the Australian Greens and Senator Dastyari to read somewhat deeper into the issue of the voting age before they utilise it as some sort of warped form of gerrymandering. The line must be drawn somewhere. If you take a reasoned and balanced view of the issue, one on which political pointscoring is not the primary focus, it is crystal clear that the current voting age is an appropriate and acceptable measure for our society.


Finally, I should inform the chamber that in preparation for my response to this matter of public importance I tasked a young man in my office, Mr Nick Henderson, to research a few of the statistics that I have mentioned today. Over the past few weeks, Mr Henderson has been working as a voluntary intern in my office and is today having his first experience of the strange life we lead in Canberra. Mr Henderson is an economics student at Monash University, where he was a recipient of the Sir John Monash scholarship for excellence and equity. He has also worked part time as a pizza chef, as a barista and in retail. He has volunteered at World Vision, and he has taught English in Cambodia. With a family member with autism, Mr Henderson has taken a personal interest in the rolling out of the NDIS and, in particular, in the certainty of its funding. While Mr Henderson has never been involved in student politics and is not a member of any political party, Mr Henderson is an astute and politically aware young man. Three years ago, Mr Henderson was not Mr Henderson; he was Master Henderson, a schoolboy, and he had done none of these things. He has done all of them since he left school. He's done all of them since he turned 18. Mr Henderson is now 20 years old.


Why would anyone want to deny a young man like Mr Henderson a chance to participate in the future of his country? Why, equally, would society bestow such a significant responsibility before Mr Henderson had the experience of any of the other responsibilities in life? This government will not be engaging with this debate, which is more about enhancing headlines than about enhancing democracy. It is more about better press than it is about better government. The Turnbull government is interested in making the lives of all Australians better, no matter what their age may be, by providing more opportunities, more jobs and a better future for all Australians.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2017-10-16,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (16:20):  All of us in this place should believe in strengthening our democracy, and Senator Hanson and One Nation's suggestion of raising the voting age is beyond ridiculous. Young people in Australia want to be involved in decision-making processes in the same way all other Australians do and should be offered the opportunity to do so on the same footing as other Australians within our existing mandate. Encouraging young people to participate encourages transparency and engagement in community-centred action to improve decision-making processes in our nation. We need to value and acknowledge the contribution of young Australians through our accountable processes here in this parliament. This means that we believe that young people deserve a say at the ballot box about the future of our nation.


According to the most recent census, almost one million young Australians would lose their legal right to vote if the voting age was raised from 18 to 21. That's one million Australians who would be denied the right to vote. I know that Senator Hanson has contended that young people haven't had enough life experience or enough political experience or engagement yet, but the simple fact is that the very act of enrolling to vote—of coming on the roll and voting for the first time—is part of what triggers that engagement. I certainly remember, for my own part, when the Australian Electoral Commission doorknocked my home when I was 17, I was excited to be put on the electoral roll. During my very first vote the following year, I started to take an interest in political affairs, and more and more so until, indeed, I had joined a political party by the time I turned 21—I'd joined the great Australian Labor Party.


What my simple experience demonstrates, like that of millions of other Australians, is you can't arbitrarily delay voting and expect that everyone will be ready after that. You've got to get people on the roll and get them engaged to trigger them to relate to what's being discussed on the TV and relate to the fact that there is an election on. It's not something that you can just turn on once you turn 21.


The simple fact is there are many 16-year-olds today who have an interest and who are willing, ready and able to vote. I think that is, indeed, a worthwhile policy discussion. We should be having more young people engaged in our democracy, not fewer. Young people are active participants in our public life in this nation and active contributors to the taxation system. I had my first taxpaying job before I turned 18. In fact, by the time I had turned 18, I was on my second taxpaying job, having worked on the family orchard before that as a child and played a role within small business.


Those under 18 in our nation currently have no voice on decisions government makes today that impact them in the future, and yet we know that 18-, 19- and 20-year-olds are mandated to engage in adult activities. You can apply from 16 years and six months of age to commence military service at 17. You can get your drivers licence between 16 years and six months and 17, or 18 in Victoria. You can get your pilots licence for balloons and gliders from 16 and for aircraft from 17. You can get your firearms licence from 14 years of age in some states and territories. Young people make independent decisions about medical matters from the age of 16 and can be treated as independent, in terms of leaving home under particular circumstances, from the age of 16. If people under the age of 21 can be sent to war, drive on our roads and live independently, why is it that they can't be trusted to participate in our democracy and have a say at the ballot box?


I raised this issue in my first speech to the Western Australian parliament when I was elected there in 2001. I said very strongly that we should be examining lowering the voting age to 16. I said at the time that, as the majority of people at this age are at least as politically aware as other voters, they have their own articulate views and opinions to which members of parliament should be responsive and accountable. I still believe that this is the case. I can recall that, in the Shorten opposition's policies before the last election, it flagged the idea of expanding the electoral franchise so that more young people have the right to vote at future federal elections. We said that in government we would consider inviting young people to come onto the roll from 16, which you currently can do, and that, once you're on the roll, you would legally be able to exercise the right to vote. It means that we could maintain the very important principle of compulsory voting but give that time for young people when they're ready—and many of them are—to come onto the roll and start to exercise that political and civic engagement, which so many of them are ready to do.


I meet young people every other day in this country, visiting schools, visiting different communities and visiting Girl Guides and Scouts who are very engaged in political discussion, very engaged in their local communities and very ready to vote on the issues before us in our society. We know this from the fact that we have seen more than 65,000 18- to 24-year-olds get on the electoral roll in the marriage postal survey. They are mad keen to have their say on this issue, and yet Senator Hanson would like to take that voice away from about a million young people. So I believe that young people are appalled at what Senator Hanson stands for in this regard, and I guess it's no surprise, really, that Senator Hanson wants to stop them from having their say.


We in this place should be ensuring that young people have a say in our future. Young people should not be disenfranchised from politics. We should be encouraging their participation more than ever. When reflecting on the idea that we need to give young people a greater say, not a lesser say, I truly believe this extends to how we consult with children and young people more broadly in our society. For example, one of the organisations that government funds is the CREATE Foundation. The CREATE Foundation is a very critical organisation that represents the needs of young people in care. These are young people whose parental guardian is the state—who have no other legal parent. They have expressed strong views about how the policies and practices of government treat them in terms of their foster care, their family placements and the day-to-day management of their lives. So, as to the issues of the state, in terms of how we affect young people—be they in care or in education, be it as to their medical care or any aspect of their lives—their views are valid and need to be considered by this place and by every level of government.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2017-10-16,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (16:30):  Let me put it on the record: this is not a One Nation policy; it's my personal opinion. So that's on the record, all right? You're all saying it is a One Nation policy. Just get it straight.


I love the hypocrisy in this place! Absolute hypocrisy! You have Labor and the Greens saying, 'Everyone should have their vote'—and they want to lower it to 16 years of age. Well, who wanted to stop the plebiscite on marriage equality? Labor and the Greens. They didn't believe that Australians should actually be voting on it but that it should be up to the parliament. So look at the hypocrisy of it. They say that people should have the right to vote—but not when it comes to a marriage equality bill; no way in the wide world. They wanted to stop that because they know better than the average voter out there!


Yes, the voting age was 21 until it was lowered in 1973 because of national conscription. I like the reference to Turkey and the grave sites. I'm not being disrespectful at all to those people, because my grandfather fought at Gallipoli. The whole fact is: the voting age at that time was 21. Yes, people went and fought for this country, but the times then were totally different because the youth finished school at around 13 years of age, if not younger. These days, the kids are still at school until 18 years of age and then they go straight on to university.


The Greens say that the voting age should be lowered to 16, as have the Labor Party under Bill Shorten. In 2015 he suggested the voting age be lowered to 16. So he is in line with Senator Dastyari.


Anyway, let's just look at this. There are a few countries around the world that do have a voting age of 21. The lowering of the voting age from 17 to 16 was rejected by Luxembourg, by 81 per cent of voters, in June 2016. They didn't want it lowered to that age. Eighty one per cent said no way in the world did they want to do it. And it was actually rejected here in Canberra as well.


Senator Pratt talks about how many people got onto the voting roll: 65,000. Well, isn't that impressive? But the AEC found that, in 2013, in the federal election, 25 per cent of young people aged between 18 and 24 failed to enrol to vote. That's over 400,000 people. Studies show that young voters are not engaged or interested in the electoral process. How many times do we have kids voting—and I'm talking about those who are 18 plus—who have no idea who they're going to vote for or why they should vote for them and no idea of policies, and who ask their parents who they should be voting for? That is the case. I meet people on a regular basis that have no understanding—and I'm not talking about 18- to 21-year-olds; I'm talking about people of older generations who don't even understand the workings of parliament. You ask them the difference between local, state and federal, and they can't even tell you.


Another thing is: this parliament and the political parties in this place have kept people in the dark and treated them like mushrooms when it comes to the preference system, because they don't want them to be informed of where their preferences go. So people are totally confused, not only about voting but even about where their preferences go. It suited the major political parties in this place to keep people in the dark.


Senator Hanson-Young makes a comment that I'm fearmongering or just creating debate so people can have a say on this. I think there are more important things to talk about in this chamber than this because no private senators' bill has been put up by myself or the party to actually reduce the voting age.

"Rice, Sen Janet",AG,2017-10-16,"



Senator RICE
 (Victoria) (16:35):  It is so good to know that the proposal to increase the voting age to 21 isn't One Nation policy; it's just Pauline Hanson's personal opinion—personal opinion that is completely out of touch, however, as are almost all of the rest of One Nation's policies when it comes to the interests of young people.


This proposal to increase the voting age to 21 takes us back a very long time. The Australian voting age was reduced to 18 in 1973. That was 44 years ago. Attitudes and our whole way of life have changed so significantly since 1973. Of course, 1973 was the first year of the Whitlam government, after 23 years of conservative rule—conservative rule, I think, that Pauline Hanson's policies would have been more consistent with. In the US, it was the time of the Watergate scandal—that corrupt politician was that long ago. It was the year that the last episode of Laugh In was produced—a show which had that memorable line, 'Very interesting, but stupid', and I think that sums up Pauline Hanson's proposal to increase the voting age to 21. It's not surprising that Senator Hanson wants to discriminate against and disenfranchise a million young Australians. It's consistent with the intolerance and discrimination that One Nation shows every day in this parliament towards people that don't agree with them.


It's absolutely right that young people do not support the hurtful, bigoted, simplistic, racist policies of One Nation. They are sick of being screwed over. They want people to be treated fairly and equitably. Young people want to have a fair go for all. In particular, people between the ages of 18 and 21—or even people between the ages of 16 and 18, who the Greens think should be able to vote—have a view of an Australia that is so different to the view of Australia that One Nation have. I'm not just making this up. There was a survey that was done by Youth Action and the Australian Research Alliance for Children and Youth shortly before the 2016 election. It surveyed 3,400 12- to 25-year-olds to ask them what was important for them and what policy outcomes they would like to see out of the 2016 election. Not surprisingly, it is a list of policy proposals that are light-years away from and absolutely diametrically opposed to the policy positions of One Nation.


Young people that were surveyed wanted to see high-quality education. They wanted to see increasing funding to education, increasing access to education and more funding and more resources for local unis and TAFEs. One Nation's low-tax, small-government policies would decimate education. Young people wanted to see better access to health services, including better access to mental health and dental health, and that means giving our health services the resources to be able to fund these programs that are so essential for young people. Young people wanted urgent action on the environment and urgent action on global warming, unlike the troglodytes of One Nation, who even refuse to acknowledge that global warming is real and is based in science. These young people are way past that. They know that it's real and that it is their futures that are at stake. They don't want to see the Adani coalmine opened. They want to see action. They want to see us transition to 100 per cent renewable energy. They're the sorts of policies and actions that young people want, and these are the people that Pauline Hanson would disenfranchise. One person said, 'I will inherit this earth, then my children after me, their children after them, and so it continues. I don't want my kids to inherit a wasteland, or to have to ask what stars, rhinos and forests look like because some power-hungry politicians couldn't get their priorities straight. They need to stop playing the game.' 


Finally, the particular thing that young people said was a priority for them was social justice, with marriage equality right at the top of the agenda, as well as support for people seeking asylum and Aboriginal rights. One person was quoted as saying, 'I'm gay and trans and very rarely feel safe, and I hope that one day I will.' With the policies of the Greens, they will; with the policies of One Nation, that day would be a very long way away. (Time expired)

Senator BUSHBY
 (Tasmania—Chief Government Whip in the Senate) (16:40):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, I present the report Review of there–listing of Boko Haram and Islamic State under the Criminal Code and the report Review of the declaration of Jabhat al-Nusra as a terrorist organisation under the Australian Citizenship Act 2007.


Order that the reports be printed.




Senator BUSHBY:
  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the reports. 


I'm pleased to present the committee's reports on the relisting of Boko Haram and Islamic State as terrorist organisations under the Criminal Code and the declaration of Jabhat al-Nusra as a terrorist organisation under the Australian Citizenship Act 2007. Under the Criminal Code it is an offence to direct the activities of, be a member of, associate with, or conduct a range of activities in support of a listed terrorist organisation. The Criminal Code enables the committee to review all listings of terrorist organisations and report its findings to the parliament within the 15-day disallowance period. 


In conducting its review, the committee held a private hearing with ASIO and the Attorney-General's Department and carefully reviewed the listings with reference to both the procedures followed by the government and to the merits of the listings themselves. The committee was satisfied that appropriate processes had been followed and that Boko Haram and Islamic State, two of the most bloodthirsty terrorist organisations operating in the world today, continue to meet the relevant thresholds to be listed as terrorist organisations. The committee therefore supports the relisting of both organisations and finds no reason to disallow the legislative instruments. 


The PJCIS has a similar review power under the Citizenship Act that provides for dual citizens aged over 14 years to lose their Australian citizenship if they engage in certain conduct on behalf of a declared terrorist organisation. The Minister for Immigration and Border Protection's declaration of Jabhat al-Nusra in July 2017 was the second to have taken place under the provisions, with the first being Islamic State in May 2016. 


As part of its review of the declaration, the committee held a private hearing with ASIO, the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Immigration and Border Protection. The committee was satisfied that Jabhat al-Nusra, which is already a listed terrorist organisation, is opposed to Australia and Australia's interests, values, democratic beliefs, rights and liberties, so that, if a person were to fight for or be in the service of the organisation, the person would be acting inconsistently with their allegiance to Australia. The committee therefore supports the declaration and finds no reason to disallow the legislative instrument. I commend the reports to the Senate.

This is item 48, the government's response to the Community Affairs References Committee report on the 'design, scope, cost-benefit analysis, contracts awarded and implementation associated with the Better Management'—and that's a joke—'of the Social Welfare System initiative'. The government's response is dated September 2017.


What an insult this response is to the thousands of people affected by this debacle commonly known as robo-debt and particularly to the hundreds of submissions that the committee received and the dozens of people that we heard give the Senate inquiry their personal accounts when we held the hearings around Australia. They were very clear that this system had a profound impact on Australians on income support. The government's response is lacklustre, perfunctory, quite obviously didn't pay any attention to the evidence that we received and claims that there is a lack of evidence to justify the committee's recommendations. I will come to that evidence shortly. It says:


There is no evidence to support the recommendation to put on hold the online system.


I'll come back to that in a minute.


It says:


The Government agrees with the conclusions and recommendations in the Dissenting Report.


Oh, my goodness! I'm shocked that the government supports the dissenting report written by its own senators! Of course it would support that dissenting report. But it also says:


On this basis, the Government rejects the central conclusions and recommendations of the Chair's Report, especially the conclusion that the online system lacked procedural fairness.


That is simply ridiculous if you read the committee's extensive report and particularly our conclusions around procedural fairness, where we outlined the complete lack of procedural fairness from go to whoa in the way the government implemented this process.


The government also seeks in its response to imply that the recommendations were superfluous because of the Ombudsman's report, but, if you look at the Ombudsman's report—which of course we covered in our inquiry—it is quite obvious that the Ombudsman's report considered a lot of things other than what our inquiry investigated. The recommendations from the Ombudsman were limited to purported debt raised by the OCI and specifically did not comment on the policy rationale behind the OCI system, the government's broader debt raising, the recovery program or the use of external debt-collection agencies, all of which we considered.


Look at what organisations commented on when they were commenting to the committee inquiry. They were supportive of the Ombudsman's reports. In fact, so was our inquiry report. But they clearly pointed out that the scope of their inquiry was limited to a few implementation matters and did not go far enough to address the fundamental flaws of the OCI system. But of course the government don't want to look at the fundamental flaws in the OCI system, because there are so many. They do not want to stop their revenue raising. They would rather try raising money from the most vulnerable members of our community than from the wealthier members of our community. They'd rather give tax breaks to the rich than actually be fair and have a fair social security system.


There are many points, and I'm sure I'm going to run out of time—in fact, I'm just about to. If you look at the perfunctory way that the government deal with the recommendations from the committee, it's a complete slap in the face to those people that have had significant trauma and, in fact, have had significant mental health issues because of the way the government handled this. Some people have been mentally unwell because of the way the government has tried to raise debts from the most vulnerable. (Time expired)

Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (16:54):  I rise to put remarks on the record with regard to the Defence Legislation Amendment (2017 Measures No. 1) Bill 2017.


Our ADF members put their lives on hold to serve and protect our country and we owe them our unwavering support during and after their service. This bill comprises four schedules which seek to smooth processes, to increase protections for reservists, to realise a recommendation from the first principles review of Defence to add contemporary definitions of children in relation to members and to enable reclassification of those who leave Defence and later find they could have been medically discharged.


With regard to schedule 1: the first schedule amends the Defence Act 1903 to enable a policy framework to broaden and expand conditions under which a positive test result for prohibited substances must be disregarded, including in circumstances relating to appropriate usage of over-the-counter medication or substances administered by authorised persons. Labor says this is a very practical amendment which will smooth processes in circumstances where individuals test positive for over-the-counter prescribed medicines.


The second schedule amends the Defence Reserve Service (Protection) Act 2001. It does so in order to ensure that all reservists would be eligible for the full range of protections under the act in respect of their employment and education. Reservists are a remarkable group of Australians; they certainly play an integral role in the defence of Australia, serving in an entirely voluntary capacity to provide support to the ADF to help rebuild lives and communities after floods, tsunamis and bushfires, as well as delivering very significant humanitarian support overseas. Labor acknowledges that our reservists are part of our broader defence capability. These changes in schedule 2 will improve the protections to our reservists and encourage greater retention and capability of that very valuable reserve force.


Schedule 3 serves the purpose of transferring the hydrographic, meteorological and oceanographic functions from the Royal Australian Navy to the Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation. This is a significant move, in that it is in accordance with the recommendation from the first principles review of Defence. Schedule 4 undertakes the task of aligning a small number of provisions in the Australian Defence Force Cover Act 2015 with other military superannuation schemes. It will provide clarity on the definition of an eligible child or an invalid.


Labor is supportive of changes which improve processes and protections for members of the Defence Force, employees of the defence industry and also their families. By smoothing the processes around medications, increasing protections for reservists, adding contemporary definitions of children and enabling reclassifications of those who leave Defence, this bill seeks to improve conditions of each of those groups and, therefore, the Defence Force overall. Labor has always said that if there is more we can do to support our ADF personnel then we should be doing it. Labor believes that in supporting this bill we are providing a smoother process and increased protection for those men and women who serve our country. There is much more to do but these are certainly reasons that Labor finds it satisfactory to support this bill.

"Kakoschke-Moore, Sen Skye",NXT,2017-10-16,"



Senator KAKOSCHKE-MOORE
 (South Australia) (16:58):  I rise to speak on the Defence Legislation Amendment (2017 Measures No. 1) Bill 2017. The bill comprises four schedules, which seek to apply a commonsense approach to Defence prohibitive substance testing, to expand and strengthen protections for reservists, to add contemporary definitions of children and to apply reclassifications for those who leave Defence. Finally, the bill includes measures to transfer certain functions from the Royal Australian Navy to the Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation.


The first schedule of the bill amends the Defence Act 1903 to streamline the policy framework by broadening and expanding the conditions under which a positive test result must be disregarded due to circumstances relating to the appropriate usage of over-the-counter medication and substances administered or dispensed by authorised persons. This is a commonsense measure that is supported by the Nick Xenophon Team.


Schedule 1 also repeals sections 101 and 104 of the Defence Act and substitutes a new proposed section 101 which simplifies the process leading to the termination of a defence member to align with the provision contained in the Defence Regulation 2016 and provides for procedural fairness during the termination decision-making process. A defence member retains redress of grievance provisions contained in the regulation, including the possible investigation by the Inspector-General of the Australian Defence Force and the Defence Force Ombudsman. Currently, defence members and defence civilians who test positive for a prohibited substance, even if they took a prescribed over-the-counter medication, are required to show cause as to why they should remain in service or why, in the case of defence civilians, they should not be terminated. However, if the same medication was administered, supplied or prescribed by a qualified medical practitioner, the act allows the result to be treated as if it were a negative.


The proposed changes to schedule 1 of the bill establish a new policy with the effect that a defence civilian's test result will be treated as negative test result when a medication has been administered by medical officers and health professionals or obtained as an over-the-counter medication, as a pharmacy medicine, pharmacist-only medicine or a general sales medicine. In addition, items 3 and 4 of schedule 1 expand on the conduct of testing for prohibited substances to include an option of a chaperone if the person being tested makes such a request. The rationale for including this provision is to provide comfort and support for the person being tested. However, the proposed subsection 95(5) states:


To avoid doubt, the test may be conducted even if the requested person is not present.


The explanatory memorandum says testing may proceed in circumstances where the request is considered unreasonable or impractical. This seems to defeat the benefit of having the option of a chaperone or a support person present in the first place. That aside, the Nick Xenophon Team is supportive of the practical measures proposed in schedule 1 that would ensure defence members and defence civilians who test positive for taking over-the-counter and prescribed medications are not unfairly penalised as a consequence.


Schedule 2 amends the Defence Reserve Service (Protection) Act 2001 to expand the protections for our reservists. The Nick Xenophon Team welcomes these measures, which have been a long time coming. The DRS(P) Act provides for protection of reservists in their employment and education to facilitate their return to civilian life after providing defence service and for related purposes. The amendments are described by Defence as being needed to mitigate some of the disadvantages reserve members face when active in defence service, because of absence from their workplace, their education provider and, in some cases, their country. The proposed measures will expand the scope of the financial liability and bankruptcy protections to apply to all operational service by reserve members. It will clarify the employment protections to give greater certainty about reserve members' rights when they are absent from employment to render defence service. It will also enhance the education protections to create an obligation on education providers to make reasonable adjustments to accommodate reserve members' defence service. This schedule introduces anti-victimisation and anti-harassment provisions to improve the experience of reserve members in their civilian workplaces and also introduces a civil penalty regime as a complement to the existing criminal offences throughout the act.


Our reservists undertake an incredible balancing act between their civilian work, their families and their reserve service. We agree with the minister when he says that no-one should be disadvantaged by choosing to wear a reserve uniform and we welcome the measures in this schedule to assist our reserve members in serving their country without concern about returning to their civilian working lives.


The DRS(P) Act was reviewed in 2008, with the protection review concluding that, whilst the act was working well overall, it did make a number of recommendations of enhancements. The government tells us that the amendments in schedule 2 implement many of those recommendations, but, until recently, the protection review had not been made public, and the explanatory memorandum is silent as to the number of recommendations implemented. However, following consultations I had with the government, the department has now made the protection review public, with the department confirming the measures in schedule 2 are a complete response to those recommendations, along with other matters raised by defence reserves.


I thank the government, in the interests of transparency and accountability, for publishing the protection review on the Defence website. It is clear that the number of reservists has been in decline over recent years. The Defence annual report for 2015-16 reported that 19,338 reserve members received pay for days served. The report showed that, while the number of service days increased from the previous year, the number of reservists undertaking paid service had in fact declined.


Major General Paul Irving, National President of the Defence Reserves Association, said in the April 2016 issue of The Australian Reservist that the Defence Reserves Association has been extremely concerned by the rapidly declining numbers in the Australian Reserves. He went on to say:


At the 2015 National Conference, we were advised that a detailed review of the Naval Reserves would be undertaken. The DRA has been critical of the state of the Standby Reserve in the three Services, particularly in the RAN. A recent review of the RAN … found that a number of members were deceased and contact details of around 90% of Standby Reservists were incorrect.


The Defence Reserves Association received 'advice emanating from the 2015 National DRA Conference that the proposed amendments to the act were moving through the ""system"" and should be considered by parliament in early 2015'. This did not, of course, occur, and we are finally at that juncture, over two years later.


While it took Defence 12 months to endorse the findings of the protection review, which were made in 2008, it is an indictment of both major political parties that, more than nine years later, these relatively non-controversial amendments, which received bipartisan support, are only now being considered by the parliament. These changes are supported by the Nick Xenophon Team and will improve the protections for reservists in many facets of their lives, with a view to encouraging greater retention and capability in the reserve forces.


Schedule 3 of the bill will transfer the hydrographic, meteorological and oceanographic functions of the Royal Australian Navy to the Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation. Currently, the AGO's functions are limited to activities relating to geospatial and imagery intelligence. The proposed changes are in line with a recommendation from the 2015 first principles review of Defence, the focus of which was on minimising bureaucracy and maximising frontline services. The proposed changes will also permit the AGO to provide its non-intelligence products and related assistance to an expanded range of entities in accordance with Australia's legal obligations and national interests. The first principles review found:


Geospatial information management is currently under-resourced, with poorly coordinated investment, limited leadership, obscure accountability, low management prioritisation and disaggregated thinking about strategy and direction.


Current planned and future Australian Defence Force platforms and operations are all critically reliant on integrated geospatial data and services. The remediation of this key enabler is urgent.


The Nick Xenophon Team does not dispute the need to provide a coordinated approach between the various Defence geospatial functions in order to deliver better service through the integration of the associated production and distribution systems and stronger professional linkages between the maritime, land and aerospace geospatial intelligence domains under the umbrella of the AGO. The Minister of Veterans' Affairs, in his second reading speech, said:


The transfer of these functions is expected to realise synergies in the exploitation of imagery and other data to produce intelligence and non-intelligence geospatial related information in support of Australia's defence interests and other national objectives.


However, while the Nick Xenophon Team is broadly supportive of the proposed transfer of these functions to the Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation, I raised concerns about the level of parliamentary scrutiny that the AGO is subjected to. On this issue, Defence has advised:


The AGO is established under the Intelligence Services Act 2001 and is subject to both parliamentary and statutory oversight similar to other intelligence agencies.


The advice continued:


The Australian Hydrographic Office is outlined and will continue to be outlined in the Defence portfolio budget statements following the merger with the AGO with intended outputs to meet Defence's obligation for providing hydrographic services in accordance with the Navigation Act 2012. Defence will also continue to provide updates on the progress and achievement of published targets during Senate Estimates.


Finally, the advice told me:


On an annual basis, the AHO publishes HydroScheme, which provides more detail on these services and related activities. Both documents are available to maritime stakeholders and the public.


On this basis, I am satisfied that the Senate and the parliament will retain sufficient oversight of the functions being transferred from the AHO to the AGO with the passage of this bill.


I also raise concerns about the Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation being a body exempt from the Freedom of Information Act 1982. This means that proposed paragraphs 6B(1)(e), (ea), (f) and (h), which together comprise the AGO's revised non-intelligence functions, will also become exempt from the FOI Act. However, in consultation with the department, I have been advised that Defence will not seek to rely on the exemption in relation to AGO's non-intelligence functions without strong justifications. Defence has undertaken to apply the provisions of the FOI Act as a matter of policy to requests for access to information concerning its non-intelligence functions, and I understand that the minister will confirm this during the summing-up of this bill. I thank the government and Defence for listening to and acting on the concerns of the Nick Xenophon Team.


Finally, schedule 4 of the bill will align a small number of provisions in the Australian Defence Force Cover Bill 2015 with other military superannuation schemes and provide clarity of definitions. This schedule will ensure that members who resign from the ADF and who later find that they could have been medically discharged will be able to apply to the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation to have their motive for discharge reassessed. The measure operates to allow individuals who were not discharged as medically unfit at the time of their discharge to apply to the CSC at a later time to consider if the grounds existed on which a person could have been medically discharged because of a physical or mental impairment that they had at the time of discharge. If the CSC is satisfied that such grounds exist then the CSC must, as soon as reasonably practical, determine the percentage of incapacity for civil employment at the time of discharge. It is entirely just and appropriate that people in this situation have the ability to have discharge circumstances reassessed. I welcome the measure and commend the government for doing so. 


The Nick Xenophon Team is supportive of these changes, especially as it will benefit those suffering from undiagnosed mental health conditions. I have personally dealt with constituents who left the Defence Force as a result of an unknown medical condition, whether it was a physical or mental illness. Many of the veterans I assisted while I worked as a constituent manager for Senator Xenophon experienced difficulties. Given what we know and continue to learn about the complexities of trauma and its manifestations, coupled with our growing understanding of mental illness, it is entirely reasonable that Defence members in this situation might leave the Defence Force without being entirely aware of any underlying health issues. For many, mental illness can go undiagnosed for a very long period of time. This measure is an important step in the healing of those persons affected. 


Schedule 4 will also provide for a more modern definition to allow a child of a deceased member or invalid to become eligible at a later date in circumstances where the child was found ineligible at the time of the member's or invalid's death. The government has provided the following example for this: when a child of the member is over 18 and ceases full-time study to care for the member or to undertake a gap year prior to the member's death, subsequently resuming full-time study after the member's death, while still under the age of 25. The measure amends the definition of 'eligible child' by removing the requirement that the person was wholly or substantially dependent on the invalid or member when they died. Instead, being wholly or substantially dependent on the invalid or member at the time of their death will only be one of the factors to be taken into account in determining whether a person is a child of the invalid or member. 


The Nick Xenophon Team continues to support changes which seek to better the lives of Defence Force members, veterans and their families. That is why we support this bill.

Senator PAYNE
 (New South Wales—Minister for Defence) (17:12):  In providing a few remarks on the summing up for the Defence Legislation Amendment (2017 Measures No. 1) Bill 2017, I would like to thank all senators who have contributed to the debate on this bill and to acknowledge the support shown across the chamber in the second reading debate. 


I want to speak briefly to the four separate measures that the bill identifies. The first of those is the amendment to the Defence Act 1903 to enable a policy framework to broaden and expand the conditions under which a positive test result for a prohibited substance must be disregarded, including the usage of over-the-counter medication. I note that concerns have been raised by some senators with regard to privacy issues. However, given this measure would allow Defence personnel to avoid more intrusive show-cause processes when they present a positive result for common treatments, such as cold and flu medicines, it is the government's view this will, in fact, ultimately, increase privacy for Defence personnel, not diminish it. 


The second measure amends the Defence Reserve Service (Protection) Act 2001 to ensure all reservists would be eligible for the full range of protections under the act in respect of both their employment and education. The bill will also extend the financial liability and bankruptcy protections for reservists on continuous full-time service that is operational service. The bill will also introduce a new provision protecting reservists in the workplace from harassment or detriment, including victimisation relating to their status or service as a reservist. These measures are the completion of recommendations from a 2008 review of the protections provided to reservists—as senators have noted—and they are long overdue. I commend these to the Senate. 


The third measure amends the Intelligence Services Act 2001, the Navigation Act 2012 and the Telecommunications Act 1997, to include the transfer of hydrographic, meteorological and oceanographic functions from the Royal Australian Navy to the Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation in accordance with one of the recommendations from the first principles review of Defence. The hydrographic functions will continue to be subject to parliamentary and statutory oversights. Noting the concerns of some senators that the status quo of freedom of information in particular be maintained for hydrographic, meteorological and oceanographic functions, Defence has provided an undertaking that it will not seek to rely on the exemption from the FOI Act that is provided by the Intelligence Services Act in relation to AGO's non-intelligence functions without strong justification. To that end, I can assure the Senate that Defence and AGO undertake to apply the provisions of the FOI Act as a matter of policy to requests for access to information concerning its non-intelligence functions.


The fourth measure amends the Australian Defence Force Cover Act 2015 to align a small number of the provisions in the act with other military superannuation schemes and to provide clarity on the definition of 'eligible child of a member or invalid', as senators have noted. As mentioned, the bill moves to make some small but significant changes to Defence and other legislation. They will be significant to the operations of Defence, providing streamlining to practices and common sense to policy. They will be significant to members of the defence reserves, who will receive greater protection. They will also be significant to family members of the ADF, who will now benefit from the changes to superannuation. I commend the bill to the Senate.

Our ADF members put their lives on hold to serve and protect our country and we owe them our unwavering support during and after their service.

However, while the Nick Xenophon Team is broadly supportive of the proposed transfer of these functions to the Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation, I raised concerns about the level of parliamentary scrutiny that the AGO is subjected to. On this issue, Defence has advised:


The AGO is established under the Intelligence Services Act 2001 and is subject to both parliamentary and statutory oversight similar to other intelligence agencies.


The advice continued:


The Australian Hydrographic Office is outlined and will continue to be outlined in the Defence portfolio budget statements following the merger with the AGO with intended outputs to meet Defence's obligation for providing hydrographic services in accordance with the Navigation Act 2012. Defence will also continue to provide updates on the progress and achievement of published targets during Senate Estimates.


Finally, the advice told me:


On an annual basis, the AHO publishes HydroScheme, which provides more detail on these services and related activities. Both documents are available to maritime stakeholders and the public.


On this basis, I am satisfied that the Senate and the parliament will retain sufficient oversight of the functions being transferred from the AHO to the AGO with the passage of this bill.


I also raise concerns about the Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation being a body exempt from the Freedom of Information Act 1982. This means that proposed paragraphs 6B(1)(e), (ea), (f) and (h), which together comprise the AGO's revised non-intelligence functions, will also become exempt from the FOI Act. However, in consultation with the department, I have been advised that Defence will not seek to rely on the exemption in relation to AGO's non-intelligence functions without strong justifications. Defence has undertaken to apply the provisions of the FOI Act as a matter of policy to requests for access to information concerning its non-intelligence functions, and I understand that the minister will confirm this during the summing-up of this bill. I thank the government and Defence for listening to and acting on the concerns of the Nick Xenophon Team.


Finally, schedule 4 of the bill will align a small number of provisions in the Australian Defence Force Cover Bill 2015 with other military superannuation schemes and provide clarity of definitions. This schedule will ensure that members who resign from the ADF and who later find that they could have been medically discharged will be able to apply to the Commonwealth Superannuation Corporation to have their motive for discharge reassessed. The measure operates to allow individuals who were not discharged as medically unfit at the time of their discharge to apply to the CSC at a later time to consider if the grounds existed on which a person could have been medically discharged because of a physical or mental impairment that they had at the time of discharge. If the CSC is satisfied that such grounds exist then the CSC must, as soon as reasonably practical, determine the percentage of incapacity for civil employment at the time of discharge. It is entirely just and appropriate that people in this situation have the ability to have discharge circumstances reassessed. I welcome the measure and commend the government for doing so. 


The Nick Xenophon Team is supportive of these changes, especially as it will benefit those suffering from undiagnosed mental health conditions. I have personally dealt with constituents who left the Defence Force as a result of an unknown medical condition, whether it was a physical or mental illness. Many of the veterans I assisted while I worked as a constituent manager for Senator Xenophon experienced difficulties. Given what we know and continue to learn about the complexities of trauma and its manifestations, coupled with our growing understanding of mental illness, it is entirely reasonable that Defence members in this situation might leave the Defence Force without being entirely aware of any underlying health issues. For many, mental illness can go undiagnosed for a very long period of time. This measure is an important step in the healing of those persons affected. 


Schedule 4 will also provide for a more modern definition to allow a child of a deceased member or invalid to become eligible at a later date in circumstances where the child was found ineligible at the time of the member's or invalid's death. The government has provided the following example for this: when a child of the member is over 18 and ceases full-time study to care for the member or to undertake a gap year prior to the member's death, subsequently resuming full-time study after the member's death, while still under the age of 25. The measure amends the definition of 'eligible child' by removing the requirement that the person was wholly or substantially dependent on the invalid or member when they died. Instead, being wholly or substantially dependent on the invalid or member at the time of their death will only be one of the factors to be taken into account in determining whether a person is a child of the invalid or member. 


The Nick Xenophon Team continues to support changes which seek to better the lives of Defence Force members, veterans and their families. That is why we support this bill.

"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2017-10-16,"



Senator PAYNE
 (New South Wales—Minister for Defence) (17:12):  In providing a few remarks on the summing up for the Defence Legislation Amendment (2017 Measures No. 1) Bill 2017, I would like to thank all senators who have contributed to the debate on this bill and to acknowledge the support shown across the chamber in the second reading debate. 


I want to speak briefly to the four separate measures that the bill identifies. The first of those is the amendment to the Defence Act 1903 to enable a policy framework to broaden and expand the conditions under which a positive test result for a prohibited substance must be disregarded, including the usage of over-the-counter medication. I note that concerns have been raised by some senators with regard to privacy issues. However, given this measure would allow Defence personnel to avoid more intrusive show-cause processes when they present a positive result for common treatments, such as cold and flu medicines, it is the government's view this will, in fact, ultimately, increase privacy for Defence personnel, not diminish it. 


The second measure amends the Defence Reserve Service (Protection) Act 2001 to ensure all reservists would be eligible for the full range of protections under the act in respect of both their employment and education. The bill will also extend the financial liability and bankruptcy protections for reservists on continuous full-time service that is operational service. The bill will also introduce a new provision protecting reservists in the workplace from harassment or detriment, including victimisation relating to their status or service as a reservist. These measures are the completion of recommendations from a 2008 review of the protections provided to reservists—as senators have noted—and they are long overdue. I commend these to the Senate. 


The third measure amends the Intelligence Services Act 2001, the Navigation Act 2012 and the Telecommunications Act 1997, to include the transfer of hydrographic, meteorological and oceanographic functions from the Royal Australian Navy to the Australian Geospatial-Intelligence Organisation in accordance with one of the recommendations from the first principles review of Defence. The hydrographic functions will continue to be subject to parliamentary and statutory oversights. Noting the concerns of some senators that the status quo of freedom of information in particular be maintained for hydrographic, meteorological and oceanographic functions, Defence has provided an undertaking that it will not seek to rely on the exemption from the FOI Act that is provided by the Intelligence Services Act in relation to AGO's non-intelligence functions without strong justification. To that end, I can assure the Senate that Defence and AGO undertake to apply the provisions of the FOI Act as a matter of policy to requests for access to information concerning its non-intelligence functions.


The fourth measure amends the Australian Defence Force Cover Act 2015 to align a small number of the provisions in the act with other military superannuation schemes and to provide clarity on the definition of 'eligible child of a member or invalid', as senators have noted. As mentioned, the bill moves to make some small but significant changes to Defence and other legislation. They will be significant to the operations of Defence, providing streamlining to practices and common sense to policy. They will be significant to members of the defence reserves, who will receive greater protection. They will also be significant to family members of the ADF, who will now benefit from the changes to superannuation. I commend the bill to the Senate.


Question agreed to.

"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2017-10-16,"



Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (21:50):  The relationship between Australia and Japan is our closest and most mature in Asia, so it's fundamentally important for our shared strategic and economic interests that we continue to strengthen and improve that relationship. This relationship is underpinned by a shared commitment to democracy, human rights and the rule of law, as well as common approaches to international security.


Australia's stability in the business and investment environments makes us a critical supplier of minerals and energy, as well as high-quality food products, to Japan. In 2015-16, Japan was Australia's largest trading partner and second-largest export market. Japan was also Australia's second-largest inbound direct foreign investor in 2015. Two-way trade between Australia and Japan is now worth over $60 billion. Japan has fewer natural resources and, as such, the Japanese economy faces significant challenges, especially in its energy policy. To address these challenges, the Japanese government is encouraging firms to secure stable energy and commodity supplies through increased investment in overseas natural resources. Australia is, of course, a major beneficiary of this investment.


In August, I—along with my WA Liberal colleague the member for Durack, Melissa Price, and other coalition MPs and senators—was delighted to welcome to parliament Mr Hitoshi Okawa from INPEX; ACIL Allen's executive director, John Nicolaou; and the Chief Executive of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Mr James Pearson, to discuss how the Japanese-owned INPEX LNG project will benefit the economies of Western Australia and the Northern Territory.


Located 220 kilometres off the northern Western Australian coastline, the project represents something quite remarkable: the largest discovery of hydrocarbon liquids in Australia in the last 40 years. It also represents the largest Japanese investment ever made in Australia, valued at US$34 billion, which is more than $43 billion in Australian terms. The INPEX LNG project is currently in construction and is ranked among the most significant oil and gas projects in the world. The project is effectively three megaprojects rolled into one, involving some of the largest offshore facilities in the industry, a state-of-the-art onshore processing facility and an 890-kilometre pipeline. The project will be operational for at least 40 years and will generate more than $195 billion in exports for Australia, which will be greater than the total exports from Tasmania in 2015-16 and greater than all Australian total wheat exports in the period 2014-15.


At peak production, the economic output is forecast to be $4½ billion per annum, before slowly reducing to a low of $1.4 billion by 2050, in line with the lower levels of production expected towards the end of the project's life. The project is expected to double the Northern Territory's exports, injecting $118 billion, or 15 per cent, into the economy between 2012 and 2050. My home state of Western Australia is likely to see a $75 billion boost to our economy over the same period. This will provide a boost in real incomes in WA of $34 billion, with the Territorians also expected to see a boost in real incomes of $14 billion.


Real incomes across the rest of Australia are expected to be boosted by $43 billion as a result of the flow-on impact from higher taxation payments. This includes an estimated $73 billion in taxation revenue to respective governments at $1.9 billion per year. At peak production, annual taxation receipts generated from the project are estimated to rise to $3½ billion. The biggest source of taxation payments from the project will be through the form of company taxation, which is forecast to rise rapidly to $2.1 billion during peak production. The project is estimated to generate $20 million in payroll taxation to Western Australia and $5 million to the Northern Territory. GST collections are estimated at an average of $269 million per annum, of which 78 per cent will be collected in WA and the remaining 22 per cent in the Northern Territory. Of course, if the draft recommendations from the Productivity Commission review into horizontal fiscal equalisation are given their head, those GST collections and revenues back to Western Australia will be significantly larger. One can only hope.


Once operational, the local workforce will see significant growth, with 600 jobs created on average per annum over 40 years in the Northern Territory and 1,100 jobs created on average per annum in the same period to support activities in Perth, the Kimberley and offshore. Broome, in the far north of my home state of Western Australia, is an important supply hub for the Ichthys LNG Project's offshore works, including workforce helicopter transfers and logistics support. During the current phase, project vessels are expected to make up to seven visits per week to the port of Broome for service and supplies. A dedicated INPEX Toll Mermaid logistics base has been established close to the port of Broome to support the project’s drilling program. INPEX has contracted Bristow Helicopters to move its offshore workers between Broome and the gas field, where two rigs are drilling 20 production wells, and more than 30,000 tonnes of equipment is being installed on the seabed. Eventually, up to 100 workers may be transported to the field each day, with the same number travelling back to Broome on return flights.


The project is also providing significant social, cultural and economic benefits to many local Kimberley communities, with INPEX providing support in areas such as arts and culture, youth, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander initiatives and education. In April 2009, INPEX signed an agreement with the local Aboriginal corporation for the long-term management of the local airport, which is located on the Dampier Peninsula, 185 kilometres north of Broome. As part of INPEX's commitment to supporting sustainable Indigenous economic development, this agreement provides the community with a dedicated sustainable income stream, together with training and employment opportunities. The agreement guarantees access to the airport for emergency evacuation from the Browse Basin fields, greatly improving safety for offshore rig workers. This is particularly important during natural disasters like cyclones. In partnership with the Western Australia government, INPEX undertook a major upgrade of the airport, including resealing the airstrip, expanding fuel facilities and installing shelters and an automated weather station. These upgrades will also benefit other users of the airport, including the community, the Royal Flying Doctor Service, tourism operators, private users and other Browse Basin oil and gas operators. For the local Indigenous community, this project provides real options for managing their own future and ensuring the continuation of Indigenous community services.


The INPEX LNG project is a great bright light for the economies of both Western Australia and the Northern Territory, and we wish them the greatest of success.
