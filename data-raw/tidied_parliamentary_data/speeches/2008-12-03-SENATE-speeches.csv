"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2008-12-03,"—This is very important legislation for the nation, but I want to flag that there will be amendments to broaden the provisions, including amendments to take into account environmentally good policy, when this legislation comes before the Senate.

"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2008-12-03,"—I am pleased to speak on behalf of the coalition in relation to the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Television Switch-over) Bill 2008. This bill sets in place the mechanisms to complete the transition to digital TV in Australia. The coalition has a very firm commitment to supporting the transition to digital television. In government, it was the coalition that commenced the process to transition Australia to digital. In the year 2000, the coalition provided the legislative framework for the introduction of digital television, with digital transmission commencing in metropolitan licence areas on 1 January 2001, nearly eight years ago, and in non-remote regional areas from 2003. The initial legislation permitted a simulcast period of at least eight years. The current legislated switch-over is designed to coincide with the end of the analog digital simulcast period.
In government, the coalition was always concerned about take-up rates before switch-over and conscious of the need to ensure consumer awareness of the benefits of digital television. In July 2006, we announced that there was insufficient digital take-up to meet the initial switch-over date in metropolitan areas. Subsequently, we established a Digital Action Plan to drive take-up and achieve switch-over with a revised target of 2010 to 2012. In November 2006, my colleague Senator Helen Coonan, as Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, announced the creation of Digital Australia to coordinate the transition to digital TV.
The Labor Party went to the 2007 federal election promising to abolish Digital Australia but, of course, has merely rebranded it as the Digital Switchover Taskforce, retaining similar functions to the previous body and retaining the executive director appointed by our government, Mr Andrew Townend. Given our leadership of the move to digital TV, the coalition naturally support the intent of the digital television switch-over bill. However, in stating our support, it is important to say that we do have some concerns about the end of the simulcast period and want the government to ensure that no current analog free-to-air TV viewer is left without a digital signal.
This bill allows the government to implement the minister’s digital switch-over time line. I deliberately referred to it as the ‘minister’s time line’ because in December last year, upon their election, the minister, Senator Conroy, determined a date for final switch-over in Australia of 31 December 2013. The minister then set about planning how this could be achieved, and it is only recently that we have seen any detail about how he plans to achieve this ambitious timetable.
The bill provides the mechanism for the minister’s timetable to be achieved, commencing with Mildura in the six-month window from 1 January to 30 June 2010. So, while the bill itself does not contain this timetable, the preferred timetable has been released, indicating the government’s preference to end simulcast region by region, and in regional and rural Australia before the metropolitan areas. From the coalition’s point of view, we do understand the rationale for that particular approach of doing it in regional and rural Australia prior to metropolitan areas, but I say to the government that this process is going to have to be managed extremely carefully to ensure that people in rural and regional Australia—in particular—do not feel they are the government’s guinea pigs for this transition to digital TV.
We note from the most recent study by ACMA into digital take-up in Australia that there have been significant improvements in take-up since we, as the former government, launched our Digital Action Plan, but there are still a number of concerns with take-up, and with viewer understanding of the end of the simulcast period, that do need to be addressed. ACMA’s report Digital television in Australian homes 2007 found a 12.2 per cent increase in the number of households—to around 41.8 per cent over the 18 months since the last survey—receiving digital free-to-air television. This is a significant increase. And the report does confirm that Mildura, the first area for switch-over under the government’s timetable, does have the highest digital TV adoption rate, at 73.3 per cent, largely driven by the availability of an additional commercial broadcasting service in digital.
This bill has been considered by the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications and the Arts and I, on behalf of the coalition, thank the committee and its secretariat for their work throughout the inquiry. One of the key areas of concern raised in the committee’s inquiry was what the government considers to be an adequate level of take-up before switch-over can occur. The bill, regrettably, does not include any readiness criteria as preconditions for switch-over. There is no requirement on the government or the minister that an area is publicly identified as ‘ready’ in advance of the specified switch-over period. The coalition is concerned about switch-over occurring before regions are deemed to be appropriately ready, particularly given that there has been no commitment by the government as yet to ensure that take-up is at an adequate level and that transmission problems such as black spots are addressed prior to switch-over in any particular region. The coalition is attracted to the suggestion submitted by Free TV, an organisation representing all the free-to-air broadcasters in this country, to the committee’s inquiry. In her evidence to the committee inquiry, the Free TV CEO, Julie Flynn, argued for amendments to the bill to require benchmark readiness criteria for switch-over and a review of switch-over readiness against that benchmark for each region six months from commencement. The readiness criteria would be set by the minister and would be required to be made public, and the results of the review into readiness would also be required to be made public. We, on our side, support the arguments put forward by Free TV, and I therefore foreshadow that the coalition will be moving several amendments to this bill to ensure better protection for viewers as the analog signal is switched off.
The coalition do acknowledge the cost burden of the simulcast period, particularly on rural and regional broadcasters—one of the good reasons for switching over in the regions first—and do not want to unduly stand in the way of switch-over, but we do want to make sure that adequate consideration is given to the people who really count, the viewers, and to their readiness to receive digital signals. Further, of particular concern to the coalition is the possibility of transmission black spots. The coalition wants transmission difficulties to be given more attention by the government before switch-over. Indeed, I have been contacted by one gentleman, Mr Inall, who wished to highlight the problems he is experiencing with receiving a digital signal. After spending $1,000 on a set-top box and upgrades to his external aerial, he is still unable to receive the ABC free-to-air signal and continues to rely on the analog signal for viewing the ABC. And, amazingly, Mr Inall lives only five kilometres from the transmission site in Roseville in New South Wales. So that is one of the reasons why the coalition will be moving an amendment that requires the government to table information about the identification of black spots and how these will be rectified in advance of switch-over.
As for the government’s switch-over timetable itself, we again stress that, as many regional centres will be the first to switch over, there does need to be publicly available information about their readiness, and a guarantee that transmission difficulties have been rectified. The government argue that a concrete analog switch-over date will drive the take-up of digital TV—or set-top boxes—and that argument has, of course, some considerable merit. But the government have not specified what they would do if take-up rates were not deemed by anybody to be adequate, nor have they defined a desired take-up rate. The government continue to cite the UK example in that country’s progress towards switch-over, but we do need to be conscious of the difference—naturally—in the geographical size of the two countries and that it is regional centres that will, of course, be moving to switch over in the first phase.
In relation to schedule 1 of this bill, the coalition do not oppose the change in the timing of the two reviews required under the Broadcasting Services Act, noting that the policy intent of these reviews is consistent with our previous policy in government. But I do place on record a couple of the coalition’s concerns with these reviews. In relation to the review of new commercial broadcasting licences, this bill amends section 35A(1) of the Broadcasting Services Act to require the minister to cause the review to be conducted prior to 1 January 2012. Spectrum allocation, as part of the digital dividend, is becoming more and more important, and yet we know it is fraught with difficulty. Even ACMA’s own Five-year spectrum outlook 2009-2014 has acknowledged an inherent degree of uncertainty in predicting spectrum requirements over the next five years.
I believe there is some merit in tying consideration of this review into new commercial licences to the consideration of the so-called digital dividend spectrum allocation—a point raised in the Free TV submission. May I also say, however, that it is difficult to envisage, from my point of view, any circumstances which would warrant the creation of a fourth commercial TV licence, given the increasingly competitive TV broadcasting industry and, of course, the advent of multichannelling with digital TV. In relation to the content and captioning rules of commercial multichannels, the coalition does note the point made by the department in its submission that ‘different regulatory requirements for content and captioning may operate in different parts of the country’ due to the staggered dates of analog switch-off.
The coalition does not want broadcasters, particularly regional broadcasters, to face unnecessary regulatory or cost burdens due to the staggered regional switch-over and, given the potential variance of requirements for broadcasters in different regions, asks that the government listens to the concerns raised about the multichannel content and captioning requirements. The coalition wants the government to ensure that everyone who currently has access to an analog signal will have access to digital signals at the time of the switch-over in that area. The government has stated that a number of assistance measures for consumers and for transmission infrastructure are under consideration, but to have any chance of meeting the minister’s deadline for the switch-over the government will need to provide funding in next year’s budget to ensure switch-over readiness.
We do believe that it is important for the government to provide assistance to ensure adequate preparation for the switch-over. This should include subsidies to assist the disadvantaged in making the switch and funding for digital towers and equipment upgrades, including, most importantly, the self-help retransmission sites as well as black spot elimination initiatives. The government should have in place a strategy to enable community broadcasters to successfully switch to digital. The government needs to provide funding certainty for consumers and broadcasters to facilitate the switch-over in advance of the Mildura switch-over period, which is the first to occur. The coalition, while strongly supporting the full transmission to digital, does want safeguards in place to ensure that Australians who currently have access to free-to-air television will continue to have that same access after the switch-off of the analog signal. Black spots must be identified and rectified, consumer measures need to ensure a high level of take-up before the switch-over, and the government should outline a clear pathway for community television broadcasters to a digital future.
The coalition continues to strongly support the transition to digital. There are of course a number of very evident advantages and efficiencies that will flow to consumers and broadcasters as a result of this transition. But we do not want anyone left behind by this transition. It is the viewers who ultimately count—they are what this is all about. We want to ensure that everyone who has access to an analog free-to-air signal will have access to digital transmissions without excessive personal cost. That is why I, on behalf of the coalition, will be moving amendments to this bill in the committee stage to ensure that there is more transparency in the process and that the government is active in identifying and addressing digital transmission black spots.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION SWITCH-OVER) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2008-12-03,"—The Australian Greens understand that the switch-over from analog to digital television is quite a significant transition with quite a long history behind it. Both the population and the broadcasters will require education, preparation and, in some cases, support in order to make the transition successfully. The deadline will provide a useful incentive to prompt both the broadcasters and the population to get ready. But, as we know, a number of quite ambitious deadlines have already been set in the past for Australians to switch over, and yet we still find ourselves in this situation today. In its initial 1997 report, ACMA thought that Australia could be digital by the year 2000, and the Howard government projected 2001 for digital broadcasting in metropolitan areas and in all areas by 2004.
The Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Television Switch-over) Bill 2008 provides another set of deadlines. The bill empowers the minister to decide if a region is ready for the switch-over and gives him six months flexibility—three months either side of a set date—before flicking off the analog transmission. The Australian Greens concur with some of those who made submissions to the inquiry that having some clear criteria for assessing the readiness of an area would assist the minister in making this decision and ensure that the process is transparent. Having the switch-over occur in an election year does provide a strong incentive for the minister to ensure that a population is sufficiently ready.
However, we are concerned that some sectors are being overlooked. This bill specifically addresses commercial and national broadcaster-owned transmitters in the Australian television-watching community, but there is no indication in the bill at all of how the difficulties associated with community television broadcasters or current self-help transmission facilities, which retransmit commercial, national and national Indigenous television services, will be taken into account in setting or varying analog switch-off dates. At a Senate estimates hearing in October, the minister answered my question in this regard by saying:
… we have been working through a variety and considering a variety of options to assist in the transition, but at this stage we have not been able to resolve some of the difficulties. But we are confident that we will find an outcome that will deliver an enhanced community broadcasting outcome.
The minister assured us at the time that the government would be addressing that issue, but there were no details whatsoever—about the process, time lines or technology—as to how the community broadcasting sector was going to be able to make this transition. Again, in a briefing provided to my office by the department, similar statements were made that acknowledged the importance of the issue but provided no assurance that we were any closer to a solution.
Outside the remit of this bill, community and self-help broadcasters are certainly relevant to the digital switch-over. Submissions made to the inquiry noted that self-help analog-to-digital TV transmission arrangements, not only in remote areas but all over Australia, are not covered by the current digital switch-over bill. These organisations are concerned about the possibility of indefinite delay creating two tiers of broadcasting capabilities and services. As the committee’s report indicated, there is real concern that remote communities are going to miss out unless they are supported in bearing the cost of conversion.
In its submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications and the Arts inquiry into this bill, the department stated:
The Government is currently considering the options available for community television to make the transition from analog to digital.
But, again, there is no indication of how or when, so I very much look forward to getting an update in the minister’s speech today, not just an assurance that the government are thinking about it or that they care about the community broadcasting sector. I am very interested to hear an update from the minister with details of some time lines, technology and information about where the consultation is at, rather than just further assurances that everything will be fine if we just trust that the process is moving along.
The government needs to address these important factors in the digital switch-over more quickly and in more detail to ensure that many people, particularly Indigenous people and people on low incomes, are not cut out of the digital age when the analog transmission systems are switched off. In addition to setting deadlines, as it does with this legislation, the government will have to establish and deliver assistance schemes to those who cannot afford the switch-over and will also need to generate clear and simple public education materials to ensure that the population is ready. We are also interested, as Senator Minchin foreshadowed, in receiving much more detailed information about what take-up rate the government assumes is appropriate—for example, whether we are benchmarking against the take-up rate in the United Kingdom. The Senate should be provided with some more detail about exactly what criteria the minister will be using to benchmark the switch-over.
I note the minister’s press release of 19 October, where we got some detail on the 30-odd local market areas and the sequence order and the approximate time in which they would be switched over. Presumably there are some criteria underpinning those, so we know that such a thing must exist. I am a little bit curious that the minister is still asking for another six months to do so. Presumably that list was not established without criteria. We are certainly interested in hearing some more detail from the government as to how that list was compiled and the criteria under which the government will be undertaking the switch-over.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION SWITCH-OVER) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2008-12-03,"—It is my pleasure to also make a contribution on the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Television Switch-over) Bill 2008. I note that it is 58 years since then Prime Minister Robert Menzies first announced the program and process for the introduction of television into Australia. Back in those days few would have thought of the type of impact and reach that television could have, not just in Australian society but in society throughout the world, or how reliant on television we would become for our news, for our entertainment, for lifestyle, sport, leisure and so many key facets, from education right through all realms of society. I am advised that the word ‘television’ is derived from both Latin and Greek origins. I am far from a scholar in either of those languages, but I am advised that it means far sight. Certainly far sight or farsightedness is what is required in seeing an appropriate transition to digital television, particularly through the passage of this legislation.
This bill contains a number of key facets. Of utmost importance in the bill is facilitating a power for the minister to ensure switch-over dates for key local markets, to essentially end simulcasting of both analog and digital signals into those key markets and instead see a digital-only signal. As the house has already heard, the minister has announced a schedule of switch-over dates, commencing in Mildura and working right through until 2013 for those regions to be switched over. The coalition, as Senator Minchin has indicated, support the broad thrust of this legislation and we recognise that it is very important to so many Australians to get this right.
The bill also requires two statutory reviews, one related to the potential for a new commercial television licence to be issued and the other relating to content and captioning rules in Australia. We welcome this because it in a sense brings to an end what has been a period of some smoke and mirrors from the government in relation to digital television switch-over and transition. When the new minister was appointed after last year’s election, he found himself the subject of the razor gang early on. One of the early victims of the government’s razor gang was Digital Australia, the agency headed by Andy Townend which was tasked with ensuring the smooth transition for Australia to a digital television framework. Minister Tanner and others lauded the savings that were going to be reached through the abolition of Digital Australia, and we were all led to believe that this was the end of those areas of expenditure and the government would be finding a cheaper and a better way to do it. Lo and behold, a few months pass by and we see the development of the Digital Switchover Taskforce. We see that it is headed by Mr Andy Townend, the same person who was heading Digital Australia, somebody who, I have confidence, from his experience in the UK and elsewhere, is doing no doubt an excellent job in ensuring the switch-over process is handled correctly. The taskforce has been given allocations to ensure a smooth switch-over occurs, as it should, but in doing so we have seen those budget savings evaporate and simply be transferred. It is a nice smoke-and-mirrors trick to be able to say, ‘We have budget savings,’ and to be able to theoretically axe an agency but then in fact simply rebuild it elsewhere within the department.
This bill gives us a clear pathway to transition. It lets us know what Mr Townend and the taskforce will be doing to help Australians ensure that they can continue to enjoy the type of services that they have in the past in relation to television, and indeed much better ones, because the potential provided by digital knows few bounds in many ways and provides great opportunities for Australians to see new services and new opportunities on their television platforms.
I say it is important to get this right because, as I said at the outset, so many Australians rely on their televisions. The late great Groucho Marx was quoted as saying that he found television very educating: ‘Every time somebody turns on the set, I go into the other room and read a book.’ But obviously for many Australians that is far from the case as they come to rely on television as a key part of their evening entertainment, their education and otherwise. However, as of 11 April this year, only some 41.8 per cent of Australian households actually had the facilities and the technology to receive digital television. If subscription or pay television take-up is included in that, some 54 per cent of households had such services. That is a significant growth over the last few years that has seen Australians reach out and ensure that they do have access to digital television. I put on the record my praise particularly for the ABC, which I think has played a very key role in this through ABC2 and its promotion of that profile. Indeed that is so, if personal experience is anything to go by, because my partner’s aunt had us out a few weeks ago buying her a new television set because she wanted to watch ABC2. So I recognise that indeed new product is a key driver of the take-up and has been a key driver of that take-up over the last months and years. Of course, with the launch of the new Free TV platform by the commercial stations recently, we expect to see even further take-up of digital television right across Australia in years to come.
Nonetheless, that does not get us away from the fact that, without pay TV included, in April this year only a little over 40 per cent of Australian households had the technology to receive digital television. Without that technology, when the switch-over date comes they will not be able to receive a signal. That is the cold, hard truth. That is why the parliament needs to get this right. I am sure the minister would not want to be the minister for communications when tens of thousands of Australians go to switch on their television sets and discover that there is no signal anymore. I am quite sure that is the last thing the minister wants, so I know he is as eager as the coalition and the Liberal Party, which started the process towards digital television, to ensure that we get this switch-over process right. That is why, as Senator Minchin outlined, it is our intent to support the principle that Free TV Australia enunciated during the Senate committee inquiry into this bill. I pay tribute to the witnesses, those who made submissions to the inquiry and, indeed, our staff on the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Communications and the Arts, who, as always, did an outstanding job in assisting us through this issue.
Free TV rightly argued that there needs to be some form of readiness criteria. It is one thing for the minister to say we will have a switch-off date, one thing for there to be a cut-off date out there—and I understand the logic of trying to work towards that cut-off date and to do so in a manner that gives people a clear deadline by which to make the switch-over themselves—but, equally, we believe there needs to be a greater level of transparency from the government as to what they believe would be acceptable when Mildura, as the first region, is cut off and other regions are subsequently cut off from receiving an analog signal.
Free TV argued that 95 per cent of households should have the technology, facilities and resources to receive a signal before the switch-off occurs in a particular region or, as the bill defines it, ‘local market area’. The coalition are not being that prescriptive, and I am sure Senator Minchin, in the committee stage, will speak in more detail to the amendments that we seek to move. We are seeking, however, for the minister to have publicly available readiness criteria to ensure, as far as possible, that broadcast services achieve the same level of coverage and reception quality after the switch-over as was available previously, that households that previously received free-to-air coverage in analog mode continue to receive it in digital mode and that adequate measures have been taken to support those households, particularly those who can least afford to convert.
As I indicated, it is not our intent to prescribe, but it is our belief that the minister, with the work of the Digital Switchover Taskforce in the department, should set out some key readiness criteria against which each region and local market area can be assessed so that we know and have confidence that the switch-off will not unduly harm large numbers of Australians as this region-by-region process unfolds. More important than what we know is that people in the regions know and have confidence that they will not be disadvantaged through the switch-off process. I would urge the government to consider and support the coalition amendments when they are debated, because they will strengthen this process. They will strengthen the faith that people can have in the process and ensure that there is confidence across all of Australia that large numbers of individual households will not be disadvantaged during the switch-over.
There are a couple of other, broader issues. The minister, I know, is well aware of the specific challenges facing high-density dwellings such as apartment blocks in areas like the Gold Coast and some of the technical challenges of ensuring that switch-over occurs there. I know that some funding has been made available to address those technical challenges. I welcome that and look forward to the government ensuring that building owners and the residents in those types of dwellings are confident that they will be able to receive the signal they expect.
Senator Ludlam has rightly highlighted, as did Senator Minchin, the importance of this for community broadcasters. I too have received representations from community television broadcasters in my home state of South Australia. I am aware of the pressures they face at present. As increasing numbers of households switch to buying digital televisions, community broadcasters face the risk that, as they currently only have funding to broadcast an analog signal, over time they will lose their market share. I urge the government to resolve the issue with community broadcasters as soon as possible to ensure that they receive the funding necessary to allow them to make the transition to the digital television platform.
I also note the challenges for remote areas that Senator Ludlam spoke of and recognise that in regional and remote areas it will be equally important for the government to apply specific policy measures that allow broadcasters and communities to receive the types of signals that are required and not to be disadvantaged during this process.
In terms of disadvantage, can I finally reflect on one of the two statutory reviews that the government has highlighted, the review into content and captioning. Whilst I recognise that the intent of this is to ensure that broadcasters with the new multichannelling that will be and is available to them on the digital platform continue to provide the types of services that Australians rightly expect in terms of the languages available, the range of children’s programs and standards across those multichannels, it is equally important to make sure that we do not disadvantage those regional broadcasters who have to make the switch first. The risk in bringing forward this review of content and captioning requirements is, of course, that those regional broadcasters could find themselves on the digital platform and having to adhere to certain standards before those standards apply elsewhere. That would be nonsensical. In undertaking this review, should there be—as I expect there would be—some changes made to the requirements, I urge the government to have those changes not take effect until closer to 2013, when all regions, all local market areas, will have made the switch-over.
In closing, I urge the government to consider the issues raised. I think this is an issue about which all members of the Senate are as one in hoping that Australia gets this right. We hope that the digital transition is a success—that Australians get to enjoy the enormous potential benefits provided by digital television and that the continued evolution of television in Australian society is a positive one. But we also hope that it is not done in a manner that creates risk or harm, be it to regional broadcasters, to people in high-density dwellings, to those less fortunate who may not be able to afford the equipment required to make the transition or to regions where take-up is somewhat slower than elsewhere. We need to have confidence that they are ready before switch-off occurs. I urge the government to consider and accept the amendments that the coalition will be moving so that we can all support the bill with confidence.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION SWITCH-OVER) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2008-12-03,"—As has been said, the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Television Switch-over) Bill 2008 makes amendments to the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 to enable the government to set a staggered, region-by-region digital switch-over timetable for the transition to digital-only television around Australia, with the final switch-over date being in 2013. It is important to note that the process of digital conversion in Australia has been a longer saga, as I have said elsewhere, than Blue Hills. The idea of switching to digital television has been around for a very long time. The process of actually getting there has been very slow indeed.
In fact, the first time I saw digital television was at an exhibition here in Parliament House in 1998 when the various television companies set up a display of digital TV in the Main Committee room. I must say that, although it was only a standard definition picture, I was very impressed by the clarity and the quality of the picture. But the people I spoke to at Channel 10 told me that standard definition was only part of the story; the real glory of digital television was in high-definition broadcasting. They said to me that it was a pity that I could not go to the International Broadcasting Convention being held in Amsterdam the weekend after that display, because that conference was devoted to digital television and would include high-definition digital television and multichannelling.
As it happened, I could go, because I was going to a conference in Trinidad and would be going through London that weekend. I diverted to Amsterdam and went to the International Broadcasting Convention, where I was stunned by what digital television had to offer. It was not just the quality of the picture—and the quality of the high-definition picture is, of course, quite amazing. More important, I felt, was the opportunity to multichannel. You could have several pictures of, say, a sporting event, looked at from different angles, and there were various other options which multichannelling offered. I thought that the great benefits that multichannelling offered were what we should be seeking to bring to Australia from digital television. It meant that you could, for example, have a channel devoted to children’s education. You could have channels devoted to other speciality interests. For example, there could be three ABC channels: one devoted to education, one devoted to children’s programs and then the ordinary ABC channel. This could also be done by the commercial channels. I returned to Australia highly enthusiastic about the possibilities that digital television offered. I spoke to then Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Richard Alston about what I saw as this exciting option. Later that year, he also went to Europe and also had a look at digital television.
But, as Senator Birmingham has said, the progress towards the switch-over date has been very slow indeed. There were various factors which came into play, as Senator Birmingham has said. Among them, of course, was that different commercial channels in Australia had views about the desirability or otherwise of converting to digital television. While we procrastinate, the delay will go on. Until Australians have been able to see the brilliance of digital television, which they can now, they will be unwilling to convert. The quickest conversion in the world was in the United Kingdom, where the satellite television channel there, BSkyB, gave every household a set-top box. Every household in the UK had a set-top box free of charge, and they were able to watch digital television on their analog set. Given that there are about seven million houses in Australia and set-top boxes cost about $50 these days, if the Australian commercial television broadcasters were of a mind to spend $35 million and present each household in Australia with a set-top box, I think Australia would move very quickly into the digital era. Although it has been a long, slow road, we are getting there. I welcome this legislation.
Some of the television channels were reluctant to switch to digital and multichannelling, believing, I suppose, that this would protect their market position. Channel Seven need to be respected because they wished to switch to digital and multichannelling much earlier than some of the other commercial channels have. It is very interesting that, while the commercial channels have lagged in agreeing to the digital switch over, subscription TV has gone ahead by leaps and bounds. Subscription TV not only is solely digital now but also offers about 130 channels. I believe Foxtel is now in about 30 per cent of the households in metropolitan Sydney. Equally, around the rest of the country people are showing that they like the option of digital television and multichannels. I am sure that is a message the commercials are picking up, because now they are moving towards a digital conversion.
I would like to make a special mention of regional television services needing special assistance to make the conversion to digital television. In Western Australia, for example, we have two satellite based commercial networks which, rather than just having one transmitter in one capital city as the capital city commercials do, have to have a transmitter in every town in Western Australia—and there are quite a lot of them. The cost of putting in the equipment to receive and transmit a digital signal in all those different locations is quite high, and that same consideration would apply to regional television services in other states around the country.
Both Senator Ludlam and Senator Birmingham have mentioned community television. I think it is very important that community television not be forgotten in this question of the digital conversion. Community television, unlike commercial television, is not well funded, but it does provide an important service to the community. In Western Australia, regrettably, Channel 31 in Perth, which was an excellent community television station, has folded. It found that being unable to transmit in digital meant that it continually lost viewers to the other, digital, channels in Western Australia, so it was not able to continue its broadcasts and the company has closed down. That really is a matter of regret, because Channel 31 Perth was probably the best community television service in Australia. For example, it trained young people in television technology so that they could go out and get employment in the commercial world of television. It did this under the Green Corps program, which seems to be a rather strange use of Green Corps, but nevertheless many young people in Perth received training in television technology at Channel 31, and I for one was very sorry that it had to wind up its operations.
In conclusion, I welcome this bill because, while it does not provide for a switch-over date in the near future—with a final switch-over date towards the end of 2013—at least there is now a definite switch-over date. When that occurs, the conversion-to-digital saga will still not be the longest saga in Australian commercial broadcasting history—that honour will still belong to Blue Hills!",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION SWITCH-OVER) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2008-12-03,"—Time is short as we approach the end of the legislative year. Because of the mismanagement of the program by the government, we are being asked to keep our remarks to a minimum. My colleagues Senator Birmingham and Senator Eggleston have both given the background to the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Television Switch-over) Bill 2008. I congratulate Senator Coonan, the former Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, for getting the digital television program on its way. It is good to see the current government continuing that enthusiasm. I speak as one who has for several years had a set-top box on my television set. In Townsville, in regional Northern Australia, where I come from, all three commercials have been ready for high-definition digital television for some time. We have the benefit of the second ABC channel even in the north of Australia, where I live.
I did raise with the minister at estimates the situation where the first area to be required to go fully digital is one region in Victoria, which, I understand, has the greatest number of set-top boxes already installed. I also understand from estimates that the second region is my home region of Townsville in North Queensland. I expressed the concern that there was a cost being put onto Townsville residents—the cost of acquiring a set-top box or a new television—at an early stage and which would not be imposed upon city viewers until two or three years later. I understand that the commercial television stations in the north and elsewhere are very keen to have the analog switch-off as soon as possible. They are very keen to avoid the cost of simulcasting in both analog and digital, and I appreciate that that is an issue for the station owners.
I suspect that, when push comes to shove, most people will spend the money on the set-top box. I was in Crazy Clark’s the other day—and I will speak softly so that I do not interrupt Minister Conroy’s slumber, Mr Acting Deputy President Marshall; I will keep my voice down—which is one of those stores that sell cheaper goods, and I think I saw a set-top box there for $28. I am not quite sure what the quality would be like, but certainly the price of a decent set-top box now is much less than it was when I bought one a couple of years ago. So, hopefully, people will be able to be involved.
One of the things that concern me, though, is that there will be black spots. Unfortunately, while ACMA did have an office in Townsville for many years, I understand, through estimates, that that is about to be shut down, and five people who used to work at the ACMA office in Townsville will now be relocated to Brisbane. So there will not be anyone on the spot to deal with black-spot issues, which do occur in all parts of Australia, I am sure. In Townsville it is because of Castle Hill and Mount Stuart and other intervening physical features. A lot of work does need to be done to ensure that all residents are eligible to get a television signal. With the early move to a digital-only signal in Townsville, I think it is very important that the minister and the government ensure that there is a process in place whereby black spots can be, first of all, identified and confirmed and then addressed, and I would be interested to hear the minister’s views on this. It is of course something that we will continue to pursue through estimates.
Apart from that, as my colleagues have mentioned, the coalition does support the bill—with the amendment to be moved by Senator Minchin, which is a very sensible and worthwhile amendment and one which I urge the Senate to support when it comes up in the committee stage.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION SWITCH-OVER) BILL 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2008-12-03,"—The Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Television Switch-over) Bill 2008 implements the government’s policy to achieve the digital switch-over by the end of 2013. The bill does not change the objectives of the existing legislative framework for digital television under the Broadcasting Services Act. Rather, these amendments to the act will give the government greater flexibility within the existing framework to deal with the unique challenges of the digital television switch-over in Australia.
The bill will enable the government to set a phased, region-by-region switch-over timetable for the transition to digital-only television. This will allow the switch-over process to be carefully managed across the country and to ensure that everyone who currently receives analog free-to-air television will be able to receive digital free-to-air television by the time the switch-over is completed in December 2013.
The bill provides for the Minister for Broadband, Communications and the Digital Economy to determine, by legislative instrument, local market areas for switch-over. This will allow areas smaller than television licence areas to be the basis of a switch-over timetable. This will enable the government’s switch-over program to better reflect local market conditions and circumstances. The bill gives the minister power to determine switch-over dates for those local market areas and for television licence areas. The bill will also allow switch-over dates to be brought forward in some areas if this is considered appropriate. Currently, the simulcast period can only be extended.
The bill provides for switch-over dates for a particular area to be varied by up to three months before or after the date originally determined by the minister. This will allow the government to identify a six-month window for switch-over in a particular local market or licence area and for the switch-over date to be finalised in response to local issues as they arise. The government is required to consult ACMA before making or varying a determination. The government will also be advised by the Digital Switchover Taskforce on decisions to vary switch-over dates within the six-month window. The bill also provides for significant and unforeseen events that could make it technically difficult for a broadcaster to commence digital-only broadcasting by the determined date. In such cases, the switch-over date can be extended by more than three months. However, there can be no extension to the switch-over date beyond 30 June 2014.
The bill sets firm dates for the timing of two existing statutory reviews, to provide certainty for industry and to reflect the government’s switch-over program. A review concerning the content and captioning rules applicable to commercial television multichannels will be conducted before 1 January 2010. This review will include consideration of the effect of a staggered switch-over timetable on broadcaster obligations. A review concerning the allocation of new commercial television broadcasting licences will occur before 1 January 2012. This review is currently legislated to occur before switch-over begins.
Given the complex technical issues involved, responsibility for overseeing digital television switch-over in remote licence areas will be retained by ACMA in consultation with the Digital Switchover Taskforce. Consistent with metropolitan and non-remote regional areas, the bill requires switch-over in remote licence areas to occur by 31 December 2013.
I want to make a few comments about the proposed opposition amendments. The key difference between the approach of this government and that of the previous government with respect to digital television is that this government has actually set a date—not a target, not an ambition but a date. This firm timetable to implement switch-over has provided certainty for consumers and industry in the transition to digital. A firm switch-over timetable will give a strong focal point for information campaigns and will also help complementary industry campaigns such as the Freeview campaign which—as those who were lucky enough to be at the launch last week would know—is the most exciting development in free-to-air television in probably 50 years. It is probably even bigger than colour TV, I would say, Senator Minchin. I am sure you remember black-and-white television.
—I do remember.
—This is going to be bigger than the excitement when you moved from that black-and-white set to a colour set. A firm timetable will also provide certainty for industry in planning for a post-analog environment.
I cannot stress enough the importance of a timetable. Manufacturers will not respond to targets. Manufacturers will not respond to ambitions. They will only agree to produce the equipment that we need to drive digital uptake if they believe there is a firm target. A firm timetable will also allow broadcasters to plan for the retirement of analog equipment. This is particularly important in regional and rural Australia. The previous government set a target of 2008. If the previous government had kept its word, we would have already switched off. It would be happening right now. But, as you can see from the statistics, without a firm commitment from the manufacturers, from the broadcasters and from all the other stakeholders in this sector, after seven years of digital television we have gone almost nowhere. It is only in the last 12 months, with the pressure from this government, and by setting the target, that we have seen industry agreement about the Freeview box and a manufacturing agreement to start producing low-cost equipment to put into the market. What will come from this legislation, ultimately, is an advertising campaign to inform Australians about how they can go about switching over. All of this stems from one decision that this government had the courage to make—unlike the previous government, which could not actually bite the bullet.
To be fair, Senator Eggleston and Senator Birmingham discussed some of the difficulties that the previous government faced. I am not being completely partisan, because this is a complex and difficult area. But what we see with the opposition amendments is that the government would be required to report on the switch-over readiness of an area six months before the scheduled switch-over date. Where the area is not deemed ready, they would develop a plan to rectify this or delay switch-over in this area. This is a recipe to go back to the future. This is a recipe to return to the situation of, ‘If you don’t want the possibility of new competitors in the market, you give people an economic incentive to go very slowly.’ That was a fundamental flaw in the previous government’s strategy. It gave an economic incentive for those who needed to help drive the change to actually drive the change incredibly slowly. That is the key difference. We have said, ‘No, we are going to push on; we are going to keep the pressure on and we are going to deliver this.’ It is not just about a better picture. It is about the interactivity; it is about the set-top boxes; it is about the capacity to record, shift and watch television when you want to watch it. It is a fundamental paradigm shift that will come from moving to digital and closing down analog. What the opposition’s amendments seek to do, in a very benign way, is to actually gut the incentive of key stakeholders to continue to drive the agenda. It may sound very benign, Senator Williams—

Senator Williams interjecting—

—No, that sounds so reasonable. The problem is that it was that reasonable approach which handed control of the agenda to stakeholders who had an incentive to do nothing. This amendment would achieve that. It would hand back the incentive to go slow.
The opposition also proposes that reports be issued every three months, until 1 September 2014, on transmission black spots. The Digital Tracker program announced in March 2008 will provide this information to the public on a regular basis throughout the switch-over process. We already have in place a mechanism to deliver the very outcome that is being suggested. The Digital Tracker will provide national and switch-over-area-specific results for actual conversion, intentions to convert, understanding and awareness, amongst other performance indicators. The combination of these four factors will establish the percentage of the population that is ready for switch-over—that is, the number of viewers who have or will convert and are aware of the digital switch-over in their area. The proposed amendments would create unnecessary process, given that the Digital Tracker has already been established to provide this information. The process would also deprive both industry and consumers of certainty in switch-over, highlighted by the former government’s Digital Action Plan as being so important.
Let me be clear: the work done previously said, ‘Look, you’ve got to do this,’ and we have responded. The bill already provides for switch-over to be delayed in a particular area by up to three months to take into account specific local market issues that may arise. I note that the opposition’s amendments do not propose to extend the time that the government could delay switch-over. The government will be required to consult ACMA before making or varying a switch-over date and will be advised by the Digital Switchover Taskforce on decisions to vary switch-over dates within the six-month window.
The absence of publicly defined targets does not preclude the establishment of internal targets which will facilitate and promote effective management of the switch-over program. This will include using data obtained from the Digital Tracker program. The Digital Tracker will become part of the overall risk management approach to be adopted by the government. The tracker will provide a continuous source of publicly available data on which to base this assessment. Rather than delaying switch-over due to lower than expected levels of readiness in an area, the tracker will be a powerful management tool for both government and broadcasters to ensure that the original switch-over date is met.
The switch to digital television is important to Australia. Digital TV provides the potential for new digital channels to be delivered with vastly improved picture and sound quality. Digital switch-over will also free up valuable spectrum capacity for a range of next-generation communications technologies, including wireless telephony and broadcasting services.
This bill makes the necessary amendments to the existing legislative framework to ensure a smooth, well-managed transition to digital-only television for the benefit of all Australians. I know that Senator Ludlam has raised a number of issues around community television. While I am not able to reveal all of the information that I think he would like, I assure him that the government recognises the important place that community TV holds in the Australian media landscape. This bill aims to set in place the framework by which the government can achieve digital switch-over in keeping with the original legislative framework. It is not intended to provide a pathway for community television to switch to digital.
The previous government’s Digital Action Plan provided no firm pathway for transitioning community TV from analog to digital. Unlike the previous government, the Rudd government is committed to ensuring that community TV has a future in digital broadcasting. We have actively engaged with the community TV sector on this issue. Community TV’s representative body, ACTA, has a representative on the Digital Switchover Taskforce Industry Advisory Group. That is how seriously we take the role and importance of community television—we have included them in the process.
In the interim, I note that most digital televisions in Australia are capable of receiving analog services, including community television, and also that analog televisions that receive digital through a set-top box can continue to receive analog community television. But, again, to reassure the Senate, community TV is an integral part of Australian broadcasting and the government is committed to its future. We have had extensive conversations. I have met with community TV as a group two or three times over the last 12 months and with individual stations on a number of occasions. I have written to the Western Australian Premier, the Queensland Premier and the South Australian Premier to assure them that we will be delivering a pathway to the community television sector and they should not consider whatever funding arrangements they have in their own states as something that should be withdrawn on the basis that there is no future. So I have taken concrete steps to reassure Western Australia, South Australia and Queensland, where there have been a number of difficulties over the last 12 months or so—not so much in South Australia, but they are a fledgling organisation. I have spoken with a number of premiers and ministers directly to reassure them that there will be a transition path for community television. We take it very seriously. In fact, in the last 48 hours, I met with one of the state based community TV organisations to discuss these very issues. So our door, unlike the previous government’s, is wide open to the community TV sector, and we take very seriously our obligations.
Community TV provides valuable training, valuable educational information and valuable entertainment. We do not resile from our commitment to deliver a pathway. It is complex; it is not possible to set down one national pathway at this stage. It may be that the individual states are dealt with on an individual basis because the available amount of spectrum in some areas is limited. In Perth—as I am sure you are familiar with, Senator Ludlam—they actually have a surplus of spectrum. It is an easier solution, ultimately, for community television in Western Australia than in, say, Brisbane. There are complex issues and competing claims. A whole raft of issues were shoved under the carpet by the previous government, who were interested not in finding solutions but in bumping them off and moving them somewhere else so they could flog off spectrum to the highest bidder, and they did not really care what happened to community TV after that. That was a very active consideration. Well, that is not the approach being taken by the Rudd government.
Question agreed to.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2008-12-03,"—Our transport industry is a very, very important part of Australia’s internal trade and of what makes us such a great nation. The fact that we can have trucks and carrying vehicles moving freely throughout the country helps our economic position and helps many of the small business men who are involved in the trucking industry. These bills before the parliament today are of fairly great significance to Australia’s economy. The Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2008 and the associated bill, the Road Charges Legislation Repeal and Amendment Bill 2008, are the matters in discussion today.
The first bill, the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2008, permits the making of regulations to apply new registration charges to the five per cent of heavy vehicles registered under the Australian government’s Federal Interstate Registration Scheme, which I will refer to hereafter as FIRS. These new charges were agreed by the Commonwealth, state and territory ministers at the Australian Transport Council in February this year. The states and territories have already implemented the charge schedule on heavy vehicles under their registration systems. That means that 95 per cent of Australia’s heavy-vehicle fleet is already operating under the revised registration schedule. The first bill, the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2008, updates some of the definitions contained in the original act, establishes a disallowable charge-setting mechanism based on regulation and stipulates a table of charges or an annual adjustment process.
The FIRS provides an alternative to state based registration for heavy vehicles weighing more than 4.5 tonnes and is designed to provide uniform charges and operating conditions for heavy vehicles that carry interstate goods exclusively. Currently, slightly more than 21,000 heavy vehicles in Australia are registered under the FIRS. In the case of the ACT, locally registered trucks are subject to the Road Transport Charges (ACT) Act. That act applies charges that are calculated on the same basis as the trucks registered under the FIRS. In the ACT, there are some 2,550-odd trucks that are locally registered, of which 91 per cent are rigid. This means that the majority of the ACT-registered truck owners would see their registration fees go down if the ACT were able to apply the new charges agreed by the Transport Council. Moreover, in spite of limited application to the FIRS for Australia’s heavy-vehicle fleet, the coalition does recognise that the scheme not only promotes regulatory consistency solely involved in interstate operations but also provides some competition and discipline in the heavy-vehicle industry. In the other chamber, the shadow minister for trade, transport, regional development and local government, Mr Truss, spoke at some length about this bill and indicated as I now do that the coalition will not be opposing the first of these two bills.
The second bill, the Road Charges Legislation Repeal and Amendment Bill, does two things. It appeals the Road Transport Charges (ACT) Act so that the ACT may set its own heavy-vehicle charges. We believe that the ACT should be free to make such decisions, and we support that element of the legislation. The second part of the bill, though, relates to a different issue, and amends the Fuel Tax Act 2006 to implement a road user charge at the rate of 21c a litre from 1 January 2009. The road user charge is levied on the basis that the costs arising from the industry’s use of the road system should be recovered. Both the trucking industry and the coalition accept this in principle, but what is important is that the amount being levied is seen to be fair and that it is spent on roads.
Motorists and the trucking industry currently pay 38.14c in tax for every litre of fuel they purchase; however, the trucking industry may claim a partial rebate under the Fuel Tax Act. This act sets for the heavy vehicle sector a road user charge which is intended to cover the costs attributable to the industry’s use of the road system. Trucking operators receive through the tax system a rebate of the difference between the fuel tax they pay at the pump and the road user charge. The road user charge is currently 19.633c per litre; the rebate is, therefore, 18.510c per litre. Should the road user charge be set at 21c a litre, the rebate will only be 17.143c per litre. This increase is the result of a decision by the Australian transport ministers earlier this year to support the National Transport Commission’s fourth heavy vehicle charges determination, a set of charges levied upon the heavy vehicle industry based on the principle of cost recovery for the roads.
The government has also attempted to implement this tax increase before. Senators may recall that in March this year, when introducing the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill 2008, the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government flagged the intention of the government to implement a new heavy vehicle determination and increase the road use charge from 1 January 2009. He also stated the road user charge was to be indexed annually to the same road construction formula that was to apply to registration charges. The coalition is concerned that this was an attempt by the Rudd government to reintroduce indexation of the fuel excise. You will recall that, after years of Labor government indexation of fuel prices—it was introduced by Mr Keating—the indexation was abolished by the coalition in 2001. Our opposition on this matter has not changed; we remain opposed to fuel excise indexation on fuel. That is why, with regard to that road user charge, the opposition here disallowed the regulation made under the Fuel Tax Act in May of this year.
In this bill, the government has removed the link to indexation. The Road Charges Legislation Repeal and Amendment Bill 2008 would repeal the relevant section of the Fuel Tax Act and add a new subsection which would set the road user charge at 21c per litre and enable the government to make regulations at other times that may be prescribed. This would be a disallowable instrument. We acknowledge that the government has made this change and we think it is quite a constructive improvement. Industry, however, remains concerned about the manner in which the National Transport Commission develops the road user charge. Its consultation process appears flawed and it refused to disclose to the trucking industry much of the data and the model it used to develop the charge. The coalition is concerned that the government has also linked these bills to the implementation of its announcement of a $70 million, four-year, heavy vehicle safety and productivity package.
We call upon the government to stop this tactic of blackmail, which seems to be much in vogue by the government these days. In the education bill we just dealt with, the government used what were effectively bully-boy blackmail tactics. It seems to be the case for this heavy vehicle safety and productivity package as well. To threaten to block the $70 million package, inadequate though we think that is, should these bills not be passed, is pretty grubby politics and harms the safety of those who work on our roads. It suggests that the government is more interested in collecting taxes than in industry productivity and safety. Governments collect huge revenues from taxes on motorists and the transport industry. More of that money should be allocated for roads. New tax increases are not in themselves required.
There are no performance benchmarks in the package. There is nothing, for example, that stipulates how many roadside facilities will be built. How can truck operators be sure that they will get the benefits being traded for these increases in the road user charges? Likewise, the government does not link the new charges to the obligations of the states to deliver their promises to harmonise transport regulation. It is unknown what the government is doing about the appalling failure of the states to implement cross-border changes to the rules which so impede the development of an efficient, cost-effective national road system. Labor said when it was elected to office that, because there would then be wall-to-wall Labor governments around Australia, they would fix these interstate inconsistencies and state differences. In transport reform, the Rudd government has failed dismally, and it is not allowing another opportunity to deliver these reforms at this time. These are key weaknesses of the bill before us in that they do not address the fundamental problems of regulation reform.
Because of that, the coalition will be moving a number of amendments relating to confirming that under no circumstances can the government consider an indexation element to the increases in the road charge in the future. We are agreeing with the increase from, effectively, 19-odd cents to 21-odd cents, because we believe that that additional money can be put to very good effect. Unfortunately, the bill does not carry through and say that, so we are going to be moving amendments to address those issues. At this stage I do not want to take too much time of the Senate in this debate on the second reading speech. Suffice it to say that, as I mentioned earlier, we want to ensure that indexation is never a possibility. We then want to ensure that the additional money recovered goes to at least an average of 50 additional heavy vehicle rest areas per year for the next four years. We want to make sure that the rest areas are appropriately constructed.
We want to link these increases as well to substantial harmonisation in state and territory transport regulations. I know some of my colleagues will be mentioning some of the huge inconsistencies there are between the different states at the present time which cause a lot of difficulty for the transport industry. We also want to ensure that, when the government does consider increasing the excise in the years ahead—and it will not be able to do that by indexation; we are determined to put a stop to that—there is proper and appropriate public consultation. Our amendments will deal with how that consultation should proceed, and we want to make sure that the transport minister has regard to those submissions when considering the issue. I will, of course, speak in more detail about that during the committee stage of the bill.
Before I conclude I want to mention briefly another issue which will play havoc with the Australian road transport industry, as well as with all of those ordinary Australians who travel interstate in the course of either their business or, perhaps more importantly, their holidays. That is the stupid proposal being put forward by the Bligh Labor government in Queensland to ensure that a new system is put in place so that New South Welshmen and other Australians cannot temporarily receive the benefit of Queensland’s lower fuel prices—because Queensland, you might recall, has never had a fuel tax. That is something for which we can give thanks to the Bjelke-Petersen and Chalk governments and other Liberal-National Party governments in past years in Queensland. It has been followed by the Labor government. There is no fuel tax in Queensland, so our fuel should be eight cents a litre cheaper than that of others. And that has been the case for some time.
As you can imagine, as you get closer to the border, New South Welshmen slip over the border to fill up in Queensland because they can get cheaper fuel there. To address that, the New South Wales government had sort of a series of incremental fuel taxes as you went to closer to the Queensland border, so that New South Welshmen and businesses up in the north of New South Wales would not be unfairly disadvantaged—so that they would not have a competitive disadvantage when competing with Queenslanders in that South-East Queensland, north-east New South Wales section of our country.
The current Labor government in New South Wales is just appalling. Everyone knows just how hopelessly incompetent that Labor government has been with its financial management—even more so than the Rudd Labor government is demonstrating that it is at the current time. That is accepted by all sides of this chamber at the present time. But without thinking of what it would do to businesses and people in the north of the state, they have just cut out all of those incremental increases. That means that businesses and people in northern New South Wales will be competitively disadvantaged compared to those of us who live in Queensland and have a cheaper rate of petrol. That clearly was not thought through by the New South Wales Labor government and is just another example of their complete mismanagement of their economy—typical of all Labor governments.
What is the Queensland government going to do to stop those horrible New South Welshmen slipping across the border and getting our cheaper petrol? We are all going to get a bar code on our licences so that, when we Queenslanders go in to fill up with fuel, we will swipe our cards and, if we have the right bar code—providing we have remembered to bring our licence with us, and a lot of us do not travel with our licences—we get our petrol at the cheaper price. But, if we are New South Welshmen, if we are truck drivers coming through delivering goods to Queensland, if we happen to have forgotten our licence or if we work for someone who has company vehicles and we do not leave our licence there, then we will have to pay the dearer price of petrol. And I understand, from the Queensland position, you will not be able to get a refund at all.
But the real problem is this new system being introduced by yet another Labor government—this time the Queensland Labor government—which will mean an enormous impost on independent fuel sellers. We have heard all the fine speeches during that debacle of a Fuelwatch program put up by the federal Labor government about how we want to promote competition. This proposal by the Queensland Labor government will stifle competition. Sure, the majors, the big fellows, the chains will be able to afford the $40,000 that I understand it is going to cost every service station to put in this card-swipe thing, but the independents, the little people, will simply not be able to afford the $40,000. They will therefore go out of business, and that will mean less competition in the fuel business in Queensland.
There is going to be more about that. There is an election coming up in Queensland. The Labor government cannot work out whether they want to bring it in before the budget—they have got to do something because their budget is also in diabolical trouble—or whether they will leave it until after the election and hope that they scrape back in. So there will be a lot more about that. But I warn the Senate now that this is going to have an enormous impact on interstate trade. There will be privacy conditions that will be of federal relevance. There will be many issues that will need to be addressed by parliament, and I just want to alert the Senate to that impending bungle and stupidity from the Queensland Labor government at this early stage.",SENATE,<title>INTERSTATE ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Williams, Sen John",NATS,2008-12-03,"—I would just like to have a brief talk on this whole road user charge. To support what my friend Senator Macdonald has just said, New South Wales really is becoming a farce. We have seen the extra cost of fuel in New South Wales; that is just one of the reasons why up to 500 people a week move from New South Wales to Queensland. Yet what did we see at the last federal election? Where New South Wales used to have 50 federal seats, we got reduced to 49 seats. We had the seat of Gwydir, the seat of the former Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson, taken from us, and another seat formed in Queensland—the new seat of Flynn—so that Queensland went up from 27 federal seats to 28. This is typical of what is happening in New South Wales with the state Labor government, which, as Senator Macdonald said—and as everyone around here must agree—is in complete disarray, in complete meltdown mode and is driving people out of the state.
I take your attention back to Labor’s history on fuel excise. Back in 1983, when the Hawke-Keating government was elected, the federal excise was around 6.3c a litre. Of course, they were quick to introduce indexation on fuel. Putting fuel tax up is one of the Labor Party’s traditional policies and they are sticking with it. When they left in 1996, thanks be to that, it was 34c a litre. The Hawke-Keating government took fuel excise from 6.3c a litre to 34c a litre. Mr Keating would say there were no new taxes or increases in taxes but, after the election, he would say, ‘Throw another 5c on fuel while we are at it.’ Now we have Mr Rudd increasing the road user charge on our transport industry—from 19.5c to around 21c. I must say that I am a little disappointed in the representatives from the transport industry. Although I have not been in this chamber for long, the word I have had from my friends is that during the coalition’s era any suggestion of increasing the road user charge would have been a terrible idea and would face huge objection. The industry now seems to say, ‘All right, we are going to pay our way; we will accept the increase to 21c.’ I am disappointed in that.
I go back to the election promise of Mr Rudd: ‘We will put downward pressure on grocery prices.’ Where I live in country New South Wales, there are no rail lines, no rail network. Everything comes in by road. Increasing the tax on our transport industry to lead to lower grocery prices? I have yet to work that one out. It is another cost so that country communities will have to pay more for their freight. The businesses will pass the cost on to the consumer, and the ordinary Joe Blow on the street will pay for it. That is what we are facing here. Of course, indexation is the thing that the Labor Party are good at. They are trying to do it now with our transport industry—not with the CPI but some sort of cost increase each year that spits out of a computer according to how much it cost to maintain our road system. This is more cost on the very people, the truckies, who shift our exports, who keep our nation alive and who actually drive the nation.
That is what this is about today. I can assure you that the coalition will be flatly refusing any suggestion of any indexation. That is why our amendments will be there: to see that that will not be introduced. I sincerely hope that Senator Xenophon, Senator Fielding and the Greens have a good close look at this and see what we are doing to our nation, especially those who live outside the cities, those who do not have public transport and those who require fuel to transport their wheat, wool, cattle, sheep and exports. These are vital products and export dollars this nation needs. To tax them more is simply disgraceful.
We make no bones about it. Having spent a lot of time in trucks over the years myself, I know that more rest areas are required. We have these stringent regulations now where if a truckie goes past their allocated hours in their work diaries—as there are now, instead of logbooks—they face severe fines, but what a situation it is when the time is expiring in their work diary but they cannot find a rest stop or anywhere to park the truck. This is a problem especially if it is raining and you cannot just pull up on the side of the road for fear of bogging the truck and being stranded there. We will certainly be pushing for that in our amendments. We will also be pushing for some consistent driver rules throughout the states. We saw back on 29 September, from memory, new driver regulations brought in in several states around Australia. It was a crazy situation. In Queensland, if you were working within 200 kilometres of your home base, you did not have to fill in a work diary. But in Victoria if you were within 100 kilometres you did not have to fill in a work diary. If it was 101 kilometres you did, but in Queensland it was 201 kilometres. In New South Wales, the state of red tape—well known for it under the changing premiers of Carr, Iemma and now Rees—as soon as you left home, nought kilometres from home, you had to fill in a work diary. The little delivery trucks around Sydney, delivering the milk, had to spend half a day filling in paperwork. They have put it on ice for 12 months, but these are the crazy differential regulations that drivers have to face around the nation.
There are a lot of other laws. There is the 84-hour rule instead of the previous 144-hour rule. After driving for 84 hours in a week—and of course going by the logbook rules—the driver has to stop for 24 hours. I know of situations where friends of mine in the livestock-carrying industry might have to go off to Charters Towers or somewhere to cart cattle to the abattoirs, and they will get up there and then they have got to turn the truck off for 24 hours. The truck driver just sits around in the sleeper cab or wherever. Wouldn’t it be better if there were more consistency in relation to a little bit of flexibility? Perhaps they could stop for 12 hours, have a good night’s sleep in the truck, load up the next day and still get on with their work. Then after 144 hours they could take their 24 hours off. The situation is crazy. It is restricting our productivity and it is costing the nation a lot of money. We will be moving these amendments today so that the government cannot have this indexation be automatic.
As I said, I have been through the history of the Labor Party’s indexation on fuel and fuel costs. We know full well the National Party’s stand. I remember former Deputy Prime Minister John Anderson demanding the fuel rebate to the transport industry several years ago to relieve the cost to that industry and to help this nation be competitive against many of our overseas competitors, such as America, who have a lot less fuel tax. That is our history; we know it. We will be here to keep them honest today, and I urge the crossbenchers to have a good close look at this. This is vital legislation. As I said, the industry has conceded the 21c. So be it; they are prepared to pay their way. We will remember that later on when we are in government, and hopefully that will not be far away. That is where we stand and that is about all I have to say.",SENATE,<title>INTERSTATE ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"McGauran, Sen Julian",LP,2008-12-03,"—I join my colleagues Senator Macdonald and Senator Williams. I am inspired to jump up by Senator Williams. A former truck driver himself, he knows only too well the costs and the pressures upon truck drivers—made up not just of the big transport companies but of owner-drivers, median operators who own up to six trucks. This is an industry that really reflects some of the best entrepreneurial elements of the economy of Australia, of Australians. This is a fine industry. There are so many people who can make their way and build and feed their family unit via this industry, particularly the single owner-drivers. These single owner-drivers are also vulnerable to the brunt of the changes in the economy—more so now than ever—to interest rates and to costs and charges put onto them by the government. Senator Williams finely represents them in this chamber.
The Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2008 and the Road Charges Legislation Repeal and Amendment Bill 2008 are in fact, in short, an increase of the costs and charges of these drivers and the industry. It ought to be made clear from the start: this is not just legislation that increases costs and charges on big operators, the big end of town—and some of those do make up the industry; they always have—this is really legislation that increases costs and charges on the owner-operators, who make up, I dare say, the majority of the industry.
That is why I would like to reflect on the history of these bills. In another form, not much different, they came into the parliament in February. That date is very significant because the Rudd government was elected only some three months earlier, so you would assume the cabinet met in January to approve these bills. So, just two months into the Rudd government’s term, they make a decision to increase costs and charges—classic Labor. One of their first decisions is to increase the costs and charges upon the owner-operators, the truckies. What a classic Labor decision that is. What is more, they sought to bring back the old Hawke-Keating indexation of fuel. This is in January of the brand-new government’s term. They did not hesitate. They returned to their instinctive nature.
—Upped the taxes.
—They upped the taxes, upped the charges and indexed it while they were at it. That is what they decided to do to those working families within months of coming into government, before they had even handed down their first budget.
We should have seen the signs, Senator Williams. When they handed down their first budget in May an array of new taxes were introduced: alcopop taxes, condensate taxes, luxury car taxes and passenger movement taxes—taxes that they certainly did not announce before the election. I did not hear them announce that they were going to introduce taxes to the tune of $19 billion before the election, Senator Conroy—I never heard that announced. But they all came gushing in from left field, literally—
—Left wing.
—‘left wing’ says my colleague—in the first budget. It caught everyone by surprise, journalists and the parliament, let alone the people that would be paying those taxes. But we should have seen the signs very early on, because early on in the term of this government they sought to increase the costs and charges upon truck drivers of this country. It was one of the first decisions they made. That is the history of this legislation, and they have not let go.
It is now 12 months into the government’s term and they are still insistent on increasing those charges. What has changed from February to now? A lot has changed. We all know the economy has changed. The Reserve Bank rushing cannot reduce interest rates quickly enough, and there is good reason for it. Consumer confidence, business confidence and investment are at an all-time low and we are feeling the brunt of the international crisis. But the government still insists on increasing costs and charges upon owner-operators. They still insist that this is necessary—because the state governments have dictated it to them, hungry for the dollar to prop up their own budgets.
This is very much state-driven legislation, and the government, who promised to eliminate the blame game, have decided to acquiesce to the states. We misunderstood the meaning of ‘eliminating the blame game between the states and the federal government’. What they meant was, ‘We won’t blame each other for increasing taxes.’ That is what they meant, and this is the perfect example, because this is state and federal cooperation in increasing costs and charges. Let that be known. This is a COAG decision, a state and federal decision by the transport ministers to increase costs and charges, and they are not letting go. It first came in February and now we are in December, in the last few days of the session, and they are still insistent upon it, even though so much has changed.
When we were in government we had similar recommendations come before us to increase the costs and charges upon the transport industry. We never even contemplated indexation of fuel, I should add.
—We got rid of it.
—We abolished it. And Labor could not introduce it quickly enough in the first months of their government, Senator Macdonald. The last time that the recommendation came before the government was in 2006. And that is all it was, just a recommendation from the Transport Commission. They are just doing their job. They work off their formula to determine what ought to be the links between registrations, the road user charge and what the heavy transport vehicles are affecting. The point is: it is just a recommendation. In 2006 that recommendation came to the coalition government and we rejected it. The industry made pleas to the government not to introduce it at that time, and we did not.
So governments have to take responsibility. I can imagine the minister standing up defending this and saying it is not a tax, it is not an increase and it is directly linked to the effect that the vehicles will have on the roads. But the point is if you are in government, you have a responsibility. You have seen the economic circumstances change dramatically since the first time you introduced this and you ought to make the decision that you are assigned to do—one that arises in so many other portfolios: if it does not fit you do not accept it. You do not accept every recommendation that comes up to you from the Public Service. Senator Conroy, you know that! Every minister knows that, but they seem captive to recommendations. That is certainly so in this particular case. So I think it is interesting to note that particular point.
This is a government that came in with huge expectations in regard to fixing fuel costs. What did we get? The now abandoned Fuelwatch scheme, which was defeated, mercifully, in the Senate. But we are still getting an increase in fuel, through this legislation, for owner-drivers. What did we get before? The grocery watch scheme. They promised so much that they would fix grocery prices. What are we getting here? With the increases in costs and charges, there will be—and there is no way around it—a cascading effect right up to grocery store shelves. That always happens; costs are passed on. It all has to be passed on. A lot of these drivers cannot absorb the costs. They will pass them on. So there is an inflationary effect; it may be small or it may be large, but there is an effect. As far as truck drivers are concerned, those two commitments, those two promises, before the election have not been met, and the blame game commitment has not been met as to this particular industry.
This is a disgraceful piece of legislation when one considers one particular aspect. One aspect of this legislation has the worst effect. It is to do with indexation. As my colleague said before, the former coalition government abolished indexation. The government are going to be dragged kicking and screaming to the table, to abolish the indexation that they embedded in this legislation, because they have not got the numbers in the chamber—and that is a good thing. I believe they may even move their own amendment to abolish it. The point is they would not do it before. They have put it in there and they have stuck by it, even after the Senate committee inquiry found out the effect that it would have. The effect is that effectively every year the rate would be around seven per cent. They were attempting to index fuel costs on owner-drivers by seven per cent. That is an enormous amount. That is the formula they were working off. But I believe, in the face of support by the Independents for our amendment, the government have—and I will not say they ‘have seen reason’—been bludgeoned into taking the indexation factor out of this legislation.
But the problems with and flaws in the bill do not stop there, and we will be moving amendments to fix them. Hopefully, they will be accepted. Take for example the rest stop situation that Senator Macdonald, who has carriage of this bill for the opposition, mentioned. Back in February 2006, the states and the territories agreed that they would build rest areas across Australia to a national standard by the end of 2008. That was a very ambitious commitment by them, ambitious in that it was calculated that some 900 rest stops would have to be built to that national standard in that time. The fact is they have not even made a healthy start on them. It is a commitment that they have abandoned. What’s more, this government is not holding them to that commitment. That is the problem and that is the gripe of the industry and of, in particular, the Australian Trucking Association. It was concerned about the lack of progress by the state and federal governments in meeting the heavy-vehicle rest areas commitment. According to the Senate committee report, its officer, Mr Bill McKinley, the National Manager, Government Relations and Communications, for the Australian Trucking Association, said this:
… there are only a few weeks left—
I dare say that was said tongue in cheek—
… and unless there is an enormous flurry of rest area construction in the next six weeks, we estimate they will be 900 rest areas short. … This is a critical issue for the trucking industry. When we held our safety summit earlier this year it was the principal issue raised by ordinary trucking operators at the summit.
The federal government ought to go back to the states and territories and hold them to some degree—in fact, to any degree—to that commitment. To that end we will be moving an amendment, and we will be sticking by this amendment, as to any future increases in the road user charges. The net figure must be linked to the building of rest stops. The amendment says ‘an average of at least 50 additional heavy-vehicle rest areas’ must ‘have been constructed each year on the National Land Transport Network, as defined by’ AusLink legislation. It says ‘the type of rest areas constructed, their spacing and amenities’ must be ‘consistent with the goal that rest areas in the National Land Transport Network will comply by 2019’. The point is we are linking any future increases in the road user charges to the establishment of a base number of rest stops. This is critical for the safety of the owner-drivers and for the safety of the public generally.
The other issue of concern to the opposition is the harmonisation of state and territory transport regulations. Again commitments made by the state governments have never been met, nor are the state governments being held to account by the new federal government. These are serious issues that go to the heart of safety on our roads for the drivers and for the public. But there seems to be no interest, no care, no commitment by the federal government to enforce a national regulation scheme. The state governments have committed to this but, as usual for the state governments, there is no progress at all. So the opposition will be making amendments to the legislation to enforce these commitments.
This bill—probably as much as any, if not exclusively—really highlights the Australian public’s disappointment in the Rudd government. They trusted them on the commitments that they made prior to the election. But the high expectations the Australian public had of the Rudd government were pretty much dashed in the first month, when the government rushed into a decision to increase the cost of charges on owner-drivers. These are family people who would be severely affected by the increase and, now that the economy has changed for the worse, it will probably be worse for them than it was back in February. With inflation, they will be affected more by the increases in these costs and charges.
The federal government has failed to enforce the commitments of the states with regard to rest stops and the harmonisation of regulations. Of course, the telling part of this legislation is the federal government’s attempt to reintroduce indexation on fuel. That has become a sacred cow for them. The Hawke-Keating government introduced indexation. The Liberal Party, in government, abolished it. The Rudd Labor government, in its first months, reintroduced it. If they can get away with it here, where else will they want to reintroduce it? I would say that they would not mind reintroducing it on the current fuel excise tax. If they could get away with it, they would. It is obvious. They believe they can get away with it here. They have stuck to their guns for close on 12 months with this indexation clause. They will lose it on the floor of the Senate, but the point is that this has become an icon for the Labor Party. This has probably become an icon within Treasury, for all we know. The indexation of fuel, whether it is wrapped up in road user charges, fuel excise or any other form, will be objected to vigorously and voted against by this side of the chamber—as we will do on this doomed attempt. The amendments are very critical for the opposition and we will be sticking by them and holding the government to account on them.",SENATE,<title>INTERSTATE ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2008-12-03,"—The debate on the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2008 and the Road Charges Legislation Repeal and Amendment Bill 2008 centres around road charges for trucks and how the cost of trucks using the road system can be recovered in the future. The Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2008 is now relatively uncontroversial. It is intended to establish a more uniform system of truck registration charges across Australia. But the road charges bill is more contentious. It sets a charge that is collected from truck drivers through the cost of every litre of petrol. Family First approaches the road charges bill with a number of concerns. Firstly, as a general principle trucks should pay their own way and the charges imposed on them should be fair in relation to the costs of the road network. Secondly, we need a fair and transparent system for truckies so that they can pay their own way. But the way the charges are determined should be clear and truckies should have a chance to provide feedback to the government. Thirdly, there is a need for money for truck rest stops to improve the safety of trucks on the road. That should include a review of the government’s heavy-vehicle safety productivity package.
Family First has been in negotiations with the government over the last couple of weeks to find a way to achieve these aims. Most would agree it is fair that truckies should pay a road user charge that covers the general cost of the use of the roads. But the government tells me that the road user charge for trucks has fallen behind and trucks have not been covering that cost for a number of years. The bill is important because it increases the road user charge for trucks from 19.6c per litre of fuel to 21c a litre, moving the road user charge back towards full cost recovery.
The next question is: how best do we make sure that the road user charge continues to keep pace with the cost of trucks using the roads? The government proposed a system of automatic indexation, by regulation, which would see the charge being automatically increased each year according to a formula and a system of consultation. Family First was concerned that a system set up through regulation takes the annual decision away from parliament and that parliament would not have an opportunity to stop increases in the charge if they were unreasonable. Family First has argued with the government for a system whereby parliament has the chance to prevent a change in the road user charge if it is an unreasonable change. The road user charge is, in effect, a charge on trucks for using the roads. It is a ‘rear-mirror tax’, with trucks now paying a charge for the previous year’s use of the roads. Changes in taxes generally come before parliament for consideration, so it is reasonable for changes to the road user charge to come before parliament as a determination which can be considered and disallowed if deemed to be unfair.
Family First has also been in negotiation with the government to improve the transparency and fairness of road user charges. Family First wants a 60-day consultation period so that truckies and other members of the public can make their views known on any proposed increase in the road user charge before the minister makes a final decision. Family First has also urged the government to spend more money on truck rest stops to improve the safety of our roads. The National Transport Commission estimated that, in one year alone, truck driver fatigue was a possible cause of 33 fatal accidents and more than 3,000 other crashes.
The National Transport Commission has issued a set of national guidelines for the provision of rest areas stating that there should be six to 12 rest areas for every 100 kilometres of road, depending upon whether the road is a single or dual carriageway. An audit of major highways found that none of the highways met the guidelines and the majority had major deficiencies. In Victoria, for example, the Sturt Highway, which runs through north-west Victoria and is a major connection between Sydney and Adelaide, has a lack of major and minor rest areas. There is also a need for a number of projects, including construction of rest areas on the Western Highway between Nhill and the South Australian border, and upgrades to existing rest stops on the Hume Highway between Wodonga and Melbourne. Additional rest stops on the Princess Highway/Freeway and the Calder Highway/Freeway are also necessary. All this of course costs money. The government’s heavy vehicle safety productivity package has allocated $70 million for additional truck stops. Family First has urged the government to increase that funding to improve the safety of all drivers on our roads.
The Australian Trucking Association estimates that 900 more rest areas are needed across the Auslink national highway network to meet the National Transport Commission’s minimum guidelines. Truck drivers have a hard slog working long hours and driving long distances. They need adequate rest stops to ensure they get the breaks they need and to ensure improved safety for all road users. This is about keeping families safe on the road. We have all had trucks thunder along near us on the roads and we have all been concerned about our safety in case of an accident.
Extra truck stops give drivers an opportunity to stop and rest and make our roads safer for everyone. Family First believes in the general principle that trucks should pay their fair share generally and that trucks should generally pay for the wear and tear they cause on the roads, but this should not be a blank cheque for the government. There needs to be a transparent and fair process for determining the road user charge. Family First believes that this bill needs to be amended to achieve the right balance between allowing the government to increase road charges and allowing truck users to comment on and test the fairness of those charges.",SENATE,<title>INTERSTATE ROAD TRANSPORT CHARGE AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2008</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,2008-12-03,"—I thank members for participating in the debate on the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2008 and the Road Charges Legislation Repeal and Amendment Bill 2008. The purpose of the Interstate Road Transport Charge Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2008 is to amend the Interstate Road Transport Charge Act 1985, which imposes registration charges for heavy vehicles registered under the Australian government’s voluntary Federal Interstate Registration Scheme, FIRS. The bill also allows regulations to be made to specify heavy vehicle charges for application to FIRS vehicles.
FIRS is a registration scheme that covers only about three per cent of Australia’s trucks. The rest are covered by state and territory schemes. All of the states have imposed the new charges since 1 July this year. It will enable the implementation of the registration charge elements of the 2007 Heavy Vehicles Charges Determination, which revises national charges for heavy vehicles and trailers for application to heavy vehicles registered under FIRS. The determination was agreed by the Australian Transport Council in February 2008 and was implemented by the states on 1 July 2008. It is self-evident that it is in Australia’s economic interest that registration charges for heavy vehicles, which regularly trade across state borders, be consistent. I commend the bill to the chamber.
The other bill we are dealing with cognately is the Road Charges Legislation Repeal and Amendment Bill 2008. I thank senators for participating in the debate. The bill repeals the Road Transport Charges (Australian Capital Territory) Act 1993 as well as making consequential amendments to the Road Transport Reform (Heavy Vehicles Registration) Act 1997 to allow the ACT government to set its own registration charges consistent with the registration charges adopted in the other jurisdictions.
The main impact of the bill is to amend the Fuel Tax Act 2006 to set the road user charge rate at 21c per litre in line with the 2007 Heavy Vehicles Charges Determination. Like all motorists, truck operators pay 38.14c per litre at the bowser for fuel; however, unlike the rest of us they receive a fuel tax rebate of 18.51c per litre. The balance, 19.66c per litre, is known as the road user charge. That rate was specifically set by the previous government in 2000 to recover the trucking industry’s share of road infrastructure costs incurred by governments. It was proposed by the National Transport Commission after an extensive consultation process undertaken during 2007. This is an issue that was inherited from the previous government—

Senator Williams interjecting—

—I will not hold you responsible for it, Senator Williams; you were not part of it. In April 2007 COAG asked the Australian Transport Commission to devise a new charges determination for implementation in 2008 that fully recovers infrastructure costs from the heavy vehicle industry, ends cross-subsidisation between heavy vehicle classes and indexes charges to ensure costs continue to be recovered. Cost recovery of infrastructure costs from trucking is only fair. The rail industry has to pay for its infrastructure, safety and regulation costs, as does shipping. No-one, not even the trucking industry, is arguing that 21c per litre is unfair.
The bill allows for the minister to issue regulations to index the charges. That regulation would be subject to review by this parliament in the normal manner. The government was always committed to ensuring a fair and transparent process for that regulation so that industry had sufficient confidence in the process. However, I note the concerns from some senators about the indexation provisions. I foreshadow government amendments to remove the capacity of the government to pass regulations that may index the charge beyond 21c per litre. The amendments will ensure that the government can only adjust the charges by disallowable instrument and cannot establish any mechanism that indexes. In short, every adjustment will be disallowable. The amendment will also propose that, prior to its making, the government must ensure that the proposed adjustment undergoes a 60-day consultation process and that the minister considers the comments received in that process.
This is a bill we inherited from the previous government. In a speech given in June 2007 entitled ‘The coalition government’s transport reform agenda’, the then federal Minister for Transport and Regional Services and Leader of the Nationals said:
The National Transport Commission will develop a new heavy vehicle charges determination to be implemented from 1 July 2008. The new determination will aim to recover the heavy vehicles’ allocated infrastructure costs in total and will also aim to remove cross-subsidisation across heavy vehicle classes.
The new charges will be fairer to both those in the industry and to the wider community. Importantly, the new charges deliver the requirements of the Council of Australian Governments for full and ongoing cost recovery. This in turn will make better use of the nation’s infrastructure—a key element of the Rudd Labor government’s plan to raise productivity, fight inflation and maintain economic growth. I note a couple of comments from I think Senator Williams and Senator McGauran. This is not a bill about the indexation of fuel excise.
—It was originally.
—It is not. Fuel excise will stay at 38.14c per litre. Truckies only pay 19.7c per litre—their charge for the use of roads. As roads funding increases, so too does the charge. I commend the bills to the chamber.
Question agreed to.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2008-12-03,"—I rise on a matter of public interest—the need for ongoing vigilance in relation to workplace health and safety within Australia. As we come to the end of the parliamentary year and we look forward to spending the festive season with our family and friends, it is appropriate that we spare a thought for those Australian families who will spend this Christmas without a loved one or a friend due to a workplace accident or a workplace related disease.
I am sure that many Australians are unaware that more than 2,000 fatalities take place each year as a result of workplace accidents and industrial diseases. This figure is an estimate because of the long latency period of some industrial diseases. The figure exceeds the national road toll, which for the year to date is just over 1,220. No-one in this place would equate human tragedy to economic outcomes. Nevertheless, it is estimated that the cost of workplace injuries and deaths to the community is approximately $30 billion per year. The highest death rate is in agriculture, forestry and fishing with 19 deaths per 100,000 employees. The next highest is transport and storage with 12.3 deaths per 100,000 employees, followed by mining with 6.8 deaths per 100,000 employees, manufacturing with two deaths per 100,000 employees and construction with 3.5 deaths per 100,000 employees.
The most common causes of workplace fatalities are vehicle accidents, being hit by moving and falling objects, a fall from a height, electrocution or being trapped by moving machinery. Between 2003-04 and 2006-07 the number of notified workplace fatalities increased by 13.7 per cent. As the nation faces unprecedented challenges due to the global financial crisis, workers in many industries will be faced with employer demands to improve productivity in a bid to maintain international competitiveness and profitability. I support a quest for international competitiveness and profitability provided this is not pursued through a process of reducing pay, destroying conditions, cutting costs or ignoring the health and safety of Australian workers. As industry faces these new and emerging challenges, it is absolutely essential that the challenges are met in a manner which maintains and improves the health and safety of all Australian employees.
In my time as a union official there was nothing worse than hearing about a worker who had been maimed or killed as a result of an industrial accident. Unfortunately, like many union officials, I have had to comfort the family of a worker who has lost their life in a workplace accident. It is a horrible experience, but this experience pales into insignificance against the tragedy and devastation that has been experienced by more than 2,000 families each year. It is almost inconceivable for most Australians to consider the possibility that their loved ones will leave for work and never come home again. It is almost inconceivable to think that your family could be so cruelly affected by a workplace accident. Unfortunately, many workplace accidents do not receive much publicity or public attention. There must be an increased focus and public awareness of workplace accidents and deaths. As in the case of laws regulating traffic safety, workplace health and safety should be supported by prescribed preventative measures, by punitive measures where breaches of preventative measures are ignored and, in the case of the most serious violations of preventative measures, by criminal offences with criminal penalties.
Introducing industrial manslaughter provisions into criminal law would merely follow an established pattern of law within Australia and would allow prosecutors to respond to the most blatant workplace safety violations with the full vigour of a comprehensive legal system. If the existing regulation continues to result in approximately 2,000 Australians dying each year, then a systematic process of persuasion, warnings, civil penalties and criminal penalties must be considered in an effort to reduce workplace fatalities within Australia. Some workplace fatalities have received extremely high publicity. Notwithstanding this, many of the 2,000 cases of workplace fatalities receive only minimal publicity. This creates a problem in developing effective ongoing prevention measures.
I would like to turn to the specific issue of asbestos disease. Friday, 28 November was Asbestos Awareness Day. I have had a long association with the Asbestos Diseases Foundation of Australia. I am proud to be a patron of the foundation. My first significant experience with asbestos in the workplace was when I was employed as a maintenance fitter at Liddell Power Station in the early seventies. Chrysotile asbestos, commonly known as white asbestos, was used routinely in the power station to insulate steam pipes and pumps. It was also used as gaskets on the boiler and as packing glands in pumps. Asbestos sheets were used by boilermakers and fitters when welding or cutting. To remove asbestos, fitters would simply ‘chop out’ asbestos lagging with chisels and small axes. We would also use high-pressure air tools to remove nuts from bolts, and this created a windstorm of asbestos dust in the vicinity of the workplace. We did not use any protective clothing or respirators.
Despite the growing literature and understanding of the problems of asbestos, the then Electricity Commission of New South Wales continued to argue that it was only crocidolite asbestos—that is, blue asbestos—that endangered your health. The combined unions in the power industry conducted a statewide campaign in power stations for the removal of asbestos and the provision of protective clothing and respirators. This campaign was successful and no doubt saved many, many lives. The use of protective safety equipment became a standard operating procedure and the culture within the Electricity Commission changed significantly.
The situation in the power industry was by no means unique; asbestos was widely used throughout industry and in the construction of what were described as ‘fibro’ houses throughout the country. One of the legacies of the use of asbestos in older houses is that new cases of asbestos related disease are increasing, arising from home renovations.
One of my first jobs as a union organiser was to assist members in Barraba, New South Wales, who were employed by the Woods Reef asbestos mine. They were facing the closure of the mine, not for health and safety or environmental reasons but for reasons of profitability. I was appalled at the conditions; asbestos dust was everywhere, like snow on the ground, with plant and equipment smothered in thick deposits of chrysotile asbestos. Workers were torn between concern for their safety and their ongoing employment opportunities, and the propaganda from the company that white asbestos did them no harm. I note that even now the legacy of that mine is controversial and locals are concerned about the amount of asbestos dust emanating from the site. I have heard estimates of over $100 million to clean up this industrial disaster area. Once again, the legacy became the responsibility of government and not the industrial polluter.
Much has been said and written about that great Australian Bernie Banton, who contracted asbestosis from his employment at James Hardie in Sydney. The anniversary of Bernie’s death was 27 November. One of Prime Minister Rudd’s first actions was to attend Bernie’s funeral and pay tribute to Bernie, his wife, Karen, and his family. The loss of such a courageous Australian at the age of 61 was a tragedy for Bernie’s family, the community and the nation. I consider myself fortunate to have known Bernie and to have assisted him in a small way in his successful fight for justice against James Hardie. The fight against James Hardie was a memorable period for the trade union movement in its campaign on health and safety. Forcing James Hardie to accept the responsibility of its actions and holding the board to account was a credit to the ACTU, the AMWU, the CFMEU, the MUA and all unions who have campaigned for justice for asbestos sufferers.
Bernie originally contracted asbestosis, which became mesothelioma. Mesothelioma is an insidious and desperately horrible disease. Diagnosis of mesothelioma is currently a death sentence. Another friend of mine, a former National President of the AMWU, Brian Fraser, was cut down in his prime after contracting mesothelioma as a result of his work with asbestos in a Queensland dockyard. Brian’s death deprived three young girls of their father and left their mother, Eleanor, without her partner and soul mate. Watching Brian, a strapping six-foot-plus Irishman, fight the ravages of mesothelioma was both heartbreaking and inspiring. Brian spent the last days of his life fighting for financial compensation for his family, and it was only on his deathbed that a settlement was reached. This, in my view, was uncivilised, degrading and unnecessary.
Statistics on the New South Wales Dust Diseases Board website show that for New South Wales alone there will be 6,779 cases of asbestos related disease and mesothelioma between 2004 and 2060. The incidence will peak in 2014, with 196 residents of New South Wales dying from asbestos related disease. Many of these unfortunate people will suffer a cruel, painful and undignified death.
I want to place on record my support and admiration for the support workers from asbestos disease groups around Australia. In particular, I want to recognise the work of the Asbestos Diseases Foundation of Australia, based in Granville, New South Wales, of which I am a patron. I want to particularly recognise the fantastic work of their president, Barrie Robson; their secretary, Eileen Day, who lost her husband to mesothelioma; and founding member Ella Sweeney, who is currently very ill from asbestos related disease. This group rely on raffles and other fundraising activity to help them provide support services to the victims of asbestos diseases and their families.
In conclusion, there are a number of issues I would like to pursue in my role as a senator. I would like to see a national monument in Canberra, our national capital, that recognises the contribution of workers who have lost their lives while assisting in the building of this nation. This would be a recognition of the families who are left behind to pick up the pieces after the untimely death of a loved one. I also believe that we must constantly monitor the effectiveness of our laws in providing a safe and healthy workplace for Australian workers. If our laws are not working and thousands of Australians continue to die as a result of workplace accident or disease, then changes should be made to the law to ensure that compliance, enforcement and criminal penalties bring about a cultural change.
Finally, I believe we have a responsibility in our region to assist developing countries to understand the problems associated with the use of asbestos. Australia should lead the fight for both a regional and an international ban on the use of asbestos. Asbestos is being exported from countries such as Canada and Russia to developing countries, with the inevitability that more and more innocent workers will contract asbestos related disease and suffer an untimely, painful and undignified death.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2008-12-03,"—On Thursday, 13 November I took a number of questions on notice from Senator Siewert in relation to Japan’s whaling program and undertook to seek additional information from the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and the Arts and the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I seek leave to incorporate the answer in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The response read as follows—
I was asked whether the Prime Minister had raised the issue of the arrest of two Japanese Greenpeace activists with his counterpart. I am advised by the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet that, to the best of its knowledge, the issue has not been discussed by the Prime Minister with his counterpart. As I previously indicated to the Senate, this is a domestic law enforcement matter for the Japanese Government and as such, it is not appropriate for the Australian Government to comment.
I was asked whether the Australian Government investigated whether the actions of the Japanese authorities are a breach of international law under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It is the Australian Government’s view that the matter, which involves the alleged breach of Japanese laws by Japanese nationals in Japan, is one for the Japanese authorities. It would be inappropriate to conduct an ‘investigation’ into a matter which is a domestic law enforcement issue for Japan.
I was asked whether the Australian Government has obtained advice on whether the matters referred to by Senator Siewert are a breach of Japan’s so-called research whaling program, and whether the Government had pursued this matter with the International Whaling Commission (IWC). The Government has examined whether the allegations, if substantiated, would constitute a breach of relevant IWC provisions, however it is not the practice of the Government to disclose the contents of legal advice that it has received. While the Government has not communicated with the IWC in relation to this matter, earlier this year the Government presented proposals for reform of the IWC which, among other things, called for reforming the management of science in the IWC through collaborative non-lethal research and an end to unilateral ‘scientific ‘whaling.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: ADDITIONAL ANSWERS</title>,<title>Whaling</title>,Questions Without Notice: Additional Answers,9,1
"Cash, Sen Michaelia",LP,2008-12-03,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Climate Change and Water (Senator Wong) to questions without notice asked by Senators Cash and Colbeck today relating to the emissions trading scheme and to water management of the Clyde River, Tasmania.
Only a short time ago I came to this place and asked what additional evidence the government requires before it will take responsibility and acknowledge that its proposed ETS is not only seriously flawed but, if the government does not listen to the concerns of industry and does not take into account the current global financial crisis, it will have a severe impact on all Australians. I implored those on the other side of the chamber not to put at risk thousands of Australian jobs and billions of dollars of capital investment in the resources sector and the energy sector because of their reckless approach to implementing an ETS. Australia and Australians deserve better.
And what do we have today? We finally have members of the government who have seen the light and confirmed that the coalition’s long-held position of responsible action when addressing climate change is actually correct. The penny is finally dropping for everyone on the Labor side except Minister Wong. I was pleased to read today in the Sydney Morning Herald that there are members on the government side who have adopted the coalition’s stance: that we need to take responsible and economically conservative action on climate change.
Honourable senators interjecting—
—Order! There is too much audible noise and discussion in the chamber.
—I am about to name those senators. In fact, I am going to quote from the Sydney Morning Herald, because it is a delightful quote that needs to be placed on the record:
The Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, has told his backbenchers to hold their nerve over Labor’s emissions trading scheme amid internal concerns about its impact on jobs and intense lobbying by interest groups.
…            …            …
NSW Senator Steve Hutchins warned of the impact on jobs should Australia proceed unilaterally with an emissions trading scheme during an economic downturn.
…            …            …
Senator Glenn Sterle, from Western Australia, spoke up—
finally—
for the liquefied natural gas industry, which is complaining it will lose billions in investments because it does not qualify for the compensation that will be given to the heavy-polluting industries.
I and others on this side of the chamber have long warned in this place that rushing towards a 2010 deadline to implement an emissions trading scheme would see unpredictable damage to Australian industry and Australian jobs. The coalition has a proven track record on the economy. We know that, without a doubt, climate change is best tackled from a position of economic strength. Under Labor, however, companies in Australia are to be put at a competitive disadvantage because we have a government which adopts a ‘go it alone’ approach. I say it again: common sense dictates that being in a position of economic strength is the best way to deal with climate change.
It may be news to those opposite, but take this from a real economic conservative: extra regulation, taxation and competitive disadvantage are not going to engender a position of economic strength in this country, especially in these financially difficult times. To this end, an effective ETS must be designed to protect our export and import industries until the rest of the world has signed up to a course of action on climate change. A hasty decision on this matter will damage the very industries that have supported the robust economic times we have previously enjoyed in this country.
Quite simply, an effective ETS should be designed to shield our export and import industries until a level playing field has been established worldwide. And Senator Sterle, a Labor senator from Western Australia, has now acknowledged this. But no—this is obviously too logical or too boring for a spin driven government such as this one. Where is the media story in being sensible and responsible? Spin over substance every time—that is what this government is all about.
The coalition is committed to responsible and effective action on climate change. The ETS proposed by the Prime Minister and Minister Wong has the potential to drive up unemployment and to export emissions overseas. This is not a responsible response to climate change but, oh, it is so typical of policy from the Rudd Labor government. (Time expired)

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2008-12-03,"—I rise to speak on the opposition’s motion to take note of Minister Wong’s answer to Senator Cash’s question. All I can say is: thank goodness we have daily newspapers delivered around Parliament House these days, because the opposition clearly would not know what questions to ask in question time otherwise. Their strategy is derived from newspaper headlines and articles.
Industry and business organisations such as the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees, the Property Council of Australia and the Australian Council of Trade Unions have been mentioned in today’s Financial Review as talking about climate change, as have AMP Capital, BT Financial Group and Colonial First State. There is only one thing that these organisations have in common with the Labor Party and not with the opposition, and that is that they are talking about climate change. The opposition have just come on board recently, if at all.
It is 12 months today since the Rudd Labor government was sworn in, and the opposition have had 15 positions on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme in 14 months. Only recently a coalition backbencher let the cat out of the bag and actually confessed that they had to pretend that they cared about climate change for electoral reasons. That is what we have got sitting across from us—pretenders, wanting to get on the program but not really quite committed about whether or not this is action that they should sign up to as a party. That is unlike the Rudd Labor government. We went to the election last year, 12 months ago to this very week, and we committed to reducing Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions at least cost, adapting to the impacts of climate change that we cannot afford and helping to shape a global solution to this global problem.
It is a tough decision to make. It is going to be tough action, but the impact on the economy and the impact on this country would have been greater if somebody had not stepped up to the mark and committed to this as an election promise. That is exactly what we did and it is exactly why we are on this side of the chamber—because people around this country wanted a government that was going to start to tackle the issue of climate change, and that is what we have done.
We have spent 12 months preparing this country for the challenges of the future by tackling climate, by actually engaging in the world arena about where we will go with climate change, by signing up to the Kyoto protocol and by spending many, many months looking at what we will do in terms of our Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. We are committed to ensuring that our greenhouse gas emissions are reduced and are reduced at least cost. We want to ensure that we adapt to the impacts of climate change that we as a country cannot avoid. The opposition turned a blind eye to them, but we have stepped up to the mark and have realised it is something we need to tackle head-on.
We want to be in the tent, on the program, part of the world dialogue helping to shape a global solution. Unlike the opposition, we are not climate change sceptics. We are realists and we want to be there as a major player around the globe—as we have been under the leadership of Minister Wong—making sure we participate in that debate. We want to be part of the solution to this global problem, and that is one of the reasons why the Australian people put us on this side of the chamber—to ensure that we can continue this work.
We have set a target of 60 per cent cuts to emissions on 2000 levels by 2050. We have set a medium-term target by the end of 2008. We are going to expand the renewable energy target to 20 per cent. We are going to drive a clean energy revolution with policies such as establishing a $500 million Renewable Energy Fund, a $150 million Energy Innovation Fund and a $500 million National Clean Coal Initiative. These are all programs that we have committed to in the last 12 months.
As soon as Minister Wong returns from her next round of international discussions and dialogue, our white paper on the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme will be produced, for each and every person in this country to have a look at and to continue their dialogue about us tackling climate change. Unlike the people opposite, who have come to the show late—they have decided to arrive at interval and get on the program at a very late moment—we are taking definitive steps. (Time expired)

"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2008-12-03,"—Confronted with the realities of life and confronted with the realities of life in government, government backbenchers are back-pedalling at a rate of knots. If they keep going at this rate, in a year’s time they will actually call for Australia to withdraw from the Kyoto protocol. Where is Senator Hutchins? Where is Senator Sterle? Where are they? They should be here explaining the concerns they have as to Australian jobs and the concerns they have about the impact of the government’s proposed emissions trading scheme on the Australian economy.
The reality is this: all Australians want to do the right thing by the environment. We want to do the right thing by the environment. Australians are prepared to pay a price—but how much and for what outcome? These are some of the questions that the government have to answer, but they refuse to answer them. They have presented some Treasury modelling which was nothing more than a snow job. They did not even assess a circumstance where the United States, China and India do not take action at the same rate as Australia is proposing to do. They did not even assess the impact of the global financial crisis. There is not an appropriate framework to cater for the impact on the LNG industry, in particular in Western Australia.
Do you know why Senator Hutchins knows about the flaws in the government’s proposed Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme? Because he is a member of the Senate Select Committee on Fuel and Energy. Along with Senator Bushby and me, he has been listening to the evidence from industry. He has been listening to evidence from the Department of the Treasury and from the Department of Climate Change. Do you know what they said to us when we asked them why they did not model or assess some of the more realistic scenarios in terms of the circumstances that Australia finds itself in and the circumstances under which Australia is proposing to implement the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme? The answer we got from Treasury officials was that the scenarios that were modelled by the Treasury were done at the direction of the government. The government is intent on doing a snow job.
Do not tell me that we on this side are climate change sceptics. We are raising valid concerns. Senator Steve Hutchins, Senator Glenn Sterle and Jennie George have raised some very valid concerns. I urge Jennie George to make a submission to the Senate Select Committee on Fuel and Energy to bring her concerns to the attention of the committee, particularly those in relation to BlueScope Steel’s Port Kembla plant. Just to show that this is not a biased party-political approach to things, I note a comment by Mr Colley, the National Research Director of the Mining and Energy Division of the CFMEU. Do you know him? When we asked him about the Treasury modelling, do you know what he said? ‘None of the scenarios are particularly realistic’—go and check Hansard, as that is on the record. The reality is this: yes, we do want to do the right thing by the environment and, yes, Australians are prepared to pay a price. But it is time that the Australian government came clean and levelled with the Australian people. What is it trying to achieve? What is the outcome that it is trying to achieve in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions globally? Is what you are doing in Australia going to have a positive or a negative effect in terms of reducing greenhouse gas emissions globally? What is the impact of the disastrous consequences, for the LNG industry, of exporting not only jobs but emissions to China, India and Japan? The government should give us some answers. We have not had any answers from the government. It is time that some proper scrutiny was applied to the government.
I am very pleased to see that Senator Sterle and Senator Hutchins are finally raising those concerns inside caucus. This will stop the Minister for Climate Change and Water, Senator Wong, from making absolutely bizarre accusations about nonbelievers and climate change sceptics. There will be a time when the Prime Minister and Senator Wong will be the only ones left on the top of Mount Kosciuszko, giving a sermon on the mount, with nobody left on their side of the argument. Everybody will have realised that there is a serious need for some proper scrutiny. The currently proposed design of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme is seriously flawed and, unless we make some corrections and unless we make sure the design is right, its introduction is going to be a very irresponsible course of action. It is not going to be good for the economy and it is not going to be good for the environment.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Emissions Trading Scheme</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,10,1
"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2008-12-03,"—The sceptics just refuse to acknowledge the reality. While we are quoting from newspapers, I did happen to read today in the West Australian—Western Australia is the state Senator Cash comes from, I believe—an article painting a bleak picture of climate change in action. If you all want to have a look at it, it is on page 13. It says:
War, hunger, poverty and sickness will stalk humanity if the world fails to tackle climate change, a 12-day UN conference on global warming was told yesterday.
A volley of grim warnings opened the marathon talks, which are aimed at drawing up a new worldwide treaty to cut greenhouse gases and help countries exposed to the fury of climate change.
Opposition senators interjecting—
—I am quoting from the West Australian. It goes on:
“Humankind in its activity just reached the limits of the closed system of our planet Earth,” …
The sceptics on the other side do not like the fact that we are consulting. They are in complete denial. They just will not accept the fact that we are undertaking an economically responsible position. It is a hard position, as we heard earlier. Because we do not take the emu approach and bury our heads in the sand and say, ‘It’s all too hard so we’re not going to do it,’ they want to have a little panic. The opposition have had more positions on this than I saw in the last ballet concert I went to. They have had 14 positions in 15 months. I have been to ballet concerts that had fewer positions than that.
The global financial crisis is having a substantial impact here at home. We know that. We cannot deny it. The Rudd government are working towards making the best of that situation. We are working around the clock to make sure that our country is buffered against the full force of the global economic crisis. We are working hard to get the balance right. When you listen to the scaremongering and the irrational concerns of those from the other side, it makes you wonder what they are actually doing here.
The global financial crisis highlights exactly why it is important that we tackle the big economic challenges of the future, which those opposite denied. They refused to do anything in 12 years of government. That is why people voted for change and wanted a change of government. They were fed up with the approach of the then government of living in the fifties and that is exactly what is happening in regard to climate change. They refuse to accept that it is happening. They are still living in the fifties and they do not want to move on. Australians want the government to deal with this issue so that their kids and future generations are not punished because we failed to take any action. I do not want my grandchildren brought up in a society that suffers so much from climate change and from impacts such as drought and extreme weather conditions. Those opposite should not say that it is not happening—that is just being complete sceptics.
Adaptation to the emerging impacts on climate change forms a key pillar of the Rudd government’s comprehensive response to the threat of climate change. We are demonstrating leadership on climate change. The first job we undertook when in government was to ratify the Kyoto protocol. The Prime Minister, ministers and senior officials have worked through key high-level forums to drive multilateral negotiations on a post-2012 agreement. We are reducing the greenhouse gas emissions as much as we can. We are adapting to the impacts of climate change but we cannot avoid those climate change issues. We are helping to shape a global solution to this global problem. It is no good for those opposite to bury their heads in the sand and pretend it does not exist.
As I said, the global financial crisis is having a substantial impact in Australia but the government will not be diverted from building a low-pollution economy for Australia’s future. Australians want the government to deal with this issue so that future generations are not punished because we did not take any action. (Time expired)

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2008-12-03,"—I note that the Minister for Climate Change and Water, Senator Wong, has followed the coalition’s approach of waiting to see where the rest of the world is going before deciding targets for greenhouse gas emission reductions. But the question is: why does the government continue to rush the introduction of their own emissions trading scheme without waiting to see the outcome of the meeting of all countries being held in Copenhagen late next year and the detail of what the new United States President, Barack Obama, will want to see implemented?
The coalition has long warned that the government’s rushed 2010 deadline will lead to a flawed model that will damage Australian industry and employment in this country. Likely to greatly influence the impact infrastructure can have in the years ahead is the design and timing of the government’s planned emissions trading scheme. To this end an effective emissions trading scheme must be designed to protect our export and import competing industries until the rest of the world has signed up to a course of action. However, as it stands today, the Rudd government’s preferred design for an emissions trading scheme would effectively impose billions of dollars of additional tax on those Australian import and export competing industries which are high users of energy ahead of any commitment by our major trade competitors to sign up to such a scheme. This surely makes no sense.
The proposal for an emissions trading scheme is a structural change of major proportions. The opposition has met with many companies over the last two months—concrete, zinc, lime, steel, energy, metal works, paper waste, dairy and many more—and all confirm that the government’s determination to heavily tax the emissions of these export and import competing industries, irrespective of what the rest of the world is doing, is a very reckless action indeed.
We must be very careful not to shoot ourselves in the foot by letting industries close and move offshore or by having resource projects that never materialise. Woodside has made the point that if the cost of the ETS is too high there will be no further gas developments by them off the North West Shelf. In all of these cases jobs will head overseas. The Rudd government must defer the politically inspired start date of 2010 until we have some idea of what the rest of the world decides to do late next year in Copenhagen and what the new United States President intends to do.
As well, we must have some feel for the impact of the financial meltdown currently affecting the global economy on Australia’s real economy and the capacity of Australian industry to cope with a new tax. The revelation that the government’s economic modelling takes no account of the global financial meltdown absolutely beggars belief and leaves the exercise dead in the water.
The government also just assumes that the rest of the world will sign up to a global emissions reduction scheme and it did not even bother to model the cost to Australia of pursuing a scheme in haste ahead of the rest of the world. After all, it was the Prime Minister who told us just two and a half weeks ago that the world as we know it has changed in the wake of the biggest financial meltdown since the Great Depression. And may I say that it reveals much about the Rudd government’s ideological rush to implement an emissions trading scheme by an artificial 2010 date that they are rushing to put this in place in total defiance of world economic conditions. Australian industries can— (Time expired)

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2008-12-03,"—On behalf of the government I seek leave to move a motion relating to the death of the former member and minister of the House of Representatives the Hon. Frank Crean.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the Senate records its deep regret at the death, on 2 December 2008, of the Honourable Francis Daniel Crean, former federal Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister, and places on record its appreciation of his long public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.
Frank Crean joined the Labor Party in 1942, represented the Australian Labor Party in both state and federal parliament and ultimately became Treasurer and Deputy Prime Minister. Throughout all those years his devotion to the Labor cause and to the principle of social justice may have been equalled, but I doubt it was exceeded.
Frank Crean was born on 28 February 1916 in the western Victorian town of Hamilton to parents Alison and John. As a teenager during the Depression, Frank saw the way the unemployed were forced to queue publicly to accept their benefits, humiliating men who were already ashamed of their inability to support their families. He instinctively understood that it was fundamentally wrong to stigmatise people for misfortune. He instinctively understood that all people have an inherent dignity, regardless of their position in life, and that their basic human dignity ought always to be respected, and protected by government.
A year’s confinement to bed with rheumatic fever saw Frank finding solace in books. A next-door neighbour, the secretary of the local Labor branch and an AWU man, came several times a week with books on politics, the labour movement and the fight for social justice. Keenly intelligent and capable of sustained intellectual effort even then, Frank finished his high school education at Melbourne Boys High School, pursuing educational opportunities not available in Hamilton, completing his leaving honours in 1933. He commenced part-time study at the University of Melbourne in 1936 after having first completed accountancy at night classes. He graduated from the University of Melbourne with the degrees of bachelor of arts and bachelor of commerce and a diploma in public administration. He was employed as an accountant in the Victorian taxation department and later practised as a private taxation consultant.
Frank joined the Australian Labor Party in 1942. Although his time in federal parliament, especially as economic spokesman in opposition and Treasurer in the Whitlam government, is best remembered, Frank Crean also held the state seats of Albert Park and Prahran before winning the federal seat of Melbourne Ports, which he held for 26 years and 11 elections. Winning just one Labor Party preselection is difficult enough. It speaks of Frank’s tenacity and his abilities that he won preselection in three seats over so many years.
Frank had to overcome a difficulty particular of his time. I was talking to Gough Whitlam before question time today about Frank Crean’s career. Gough told me a story that Frank, christened Francis Daniel Crean, had a name altogether too Catholic sounding for preselection as far as then Senator Pat Kenneally was concerned. Kenneally explained the problem that there was a perception amongst the Victorian public that the Australian Labor Party in Victoria was dominated by those of the Catholic faith. I might say that that was a conversation apparently lengthened by Kenneally’s famous stutter. Francis Daniel Crean explained that he was in fact not Catholic but Presbyterian. A relieved Kenneally told him that that would be fine, so long as he dropped the Catholic sounding ‘Francis Daniel’. ‘From now on,’ he announced, ‘you are going to be F-F-Frank.’
In 1945 Frank Crean was elected to the Victorian Legislative Assembly as the member for Albert Park. He was defeated in 1947. He was re-elected in 1949 as the member for Prahran. In 1951 Frank left state politics for the federal arena. As one of the first Labor members with formal qualifications in economics he became Labor’s spokesman on economic matters. He was a member of the executive of the federal parliamentary Labor Party from 1955 until his retirement in 1977. Frank became Treasurer in 1972 in the Whitlam Labor government. In 1974 he became minister for overseas trade. He was subsequently appointed Deputy Prime Minister in June 1975 and served in that post until the Whitlam government was dismissed by Sir John Kerr on 11 November 1975. During his parliamentary career Frank served on a number of committees, including the Joint Statutory Committee for Public Accounts, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Privileges, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the ACT and the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure, to name but a few.
Frank was keenly intelligent, as his academic record showed, and passionately committed to social justice and to the role of government in achieving that justice. He was no factional foot soldier but someone who based his policy positions on his perception of Labor values and the party’s interests—something that brought him into conflict with others in the party from time to time. He was in many ways an old-fashioned Labor man, in the mould of his hero Ben Chifley—decent and unassuming. Even as Treasurer he did the family grocery shopping. There is a wonderful story about Frank Crean in Edna Carew’s book National Market, National Interest, where John Valder, then chairman of the Sydney stock exchange, was trying to build bridges with the new Labor government—history repeats itself! Mr Valder invited Frank to visit the exchange. Let me quote from Edna Carew’s book:
… Valder brought Labor politicians into the stock exchange, inviting them to seminars and lunchtime meetings. The public had run from investing in shares and now the stock exchanges were trying to win back a better image. “It was all part of trying to open up the place,” he says. “We had Frank Crean, Jim Cairns, Clyde Cameron, Rex Connor. They came to lunch at the exchange. It was early days and we were trying to build bridges. It was pioneering stuff.” He recalls Crean’s visit:
At the end of this meeting, which was held in what was then the Menzies Hotel, I said; “Is there anything else I can do to assist you while you’re in Sydney today?” Crean said: “Well, whenever I come to Sydney, I like to get some fish to make a spaghetti marinara. There’s a particularly good fish shop, I understand, on Wynyard ramp.”
Crean, Valder and the federal secretary of the Securities Institute of Australia, Jenny Crivelli, walked the short distance from the Menzies to Wynyard. As the SIA’s journal, JASSA (Journal of the Australian Society of Security Analysts) later recorded:
Crean’s style was ever humble. No commonwealth limousine was summoned; this treasurer planned to take the bus to Sydney airport. But it was a Friday, the day of the week when the Crean family traditionally had spaghetti marinara for dinner … the federal treasurer [made] a satisfactory purchase and, opening his briefcase, dropped the parcel of fish in with the state papers he was carrying.
Valder says: “I thought, wasn’t that a nice homely sort of touch. He’d done his official bit. Now let’s get on with the spaghetti marinara.”
I do not think that anyone would argue with the statement that Frank Crean was not the most flamboyant Labor parliamentarian of his time—a time, after all, that included Gough Whitlam and Jim Cairns, just to name two. But he won widespread respect for his diligence, honesty, technical expertise and capacity for hard work. His former comrades from the Victorian branch of the ALP recall him as absolutely and utterly reliable, always ready to do what was required in Labor’s interests, not just as a parliamentarian and a minister but also at the local level.
He was described by Don Whitington as someone who his caucus colleagues knew could be relied upon at all times, who was always courteous, always friendly, stubborn but not aggressive, insistent but not offensive. His leader for 10 of the years he served in the federal parliamentary Labor Party was Gough Whitlam, who, today, said about Frank:
… he had the distinction and challenge of becoming the first Labor Treasurer since Ben Chifley, twenty-three years previously. His first Budget in August 1973 was monumental in its sweep and ambitions. It set out fully and faithfully to implement the Program on which we had been elected. It laid the financial foundations for the work of the Schools Commission, urban renewal and regional development and universal health care.
In his statement, Gough went on to say:
These essential reforms were strong enough to endure and withstand the immense pressures of the 1973 “oil shock”, which broke the almost uninterrupted period of post-war economic growth and disrupted international trade; in the apt words of Henry Kissinger, “all Western governments floundered.”
And further:
Frank enjoyed Sir Robert Menzies’ joke that they were both “simple Presbyterians” who always had to be on the look out for the traps set for them by more wily persons, including their own party colleagues.
Frank was Deputy Prime Minister in November 1975. Called to the Lodge by Gough Whitlam to be informed of the dismissal, Frank was in the extraordinary position of having to return to the House of Representatives as the first speaker after the lunch adjournment on Malcolm Fraser’s censure motion against the government. Graham Freudenberg recalled that Whitlam, still working on his parliamentary response to Kerr’s ambush, asked Frank not to reveal to the House what had happened. Freudenberg wrote that Frank’s speech ‘must be one of the most remarkable efforts in restraint in the annals of the Australian parliament or of any parliament’, and, I might say, more so given Frank Crean’s deep and abiding respect for parliamentary process and democratic principles.
It was a respect he passed on to his sons, along with an instinctive knowledge of politics, the operations of the parliament and his strong Labor values. His son Simon, the current Minister for Trade, became the member for Hotham in 1990 and has distinguished himself in the federal parliament. And I must say that we really do feel this loss more deeply because Simon is such a good friend; we know him so well. He himself is not only a respected colleague but is a former leader of the federal parliamentary Labor Party. Another son, Dr David Crean, became Treasurer in the state Labor government in Tasmania. His eldest son, Stephen, served Australia as a public servant, before his death in a skiing accident in 1985. Today our sympathies are with Frank’s wife of 62 years, Mary, with Simon and David and all the Crean family.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Hon. Frank Crean</title>,Condolences,11,1
"Minchin, Sen Nick",LP,2008-12-03,"—I rise on behalf of the coalition to support the motion moved by Senator Faulkner. We also extend our very sincere sympathies to all the family of Frank Crean—especially Simon Crean—upon his sad passing yesterday. I did not know Frank Crean personally but I observed him firsthand in the old parliament during the years of the remarkable Whitlam government, when I worked as a casual waiter while I was studying at the ANU. I was able to observe at firsthand all the goings-on of the Whitlam government and its ministers, including Frank Crean. He was the Labor Party Treasurer while I was studying for my economics degree at the ANU, and I took a keen academic and professional interest in his activities at that time. It seemed to me way back then that he was one of the few sane people in that Whitlam government. From where I sat, he seemed to be an island of common sense in the Mad Hatter’s tea party that represented that government. I observed at that time that he was one of the few Whitlam ministers who seemed to know exactly what he was talking about and one of the great strengths of that very exciting government.
The obituary in the Australian today, which I think is a very good one, notes ‘Frank Crean’s diligence and fiscal competence, rare in the Labor Party’. That was a rare trait in the Whitlam government but one that he certainly had. That obituary also notes Frank Crean’s later recollection of his time as Treasurer. It quotes him as saying:
I had 23 ministers who each reckoned he could spend as much as the total budget was.
That shows that his task as Treasurer during that period must have been quite overwhelming and, frankly, appalling. The pent-up spending ambitions of all those Labor ministers, after that incredible and obviously painful 23 years in opposition, all came to the fore at a time when, as Senator Faulkner has observed, the world collapsed around them. I wonder if history is repeating itself.
Despite having been our government’s Minister for Finance and Administration for six years, and having fought back the spending ambitions of coalition ministers throughout that time, I cannot even begin to imagine what Frank Crean had to put up with as Labor Treasurer in the Whitlam government after those 23 years of frustration that they had to bear. I know Gough personally and well, as we are both old boys of Knox Grammar School, in Sydney, and we bump into each other. I enjoy Gough’s company very much, but I can imagine, knowing Gough, how frustrated he would have got at the dour Frank Crean saying, ‘No, you can’t spend the money, Gough.’ I guess that was one of the factors that led Gough to make the biggest mistake that he made in his time in government, and that was to replace Frank Crean with the hapless Jim Cairns. History shows that that was a complete disaster.
The obituary in the Australian today, to which I referred earlier, records that Frank Crean believed that the events leading up to the dismissal of the Whitlam government would not have occurred if he had remained Treasurer. I suspect that Frank Crean may well have been right. If he had remained Treasurer, all the events surrounding Jim Cairns and Khemlani et cetera would not have happened and the Whitlam government might not have ended up being dismissed as it was. It is certainly true that the government would not have had what turned out to be a disastrous economic record if Frank had remained Treasurer and had been able to have more influence on that government. In that sense, I think he was a great man, ill-served by the times and the circumstances.
It was Frank Crean’s enormous misfortune to serve 23 of his 26 years in this parliament—nearly a quarter of a century—in opposition. It says much for his diligence, persistence and tenacity that he hung in there for that length of time. He was then, on the one hand, rewarded with the opportunity to serve in government but, on the other hand, was part of what ended up being a political tragedy, with him being an observer of the dismissal of the government and thinking, ‘If only Gough hadn’t made that mistake, none of this would have happened.’
Frank Crean is one of the great but unsung heroes, I think, of postwar politics. I endorse everything that Senator Faulkner has so eloquently said about Frank Crean’s life and career. It was a remarkable one. Again, as that obituary today notes:
What he lacked in charisma he made up for in quiet principle.
I say amen to that. I think it is a great pity that in Australian politics there is insufficient premium paid to the virtue of quiet principle, as opposed to the elusive concept of charisma which so fascinates our media. Frank Crean was one of those giants of men whose great virtues go unsung in the more modern political era. I think up-and-coming young aspiring politicians should take great note of that. They should aspire to pursue that and to follow his example. I certainly believe that Australian politics could do with more people like Frank Crean, who was clearly a diligent, hardworking, honourable servant of his party and his nation.
On behalf of the opposition, I extend our sympathies to Frank’s wife, Mary—they were married for 62 years, which is remarkable—and particularly to his son Simon Crean. While Frank was 92 and had a fantastic innings, no doubt it is a very difficult time for Simon and David and their families. I gather Frank has six grandchildren, all of whom will no doubt miss him very much. We place on record our appreciation of Frank Crean’s long and exemplary public service and we tender our profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.",SENATE,<title>CONDOLENCES</title>,<title>Hon.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2008-12-03,"—I rise to make a brief statement to add to Senator Minchin’s words. I also concur with the sympathies that were conveyed to Mary, Simon and David. I want to acknowledge that Mr Crean was a founding member of the federal Parliamentary Christian Fellowship, which is something that I think should be noted for the record. I also want to acknowledge the fact that he was an accountant. Being someone who is also an accountant, I thought it was worthwhile coming down here to acknowledge someone who was widely respected.
The Crean family are widely respected in country areas, although we take them on as political foes at times. They are seen as people who have their heads screwed on, especially, as Senator Minchin pointed out, at the tumultuous times of the dying days of the Whitlam Labor government. It is always peculiar in the extreme how Dr Jim Cairns managed to take Mr Crean’s position.

Dear Minister
I refer to the following instruments made under regulation 208 of the Civil Aviation Regulations 1988: CASA 389/08 and CASA 390/08 made on 28 July 2008.
The Committee notes that both of these instruments, which commence on 1 August 2008, are intended to apply in the place of CASA 445/07 which expired on 31 July 2008. As with CASA 445/07 the two instruments appear to provide for the cabin attendant to passenger ratio of one cabin attendant for every 50 passengers carried on Boeing 737-800 series aircraft. The Committee notes that the exemption from Civil Aviation Order 20.16.3 originally provided for in CASA 445/07 is now contained in two instruments, with CASA 389/08 providing for aircraft that carry 50 or fewer passengers and CASA 390/08 for aircraft carrying more than 50 passengers.
Instrument No. CASA 445/07 was subject to a notice of disallowance that was not withdrawn by the Committee until 26 August 2008. Section 47 of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 prevents the making of a legislative instrument that is the same in substance as an instrument that is subject to disallowance. The Explanatory Statements that accompany these instruments make no reference to the notice of disallowance on CASA 445/07, nor whether legal advice was sought as to the implications of making the instruments while the notice was still active. The Committee would appreciate your advice as to why these two instruments do not breach section 47 of the Act and a copy of any legal advice obtained to support their making.
The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matter as soon as possible, but before 19 September 2008, to enable it to finalise its consideration of these instruments. Correspondence should be directed to the Chair, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Dear Senator Wortley
Thank you for your letter dated 28 August 2008 (your reference 115/2008) about the directions given by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) under regulation 208 of the Civil Aviation Regulations 1988, in the form of instruments CASA 389/08 and CASA 390/08. In particular, you sought advice as to why these two instruments do not breach section 47 of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 (LI Act), and a copy of any written legal advice supporting the making of the two instruments.
On 18 June 2008, you gave, on behalf of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances (the Committee), a notice of motion for disallowance of CASA 445/07, pending answers from CASA about concerns the Committee had regarding the consultation preceding the making of the instrument.
CASA 445/07 was an instrument, expiring on 31 July 2008, directing Qantas Airways Limited (Qantas) in the number of cabin attendants required for certain passenger carrying operations. The directions were based on aviation safety assessments and reduced the number of attendants that might otherwise be required for the operations.
On 26 June 2008 you gave notice of your intention to withdraw your earlier notice of motion of disallowance.
On 26 August 2008, pursuant to the Committee’s notice of intention to do so, you withdrew your notice of motion of disallowance of CASA 445/07. The instrument itself, of course, had expired on 31 July 2008.
As the time approached for CASA 445/07 to expire, CASA considered further directions for Qantas. Two instruments of direction were, therefore, made on 28 July 2008, to take effect on 1 August 2008 for 1 year, directing Qantas, amongst other things, in the number of cabin attendants required for certain passenger carrying operations.
One of these new instruments, CASA 389/08,
applied solely to Boeing 737-800 aircraft with a maximum seating capacity of 189 passengers, operated by Qantas and carrying 50 or less passengers; and
contained 7 detailed conditions to be observed by Qantas for the purpose of complying with the direction; and
took effect on 1 August 2008 for 12 months until 31 July 2009.
The second new instrument, CASA 390/08,
applied solely to Boeing 737-800 aircraft with a maximum seating capacity of 189 passengers, operated by Qantas and carrying more than 50 passengers; and
contained 5 detailed conditions to be observed by Qantas for the purpose of complying with the direction - 4 of these 5 conditions are similar to those in CASA 3 89/08; and
took effect on 1 August 2008 for 12 months until 31 July 2009.

Response to the Questions

In your letter of 28 August 2008, you ask why, given the fact that your notice of motion was still in force with respect to CASA 445/07, the making of CASA 389/08 and CASA 390/08 on 28 July 2008 was not a contravention of section 47 of the LI Act, in that the two later instruments were ‘the same in substance as’ the earlier one, and therefore contravened the prohibition in section 47.
When it made the two later instruments, CASA was satisfied that they were not the same in substance as the one instrument to which your notice of motion related.
I have been assured that CASA closely considered the LI Act and High Court cases as it reviewed this matter.
CASA naturally also had regard to (a) the imminent expiry of the directions in CASA 445/07 on 31 July 2008, (b) the fact Qantas had been consulted about the nature and content of future directions and that CASA considered that consultation to be adequate for the purposes of section 16 of the Civil Aviation Act 1988 and section 17 of the LI Act, and (c) the fact that safety considerations had been taken into account in deciding whether and in what form to issue such directions.
CASA is a responsive organisation, which does not merely re-issue expired regulatory instruments if improvements enhancing operational safety are possible. CASA is obliged to ensure such improvements are made if and when this can be done.
It should be noted that leading up to the end of July this year, CASA was actively considering Qantas’ application for renewal of its Air Operators Certificate. As part of this process there were a number of approvals, manuals and instruments to be revisited, and the cabin crew instruments were only one aspect of this broader approval exercise. It was in that light that CASA considered the broader question of the Qantas direction and what its appropriate response could and should be in the circumstances to hand, namely (a) the imminent expiry of CASA 445/07, (b) the Committee’s unwithdrawn notice of motion of disallowance, (c) the need for appropriate directions for Qantas, and (d) the need to act consistently with the requirements of section 47 of the LI Act.
In examining all aspects of the matter, I am advised CASA decided to formulate and issue, CASA 389/08 and CASA 390/08, each commencing on 1 August 2008. As the analysis of the contents of the instruments above indicates, CASA took the view that each instrument was not, and the instruments combined were not, the same in substance as CASA 445/07, by reason of:
the differing content, conditions and effect of the instruments; and, in particular,
the fact that the time period for the operation of the new instruments differed entirely from that of CASA 445/07.
I am advised it was CASA’s view that an instrument in force during the period 1 August 2008 until 31 July 2009 was not, and regardless of its contents could not be, the same in substance as an instrument in force during the period 14 November 2007 until 31 July 2008, a period that had elapsed.
Time of operation was a critical component part of CASA 445/07, just as it was of the two subsequent instruments. Where a matter as fundamental as the period of time of operation is involved, an instrument taking effect after an earlier instrument has expired would not be the same in substance as the expired instrument.
I am advised the effect of the new re-drafted and re-arranged CASA 389/08 and CASA 390/08, taken as a whole, is clearly not the same in substance as the expired CASA 445/07.
The fact that CASA 389/08 and CASA 390/08 were made on 28 July 2008, should not alter any of the conclusions as to the integrity of the new instruments, because, although made on 28 July 2008, they took effect only on 1 August 2008.
CASA maintains that CASA 389/08 and CASA 390/08 were made consistently with the requirements of section 47 the LI Act, and the course of action adopted in making those instruments was the most appropriate in the circumstances.
The relevant legal issues were canvassed within CASA’s Legal Services Group in the course of drafting CASA 389/08 and CASA 390/08. No formal written advice on the matter was sought or provided at the time.
I have asked CASA to make senior officials available to meet with you to discuss the issue of cabin crew ratios, and I am happy to facilitate that meeting to suit your convenience.

Dear Minister
Thank you for your letters of:
11 November 2008 in relation to CASA Instruments No 222/07, No 364/07, No 445/07 and No 450/07 (your reference 10106-2008); and
10 November 2008 in relation to CASA Instruments 389/08 and 390/08 (your reference -8703-2008).
This correspondence has raised a number of issues including the extent to which CASA provides scope for (and reports on) consultation with people or organisations other than those who are members of the aviation community (for example, airline passengers), and the extent to which other provisions of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 have been applied (for example, those dealing with remaking instruments ‘the same in substance’ as instruments while they are under consideration by the Parliament).
In your letter you advise that senior CASA officers are available to discuss such issues with the Committee. The Committee would appreciate an opportunity for such a discussion and I have asked the Committee Secretary, Mr James Warmenhoven, to contact your office to arrange this.
One matter on which the Committee would particularly appreciate some further advice concerns the ‘same in substance’ rule, noted above. As you are no doubt aware, section 47 of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 prevents the making of a legislative instrument that is the same in substance as an instrument that is subject to disallowance. In your letter of 10 November you refer to advice from CASA that Instruments 389/08 and 390/08 are not ‘the same in substance’ as Instrument 445/07 because their content, conditions and effect are different, and, in particular, because “the time period for the operation of the new instruments differed entirely from that of CASA 445/07.”
The Committee is aware that the expression ‘the same in substance’ has been judicially construed to refer to “any regulation which is substantially the same … in the sense that it produces substantially, that is, in large measure, though not in all details, the same effect” (Victorian Chamber of Manufactures v the Commonwealth 1943 67 CLR 347 at 364). The Committee is not aware of any case law that refers to the time of operation as fundamental. If time were always fundamental, it might be suggested that an instrument which operates from 1 January to 31 December, and which is subject to a disallowance notice, or which is disallowed, might then be successfully remade if it applies for a different period (for example, from 1 March to 28 February). If upheld, such a view would make section 47 redundant.
The Committee looks forward to discussing this and other relevant matters with CASA shortly.
Yours sincerely
Senator Dana Wortley

Dear Minister

I refer to Instrument No. CASA 397/08 and Instrument No. CASA 414/08 made under subregulation 38(1) of the Civil Aviation Regulations 1988.
These interim instruments require compliance by Qantas Airways Limited, Jetstar Airways Pty Ltd and Virgin Blue International Airlines Pty Ltd with each Airworthiness Directive (AD) that is issued by the National Airworthiness Authority of the particular State of Design for certain aircraft. The State of Design AD is to be regarded as if it were an Australian AD. The Explanatory Statement that accompanies each instrument indicates that there is a wider proposal to amend Part 39 of the Civil Aviation Safety Regulations 1998 to authorise all State of Design ADs. The Committee would appreciate your advice clarifying this statement and an explanation as to the implications, if any, of this proposed amendment for future Australian ADs, and for the parliamentary scrutiny of ADs. The Committee notes that, in each case, consultation was undertaken with the individual airlines affected. Given that there appears to be a move to making this approach applicable generally across the industry, the Committee would appreciate your advice on whether wider consultation has been, or will be, undertaken.
The Committee would appreciate your advice on the above matter as soon as possible, but before 19 September 2008, to enable it to finalise its consideration of these instruments. Correspondence should be directed to the Chair, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Dear Senator Wortley
Thank you for your letter dated 4 September 2008 (your reference 124/2008) about the Civil Aviation Safety Authority’s (CASA) Instruments CASA No 397/08 and CASA No 414/08 made under sub-regulation 38(1) of the Civil Aviation Regulations 1988 regarding Airworthiness Directives (ADs) issued by the National Airworthiness Authority of the particular State of Design for certain aircraft. You sought advice about the implications of automatically adopting State of Design ADs for future Australian ADs, Parliamentary scrutiny of such ADs and the consultation process.
Under the proposed amendments, which are expected to be made by the end of 2008 or early 2009, foreign State of Design ADs would apply automatically to Australian aircraft operators, without the need for CASA to issue a unique Australian AD that repeats and applies the substance of the foreign AD. Industry, through CASA’ s consultative forum the Standards Consultative Committee, has been encouraging CASA to automatically adopt State of Design ADs for a number of years, as there would be significant cost savings to both industry and CASA with no detriment to safety. Last year, a government Taskforce (the Hawke Taskforce) also concluded that CASA should aim to reduce its unique Australian ADs.
The proposed amendments to Part 39 relate specifically to State of Design ADs and there would be no direct Parliamentary scrutiny of the AD issued by the State of Design. However any AD generated and issued by CASA, either as the Australian State of Design or because of any safety issues identified by CASA, would continue to be a legislative instrument and subject to Parliamentary scrutiny.
I note your comment regarding consultation with individual airlines affected and that there appears to be a move to making this approach applicable generally across the industry. I would like to assure you that this is not the case. CASA continues to operate in accordance with the consultative requirements of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003 and there is no move to change its approach.

In general terms, the State of Design AD is to be regarded as if it were an Australian AD.
In your letter you confirm that, under the proposed general amendments, non-Australian State of Design ADs will no longer be subject to Parliamentary scrutiny, while ADs generated and issued by CASA (either as the Australian State of Design or because of any safety issues identified by CASA) will continue to be considered legislative instruments and subject to Parliamentary scrutiny. Such a distinction, based simply on country of origin of design, seems inherently arbitrary and an invitation to inconsistency. Its effect seems to be to remove a large number of instruments from continuing parliamentary oversight.

The Committee seeks your advice on the means by which any arbitrariness might be mitigated. The Committee also seeks your advice whether any organisations consulted have expressed reservations at this approach.

The Committee would appreciate your urgent advice on the above matters as soon as possible, but before 9 October 2008, to enable it to finalise its consideration of these instruments.

Dear Senator Wortley
Thank you for your letter dated 25 September 2008 (your reference 142/2008) regarding the Committee’s concerns about proposed amendments to Civil Aviation Safety Regulation (CASR) Part 39 on the acceptance of State of Design Airworthiness Directives (ADs) and the consequent effect on parliamentary scrutiny.
Under section 11 of the Civil Aviation Act 1988, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) is required to perform its functions in a manner consistent with the obligations of Australia under the Chicago Convention relating to the safety of air navigation. The Chicago Convention mandates compliance with Annex 8 of the international Civil Aviation Organization, which requires the State of Design to have carriage of the responsibility for issuing mandatory airworthiness information necessary to ensure safe operation of the aircraft. Upon receipt of this mandatory information, the State of Registry (in Australia’s case CASA) is required to adopt the mandatory information directly or to assess the information and take the appropriate action.
Currently CASA reissues State of Design ADs as an instrument under subsection 98(5A) of the Civil Aviation Act 1988. Reissuing State of Design ADs is, in most cases, an unnecessary bureaucratic process. Subsection 98(5B) of the Act makes the reissued instruments legislative instruments, and hence subject to parliamentary scrutiny.
State of Design ADs are mandatory safety actions under the requirements of the Chicago Convention. The proposed amendments to CASR Part 39 will mandate acceptance of State of Design ADs through regulation, rather than instrument. CASA has advised me that most national aviation authorities have enacted similar regulations to automatically mandate State of Design ADs.
This is not an arbitrary process. It is totally consistent with numerous other mandatory airworthiness requirements which are made through regulation without parliamentary scrutiny, such as airworthiness limitations, flight manual changes and conditions on foreign type certificates.
In relation to the consultation process, CASA published a Discussion Paper in 2005 and received a favourable response to automatic acceptance of State of Design ADs. CASA published a Notice of Proposed Rule Making (NPRM) on this matter in 2007. Both the Discussion Paper and the NPRM were reviewed by CASA’s Standards Consultative Committee (which includes a broad range of industry representation) prior to publication, without adverse comment. The majority of respondents to the NPRM were in favour of the proposed rule.
I trust this addresses your concerns.

Dear Minister

Thank you for your letter of 13 October responding to the Committee’s concerns with Instrument No. CASA 397/08 and Instrument No. CASA 414/08 made under subregulation 38(1) of the Civil Aviation Regulations 1988. These interim instruments require compliance by certain airlines with each Airworthiness Directive (AD) that is issued by the National Airworthiness Authority of the particular State of Design for certain aircraft. In general terms, the State of Design AD is to be regarded as if it were an Australian AD.
In your letter you provide detailed advice on the process of reissuing State of Design ADs, noting that, in many cases, it represents an “unnecessary bureaucratic process,” and that its reform was supported by the majority of respondents to CASA’s Notice of Proposed Rule Making.
Notwithstanding this, from a parliamentary scrutiny point of view, the effect of the proposed change will be that some instruments in a class will be disallowable and other (almost identical) instruments will not – simply on the basis of their State of Origin. Such an inconsistency seems difficult to rationalise and likely to produce unintended consequences, and the Committee would appreciate your advice on how it might be avoided.
The Committee would appreciate your urgent advice on the above matters as soon as possible, but before 7 November 2008, to enable it to finalise its consideration of these instruments. Correspondence should be directed to the Chair, Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Room SG49, Parliament House, Canberra.

Dear Senator Wortley
Thank you for your letter dated 16 October 2008 about the Committee’s concern with instruments CASA 397/08 and CASA 414/08.
The Committee has expressed the view that the proposed new approach for mandating direct compliance with foreign State of Design Airworthiness Directives (ADs) seems, from the Parliamentary scrutiny point of view, inconsistent, difficult to rationalise and likely to produce unintended consequences.
Whilst I accept that, from a Parliamentary scrutiny perspective, this may appear to lead to inconsistency in treatment between documents of a substantially similar nature, I do not accept that this inconsistency is difficult to rationalise. Put simply, the amendments proposed to Civil Aviation Safety Regulation (CASR) Part 39 will place foreign State of Design ADs on the same footing as the very large volume of other foreign instruments referred to in the CASRs, which are simply incorporated by reference rather than being re-issued as Australian legislative instruments. Unique Australian ADs will continue to be legislative instruments and will be registered and tabled in Parliament, just as they are currently. Foreign State of Design ADs, on the other hand, which comprise the vast majority of the ADs issued on a worldwide basis, would not be legislative instruments under the Legislative Instruments Act 2003, and therefore not registered and tabled.
It is unclear what ‘unintended consequences’ the Committee anticipates might flow from the proposed new approach for dealing with foreign State of Design ADs. The proposed change is one of form rather than substance. CASA has effectively been accepting State of Design ADs without alteration or amendment for quite some time and has yet to encounter any unintended consequences of this process. To the extent that some unforseen outcome might flow from the automatic acceptance of a State of Design AD, CASA has sufficient powers available to it under Part 39 to deal with that eventuality.
Given Australia’s international obligations in regard to ADs, the new approach to dealing with foreign State of Design ADs will have both safety and efficiency benefits:
an operator would only have to refer to one document rather than referring to an Australian AD and a foreign State of Design AD;
the proposed amendments would facilitate CASA’s acceptance of alternate means of compliance (AMOCs) approved by the foreign authority which issued the State of Design AD. The affected operator will no longer need to submit an application to CASA for approval of an exclusion to the AD. This will reduce the costs for industry; and
most importantly, the proposed amendments will directly enhance aviation safety by removing the delay between (i) the issue of the foreign State of Design AD, and (ii) the issue of an Australian AD by CASA based on the foreign State of Design AD. ADs are issued for safety critical reasons, so any delay in ensuring an Australian aircraft complies with them may prejudice aviation safety.
As indicated in my previous letter, the industry was fully consulted and supports the proposed amendments to CASR Part 39, which are consistent with increasing international reliance on the responsibilities of the State of Design for the continuing airworthiness of aircraft and aeronautical products. Whilst I appreciate that the proposed amendments to CASR Part 39 will have the effect of removing foreign State of Design ADs that CASA has previously re-issued as Australian ADs from Parliamentary scrutiny, CASA officials have assured me that this proposed new approach for dealing with foreign ADs is motivated purely by safety and efficiency objectives. It is important that Parliament oversights Australian legislative instruments. However, I do not believe that it is necessary for Parliament to scrutinise safety decisions made by foreign manufacturers and overseas national aviation authorities.
I trust this addresses the Committee’s concerns.
Yours sincerely

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2008-12-03,"—As Chair of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, I lay on the table Scrutiny of Bills Alert Digest No. 14 of 2008, dated 3 December 2008, and move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I seek leave to incorporate a tabling statement in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The statement read as follows—
SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE FOR THE SCRUTINY OF BILLS TABLING STATEMENT
3 December 2008
In tabling the Committee’s final Alert Digest for the year (Alert Digest No. 14 of 2008), I would like to place on record the work of Emeritus Professor Jim Davis who has served as the Committee’s legal adviser for the last 25 years. Professor Davis will retire at the end of this month and I would like to formally acknowledge his enormous contribution to the Committee, and to the Australian Parliament, over those 25 years.
Not surprisingly, Professor Davis is the Committee’s longest-serving legal adviser. He has been with the Committee since his appointment in 1983, apart from only a 13-month leave of absence in which the Committee was assisted by the late Emeritus Professor Douglas Whalan.
Professor Davis has not only contributed to the scrutiny of bills but also to the scrutiny of delegated legislation, having worked as the legal adviser to the Standing Committee for Regulations and Ordinances for three years, from 1997 to 2000.
Professor Davis commenced his legal career as a lecturer-in-law at Canterbury University, Christchurch, New Zealand in 1965.
He joined the Law Faculty at the Australian National University in 1968 as a Senior Lecturer, was promoted to Reader in 1971, and was appointed a Professor in 1989. He specialised in the areas of Contract, Tort and Conflict of Laws.
Professor Davis retired from the ANU in 2001, and on retirement was appointed an Emeritus Professor, and a Visiting Fellow in the Law Faculty. He still teaches in the areas of Contract, Tort and the Conflict of Laws in the Faculty’s post-graduate program.
Professor Davis has written many published journal articles, and has also written texts, namely:
Greig and Davis, Law of Contract; and
Balkin and Davis, Law of Torts (he is currently working on the 4th edition)
He has also worked as an editor and updater of the “Contracts” title of Laws of Australia and the “Torts” title of Halsbury’s Laws of Australia and has provided intensive courses on contract law for non-lawyers involved in the negotiation and administration of contracts.
The Scrutiny of Bills Committee plays an important role in the scrutiny of legislation and is absolutely vital to the good work of the Senate and the Parliament as a whole. Professor Davis has contributed greatly to the Committee’s essential work over the period of his association with it and has consistently provided expert and independent advice. His role in helping to ultimately protect the rights and liberties of the people of Australia must be recognised. 
On behalf of members of the Committee, past and present, I acknowledge Professor Davis’s contribution over the last 25 years, thank him for his work, and wish he and his wife, Judy, all the very best in retirement.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2008-12-03,"—I table a ministerial statement relating to amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Political Donations and Other Measures) Bill 2008, together with proposed government amendments to the bill.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Political Donations and Other Measures) Bill 2008</title>,Ministerial Statements,22,1
"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2008-12-03,"—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I will not take much of the chamber’s time, and I thank the minister for providing me with a copy of this earlier on. There are just a couple of things I would like to make some comments on. The coalition welcomes the movement of the commencement date to 1 July next year. I will just read from the minister’s statement on page 1. It says, ‘This time frame will allow the Australian Electoral Commission to implement new reporting systems and provide an opportunity for them to educate and assist key stakeholders.’ I must say that this is the first indication that the current reporting standards were inadequate to deal with the change. It is, after all, just a reduction in a dollar amount, and the Australian Electoral Commission, the AEC, appeared on 26 September before the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters inquiry into the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Political Donations and Other Measures) Bill 2008—which was, I note, introduced some 4½ months prior to that—and there was no mention of any issues at that stage. I ask the minister if he would be happy at some stage to provide copies of correspondence between him and the AEC, in the context of openness and transparency, as to when they first became aware of this, which I assume was only fairly recently.
On that same page, I note that the ministerial statement says, ‘The measures contained in this bill are also part of a more extensive review of electoral laws already announced by the government.’ With the greatest respect, normally the measures follow the review; in this case the measures are prior to the review. I appreciate that there are obvious domestic reasons for this to be put by the minister in this way in the statement, but I say to him that these measures are not part of a more extensive review; they are totally separate. If they were part of it, they would have post-dated the outcome of the green paper review. The coalition has said from day one that we believe that this whole matter should be dealt with holistically. We have supported the government’s green paper process on the way through. There have been some timing delays with that, on which we have had no issue at all. We want this done properly and we understand that the reason for the delay is to make sure that it is done properly. We look forward to the release of the green paper in due course.
In relation to the $50 exception to the prohibition on the acceptance of anonymous gifts, I have only had a short period of time to look at this statement but I indicate to the minister that my initial reading is that it is conditional in the way that it does not reflect the committee’s views and also seems to be an increasing compliance burden over and above that which was proposed by the committee. I noticed that, at the bottom of the page, there is a provision that any excess funds be returned or paid to the Commonwealth. I think that this may well be a compliance nightmare, but again I will need to have a closer look at that.
There is one other matter, and that is in relation to the disclosure of thresholds and claims of discrimination for any breach of the second paragraph of subsection 37(2) of the bill. The committee, in the full report, which was effectively the all-of-committee report, foresaw the potential for gross infringements of individual rights. It is a pity that the government has not taken up the opportunity to address the committee’s views in relation to this. I accept that it would require further expenditure from the AEC, and I am acutely aware that money is tight, but I invite the minister to review this provision again. I thought that the committee’s way around this—that is, with a dedicated unit within the AEC—was, with the greatest respect and with no reflection at all on the minister, a far better way of dealing with this than to leave it in the hands of the government. An independent arbiter, if you like, of these matters via the AEC, as proposed by the committee, would have been far better.
With those very short comments, I again thank the minister for his indulgence in providing me with a copy of this document. Clearly the opposition will have a lot more to say about the matter when the bill comes back after Christmas. But I urge the minister to view this question holistically. We have been at odds with the government in relation to both this bill and the other bill that is listed for tomorrow. We do not believe they should have been done through the green paper type review, but the minister is fully aware of my views on that—we have had some very public debates about it. I thank the minister for his courtesy and I ask that he look at those matters that I have raised during this brief presentation.",SENATE,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Political Donations and Other Measures) Bill 2008</title>,Ministerial Statements,22,1
"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2008-12-03,"—I too will be brief in my comments on this matter. The government has very deliberately provided today this ministerial statement in relation to the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Political Donations and Other Measures) Bill 2008 and has very deliberately circulated well in advance of the debate in this chamber the proposed government amendments to the bill. The government has responded to the advisory report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and believes that it is appropriate that this response and the amendments that the government proposes to move to the bill in response to the committee’s report are in fact available not only to senators in this chamber and member of the House but also to political parties and those involved in the political process. I want to ensure that there is ample opportunity for these measures to be fully scrutinised before the bill commences, and I want to ensure that all those involved in the political process have fair warning in terms of the approach the government intends to take.
In relation to the issues raised by Senator Ronaldson, I hate to disappoint him but he is not going to find a flow of correspondence between me and the Australian Electoral Commission on the matter that he has raised. One of the measures contained in the bill relates to the reduction in the current time frame for the lodging of returns from the existing 15-, 16- and 20-week periods to a period of eight weeks. There are new obligations on political parties in relation to these returns. I think that it is appropriate that maximum visibility is provided to political parties in relation to those matters.
The issue of the $50 exception to the prohibition on the acceptance of anonymous gifts is a direct response to the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. According to my reading of the Hansard and understanding of the committee’s report, the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters has picked up the recommendation of the Democratic Audit of Australia in this regard. I commend this approach to all involved.
The basis of the recommendation was to remove an onerous record-keeping burden in relation to fundraisers, including recording the name and details of each individual donor where only small amounts of money were donated. A lot of the traditional political party activities—we all know what they are like, the raffles, the trivia nights, the street stalls and the like—are what is contemplated here. I think the spirit of the amendments comes from the recommendation of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. Again, the parliament and the Senate have full visibility and full transparency in relation to the government’s proposals in this regard.
The other issue that Senator Ronaldson raised relates to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters recommendations about section 327(2) of the Electoral Act. I think it is important just to put it on the public record that the Australian Electoral Commission have advised that, while they have received several allegations of discrimination over the past 17 years, at no time have they actually received any evidence at all to substantiate such an allegation or been able to refer a matter to the Australian Federal Police for action. In fact, almost all of the allegations were made by persons who had been contacted by the AEC about failing to lodge a required donor return.
I commend the detail of this ministerial statement to the opposition in relation to this particular matter. I clearly acknowledge the fact that the reduced disclosure threshold contained in the bill may result in more donors being identified, but the government will ensure that any claims of discrimination in breach of the requirements of section 327(2) of the Electoral Act are fully and properly investigated by the appropriate authority. But there is simply no evidence to support the changes recommended to establish a new area within the Australian Electoral Commission to deal with such complaints. There needs to be a substantive basis to do this, and frankly the case is nonexistent.
I commend the government’s approach on this to the Senate. There will be ample opportunity over the weeks and months ahead for senators to look closely at the proposed government amendments. It is unusual to have a situation where there is a ministerial statement on such a bill with a change. The other key amendment is a change to the start-up date of 1 July 2009. This gives the government the opportunity to do this not only for the benefit of those who serve in this parliament but also for the benefit of the political parties, who are all impacted by these significant changes to the Electoral Act, which I stress—and this is the key point—are all measures designed to enhance the integrity of our electoral system. They are critically important measures that do just that. I have commended these measures to the Senate before and I will continue to do so. It is important that we ensure that these critical enhancements to the integrity of the Electoral Act and our electoral processes are agreed to by the Senate in the New Year.

That the Senate take note of the report.
Section 51AC of the Trade Practices Act is very important and is going to be a crucial issue when it comes before this chamber in, I hope, the not too distant future. Section 51AC, and especially ‘unconscionable conduct’, is an area of serious concern for small business people around this nation, predominantly those who are dealing with retail tenancies in big shopping malls.
I would like to thank members of the committee for the work that was done through this process, and I see that Senator Cameron is in the chamber. Although members may not have come to a consensus in the report—there being additional comments by coalition senators and Senator Xenophon—there was general agreement that section 51AC needs to be tightened.
In this nation, we have to make sure that we maintain the capacity for those who wish to prevail in business to not be knocked out because they are not good at their job, or because they have a badly priced product or a badly priced service, or because they are being bullied out of the marketplace by terms that have been brought about because one player has excessive market power which is used to completely walk over the other player. To go about this process, and because of the lack of clarity of section 51AC, we need to get a more definitive approach. I stand to be corrected but I think only two cases have been prosecuted successfully by the ACCC under section 51AC in the last 10 years. That needs to be addressed by way of a stronger statutory definition of unconscionable conduct.
Unconscionable conduct has to stand in proxy where market forces have failed. If there were a strong market and ease of entry and exit, with alternative sources of supply and diversity of players, then there would really be no role for the Trade Practices Act, and that would be an idyllic world to live in. But when these forces are not present and we get a centralisation of players, or exploitation by a very strong group of players over a very weak group of players, then we have a role for the Trade Practices Act.
The issues that we looked at in section 51AC were such things as fair dealing, fair trading, fair play, good faith and good conscience. These are definitions which are not peculiar to the Australian people, and they are what a lady who runs a shop in a large shopping mall would be looking to the Senate to provide. In her negotiations with the landlord, she would be looking for fair trading, fair play, good faith and good conscience. Other people, when negotiating with centralised players in the marketplace, will look for the same outcomes. I look forward to giving the ACCC greater powers and, at times, a greater motivation to pursue these issues.
I commend the report to the Senate. I hope in relation to this matter that a reasonable approach is taken and that we see all those things that I have noted—fair trading, fair play, good faith and good conscience. They are the elements exhibited by this chamber when it comes forward with a stronger definition of 51AC so that the Australian people have access to the merchant class and have the capacity to be participants in the wealth of our nation. When the dreams and aspirations of people living in this marvellous nation of ours, Australia, and the economy—which is a manifestation of our nation’s benefaction—come forward into our legislation, we can give our citizens a better and fairer economy to enjoy and be part of.

"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2008-12-03,"—Tonight I rise to bring to the attention of senators one of the biggest challenges concerning the protection of our children. It is very appropriate, given the valedictory speech from Senator Ellison, that I raise this issue, because I know he has a great interest in it. As a former minister for justice, Senator Ellison played a role in the fight against online predation.
I add my voice to the fine speeches made tonight and I thank Senator Ellison for his contribution to the country and to the state of Western Australia. While Senator Ellison can reflect on his achievements and time as a minister of the Commonwealth, he will make no greater contribution to humanity than the raising of his children—something that he has obviously recognised. I congratulate him for making the decision to spend more time with his family and I wish him and his family well for the future. The Senate has lost a gentleman and will be a lesser place for his departure.
The issue of online safety is one that affects almost every Australian child and teenager. Currently, there are over 2.4 million children between the ages of nine and 15 who use the internet regularly, with over 85 per cent of Australian teenagers using social networks such as Facebook and MySpace. ‘Generation next’ are at home on the internet. In fact, many have mastered it. Worryingly, some have become too comfortable with the net and are undertaking extremely risky behaviour, leaving themselves vulnerable to predators, identity theft and online bullying.
On Monday the bipartisan parliamentary group, Parliamentarians against Child Abuse and Neglect, PACAN, held a forum to view a new program called Smart Online Safe Offline, SOSO, which is designed to safeguard children on the internet. The program is run by the National Association for the Prevention of Child Abuse and Neglect, NAPCAN, in partnership with Profero, a digital marketing company. The Smart Online Safe Offline program helps children by building resilience and giving them the skills and awareness they need to recognise threats online, thus empowering them to make the right decisions and the right choices when communicating with strangers in chat rooms or other online platforms. The seed funding for the program of $150,000 was provided by the federal government, and I feel it would be an injustice not to acknowledge and congratulate Senator Ellison, who initially approved the funding, and also the current minister, Bob Debus, who has maintained the government’s strong support.
We have previously had great difficulty in getting the online safety message through to our rebellious teenagers, but programs like SOSO offer great hope. The program, which first went live on 1 October 2008, is the first program that engages teenagers directly in their language and images within their social networking environments. Since going live two months ago it has captured the attention of nearly two million children—indeed, 1.9 million children, or 81 per cent of the target demographic, have viewed the program, and at least 10 per cent of these visitors used the ‘report a creep’ link to report someone online to the authorities. Those are fantastic figures. SOSO provides great hope and warrants further support and investigation by the government.
We should never underestimate how big this problem is and the complexity of the task to keep our children safe online. Digital technology has changed how we live, how we work and how we communicate, and it is evolving constantly. Just look at the explosion in Facebook and MySpace and you can quickly gauge the social revolution that is taking place on the net. As each new platform for communication and social interaction emerges, so too do the threats from online criminals and the difficulties for police and policy makers. Having talked to law enforcement officers from the Australian Federal Police, I have no doubt that the incidence of online crime against our children, in particular cybergrooming and predation, is rising quickly as paedophiles and perverts come to master the net and use it as a tool to extend their activities and to establish foul networks. The problem for parents is that these crimes can be happening at any time, anywhere, and there is very little they can do about it.
It is not an overdramatisation to say that in the net age you can have your doors and windows bolted shut but you can still have a predator in your house—online with your children. The figures back this up. I was shocked and dismayed by a British study quoted at the PACAN forum which showed that at least 70 per cent of children may have been cybergroomed online. For the uninitiated, ‘cybergrooming’ is when older people masquerade as teenagers to coerce information out of kids. Information may include details about where they live, where they go to school or even more personal details. Our children are giving too much information because they think they are safe. They are unaware of how many of these criminals are out there and how well organised they are. They are leaving themselves extremely vulnerable.
Programs such as the federal government’s Cybersmart, the Australian Federal Police’s Fireworks and now SOSO go a long way in educating our children about these threats and how to be safe whilst on the internet. As the saying goes, to be forewarned is to be forearmed. In relation to SOSO, Smart Online Safe Offline, I would like to congratulate NAPCAN and Profero for the outstanding work they are doing, and also thank their corporate partners such as Microsoft, Telstra, ninemsn, the Cartoon Network and many others who are confronting this issue head on and providing direct links to SOSO and free advertising to raise awareness. These organisations are showing what corporate responsibility truly means and are taking action to protect the integrity of the internet.
Over the next 10 years we will face many challenges as policy makers in relation to the internet. The criminal activities that are taking place now will require further action, further laws. As a parliament, this is a task on which we must work together. Great thanks should also go to the Australian Federal Police. Senator Ellison raised the fact that they are world leaders in online enforcement—and they are. They have had great success in tracking down and prosecuting online predators and paedophile rings. To the many officers who work in the online enforcement branch: thank you for the work you are doing to protect our children. We respect it and our families require it.
But politicians must also play their part. To that end PACAN has undertaken and will undertake an awareness campaign, urging every member of parliament to put SOSO on their website, Facebook or MySpace site and assist in helping to educate our teenagers and constituents. This is a huge task, but as politicians we have a responsibility. I would like to thank Senator Kroger and all the members of PACAN for the work they are doing on this issue and also again thank Senator Ellison for the work he has done as a minister and as a senator. I know it is something he feels deeply about, and he has been hugely successful. Thank you.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Internet Safety</title>,Adjournment,31,1
