"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-12-06,"—I would like to welcome Senator Kemp to the chamber to continue the discussions.
—Thank you.
—We missed you last week.
—No, you didn't. Senator Campbell did a brilliant job.
—I missed you.
—Order! Can we get down to the discussion at hand please, not whether senators were here or not. Senator Conroy, you have the call.
—We were just wondering, Senator Kemp—
—Address the chair please.
—Through you, Madam Chair—
—`To' me, thank you, not `through' you.
—To you, Madam Chair, we are wondering whether the government has got anywhere in its discussions on 
 where the conurbations were. We are hoping that we can speed the passage of this bill by getting some indication from the government as to where we are at. I will see what response I get before we decide how much further we go.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-06,"—I thank Senator Conroy for that very fulsome welcome back into the chamber. I am advised that this bill was brought on rather quickly last Tuesday. When the bill was brought on I happened to be in the air, so it was somewhat difficult for me to return. But I am mightily consoled that my colleague Senator Ian Campbell apparently did an outstanding job.
Senator Conroy interjecting—
—Order!
—Thank you, Madam Chair. I wish he would stop interrupting. He did so well that we are planning to bring him back for the last quarter, at 1.30 today. So I raise that as an incentive for Senator Conroy to try to resolve this bill as quickly as possible.
We are well aware of the boundary issues Senator Conroy has raised. This is a matter that the government are working on. We hope to resolve these matters in a reasonably short period. We are, as you know, a government that likes to get things right. So we are working at that, but we are anxious that they be exposed as soon as practical.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-12-06,"—I will take that as a complete non-answer. I guess I would at this stage have to leap to my feet in defence of the Democrats who, having already been dudded by you on the question of forestry, I know are very concerned about being dudded by you on the boundaries of these conurbations.
—We didn't think you were a spokesman for the Democrats.
—I know that the Democrats are down there sweating on how badly you are going to dud them this time, and well they might. I was talking with Mr Apps from the Australian Trucking Association recently in the Senate committee on this. I am reading from the committee Hansard . 
 He was of the belief that a conurbation, or what was an urban area from his perspective, was an area defined as `densely populated, which does not go, looking at the map, beyond what generally might be identified as the local government areas that surround the boundary of an urban centre'. Would Senator Kemp like to venture an opinion on that? We will keep coming back to this if we do not get any answers. So I am hoping Senator Kemp can enlighten the chamber.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-06,"—We are in the process of cutting excise. I am not being provocative, but there is a difference between our two parties. We believe in, where practical, cutting the price of diesel fuel; you think the price should remain at its current level. The trucking industry particularly welcomes this policy. There is an issue of where the boundary lines are drawn. We listen very carefully to what people say. As I have indicated to you, this is a consultative government, a government which talks to people and takes on board their views. The issue of the boundary lines is one that the government is very anxious to resolve as quickly as practicable. We always take into account any views which are put to us.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-12-06,"—That is very disappointing of the government. It has been five months—in fact, it has probably been a little longer now, and the sweat on the brow of the Democrats continues to grow—since the government gave its preliminary indication. Could the government confirm at this stage, according to the announcements it has made, that Coolangatta is inside a conurbation and Tweed Heads is outside a conurbation?",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-06,"—I do not want to get into any particular argument as to who is in and who is out. The government, when it has to fix a boundary line, will be doing so as quickly as practicable. Senator, I urge you to wait. But I underline the very important point which makes this government different from the Labor Party policy: we want to cut the price of diesel.
—We voted for it, I think.
—Senator, it seemed to me that you were opposed to our tax package, certainly during the election. You have made an important comment there. Therefore, I hope it is recorded in the Hansard  that the Labor Party now accepts the government's policy on cutting excise. That is a big change, Senator. We welcome that and it is duly noted. But at the end of the day the Labor Party will have a view on the appropriate boundaries, as we will.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-12-06,"—It is going to be a long, slow morning and a long, slow afternoon. Time is not flying. My understanding from the government's press releases and documentation is that they have indicated that Coolangatta is inside the proposed conurbation and Tweed Heads is outside. Is there a reason why what is in effect a twin city was inside and outside? I might check with other senators in the chamber.
—Through the chair, thank you.
—Of course, to the chair, and through the chair. The chair might be able to help me. I am trying to work out whether Tweed Heads was a Liberal marginal seat or a National marginal seat. Is Larry Anthony the member who would cover the area of Tweed Heads?
—Are you asking the minister?
—I am asking anyone who wants to answer. A situation like the one of the twin cities of Coolangatta and Tweed Heads seems quite surprising. One is on one side of the road and the other is on the other side of the road. Apparently if you live in a Liberal marginal seat you are outside a conurbation whereas if you live in Geelong you are inside a conurbation. If you are in Ballarat, you are outside a conurbation. It may just be a coincidence, but Geelong is a Labor held seat while Ballarat, surprisingly enough, is a Liberal marginal seat. I am wondering whether the conurbations are going to follow the colour of the electoral map around the country.
—The Alice to Darwin railway line.
—It could be as ludicrous a proposal as the railway line. I was wondering whether at any stage the minister will enlighten the chamber about whether the policy on the boundaries or conurbations has anything to do with the boundaries of the government's marginal seats.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-06,"—These boundary lines are being looked at closely. I will not rise to the bait of Senator Conroy.
—Just a coincidence, is it?
—I will not rise to the bait. We are working on these boundary lines. When they are determined, you can stand up and make all the political points you wish to make. As I have often said to you—I do not know why I should have to say it again and again—if you want to have a political debate, the truth of the matter is that you generally lose them, in my judgment. You are a senator who carries a lot of baggage, not the least being that you are a member of the Labor Party, which opposes tax reform. I have to tell you that, as tax reform comes in, people will note the behaviour of the Labor Party, which has again gone missing in action on the big issues facing the nation.
We are very proud of this tax package. We got this tax package through. You are quite right; you do not speak for the Democrats. I imagine that you would be the last person the Democrats would want to have as a spokesperson for them. As I have said so often, we are a consultative government and will talk to anybody, including you, Senator Conroy. Unlike the Labor Party, our negotiations with the Democrats are generally constructive.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",IND,1999-12-06,—I am seeking some clarification from the minister in relation to the exemption of vehicles within metropolitan areas. Can the minister just clarify for me whether a vehicle transporting either passengers or goods which falls between 4.5 and 20 tonnes and operates within the central areas will not be eligible for the 25c rebate. That is for those working within the defined area.,SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-06,"—If the journey is internal to the urban area, the answer is that it will not be. If it is coming from a country area to the city area, it will be.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",IND,1999-12-06,"—Based on the minister's answer and particularly in relation to transport, what provisions does the bill make for city councils operating passenger carrying buses that fall within 4.5 to 20 tonnes which are operating within those areas exclusively?",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-06,"—The first answer I gave you answers that. If they are operating exclusively within a city area, the answer is that they are not eligible.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",IND,1999-12-06,—Is it correct that a same tonnage vehicle—between 4.5 and 20 tonnes—which starts its journey outside the exclusion area and comes into the metropolitan area will be exempt for the entire journey but that an identical vehicle operating from within the metropolitan area to a rural area will not be eligible for the portion of that journey until they reach the 100-kilometre exclusion area?,SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-06,—It does not matter which way they are going. There is a point inside and a point outside the area where they are eligible.,SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",IND,1999-12-06,"—My understanding is that if a vehicle is registered outside the exclusion area and travels into that exclusion area, on the journey logged on the way in they can claim exemption all of the way in but they cannot—and neither can a vehicle based within the metropolitan area—claim exemption until they are outside. I am seeking clarification that there is not a difference between somebody operating from Townsville into Brisbane and a freight company operating out of Brisbane to Townsville, for example.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-06,"—I think I answered that question the first time. We are just rehashing the question. If the journey starts outside the exclusion zone and comes into the 
 exclusion zone, as you call it, it is eligible. If it starts inside the exclusion zone and finishes outside the exclusion zone, it is also eligible. That is the second time I have answered the question. I am happy to keep on going. Is that sufficiently clear for you?
—Yes.
—That is the advice I have received. I am sure that whoever posed this question can read the Hansard  with interest.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",IND,1999-12-06,"—The question came directly from me. It was not posed by an individual. I thank the minister for his answer. Could the minister—and I realise this may not be within his parliamentary role—convey to the Senate how, in relation to vehicles travelled, the government perceives that the logging and records for this proposed exclusion zone process is, first of all, going to be set up. Secondly, how is it going to be administered by the companies involved? The third issue is: how is the government going to in any way, shape or form enforce compliance?",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-06,"—As far as the compliance arrangements are concerned, the tax office is working on this matter, and we will ensure that the compliance arrangements are as simple as possible. Senator, you do understand that we are actually cutting the price of excise and that we are actually giving a benefit to the trucking industry and this is a very big benefit? This is a very big plus. This is what the trucking industry wanted. Senator, you are aware what the original proposal was. You are aware what happened with the final proposal.
The government is very conscious that we are delivering a major benefit to the industry and we are anxious, as this government always is, to make sure that the compliance aspects are as simplified as possible. I am advised that the government is not going to impose logbooks or particular record keeping systems where existing records can substantiate a claim. I understand the record keeping requirements for most claimants will be no more than fuel receipts and eligible kilometres travelled. We acknowledge that small truck operators working across metropolitan and 
 country areas will have to maintain more detailed records to access the grant. But we have to recognise that the grant will more than compensate operators for the effort required. This is a very substantial benefit. This is a big benefit to the industry.
Senator Conroy says the Labor Party has reversed its position. Well, that is all right. We always welcome it when the Labor Party back flips, as they do so regularly on difficult policy issues. But the truth of the matter is that this is a very big benefit. This was an initiative the government went to the election on. The Labor Party did not have this as part of its policy. The Labor Party decided in its policy that it would ignore rural and regional Australia. I am interested to hear that Senator Conroy and the Labor Party have now come on board. I do not know if Simon Crean has made an announcement to that effect. Maybe he has.
—We voted for it in the Reps, you idiot.
—I am not being churlish, Senator. We are always pleased when you adopt our policies. We are very happy with the business tax reform. We are very happy when the Labor Party finally comes on board. After all the huffing and puffing that it went through with the election, we are delighted that it came on board. Senator Harris, I hope that makes that clearer for you. We are not in the business of trying to add major compliance problems. Obviously, the way the grant is structured in this fashion, some records will need to be kept. But I hope the comments I have made will provide the sort of assurances you are looking for.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",IND,1999-12-06,"—The purpose of the question was not to determine whether the government was or was not providing the industry with a benefit. The purpose of the question was to clarify those three issues: how did the government envisage, firstly, recording it, secondly, administering it and, thirdly, enforcing compliance with it? The minister's answer has not greatly contributed to those, so I can only assume from his reply that the government at this point in time does not have the policies formulated. ",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-06,"—Senator, I do not think you are listening to my answers. I am a bit loath to repeat myself because Senator Conroy will say I am wasting time. I do not propose to read the answer I gave you out again, because I want to save time, but I think if you read the Hansard  you will see that your comments then were quite unfair.
—Hurtful, in fact.
—Thank you, Senator. I think I will survive. But I would urge Senator Harris to carefully read it. I think you will find that I did address those issues. As I said, I do not wish to repeat myself, because Senator Murphy, Australia's champion fly-fisher—
—World champion. He is up there with Philippoussis.
—I would like to get that for the record. Did you say he was the world champion?
—He is the world champion.
—We did not even know that. I shall inform the PM, Senator, of your great success. May just briefly record this, with the indulgence of the committee, because I think Shayne Murphy is far too modest to record his achievements. It was a secret to me, I have to tell you. I saw him on the TV, actually. I am not sure what program it was. I saw Senator Murphy, and I said to myself, `I know that bloke.' He was providing us with a lecture on fly-fishing. It is very nice to know you have got some skills, Senator.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,1999-12-06,"—To put the record straight for Senator Kemp, who I know would probably like to know a little more about fly-fishing—and it might improve your skills if you took it up—Australia did win the world fly-fishing championship for the first time, in a team of which I am a member. I will say, with the indulgence of the committee, that I would like to congratulate the other members of the team, one of whom became world champion. I actually came fourth.
Through you, Mr Chairman, I ask the minister a question with regard to the 
 government's negotiations with the state governments as to the checking of registration of vehicles, and in particular trucks. We were informed by the tax office that they were negotiating with the state governments for the purpose of establishing how many vehicles might be eligible for the scheme by having a cross-checking mechanism. I would like to know whether you can tell us whether that has progressed to any reasonable degree.
—Before I call Senator Kemp, perhaps we should congratulate you and the Australian team on winning the world championship.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-06,"—We have been having discussions with the state governments. They have not been finalised yet, but, as I said, I am sure that, because this is a very big benefit that is being given to truck operators, the state governments would wish to cooperate.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,1999-12-06,"—I appreciate the fact that it is a big benefit, but I would have thought that the government wants to ensure that it is not rorted significantly. That is one of the major concerns that I would have. Look at the practical exercise in ascertaining how many trucks there are, whether they are operating, in which state they are operating—and not only trucks; it could be plant such as bulldozers, graders, any type of roadwork plant or earthmoving plant which could be sitting idle and have claims for this scheme lodged. I want to know what practical exercises the government is going to put in place other than what was put to the committee by the tax office—that they are going to develop a risk assessment process as this thing unfolds. It could be well and truly unfolded in a very—to use your words—generous way, much to the cost of the ordinary PAYE taxpayers of this country. I would like to see a little more meat on the checks and balances process than you—and likewise the tax office—have been prepared to put on at this point in time.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-06,"—Let me give you an absolute assurance that this government 
 always acts, and always acts very promptly, to stop rorting of the tax system. I think this government has a pretty powerful record in moving in this area, not least with the integrity measures that are part of the business tax system, which have been announced. Again, I think they are supported by the Labor Party. Also, apparently the Labor Party supports this grants scheme, as I understand it.
—It does.
—It now does support this scheme.
—And we would like someone to explain it to us.
—This is a unique comment. The Labor Party support the grants scheme and now say, `Could someone explain it to us.' What normally happens in this big wide world that we live in is that you would explain—
—We weren't at the dinner table having a cup of tea.
—You are always welcome at the table, but you would not come through the door. The door was always open to you, but you would never come through the door.
—Update your rhetoric. You did well, remember. You have to update your rhetoric.
—Senator Conroy, it is only the start of the week and you are already showing signs of strain. I think it will be a great relief when we all rise for Christmas. I am not quite sure whether Senator Conroy can stay the distance, to be quite frank.
—Can we all address the matters before the chair, please.
—Through you, Mr Chair, the Department of Transport and Regional Services—I am looking at my advisers, and they can give me the appropriate nod or not—already has some indicative figures on the numbers of vehicles. Clearly, checking on the registration would provide additional information for us, and that is the substance of the negotiations that we are having with the states. Quite a few of the states these days are in fact controlled by the Labor Party.
—Victoria being one of them.
—Senator Conroy has got one thing right today; he has noted that Premier Bracks—
—You stop smiling about that.
—We will be pursuing this, as I said, with the states, seeking the cooperation of the states. You are particularly worried about whether the states would cooperate. I am not sure whether that is your worry. If you are worried, I suggest that you add to the discussions that we are having. Frankly, a letter from one of the world champion fly-fishers would carry a lot of weight with the state governments. Now that you are a public figure, Senator Murphy, there may be additional responsibilities on you in the public policy area.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,1999-12-06,"—No, for the minister's information, I am not worried about the states; what I am worried about is the revenue—the cost of running this scheme. We know from the historical point of view with regard to the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme that there were problems with it, and there are probably still problems with it, I would suggest. This is a new scheme. You are starting from a whole new base. At least the tax office have acknowledged that they need information to have some checks and balances in this process. It is that that I am asking you about. Suppose you have, say, a contractor working in forestry who has heavy plant and equipment that is used directly in the harvesting of trees, and the person also has a transport operation not just involved in the transport of wood. To my way of thinking, they could—I am not suggesting they would—actually make a claim for diesel that is not being used in part of their transport operation. They could be using diesel, as I put to the tax office, because nearly all of them have diesel four-wheel drives, as do many of the workers. A whole new diesel usage could occur, for which claims for the scheme will be lodged and paid.
At this time I cannot see, and I have not been informed of, any process of checking 
 proposed to be in place to actually determine that. That is what I am asking you about: I am asking you to inform the Senate of the negotiations between the states on the registration of vehicles and how you then further check registration of vehicles that are put off the road—that is, a bus or a truck that breaks down and is put around the back—but claims continue to be made for them. I suggest that you do not have any mechanism at this time, and the Senate ought to be informed about what you propose to do.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-06,"—We would obviously have access to a range of records—
—What are they?
—Do you have any idea what is in this bill?
—My understanding is that you are supporting the bill. Is that right?
—I asked whether you had any idea what is in this bill.
—As I have indicated to you, the record keeping requirements for most claimants will be things like fuel receipts and the eligible kilometres travelled. If there is some doubt about the claim, the Australian Taxation Office always has powers to seek further records. I can assure you that this happens across a range of schemes. Ensuring compliance with the law as it stands is not a new experience for the tax office. We understand people are pretty creative, but this government has had a very strong record of dealing with tax avoidance and tax rorting.
—Absolute rubbish!
—Senator Conroy was the man who voted against our proposal to close down R&D syndicates—
—I wouldn't go there.
—I wouldn't go there if I were you, Senator Conroy, because—
—Order! I ask the minister not to respond to interjections.
—The registration records of the vehicle, the records of the operation of the vehicle and odometer readings are just some of the records we can get. We can also 
 require the verification of journeys undertaken for business purposes.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Conroy, Sen Stephen",ALP,1999-12-06,"—Minister, under questioning, the Australian Taxation Office indicated that your office was specifically in charge of drawing up the boundaries of the conurbations. Is that in dispute? They said you were making the decision.
—Just ask the question.
—`It's up to Rod,' they said.
—That's exactly right, Senator Kemp—I mean Senator Murphy, world champion Senator Murphy.
—Don't make that mistake.
—No, that is very insulting. I apologise. I withdraw unreservedly, Senator Murphy.
—Order! Senator Conroy, please do not respond to interjections.
—Currently, on the existing proposals that have been floated publicly, Ballarat is outside and Geelong is inside. Can Senator Kemp give us some indication on that, because there are some consequences if that is the case. I am glad Senator Kemp mentioned he was consulting with the trucking industry, because we had trucking industry representatives before the committee, as well, and I asked them whether they thought truck routes would be altered to take into account where the boundaries were—where those lines that you are going to draw on your electoral map are. Mr Gunning from the trucking association said:
. . . when you think about the way people structure businesses and so on, one would have to say the answer has to be yes over time.
The sorts of questions that Senator Harris, Senator Hutchins and Senator Murphy have been asking of Senator Campbell and Senator Kemp go to the heart of behavioural change and how it is going to be possible for a competitive advantage to be bestowed on a company based in Ballarat compared with a company based in Geelong. Mr Gunning went on to agree that there was the possibility of people changing their journeys.
I know what constitutes a journey is also part of your discussion, and I will come to that, but I am interested in your justification for Ballarat being in and Geelong being out, other than the fact that one is a marginal Liberal seat and one is a safe Labor seat. Both are served by two-lane highways, both are roughly the same distance from Melbourne and both contain a number of transport companies. Your current package provides a competitive advantage to the company in Ballarat, because if you have a choice between hiring a company that is charging a cheaper price because it is driving across the conurbation compared to one which is not driving across the conurbation—
Senator Kemp interjecting—
—You will be able to clarify this when you tell us where the boundary is. It does not matter where it is sited—I already know that—what matters is the journey undertaken and where it is from and to. That is the key to the dirty deal you did with the Democrats. If you happen to hire a company in Ballarat, now, and it then drives into the city to do a drop off, that company is going to be able to charge a cheaper price than the company in Geelong. Both are the same distance from the CBD and both are on two-lane highways—different highways, obviously, as you would well know, Senator Kemp, because you are a frequent traveller to Geelong and Ballarat, like I am. I am interested in your answer on that.
I am interested in whether or not you agree with Mr Gunning and the industry that the value of a smaller second-hand truck has diminished. Let us say I had bought a four-tonne truck. The industry says that, if I am competing against a 4.5-tonne truck on the same routes, not only do I have a cost disadvantage but also my resale value has gone down substantially because I am not eligible for your grant, which goes to trucks above 4.5 tonnes. So, if I bought a four-tonne truck, has my resale value gone down? The industry says yes. Do you agree with the industry? You may shake your head, Minister, but these are legitimate questions for small businessmen in our state who are based in and around Melbourne. Before you did your dirty deal 
 with the Democrats behind closed doors on your original tax package, someone might have gone out and bought a four-tonne truck, and all of a sudden they find that the resale value has gone down. It is not a trivial issue to a small businessman, an owner-driver operator of a four-tonne truck.
Do you also agree with the industry when they said at the hearings—I will quote from page 11 of the transcript:
The bus industry finds it incongruous that the direction of these changes is actually pushing people out of buses and into cars; yet we know that buses are, at worst, eight times more effective in terms of improving the environment than cars are.
You are a former shadow minister for the environment. You know how important these issues are. The Democrats know how important these issues are. What we want to know is why both of you are pursuing a policy that is bad for the environment. Mr Gunning goes on to say:
The particular business about the diesel alternative fuel grant, in broad order, would push up bus fares by about three per cent, and that is in an environment where, for a private motorist, car costs are coming down by about three per cent and, for a business user of cars, cost reductions are in the order of 13 or 12 per cent. We know there is substitutability between buses and cars . . . so we are heading in the direction of pushing people out of the great bulk of the bus fleet into cars. We know that on average, across the board, depending on the scenario you draw, buses are about eight times environmentally better than cars.
Mr Gunning goes on to say:
For the great bulk of the private bus industry, we would expect costs and fares to rise in the order of nine per cent.
So you have here a policy that pushes up bus fares, drives people—no pun intended—off buses into cars and is worse for the environment. So you have got two strikes: you have got a policy that is going to push people off buses and then put up the competitive advantage of cars and be worse for the environment. This is an extraordinary position to be advocating for someone who has held the position you have, Senator Kemp.
—Held it so well.
—You certainly suckered in the ACF. I will give you absolute 
 credit for having suckered the environment movement in 1996; there is no question about that. That was a tribute to your political skills, and I am the first to concede that suckering the green movement like that was an achievement. But the good news is that you have done it again. You have actually pulled off another great scam here. You have suckered the Democrats into believing you are helping the environment with this policy, and it is actually not.
I move on to another point. Minister, can you confirm the evidence given by Mr Mike Jackson, Deputy Commissioner Excise for the Australian Taxation Office, that dipsticks would actually be part of the armoury of the tax office in policing these measures? I refer you to page E18, where Mr Johnson was asked by Senator Murphy what mechanisms were available for monitoring these things, how it was going to work. He replied that there were a range of mechanisms available to the tax office, such as usage patterns et cetera. I said, `The dipstick?' He went on to say:
I am not sure we would use a dipstick, other than to measure the amount of fuel that is in a tank—
I not sure what else you would use a dipstick for other than to measure the amount of fuel, but maybe Mr Johnson has got a few ideas we do not have. Is it a fact that the tax office are issuing dipsticks to tax officials to help police this particular piece of legislation on your behalf?
—This is a general rant.
—I am saving you time. We do not want to wear the carpet out over there. I am saving the Commonwealth money from your wearing the carpet out. You will have to go over it only once.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I raise a point of order. Is it proper for Senator Conroy to refer to the minister as a dipstick? Is it parliamentary?
—There is no point of order.
—I will defend Senator Sherry. I think he misheard me. I did not actually describe Senator Kemp as a dipstick but, as they say, if the shoe fits. As I said, I 
 am just going through a string of issues to save you time, Minister, because I know how concerned you are about time and wanting to get home for Christmas. If you can get us some answers on some of these issues we have raised, you will save us all time and hopefully we will all get home before 24 December.
You keep indicating that there will be a decision made soon on the conurbations. Well, the education campaign which the tax office took us through, as to where the conurbations are, actually does need to know itself where the conurbations are. We are just wondering when you are going to make a decision because the education campaign, which is very important before the introduction of this bill and the actual commencement of the act, requires the details before it can actually commence educating. So we would not want to see you, in the usual ham-fisted manner in which this government operates, not give the industry and the tax office enough time to actually run the education campaign.
I would also like to come to the costings. The tax office were not sure who did the costings and they referred us to you. There are some substantially detailed costings that were put into your press statements and we are just wondering where the analyses were done, given that you did not have conurbation boundaries at that point. Were they something knocked up by your staff in your office? Did Treasury provide them or were they your own work? We were just wondering how you did those calculations and where they came from. The tax office said they did not do the calculations and they had no idea where they were done. But they were fairly detailed and again, Senator Greig, you are not responsible, so I do not at any stage hold you liable for this.
—Yes, we do—he's a Democrat.
—He is a Democrat and I know he was involved in the phone hook-ups, so he cannot escape completely, but I am sure he would have done a much better job in nailing down what a conurbation was and where it was. So we would appreciate it, Senator Kemp, if we could get some indica 
 tion of who did those costings. Finally, I would like to take you to a couple of press statements. One of them is a press release of 31 May in which the Prime Minister said:
The extension to the off-road concession for diesel and like fuels will be limited to providing full credits for marine use, bush nursing homes, hospitals, nursing homes, aged person homes and private residences but not for construction, power generation, manufacturing or forestry. The proposed full credit for mining currently accessing the DFRS will be maintained.
Hopefully, Senator Kemp, you are familiar with the Prime Minister's press release. We then had the government introduce the bill in the other place and Minister Anderson commenced his second reading speech by stating that the bill implements changes to the diesel fuel rebate agreed with the Australian Democrats as part of the package of environmental measures that will now accompany `the introduction of A New Tax System on 1 July 2000'.
I am assuming that the minister has seen that reference, and hopefully he was sitting around the cabinet table at some stage as part of that discussion. But then Minister Tuckey put out a press release that claimed that this legislation was a mistake and that the government had `never intended to reduce the rate of rebate to forestry'. Who is right and who is wrong? Were Minister Anderson, now the Deputy Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister right when they said they intended it to apply to forestry or, as was said by Minister Tuckey—
—You've got the wrong bill. That's TLAB 9.
—I am aware of which bill it is, Minister, but you can perhaps help us.
—We are not debating that one.
—We will get to that one. I am just not going to be here when you do, so I am just slipping that one in. You are good-natured about this and you are always happy to provide information but, unfortunately, I am not going to be here when TLAB 9 comes on.
—Oh!
—I am just trying to help you out here, Minister. Who is telling the truth: the Prime Minister, who said forestry was in; or Minister Tuckey, who said the government had never intended to reduce the rebate? You would have to be a dope to sign up to a deal like this where the Prime Minister gives you a commitment one day and the minister responsible repudiates him the next day. Who is telling the truth? Did you never intend to keep this commitment?

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-06,"—I might respond to a number of matters that Senator Conroy raised because Senator Conroy is about to leave the chamber, and I think I am about to, too.
—No, I am eagerly awaiting your replies.
—Senator Conroy, as is his want, roamed far and wide, and if we did not think so highly of Senator Conroy we would have assumed that he was just wasting time.
—I am hurt by that suggestion.
—I am sure that would not be the case, but I think an objective listener may well have come to that conclusion.
—There were at least 10 questions for you to answer.
—There were a number of questions. Let me deal with the first ones. This is the general political attack that Senator Conroy likes to make whenever he stands up. Let us completely ignore the political attack. The fact of the matter is, Senator Conroy, that you are paranoid because you think the Liberal Party go on what the Labor Party do. We are a different party.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I rise on a point of order. The question I directed to the minister was in relation to whether the levy that is being collected is in fact being used primarily for the construction of public roads.
—Senator, I think the minister will answer it in due course.
—Senator Harris, you might recall that before you got up to speak Senator Conroy got up to speak. What I am proposing to do is to go through the questions that Senator Conroy raised with me and then I will come to your questions. That is the way these committees operate, Senator.
—Senator Harris?
—Oh, here we go!
—I rise on a point of order, Mr Temporary Chairman. I would just like it to be brought to the minister's notice that I had not risen from my chair; I was called.
—Well, you were seeking the call previously so I gave you the benefit, Senator Harris.
—Senator Harris, you did rise from the chair, because I saw you standing, so I think that would be one of the all-time great quibbles in parliamentary history.
I will completely ignore the political comments that Senator Conroy made, because Senator Conroy thinks that the Liberal Party act like the Labor Party and therefore he gets awfully paranoid. We do not. We are a different party and our standards of behaviour are far higher than those of the Labor Party, I am happy to say.
Senator Conroy got onto the issue of trucks going from Melbourne to Geelong and from Ballarat to Melbourne. The truth of the matter is that two trucks making the same journey will be treated the same. You seem to misunderstand the nature of this, Senator Conroy.
—You don't understand.
—You don't, Senator Conroy. This was the all time great comment—
—If their starting points aren't the same—
—Senator Conroy, trucks doing the same journey will be treated the same. So, Senator Conroy, if you think about what you are—
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I rise on a point of order, just to clarify this.
—There is no point of order.
—The minister is struggling.
—Oh, struggling! Senator Conroy, you asked a dopey question. I fail to see the point you are making. If the journeys are the same, they will be treated in the same manner.
—Different starting points.
—They are not the same journeys, then. If their starting points are different, they are not the same journey.
On the issue of the resale value, what is the logic of scrapping the grant to help the resale values? What a genial comment that truly was! The truth of the matter is that this government want to cut taxes and excises. What a dopey comment, Senator Conroy.
In relation to the comment that we are going to take business from buses to cars, this matter was carefully considered by the Economics Legislation Committee, and I thought the committee did a pretty good job. The report of this committee's inquiry into the  Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme (Administration and Compliance) Bill 1999  states:
The Committee rejects the notion that public transport costs must necessarily increase under the DAFGS Act . . . The opportunity for bus operators to convert to cheaper natural gas and LPG will lower costs.
Senator Conroy interjecting—
—Senator Conroy, you ask a range of dopey questions, I stand up to answer them and then you subject me to the most outrageous abuse. I am trying to ignore the provocation of Senator Conroy, so I will proceed:
Further, as the states benefit from the GST revenue—and the states set public transports costs—it is incumbent on the states to pass on this benefit to consumers, as it is in their interests to keep such costs down for social and environmental reasons.
The committee went on to say:
The Committee does not agree that there is a proven need to increase transport costs as a result of the passage of this Bill.
That was considered by the committee. I do not know whether you were part of that committee, Senator Conroy. If you were, your views certainly were not taken into account. Another question was: is the tax office issuing dipsticks?
—The tax office has said it will.
—The tax office has indicated to me that it is not issuing dipsticks. That puts the dipstick issue to rest, at least for a moment. That was a very good, very powerful question, Senator Conroy! It shows that you are really on top of the issue. On the issue of costing, I am going to provide you with some information on that.
—When are we going to get it?
—We will get it to you as quickly as we can, as we always do. We will deal with that.
Having run out of questions on this bill, Senator Conroy then got onto questions on the next bill. As I now have to leave the chamber, I would urge my colleague Senator Campbell to make sure that he deals with questions which relate to this bill. Senator Conroy probably did not understand what was in this bill or went off on a little frolic. Senator Conroy, the forestry issues are in  Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 9) 1999 , which I understand is coming up a little bit later. So the sooner we get through this bill, the sooner we can get onto TLAB (No. 9). That is when those sorts of questions should be posed. In relation to the building of roads issue raised by Senator Harris, there is no specific amount in the excise rate. I will now pass the chair on this side to Senator Campbell who, after his excellent performance on Tuesday, is very anxious to get back into the fray.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,1999-12-06,"—The Assistant Treasurer is leaving, but I am pleased that we have the reserve minister, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Communications, Information 
 Technology and the Arts, Senator Ian Campbell. Perhaps he will be able to inform us a little better of some of the issues. Senator Campbell, is the scheme going to run for two years?
—Yes.
—I have raised some issues with regard to the verification processes for this scheme. It is going to work for only two years. In the course of our hearings on this legislation, we asked the tax office about verification. They said, `Look, some of these things will work out as the thing unfolds.' But it is going to unfold over a relatively short period of time, and I am not sure how you can work it out as it goes along, given that it is a new scheme. I understand it will be 16c a litre.
With regard to registration of vehicles in particular—mainly trucks—the tax office say that they are negotiating with the states. I am still interested to know how that is going to work. I would appreciate more advice than what we got from the Assistant Treasurer about how it is going to work and whether the states are going to be paid for the information they provide. I also raised the following questions with the tax office: what happens when a vehicle is sold and what happens when a vehicle is owned but not operated in the same state as the residential address of the owner, because that occurs quite often in the transport industry.
Equally important is the question of fuel that is eligible for the grant but is being used for other purposes. Can the minister explain what checking processes the tax office will have? Where are we at this point in terms of checks and balances to determine whether or not claims being made for the 16c a litre are legitimate?",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-12-06,"—These issues were gone into in some detail last Tuesday, as Senator Kemp said. But since Senator Murphy was not here last Tuesday I will repeat some of what was said. The government are putting in place a strict verification regime because we do not want 
 the system to be rorted. We think the grants scheme will be good for Australia. We think it will be good for the trucking industry and therefore the transport sector and therefore the efficiency of the economy. But we want to ensure that it is not rorted. As the honourable senator opposite would know, the ATO is well versed in compliance action where there is a self-assessment system involved. We already have the existing example of the income tax system, which is a self-assessment system. The Australian Taxation Office systems in place for that self-assessment system are regarded as efficient and, in many respects, world best practice. The same office will be implementing this system.
 It would clearly be wrong for the commissioner to start from the assumption that every truck owner is going to seek to rort the system. The reality will be that most truck owners will not; most truck owners will work within the system, as they do now. I am informed that the commissioner has actually said this in relation to the tax paying community in general, and that is why we have self-assessment. On the other hand, we can rest assured that the commissioner will do what he has to to ensure that the grants scheme is not rorted. As we discussed at some length last Tuesday, both the bill and the explanatory memorandum contain details of the record keeping powers, and that was gone into over a period of a couple of hours last Tuesday. We went through the sorts of records that will need to be kept. We went into the powers that this bill contains to enable people to pull trucks over to the side of the road, which are very similar powers to those that exist in the fuel substitution act.
I am not sure whether the Labor Party supported that bill when it came through this place. You may not have. It may be the Labor Party's policy, which will emerge, I guess, at some stage before or after the next election, to roll back the new tax system. Maybe part of the roll back is to unwind this grants scheme and maybe to remove some of the verification procedures. I am not sure. You will obviously have to discuss that at your national conference and within the caucus. That may be part of the roll back, or the walk 
 back, that Mr Beazley refers to. Maybe you do not like strict verification and antirorting procedures within these sorts of legislative and regulatory regimes, but we think it is important that the scheme has integrity. This scheme and the powers in it to enforce the record keeping are provided to the commissioner to ensure proper enforcement.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,1999-12-06,"—I say to the minister, through you, Mr Temporary Chairman, that record keeping is one thing, but I gave an example both to the minister and to the tax office earlier about diesel fuel that is claimed as eligible for the grant but is used for other purposes. History will tell us that even with the diesel fuel rebate scheme there were problems and, of course, the then government moved to rectify some of those problems with regard to verification. But this is a new scheme. The minister has said, `Look, the tax office has verification powers and stands on its record.' I would suggest to him and to the tax office, with no disrespect to the tax office, that the self-assessment program that it has in place at the moment has its own problems, and some of them are quite significant and have been stated publicly with regard to an existing, self-assessment process.
This is a new one. If somebody has an off-road operation, be it in mining, forestry or agriculture, where the diesel they purchase is eligible for the DFRS, or could be eligible under this new grants scheme, and it were to be used in another aspect of the company and/or the person's business—that is, where it would not be eligible—what is the process for checking that? There are many examples, and I am sure that the minister is aware of the potential for these things to exist. How do you actually check the volition of the claim as to whether or not all of the diesel is eligible? An example could be that the employees of a forest harvesting contractor could all have diesel vehicles—most of them do—and they could all fill up out of the contractor's diesel tank in the bush, and that diesel would not really be eligible for the scheme but you have the person claiming it. I am not sure that you can actually verify this and I think that, unless you have some process in place, you 
 are not going to be able to verify it. I will quote what Mr Colmer from the tax office actually said about that:
To some extent that is something that is going to develop as the scheme unfolds because we do not have detailed experience at the moment with this scheme. This is a new scheme that is starting next year. We are trying to get in place a balance of requirements so that people can undertake their business and we can actually monitor the arrangements.
It is the monitoring of arrangements that I would like to know about, because you do not have any records at the moment other than the diesel rebate scheme records. They are the only records, I would suggest, that the tax office has for you to be able to check as to whether or not, when this new scheme starts, people are actually making larger claims for diesel which they are using for other purposes. What is to stop a company or a person buying diesel for others?
Those are the sorts of things which were experienced with the early diesel fuel rebate scheme, and I would like to know exactly how you intend to monitor them. This is only a two-year program. I cannot accept the tax office saying, `It will develop as the scheme unfolds,' because you are essentially going to have two financial years. I would have thought you would have been a little bit further down the track with regard to a detailed proposal of what types of checks and balances you intend to have in place to ensure that the 16c a litre that is going to be paid through the scheme is actually paid for what it is intended.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-12-06,"—There is not really a lot more to add. I realise the Labor Party have a range of views on these things, and I guess the challenge for the leadership of the Labor Party is to try to pull them together. Senator Conroy seems to think that this verification regime is far too strict and is going to impose too much on truck drivers. He would like to roll it back so it would be a slack sort of scheme that could easily be rorted. Senator Murphy is saying, I think, that it is maybe not tight enough, and 
 Senator Hutchins on Tuesday had his own concerns about whether trucks could be pulled over. There is a whole range of different views on the scheme. I guess the big challenge for those opposite is to come up with an alternative taxation system that will raise the revenue, that will be fair to people, and that will be efficient. We have sought to do that and this is obviously part of the arrangement.
What the honourable senator opposite quoted was an extract from the committee Hansard, I presume, where the tax officer said, `It is a new scheme and we are going to develop it.' I think what was said in the Hansard, and I am sure it was quoted accurately, was a very wise and sensible contribution to the debate. It would of course be absurd for a tax officer giving evidence to a Senate committee to say, `These are all the rules, it is all ready to go, and there is no more development of the program to take place.' The tax office, as I said on numerous occasions last Tuesday and now today, have experience in these self-assessment systems.
This is, as the tax officer before the inquiry said, a new system, but it is based on self-assessment. There is a range of powers available to the tax office. I refer the honourable senator to page 13 of the explanatory memorandum which, at 2.3, talks about part 4, which contains the rules about record keeping and substantiation. It refers to the fact that the commissioner can, for five years after a claim is made, go back and audit it. If someone seeks a grant, buys the diesel and then gives it to someone else—in other words they rort the system—that would be a fraud and against the Crimes Act. There would be quite serious penalties, the smallest of which would probably be to ensure that they are not eligible for any future grants. There is a whole range of methods. The tax office will verify that it is for business purposes, and any business records may be examined for that purpose. So if there is rorting and fraud going on, the chances are that, at some time, the tax office will find it and the person who is rorting will be charged with fraud.
Senator Murphy may have a suggestion as to how he thinks we could improve the measures to reduce the chances of rorting and 
 to improve the chances of people getting caught, so I welcome him back to the debate. At the moment all we have had is a series of Labor senators coming up with a range of different views. Some seem to want to make the system slacker and easier to rort—that is the Conroy faction. I have not figured out where Senator Hutchins is coming from. He has asked a series of questions about how trucks can be pulled over to the side of the road. I do not know whether Senator Hutchins thinks it is a good thing that a truck can be pulled over to see if they are rorting a grants scheme or whether he thinks you should just let them go on rorting. He may be just trying to get across the regime, which I informed the Senate last Tuesday is very similar to the fuel substitution regime in terms of the powers available to the commissioner. I do refer the senator to page 13 of the explanatory memorandum, which sets it out very clearly. There is nothing I can add to that, quite frankly.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,1999-12-06,"—For the minister's benefit and to clarify our position, Senator Conroy is saying that you really cannot verify this process without making it so restrictive and without having the record keeping so tough and onerous that it is hardly worth the trouble. It will be a cost to truck operators in particular. But that is not the question I am asking.
I might make this suggestion with regard to off-road agricultural, mining and/or forestry diesel, which is currently already eligible for the diesel fuel rebate scheme. Maybe it would have been a worthwhile exercise to make some assessment of the current fuel volumes used so that you would know whether or not there is a rort in the process further down the two-year track. That may have some application. This is a new scheme, and what has not been explained is where somebody puts in a claim and then uses the diesel for other purposes. The tax officer said this is going to develop as the scheme unfolds. This is the tax office that came before this committee—the tax office that you say has all this experience with regard to self-assessment programs.
I would have thought that they would have at least been able to come before the committee and say, `Senator, these are the things we 
 have in mind in terms of checks and balances' and not `This is a new scheme,' because that contradicts the minister's proposition to the Senate that the tax office have all of the experience. It was the tax office that came before the committee. If they have all the experience, why could they not have explained some of that experience to us in respect of this scheme?
I am not saying that you should make the record keeping tougher; I am saying that there ought to be some thought given to ensure that the scheme is not rorted. As I put to the minister before, the tax office already has a problem with self-assessment schemes. That has been publicly acknowledged by the Commissioner for Taxation. I would really like to know if they are going to work it out as it goes along. It has two financial years of running. Sure, the tax commissioner might be able to go back five years, but in this case he will only be able to go back two because that is the extent of its operation. How is he going to do all that? How are you going to run this and ensure that the diesel that is eligible for the 16c a litre is being used for the intended grant purpose?

"Harris, Sen Len",IND,1999-12-06,"—I would like clarification from Senator Ian Campbell—or Senator Kemp, since he has returned to the chamber—in relation to private roads. Part of the criteria for eligibility is that the vehicle is to be used on public roads. Private property owners in North Queensland and, I assume, throughout the rest of Australia have extensive private roads—some of them far in excess of hundreds of kilometres. If they were on the public road they would be eligible for the rebate. My question is: are they eligible to access the grant if the same vehicle, carrying the same goods, is used on their own private roads?",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,6,1,speech
"Campbell, Sen Ian",LP,1999-12-06,"—I am advised that, under this scheme, the proposition that Senator Harris puts is correct—that is, they will not benefit from this grant on private roads. But, under certain circum 
 stances, depending on what they are carrying, they may be eligible under the DFRS.
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I raise a point of order. I noticed that Senator Kemp was in the chamber. I think he has gone out to read a newspaper. Shouldn't the minister be dealing with the bill? It is his bill. I think we would make more progress if the minister who is supposed to be handling the bill were here. That is no reflection on Senator Ian Campbell. It is Senator Kemp who is causing the problem by dancing in and out of the chamber. We want some answers to the questions, and we do not want to be here until Christmas. I think Senator Kemp owes it to the chamber to answer the questions that are put to him when he is here.

"Hutchins, Sen Steve",ALP,1999-12-06,"—Senator Ian Campbell, I want to clear up for you where we might be coming from. There are no factions on this or a different point of view. What we are trying to ascertain from the government—and I think you may agree with me—is whether the new tax that you have introduced, and which you have made so complicated to comply with and administer, is going to be an administrative nightmare for the companies that are going to have to work within it and also for the Australian Taxation Office. In the end, this has all come about because we do not have a definition in respect of conurbated and non-conurbated parts of Australia. As I understand it, the grants scheme will apply, to a large degree, from where you purchase the diesel.

Possible parliamentary question 3.41
East Timorese—Refusal to move to East Hills
Possible Question:
How does the Minister respond to the refusal of East Timorese evacuees to move from the safe haven in Leeuwin to East Hills?
Suggested Response:
I can confirm that a number of East Timorese in the Leeuwin safe haven in Western Australia refused—at the last moment—to get on a plane to take them to Sydney to join their fellow countrymen at East Hills.
I am concerned that they were encouraged by irresponsible elements in the local community, to boycott the flight. I see this as an unconscionable act.
The residents have known about the consolidation plans for some time. 

On 26 November, East Timorese at the safe haven in Leeuwin were advised of arrangements to transfer—to East Hills—those families who did not return to East Timor.
However, 6 families at Leeuwin have members who are not well enough to fly interstate at this time. These families were to stay at Leeuwin until they were fit to travel.
A few hours before the charter flight scheduled for this morning, the evacuees advised safe haven staff that they refused to be separated as a group.
They had given no previous indication of concerns about these arrangements.
They insisted that unless those families with members unfit to fly were included in the flight the whole group would stay together at Leeuwin.
Safe haven staff explained that it was not possible for the whole group to fly together at that time because it would endanger the lives of those not medically cleared to travel.
Consequently, at a cost of $30,000 to the taxpayer, the flight was cancelled.
Now that a substantial number of East Timorese have returned to East Timor, we need to consolidate those people remaining, in the East Hills safe haven.
Yesterday 213 of the Leeuwin residents voluntarily returned to East Timor.
Consolidated of Leeuwin with East Hills will lead to savings of almost $1 million per month.
Maintaining Leeuwin safe haven with only one-third capacity for the 153 people who remain there is uneconomic and places an unfair burden on the Australian taxpayer.
Consolidation of evacuees in fewer havens reduces costs for security, catering, defence staff, DIMA staff, medical facilities and support services.
The safe haven at East Hills has capacity for over 1,000 people if necessary and has held up to 831 Kosovars.
My department has kept the residents of the safe havens informed about the availability of return flights and the plans to consolidate the safe havens.
I am very disappointed at the actions of members of the community.
Additional information for Senator Vanstone in response to a question from Senator Bartlett
The UNHCR no longer considers that there is a well founded fear of those who escaped from East Timor being persecuted if they return.
There are health and housing issues which need to be addressed in East Timor and these are being 
 addressed. Australia's aid package including an additional $60M this financial year will contribute to this as will the work of the UNHCR and aid agencies operating in East Timor:
Australia's funding will be used to supply building materials and for health programs such as child immunisation, malaria prevention, and training of midwives.
Any evacuees living in safe havens in Australia who have serious health problems are not expected to return at this time. They and their immediate families can stay until they are fit to travel.
All those East Timorese who are returning from Australia are doing so voluntarily and they are asked to sign a form stating that this is the case:

"McKiernan, Sen James",ALP,1999-12-06,"—I give notice that, on the next day of sitting, I shall move:
That the time for the presentation of the report of the Legal and Constitutional References Com 
 mittee on the operation of Australia's refugee and humanitarian program be extended to 29 June 2000.
I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard  a brief statement in relation to the notice that I have just given.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
Referral of the Inquiry
On 13 May 1999 the Senate referred to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee an inquiry into the operation of Australia's Refugee and Humanitarian Program. The inquiry was to report by 18 October 1999. On 30 September 1999 the Committee sought and received an extension of time to report to the first sitting day of the second sitting week, 2000.
The Committee now seeks an extension of time to report to 29 June 2000.
Reason for Request for Extension of Time to Report
The Senate and the Australian community are entitled to an explanation as to why the Committee seeks a further extension of time.
Delays Caused by Ministerial Decisions 
The Committee's work was interrupted by the decision of both the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and the Minister for Foreign Affairs that their officers would not provide information to the Committee. The information related to the case of the person known as the Chinese woman. The grounds stated by Minister Ruddock for refusing such information were that:
.	 a separate inquiry had been established, and it was expected that this would be a thorough and detailed investigation; and
.	 the person undertaking the inquiry should not feel under any pressure to complete the task;
The Committee was concerned that the explanation seeks to avoid the obligation of departments to provide information on the basis that a Ministerial inquiry will have precedence. However there is no basis for such an approach, and it was noted that the absence of a reporting date for Mr Ayers' inquiry did not suggest that information would be available to the Committee in a reasonable time. The Minister for Foreign Affairs, who, we believe, had even less reason for seeking to interfere in a Senate inquiry, used a similar argument. The terms of Mr Ayers inquiry related primarily to actions of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs and its officers. This approach resulted in delay to the work of the Committee, with considerable time spent in discussions and correspondence. The Committee, after lengthy deliberation, took the decision to exercise its powers and ordered both 
 departments to appear before it. The Minister's reversed their decisions and officers of the departments appeared voluntarily at later hearings and the Committee was then provided with a substantial amount of information, including documents. The Committee is pleased at this outcome which avoided the need for referring the matter to the Senate and possibly to the Privileges Committee.
Confidential documents
A further burden to the Committee's work has been caused in part by the production of a substantial amount of material which departments have requested remain confidential. Such requests relate to personal and other information about the Chinese woman, and about Mr SE; to extensive correspondence including cables and other documents from departments; and to several other items including contracts between DIMA and a series of service providers in the Information Advice and Application Scheme (IAAAS).
On several occasions I have, on behalf of the Committee, sought advice from both departments about the status of this information. While I accept that material relating to a person's application for protection in Australia and to their medical status should generally remain confidential—primarily on the grounds of privacy—there seems little benefit in placing much other information in a similar category.
At this time, although DFAT has provided an extensive list of documents that may be published, DIMA has cleared a limited number for publication. It has also not provided documents relating to contractual arrangements for services on the basis that these will only be provided if they are not published. It is necessary for departments to realise that, regardless of the decisions of Committee members, the Senate retains the power to order the publication of material; hence, it is not possible for the Committee itself to make any definitive order of the type requested by DIMA.
The claim of commercial in confidence is increasingly common in respect of material that is sought by Parliament. At this stage, the Committee has not pursued this issue. However, I note the matter as a reason for delays experienced in obtaining information to address the terms of reference of our inquiry.
The Committee notes that claims of confidentiality can often disrupt hearings and make it difficult to obtain information essential to an inquiry. While there will be many documents that should not be published for good reasons—and this Committee accepts appropriate limitations—broad requests can hinder effective questioning and investigation.
New legislation
A second reason for seeking an extension is the emergence of important new legislation governing 
 the legal framework for people seeking protection in Australia. On 23 November 1999, the government introduced into the Senate the Border Protection Bill 1999 , which was passed two days later with bipartisan support.
Among other things the new law introduced:
.	 temporary visas for unauthorised arrivals found to be refugees;
.	 prevented access to Australia's refugee determination system for those with alternative protection avenues;
.	 and increased the powers to accurately identify asylum seekers.
The committee considered it important to devote time to evaluating the practical and policy implications of these new laws, and considerable time in public hearings was spent exploring these issues with departmental officials.
Need for Additional Hearings 
A further reason the Committee seeks an extension is the need for additional hearings and other briefings.
Between 5 July and 29 November 1999 the Committee held 15 public hearings and 9 in camera hearings. It plans another hearing tomorrow (7 December). Next week, the committee will be discussing issues with officers from the Attorney-General's department, and the committee expects to hold a further hearing in Western Australia early in 2000.
The Committee needs additional time in which to consider this evidence.
Other Factors 
First report
The Committee had planned to present a first report to the Senate before the end of this current sitting session. A considerable amount of the work has been done in the preparation of chapters relating to some of the Inquiry's terms of reference. However, during deliberation on these drafts, the Committee found that it was difficult to separate and compartmentalise each term of reference. Reluctantly, the Committee decided to abandon the idea of reporting separately on some terms of reference in order that the report should be complete and comprehensive when it is tendered to the Senate.
Issues not within terms of reference
I should also note that a further difficulty which the Committee has experienced has been the belief that the inquiry concerns a range of issues relating to immigration detention centres, such as treatment of detainees and the legality of detention itself. Members have sought to explain to individuals and organisations that there is no specific term of reference that examines the issue of detention centres, but this has not always been accepted. 
 Other concerns—about removal from Australia, about the conduct of a case before the RRT—have also been expressed. The Committee has advised that it is not in a position to investigate individual cases, with the exception of the two referred in the terms of reference. Again, this has not always been understood or accepted by members of the community.
These matters have also added significantly to the Committee's work, requiring both discussion and correspondence.
Allegations of intimidation/assault of witnesses
The Committee has also received reports during the course of the inquiry about assault and intimidation of witnesses and of other persons. The Committee took action on these matters for two reasons. Firstly, allegations of assault against detainees who themselves may have limited access to other sources of assistance, must necessarily be reported to the appropriate authorities in the same way as any such allegation would be reported by a citizen.
Secondly, the Committee emphasises that intimidation or assault of a witness in respect of evidence given or believed to have been given to the Committee is prohibited under the Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987, the principles of which are set out in the Standing and Other Orders of the Senate.
The Committee has been obliged to consider matters in both categories. This has further delayed its consideration of evidence, but it believes that such action is essential in order to maintain the rights of witnesses and of Committees of the Parliament.
For the above reasons, I would ask that the Senate agree to the request for an extension of time to report.",SENATE,<title>NOTICES</title>,<title>Presentation</title>,Notices,11,1,speech

That the Senate take note of the report.
I am pleased to present a report on the proceedings of a seminar on world debt hosted by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade on 27 August this year. The seminar was opened by the parliamentary secretary responsible for Australia's aid program, the Hon. Kathy Sullivan MP, and the panel of speakers on the day included representatives of Jubilee 2000 and several other non-government organisations. The seminar was balanced by the inclusion of academics and officers of government departments and was very well attended by members of the diplomatic corps, representatives of government and non-government organisations and other interested parties.
The debt of the world's poorest nations is an issue that all sides of politics have a great deal of concern about, a concern shared by many people in Australia and around the world. A petition of 385,000 signatures from Australians that was presented to members of parliament clearly demonstrates the depth of feeling in the community about the debt issue. The Australian petition formed a part of a global petition of some 17 million signatures, which was delivered to the June 1999 meeting of the G7 nations in Cologne.
The debate about development has evolved in recent years. Debt is one of the fundamental problems inhibiting growth in the poorest nations of the world. There is a belief that debt and a failure to develop are intrinsically linked: highly indebted nations are unable to attract investment, nor to invest in their own social capital because of the debt burden they carry.
In 1996 the World Bank and the IMF launched the Highly Indebted Poor Country Initiative to alleviate some of the debt of the poorest nations. Criticisms have focused on the initiative's strict qualifying criteria, the limited amount of debt forgiveness and the long compliance period that countries must adhere to before debt forgiveness is offered. In response to the continuing debt crisis and the perceived shortcomings of the HIPC Initiative, a broad coalition of interested parties began campaigning for greater debt 
 forgiveness for the poorest nations by the year 2000 on moral and ethical grounds. In June 1999 G7 leaders agreed on the Cologne Debt Initiative, which would relax some of the criteria for access to debt relief and, most importantly, substantially increase the amount of money offered for debt forgiveness.
Australia bears little responsibility for the indebtedness of other nations. We accept that the role that the Australian government can play in reducing the debt of developing countries is somewhat limited. The committee's report therefore focuses on the concrete objectives that Australia can pursue to reduce poverty in the world's poorest and in other developing nations. In our report, we recognised the need for a fine balance between the monetary cost of the Jubilee 2000 proposals for debt relief and the human cost of doing nothing and the debt crisis continuing. It is on this basis that the committee recommended the government's continued support for the HIPC Initiative.
Australia does not have a great deal of bilateral debt owed to it by other nations, and even less of that debt is not being serviced. This is largely a result of prudent decisions to offer development assistance in the form of grants, not loans. At the seminar the committee was told that these debts totalled less than $80 million. In the spirit of the HIPC Initiative, the committee recommended that Australia offer this bilateral debt to be considered as part of any future contributions to the revised HIPC Initiative, where those countries are permitted and agree to meet HIPC conditions.
Despite the IMF proposal to revalue some of its reserves of gold in order to pay for the HIPC Initiative, the initiative will not be fully funded. It is on the basis of this expected shortfall that the committee recommended that the Australian government give consideration to additional contributions towards the HIPC Initiative, in line with Australia's levels of obligation to the IMF and the World Bank.
We also recommended that the Australian government give consideration to increasing substantially the current levels of Australian official development assistance. This recommendation is consistent with the government 
 continuing to endorse a ratio of 0.7 per cent of GNP to be spent on development assistance. During the seminar we also heard of the problems with putting any conditions on granting debt forgiveness. It was made clear to us that the problem is a serious one, and the committee recommended that the government negotiate a form of conditionality which will prevent the expenditure of these funds on military equipment or corrupt practices.
Debt relief may be a circuit-breaker but it is not a panacea for the development of the world's poorest countries. Development will flow only from a genuine commitment to improving the material conditions of people, along with basic policies and robust institutions that are essential to growth. In conclusion, may I commend the work of Jonathan Bonnar from our committee in putting this seminar together and his efforts in formulating the report. I commend the report to the Senate.

"Gibson, Sen Brian",LP,1999-12-06,"—by leave—I present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to Greece, Turkey and Cyprus, which took place from 6 to 21 July 1999. I inform the Senate that the delegation was led by the Speaker of the House of Representatives, the Hon. Neil Andrew. The deputy leader was Duncan Kerr and the other members of the delegation were Joel Fitzgibbon, David Hawker, Mrs Danna Vale and me. The secretary was Mr John Kain from the library. We visited the three countries of Greece, Turkey and Cyprus at a sensitive time. The wars in the Balkans have impacted on each of those countries, and we visited Cyprus during the 25th anniversary of Turkish intervention.
 Australia has strong social and cultural links with all three countries. There are over 600,000 Australian residents of Greek extraction, 100,000 of Turkish extraction, and a considerable number from Cyprus. I understand that the Australian Cypriot community is one of the largest outside Cyprus. These migrants have made a very rich contribution to Australia—to its arts, media, cuisine and business. While none of these countries are major trading partners with Australia, they do offer important export growth and investment opportunities.
 I have some comments on the economies of these countries. Firstly, I believe that the 
 Olympic Games in Athens in 2004 offers considerable investment potential for Australian businesses. Australian construction and related industries would be wise to take up those opportunities, given their experience in Sydney. Greece's economic orientation is, naturally, focused on Europe. It has been a full member of the European Union since 1981, and it is a significant net beneficiary of EU funding. It entered the European exchange rate mechanism in March 1998. In regard to economic policy, the government's stated top priority is to ensure that Greece achieves the convergence criteria to enable it to enter into the economic and monetary union. Towards this end, the government passed a very tight budget in 1998, imposed new taxes and curbed public expenditure. It also introduced significant changes in labour force arrangements, particularly applicable to publicly owned, debt-ridden companies such as Olympic Airways and the Greek post office. As well, there has been an extensive restructuring of the public education system. These changes have attracted significant public opposition, but the aim to be well and truly part of the European Union overrides all that.
 Turkey is increasingly becoming an economic powerhouse in the region. I guess that not many Australians realise that there are 63 million people in Turkey and that the natural increase is a million and a half people each year. However, there have been significant problems in Turkey, particularly its internal upheaval as a result of its Kurdish problem. Already there has been a significant growth in our trading relationship with Turkey and, in recent years, there have been agriculture, animal husbandry and irrigation infrastructure developments between the two countries. The export of fast ferries to Turkey has also been noteworthy. It has a young and fast growing population and the government places a priority on improving its people's educational levels. But its education system is under considerable strain and this opens up opportunities for Australian educational institutions.
 The Turkey-Australia economic relationship is supported by a number of bilateral agreements in such fields as trade and economic cooperation, migration and taxation. 
 Turkey has embarked upon a large-scale infrastructure development and modernisation program. The aftermath of the earthquake will certainly have an accelerating effect on this program. The outpouring of international assistance following the tragedy has also drawn Turkey closer to its neighbours in Europe. Particularly noteworthy was the response from Greece, because there has certainly been a lot of enmity between those two countries.
 Cyprus is only a very small market but it does offer the potential as a bridgehead for the rapidly growing markets of the region. It is a fellow member of the Commonwealth of Nations and the Australia-Cyprus relationship reflects the common institutional inheritances of our origins. Australian Federal Police force members attached to the United Nations civilian police have been serving on the demarcation line in Cyprus for many years. While we were there we met with the Federal Police representatives, and they were very pleased to see us.
All three countries are certainly oriented to Europe and, while Greece is already a member of the European Union, Turkey and Cyprus are very keen to join. That was a very strong theme that we encountered. We had a very worthwhile visit and I must say that the ambassadors looked after us very well; in fact they complimented us on coming to visit the countries in which they are stationed. Particularly as we were led by the Speaker, we had access to presidents and prime ministers, which would have been difficult to achieve otherwise. As the only senator on the committee, I wish to thank the countries, the embassies and the parliaments for their overwhelming hospitality, the great receptions they gave us, and the friendliness they showed to each and every one of us.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-12-06,"—The Diesel and Alternative Fuels Grants Scheme (Administration and Compliance) Bill 1999  provides for a difference in treatment regarding those people who live in conurbations or run trucks from conurbations and those who do not. Section 99 of the Constitution says:
The Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation of trade, commerce, or revenue, give preference to one State or any part thereof over another State or any part thereof.
Has the government taken account of section 99? Has it got advice that section 99 in some way or other is disregarded in this matter?",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-06,"—My understanding is that this bill has gone through the usual processes. It has been through the Attorney-General's Department. We believe that the bill is constitutional. If it were not, we would not be bringing it before this chamber. This is a grants scheme. As you would be aware, the Commonwealth has a large range of 
 grants schemes. We have decided on the criteria for this grants scheme. I am sure that, in quality, it would be similar to many other types of grants schemes that the Commonwealth has.
—Would the minister be good enough to explain the difference between a rebate and a grant?
—A rebate is, I think, essentially a payment back of a tax. As I have said, we have decided to provide this as a grants scheme and we have set the criteria for it.
—Is the minister telling the committee that the payment back of a tax is not a preference in the matters of trade, commerce and transport?
—Senator, this is a grants scheme. We are making a grant. This will mean that, providing you meet the other general criteria, there will be less effective costs in fuels such as diesel fuel. We think this is a good thing for Australia, as it will assist in making transport cheaper to rural and regional Australia. I do not know whether you agree with that, but I can tell you that most people in rural and regional Australia do agree with that.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech

The Commonwealth shall not, by any law or regulation of trade, commerce, or revenue, give preference to one State or any part thereof over another State or any part thereof.
Would the minister be good enough to tell the committee how giving a rebate on a tax of this variety—which is, of course, at the heart of trade—is not a matter of giving preference to one region of Australia as against another?

 All my other remarks in the Hansard  remain. This is a grants scheme. This has gone through the various procedures that bills are required to go through before they are constitutional.

On the face of it, there is a constitutional impediment to treating one region of Australia differently from another. We have elicited that there is not written advice to the government to the contrary but that there is advice from the Attorney-General's Department. The easiest thing here would be for the minister to simply explain what that advice is.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-12-06,"—It is quite normal for any opposition—including your party when you were in opposition—even when supporting a measure, to scrutinise thoroughly the reasons that the government has advanced and the arguments that it puts forward. There is nothing strange or unusual in doing that. The fact is that with this proposal to define urban conurbations and have effectively lower costs in rural and regional Australia—which, coming from Tasmania, I do not have any objection to—you have higher costs in the urban conurbations, however they are defined, and you have to draw arbitrary boundaries between urban conurbations and non-urban conurbations. A range of inconsistencies and anomalies will emerge, and the enforcement of these new boundaries will be bureaucratic and, as a consequence, costly. Effectively, a new enforcement regime will have to apply.
The statement by the Prime Minister `Costings of Commonwealth and state measures'—which arose as a result of the deal with the Australian Democrats—has listed on page 2 total cost to government, funding measures and additional revenue.

—Which page are you reading from?
—Sorry. It is the statement by the Prime Minister on 31 May, `Costings of Commonwealth and state measures'. My apologies; I had the wrong date. It has diesel fuel excise mid-range vehicles: $199 million for the year 2000-2001, $209 million for the year 2001-02 and $223 million for the year 2002-03. I assume they are the correct figures.

Those figures turned out to be misleading in a number of ways, but that is another issue. I do not want to be overly provocative and I do not want to keep the Senate chamber on this legislation for too long. You then did a deal with the Democrats. 
 The document that I have here from 31 May outlines the cost to revenue and the additional expenditure involved in that deal with the Democrats. We know that the transport of goods and services has a significant impact on the cost of those goods. We know that there is an additional cost as a result of the position the Democrats took.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-06,"—I will go through this again. Senator, I guess if you repeat yourself, there is no reason why I should not repeat myself—that's called showbiz. This is a measure that the government has announced following the agreement with Meg Lees and the Democrats. This measure will be to the overall benefit of industry and transport costs. An environmental issue was raised by the Democrats. As a result, a bill in the current form has been produced to this chamber. The overall benefit is going to be very important to regional and rural Australia.
I make that general point and then I come to the next point—the impact on inflation. The Treasurer has announced, based on the best available Treasury estimates, an overall inflationary effect of the ANTS package. I do not know if I can disaggregate that for you any further. The Treasurer probably feels, quite correctly, that he has given a great deal of information. But if you feel any further information is needed, I will put that to the Treasurer.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-12-06,"—This is an important issue. We hear from the government, the Liberal-National Party, ad nauseam about these cost savings. It will be interesting to see how much that cost saving passes through to the consumer in terms of the final price paid in rural and regional Australia. I would like you, Minister, if you could, to give an undertaking to us that the full price flow will occur. That is the first question, Minister, I would like you to address—a guarantee, or an undertaking, that the full savings will flow through into cost reductions for rural and regional Australia. 
 That is a very important issue for rural and regional Australia.
I asked you a second time about the inflationary impact of this change to the original ANTS package not because I believe in asking questions two or three times but because I thought you misunderstood. What we would like to know is: what is the inflationary impact of the additional cost that mid-range vehicles are going to incur as a result of this change to diesel fuel rebate in urban conurbations? I think that is important. That is the second issue you should address, Minister.
 Looking at the figures, the $199 million in the year 2000-01 increases by about five per cent, by approximately $9 million, in the following year. In the next year it increases by a little over five per cent. Why the increase? What is the basis for the increase in the figure over those two years?
Flowing on from that, in order to achieve these estimates, you must have had some formula for calculating the cost to industry and the revenue saving to government. In order to have that formula, you must have had some idea about the proportion of kilometres travelled by these vehicles over a year. In order to have that, you must have had some idea about the number of kilometres spent by vehicles in urban conurbations vis-a-vis rural or non-urban conurbations. In order to come to that estimate, you must have had some idea of the borders of these so-called urban conurbations. We would like the detail of that. How did you come to this calculation? You must have some preliminary detail in order to make these estimates. That is my fourth point. I think it is a very important issue.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-06,"—We expect that the savings we are providing will flow through to regional and rural Australia. That is one of the marching orders of the ACCC to deal with this issue. I do not think Senator Sherry was at the Senate committee when the ACCC appeared. We expect cost savings to flow through. The second issue is the cost to mid-range vehicles. It is clear that the grant scheme applies to vehicles that take journeys where at least one point is outside the conur 
 bation. We do not have figures that we can assist you with there.
The third issue is the overall inflationary impact of this measure. I have discussed it, and I do not think I can add anything further to what I said earlier. Your fourth point concerns the calculation of the figures. These figures were prepared by Treasury. As far as providing you with some more information on how the conurbations will be defined, I am afraid that you will just have to wait until this material is released.

"Harris, Sen Len",IND,1999-12-06,"—I seek some clarification from the minister about vehicles between 4.5 and 20 tonnes that travel long distances outside the exclusion areas. A vehicle under full maximum load, for instance, from Brisbane to Cairns will consume X litres per 100 kilometres. If it is not able to get a back-load and it returns unloaded, it will use Y litres per 100 kilometres.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-06,—It is the eligible kilometres over the total kilometres travelled by the quantity of fuel. I suggest that Senator Harris look at section 1.21 of the EM.

 If there is, I would be surprised. It seems to me to be pretty straightforward.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-12-06,"—I follow on from the point that Senator Harris is making. I appreciate his concern. Queensland is a slightly bigger state than Tasmania. There is an enormous amount of trucking around Queensland, as there is in Tasmania. Both states share at least one thing in common, which is that the majority of the population lives outside the capital cities, unlike all other Australian states.
Point 1.21 of the explanatory memorandum provides the statutory formula for working out the eligible use of fuel. There are then a number of paragraphs. It goes across the page. If I were a truckie reading this, I would be a bit concerned. Obviously, not many of them would read an explanatory memorandum. I assume that their accountants and financial advisers would do that for them. It begs the question of the costs involved for the truckie in addition to the cost of the advice they have to get from their accountant or financial adviser.
But, on reading this formula, it seems to me that a driver would have to record accurately in some diary the quantity of fuel that is consumed between stops. Are you able to address that issue, Minister?
—They are required to record eligible fuel consumption.
—Senator Harris raised this issue initially, so I should give the floor to him.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",IND,1999-12-06,"—The issue that I am raising is that these vehicles can carry up to two tonnes of fuel. A normal fuel gauge will give them increments in either quarters or tenths, so there is a variation of anywhere between whatever number you want to pick and 20 litres showing on the actual gauge. My question is: how is the government going to require these drivers to say that they have left point A, travelled to point B, returned back to point A and used exactly the litres of fuel that they are going to claim on the rebate? Unless they happened to start their journey from a service station and return to the same service 
 station and fill again, they are going to have considerable difficulty in relating the total kilometres to the total quantity of fuel used.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-06,"—What we say in the formula is that it is the total quantity of fuel used, which presumably you can get from the bowser or your various gauges, by the eligible kilometres divided by total kilometres. I think you are raising an issue which, it is clear to me, is not complex at all. The formula just requires the total quantity of fuel. I do not think there is a complication in measuring the total quantity of fuel that you have put in your vehicle. Then you multiply that by the eligible kilometres divided by the total kilometres. I do not see that that is a complex issue. It seems to me to be quite straightforward. I am not quite sure where you are heading or what the construct is.
We are giving a benefit. This is a significant benefit, and I think it is something which is eagerly sought by rural and regional Australia. I am surprised you adopt such a negative attitude to it. The truth of the matter is that this is something which is going to be of importance to rural and regional Australia. It is far better than the current arrangements. You are not standing up and defending the current arrangements, are you? I think you are not, and neither should you. This is a better arrangement. Quite clearly, when you bring in a new scheme, there are certain compliance issues. You are well aware of our agreement with the Democrats. The Democrats were concerned about environmental issues in the city areas—the conurbations, as we call them. So arrangements were made. But this is a big plus. The way you are addressing this issue, it seems to me you are thinking that this is a minus. This is a big plus for rural and regional Australia.
I think the original scheme the government went to the election on was very widely supported. It was not matched by the Labor Party in any shape or form. This is something we think is important. This is the mark 2 version. We agree with that. But you are aware of that debate. Senator Greig is particularly aware of that debate. But I do not think there is a complexity along the lines that you 
 are talking about, when you view the formula in section 1.21 of the EM.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Harris, Sen Len",IND,1999-12-06,"—I would just like to note on the record that I am neither supporting the initiative nor condemning it. I am trying to achieve some clarity for the people who are going to have to use it. In many cases, these vehicles do not start and complete their journeys from similar areas. They do not fuel up going in or out of restricted or non-restricted areas. I am merely seeking clarification from the government as to how these different kilometres and the percentage that will be eligible kilometres are going to be recorded by the drivers of these vehicles—nothing more; nothing less.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-06,"—Each time you fill the tank you record the number of litres. There is no big deal in recording that. You are able to tell the distance travelled from the gauges in the vehicle. There is no great complexity in that, particularly if you are going to get a nice big grant at the end of it. If you do not want to record any of it and do not want to apply for it, you do not have to. But let me make a bet with you that these compliance arrangements are not complex. You record how much fuel you put in. You fill up your tank, so you record that. You make a calculation from the gauges in the vehicle how far you have travelled on an eligible journey. It is very straightforward.
I must confess I am a little bit sorry to hear you are neither supporting nor opposing the measure. I would have thought that if you are interested in rural and regional Australia you should have been out there strongly supporting this measure. You should have been screaming from the rooftops to bring this in as soon as possible, because this is what rural and regional Australia wants. We are cutting back on the very high excise costs which the former government imposed.
—Oh, rubbish!
—In the last election, the former government, by the way, did not offer any measure, as I remember, in relation to excise. I do not think there is that complexity that you are talking about. These are not complex calculations. It seems to me that they 
 are quite straightforward. Given the incentive to get a grant at the end of it all, I think we will have a very high percentage of eligible truckies who are very keen to claim this grant—a very high percentage indeed.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-12-06,"—I just want to respond to a couple of points that Senator Kemp made. I have just checked very briefly, and the excise on diesel is not a Labor tax; it was introduced, I am advised, back in the 1920s by a conservative government. It is nice to see the advisers acknowledging that. It was not a Labor tax. We have had this diesel excise—
—You kept on putting it up. That is the advice I have.
—I seem to recall when you were in government you bunged it up. It has been indexed. I am informed it has been indexed and it is still being indexed under your policy despite what we are considering here. You really were stretching it a bit there, Senator Kemp, but at least you have livened the debate up a bit by your outrageously provocative statements. We are not on public broadcast but I think that the three members of the public listening to this debate in the public gallery should be well aware that what you said was not true. It was just not true. It was introduced by a conservative government. The point should be made that the diesel excise will continue to be indexed. That is correct, isn't it? It will continue to go up. So your allegation was just false.
Returning to the issue of Queensland, I think you missed the point, Minister. When you talk about rural and regional Australia, there will probably be, I suspect, some urban conurbations outside Brisbane-Gold Coast. Apparently the Gold Coast will be part of the urban conurbation. Will there be any urban conurbations outside the Brisbane-Gold Coast area in Queensland—for example, in the Townsville area or the Cairns area? Are they going to be classified as urban conurbations?",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-06,"—Conurbations in Queensland—your advisers can confirm this; they would not have asked the question—are in the act. I am surprised that, having closely 
 read the act, as you certainly have, you asked that question.
—What is the boundary?
—That is not what you asked me. You are attempting to slip-slide away. You are a slippery customer, Senator Sherry.
—Order, Minister! That is not parliamentary dialogue.
—Thank you. Of course, I withdraw that; I was just provoked, as you know.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-12-06,"—I think it is important to note that Senator Kemp did not respond to the earlier point I made in my last contribution about who introduced the diesel excise and the fact that diesel excise is still going to be indexed, still going to go up. This is part of a GST deal. I do not know what Senator Harris's attitude is to the GST, but he has expressed a degree of ambivalence about this package that we are considering here in debate. The price of this change to diesel fuel in rural and regional Australia is a GST. It is a whacking big new tax.
—Senator, try to keep a straight face.
—Well, we—
—Order! Senator Sherry, please ignore the unruly interjections.
—Thank you, Chair. We do occasionally smile in this place, Senator Kemp, as you well know. It is not all serious, humdrum, deadly boring debate. We do sometimes, somehow manage to maintain a sense of humour in this place, and I think that is a good thing.
I will go back to the indexation of the excise. We are going to have a goods and services tax starting from 1 July next year. Inflation will be higher—we differ about what the impact of that will be—and we will therefore have more excise collected. Could you, Minister, tell me, on the basis of the government's inflation projections for next year, how much additional fuel excise will be 
 collected as a result of the increase in inflation next year? It is indexed to inflation, as I understand it. We would like to know that.
The next issue that I wanted some response to was this. Senator Greig, as I understand it, on behalf of the Democrats, has not made much of a contribution. He may have made a contribution when I was not in the chamber, so I will not accuse him of not making any contribution or responding in any way. He may have made a contribution during Senator Conroy's carriage of this legislation earlier today or last week. I do find it strange that, if a vehicle travels in the urban conurbation—let us use Sydney as an example, whatever the borders of Sydney are—and if it travels just one inch—I suppose we should use metric; I am still with imperial measurements unfortunately—
—I didn't think you were as old as that.
—Yes, I am as old as that, Minister, and I feel it too, particularly with this GST package that we have been considering for the last year. Let us assume they travel one centimetre over the boundary, however it is defined. My understanding is that for the whole journey—whether it is 600 or 1,000 kilometres—they receive the rebate and are effectively paying a lower fuel excise. Is that correct?",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-06,"—The destination has got to be outside the conurbation. I cannot add any more. We had this debate a bit earlier when Senator Conroy was here, and I said that if there was a starting point outside the conurbation and an end point inside the conurbation, or vice versa, the general rule applies. I cannot add much more to it than that.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-12-06,"—My purpose in raising it was not so much to get a response from you but to get one from the Australian Democrats, who have been very silent. You have confirmed, Minister, that if you drive a couple of hundred kilometres within the urban conurbation, however it is defined, then effectively you are an urban conurbation driver—sounds a bit like an urban cowboy, doesn't it?—but if you 
 step just a fraction outside the boundary for a fraction of a kilometre then you get the whole journey—hundreds of kilometres—tax free. That does seem to me to be opening up a real potential for a loophole. I do not see that that is a reasonable way of spending public moneys.
I can understand why you might do that for simplicity's sake—administering the proportion of kilometres a person travels one side of a boundary or the other would be difficult—but in terms of equity and value for the taxpayer, et cetera, it does seem to be an extraordinary situation. I would like some response from the Democrats on this point. Certainly, while I have been in the chamber they have sat silent throughout this debate. Senator Greig, to be fair to him, was not in the Senate when this package was negotiated, so we do not say that he was involved in the conversations and negotiations—I assume he was not—but he is here now and he has to represent the Australian Democrats. He has to front up and provide an explanation for the way in which the formula is going to apply. I would appreciate some confirmation. I would like to know from the Australian Democrats whether this is what was negotiated with the government and, if that is a correct interpretation, why the Australian Democrats took that particular approach.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-06,"—If Senator Greig would like to make a contribution, that is absolutely welcome, but I will briefly make a couple of observations on Senator Sherry's remarks. This new provision that is being inserted will enable the commissioner to make a determination as to what will or will not constitute a journey for the purposes of the DAFGSA. The commissioner himself will make a determination on what constitutes a journey, and that will be a tax ruling. The commissioner will obviously be interested in making sure they are genuine journeys. I would not have thought there would be any argument about that. Given your desire earlier in this debate to protect revenue, I am sure that you would support that. That is the observation I would make on your remarks.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-12-06,"—Senator Harris has raised an important issue.
—Can't your advisers give you something better to bounce off?
—Our advisers have been doing a fantastic job on this GST legislation over the last year.
—They normally do. I have the greatest admiration for them.
—Thank you; that is on the record. Firstly, you will not tell us the boundaries of the urban conurbations, but you must have some idea of the number of points of crossover at the borders. You must have some idea of the number of public roads throughout Australia—and I will come to that issue of public roads a little later—at which there is a point of crossover at the boundaries. We can surmise that, on this new map of Australia that is going to be produced, there will be thousands of kilometres of new boundaries drawn around our urban conurbations. You must know approximately where they are going to be because you have made calculations about the cost of this to revenue. How many crossover points will there be: 100, 200, 250? You must have some idea of that, so I would like to know.
To return to the issue that Senator Harris raised about stopping trucks—
—Big trucks or small?
—Both. Frankly, I would not get in front of a one-tonne truck, let alone a 20-tonne truck. I think the result would be the same—you would be squashed. I would not like to get in front of any sort of truck. How are you going to stop the trucks? Presumably there will be some sort of pullover pit with an inspector who will somehow indicate, as you do at the moment when you are checking the weight of vehicles to see whether they are overweight, to the truckies asking them to pull over. Is the Commonwealth going to pay for the pullover stop positions on the borders that are being established? How do you physically stop the truck? What will be the incidence of stoppage checking? Will this happen at a border point daily, weekly or monthly? Can you give us some indication of the level of inspection, the level of inconvenience to truckies in trucking operations in this country?
Senator Campbell made a point earlier, in your absence, Minister, asking whether the Labor Party is in support of the anti-avoidance proposals. The Labor Party is, but the problem that the Liberal-National Party government have got is that you are the ones who came up with this proposal with the Democrats. You are the ones who are drawing new maps around the outer edges of so-called urban conurbations, which by their very nature mean that there will be a greater level of inspection, a greater level of cost and a greater level of inconvenience for truck drivers in this country. I would appreciate a response on those issues.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-06,"—I have seen time being filled in before. Sometimes it is done well and sometimes it is done in a fairly ordinary fashion. I think the Hansard  will show that we are just about back to the level of the dipstick here. How many crossover points are there? You will just have to wait until we release the boundaries of the conurbations.
How will we stop the truck? What will the level of inspections be? We, as the government, are always very careful in our risk assessments to make sure that we minimise 
 any costs of compliance. The general matters of compliance are being carefully looked at by the tax office to ensure that there is minimal disruption. We are a government that supports industry. We support entrepreneurs and we support the ability of people to go out and make a dollar. That is why sometimes, unlike you, we are not altogether rapt with the activities of unions. Rather than creating jobs, some of their policies seek to destroy jobs.
At the end of the day the Labor Party is the political arm of the trade union movement, and I think truckies know that as well as anybody. We are actually a party which believes in enterprise, which seeks to encourage enterprise, and particularly seeks to assist rural and regional Australia, and this is why we are very pleased with this policy. It is true that we had to negotiate with the Democrats and the Democrats had particular priorities, but the policy that has been developed following these negotiations is a very sound policy which will deliver significant benefits to rural and regional Australia. There are some compliance issues, that is true, but this government always seeks to minimise the costs of compliance while at the same time ensuring that people cannot rort the system. I am not sure that I can add anything further. I hope that will give you the assurance that you were so eagerly seeking.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-12-06,"—It did not, because you could not tell me how many crossover points there will be on the boundary. I would have thought you could give a reasonable figure, at least some sort of indication of the number of crossover points. Regardless of where the boundaries are drawn, there would be a ballpark figure for the number of crossover points.
Minister, I seek an undertaking to the chamber on agricultural production areas within the boundaries of urban conurbations. It is an important issue, because this proposal does not seem fair to a winery, for example, if it is within urban conurbations. I think that would occur in some areas. Let us take market gardens, horticultural production areas. Will you give an undertaking to the chamber that there will not be any of those types of production areas within an urban conurbation? 
 Let us compare operating a truck from a market garden within the urban conurbation and taking your produce to the central market with a market garden or winery that is outside the boundary of the urban conurbation. It may be just outside; it may be the next-door neighbour. The boundaries have got to go somewhere and they could go between two properties, so one would be inside the urban conurbation and the other outside. So you would have different transport costs in taking the produce to the central market.
—The Hawkesbury.
—That is not a bad example. Perhaps you are not taking the produce to the central market. Let us say you are taking it to a regional airport that is not in an urban conurbation. You have got to truck it to the regional airport. You have to draw the boundary somewhere, and you could have the transportation of goods from an agricultural area within the urban conurbation. That is unless you can assure us that there will not be agricultural production within the urban conurbation. You are the one who is drawing the boundaries. It would be useful to know that.
—Senator, you will just have to wait till the boundaries are announced.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-12-06,"—I have an easy question after all that. Will the woodchip trucks going into Newcastle to the woodchip export facility there be treated the same as those going through Launceston to Georgetown?

"Harris, Sen Len",IND,1999-12-06,"—I come back to Senator Kemp's answer earlier on in relation to the reasons for taking fuel samples. Could the minister oblige the committee by defining the difference between eligible and ineligible fuel?
—Senator, it is in the act and I will give you the exact reference.
—Also for the committee, could the minister advise it how the bill protects a driver purchasing fuel so that he can be assured that in actuality he is purchas 
 ing eligible fuel? If the purpose of taking a sample is to determine whether the vehicle is being operated on eligible fuel, what provision is there to assure a driver when he is purchasing fuel—and I am assuming only that there has to be a scientific test of the fuel—that he is in actuality purchasing eligible fuel? How will an owner-driver or the driver of a company vehicle be assured that he is purchasing eligible fuel?",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-06,"—The section of the bill that I suggest you may like to look at is that on definitions. Broadly, the definition is diesel or a number of alternative fuels which are listed as being eligible—compressed natural gas or liquefied petroleum gas, recycled waste oil, ethanol or canola oil—and there is a catch-all: other fuel as is specified by the regulations. If it is leaded or unleaded, it is not eligible. I think that is pretty clear.
I think that drivers will not have a difficulty. These issues are not complex and there is a great deal of incentive for drivers to comply with the act. If they comply with the act then they can obtain the grant. To me, that provides a lot of incentive. As for deciding what fuel it is, I have provided a list to the chamber and that list will be well known in the industry. I do not see the difficulty there at all.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-12-06,"—We have established that the woodchip truck coming into Newcastle will get the advantages in the government's legislation. Can the minister say what happens to the truck that is going around the metropolitan area conurbation collecting recycled paper?
—If it is over 20 tonnes, it obtains it.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-12-06,"—I want to go back to the issue of agricultural production to make a point to the minister—and I hope he will take this on board—as I understand he will be the minister responsible for the regulations. Minister, when you are looking at these maps, remember that we do not want to see wineries inside urban conurbations and other wineries next door outside the conurbations, or horticultural production inside boundaries and horticultural 
 production next door outside. That would be very unfair to some sectors of the same industry and that would not be competitive neutrality.
Frankly, I was quite happy about the issue of competitive neutrality—from a Tasmanian point of view—until Senator Brown raised a valid point with the issue of woodchips. The whole state of Tasmania is a non-urban conurbation and, of course, in the transport of woodchips to whatever the port is in Tasmania versus the example he gave of the woodchips being transported to the port of Newcastle, there is obviously a cost differential in Tasmania's favour. As I say, I do not have a problem with that. Senator Brown knows my position and I know his.
—You had said there would not be any difference—Newcastle versus Tasmania.
—What if they take the chips to a depot on the edge of the urban conurbation and then they transport them to port? I do not think that would be such an unusual circumstance with the depot within the urban conurbation. So there would be a disadvantage.
Senator Kemp, on the issue of competitive neutrality I noticed you were reluctant—you just said to wait and see, to wait until we get these maps. We know you are the minister who is going to be personally responsible for crafting these maps across Australia's boundaries and you will actually be in an interesting position. You will be the first minister that I can recall that is going to be drawing lines across maps that will have critical economic importance.
—They have to come to the Senate.
—Yes, we will see them in the Senate. Good. Are they disallowable? That is an interesting point.
—Yes.
—You might allow disallowable, good.
—It's going to put you in an interesting position.
—From a Tasmanian perspective, I am quite relaxed about it. On the issue of competitive neutrality, businesses within the same industry competing against each other where the boundary cuts one side off from the other is a bit like the Berlin Wall. There was the absurd situation of the Berlin Wall running down the middle of Berlin, and all sorts of difficult restrictions and absurdities arose. It is the only example I can think of. I know this is not as extreme as the Berlin Wall—I would not want to make any inference that it is—but if you put boundaries across the nation, as you are proposing, to administer a diesel fuel excise, certain problems are going to emerge.
Again, I would invite Senator Greig to participate, and I notice he has not responded to my invitations to date. Minister, have any other countries adopted this type of approach in the payment of a rebate—that is, actually sat down and drawn on the map non-political boundaries? I can understand using existing political boundaries—they are well known, they are well defined and there is a degree of regulation between, say, states in the United States—but here we are not proposing to use the boundaries of states. We might in a couple of instances use the boundaries, but you, Minister, are going to be a cartographer—Cartographer Kemp. That is an interesting new title for you.
—You're struggling, Nick!
—You are going to draw these maps, and they are critical to the enforcement of this rebate, which involves $200 million a year. That reminds me, Minister, of the earlier question I asked—which you did not respond to—on the approximately five per cent increase from one year to the next. I ask you to respond to the question of the reason for the five per cent increase as well as the issues that I have raised in my comments.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-06,"—That contribution travelled far and wide. As a filler, I would rate it as about a three, to be quite frank. I do not think I could rate it any higher, in fairness. I have indicated that the boundaries of the conurbations will be released at an appropriate time. I do not think I can add anything 
 to that. Whether Senator Greig wishes to respond or not is entirely a matter for Senator Greig. If I were Senator Greig, I am not sure that I would be provoked by you, Senator Sherry. I do not have any capacity to instruct any other senator, including those on my own side. Senators will do what they want to do. I see Senator Bob Brown is poised to jump, so undoubtedly he will take up a bit more time.
In relation to the overall price effect of the ANTS package, the Treasurer has announced some figures, which we dealt with in question time. If you want any more information on that, I would be happy to put that to the Treasurer to see whether he can give you any further information to satisfy your insatiable appetite.
You raise the issue of international comparisons; I do not have any comparative data to give you. It is important in Australia that we cut the effective cost of taxes wherever we can, particularly because we are such a large country. This government is particularly conscious of the additional costs which may have to be borne by regional and rural Australia. This package, as Senator Brown might well know, is a package which we believe will ensure that we have a more competitive tax system and a better functioning economy. If you have a better functioning economy, you are more likely to be able to create those jobs which are so important.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-12-06,"—The tax package is a gift to the big end of town. When it comes to battlers in the bush, they are not going to get nearly the amount of money out of this that the big corporations—in particular, the mining and transport corporations—will get. My question to the minister follows my earlier questions about Newcastle. My question to the minister is: will a woodchip truck coming through the streets of Newcastle be treated, as far as the rebate is concerned, in the same way as a 10-tonne truck that is gathering recycled paper?",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-06,"—We are talking about a grant scheme. You keep on saying `rebate'. That is where you got yourself into difficulty earlier on. We are talking about grants, and 
 that is why you got into the constitutional difficulty that so gripped the chamber about half an hour ago. The rules are clear. I do not know whether I can explain them any more clearly to you.

The second part of my question is that the woodchip does get the grant—and let us call it a grant because this minister could not explain the difference between that and a rebate earlier in the debate, so we will go along with his terminology—but what about the 10-tonne truck that is gathering paper for recycling?",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-12-06,"—The question I put is not for a truck making the same journey; it is for a truck that is gathering paper within the conurbation of Newcastle with a view to delivering that to the recycling facility.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-06,"—Neither would a woodchip truck if the sole journey were within the conurbation. We are not distinguishing between trucks that carry woodchips and trucks that carry wastepaper. The issue for the 4.5-tonne to 20-tonne trucks is the journey, and whether the journey starts outside the conurbation and finishes inside the conurbation or vice versa. You are actually opposed to any effective cuts in excise, as I understand it. You may well be happy with the current arrangements, but there is a group of us within this parliament that actually thinks it is a good thing to see what we can do to assist people.
I am sure all the truckies will be pleased to know that you think they are all from the big end of town, but you are quite wrong. I do not know whether or not you have met a 
 truckie; I am not sure how many truckies would want to meet you. The truth of the matter is that a lot of these people are business operators; they are running a small business and they are out there to make a quid. For you to suggest that this grant goes to the big end of town actually misses the point, as you so often do in these debates.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-12-06,"—The question I put to the minister, and I will persist, is: is a woodchip truck bringing its load of woodchips from out of town through the streets of Newcastle to the port for export to the paper mills overseas, and which gets the grant—we have established that from the minister—being treated in the same way as the truck I have described gathering up paper for recycling to go into the paper making process within the city of Newcastle? Or, isn't it true that the woodchip truck is going to get the grant but that the truck gathering up paper for recycling and working within the urban area is not going to get the grant? You are treating them differently; isn't that the case?",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-06,"—I guess we can repeat ourselves; there is no law against it. A woodchip truck or a truck carrying wastepaper for recycling that starts outside the conurbation—
—You are caught!
—Yes, but you are persistently asking a loaded question so I am actually giving you a full answer. So a woodchip truck or a truck carrying wastepaper which commences its journey, say, outside the conurbation is treated in exactly the same way. A woodchip truck—and this is for the 4.5-tonne to 20-tonne trucks—whose journey is solely within the conurbation is treated the same way as a wastepaper truck. You are trying to make a distinction and trying to make a point by ignoring the facts and realities.
This does not discriminate. What we are trying to do is provide a significant benefit to rural and regional Australia, to the battlers out there. This will deliver significant benefits to the battlers. Don't you dare hide behind the fact that this is the big corporations. That may make it slightly easier for your conscience, Senator, but you would be missing the point. 
 These arrangements under the ANTS package will be of benefit to battlers in regional and rural Australia, including those battlers who are driving trucks on these long journeys. So do not try to calm your conscience by trying to wipe this by saying that this all goes to the big end of town, because you would be wrong. It is about time that you showed a bit of consideration, Senator Brown, for the battlers in this country instead of always trying to deny them jobs. This is one of the ways we will be assisting rural and regional Australia, and I suspect it will be without help or thanks from you.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-12-06,"—The minister has, of course, been caught out. What I am putting to him is a real set of circumstances. The woodchip truck does come out of the forests, it does go into the city, it does export its woodchips to Japan and it does get subsidised by the government under this scheme. But the recycling truck that I described does start its journey in the city, it does go around the city streets collecting paper for recycling and it does go to the recycling facility—and does the environment a great turn by doing that—but it gets no subsidy. It is discriminated against yet again under this Democrats-government package.
 On the issue of the battlers, the point is that this is a $3-billion rebate scheme we are talking about and $2 billion of that is going to the mining corporations, according to government ministers, the minister's own colleagues. A huge slice of the rest will go to transport corporations. In the relative order of things it is small but in terms of forests, and we will be getting on to that shortly, it is the woodchip corporations that will get the big advantage out of this.
The last time I spoke to a group of truckies, at close quarters, they were in my office because this minister's party in Tasmania had stood by while they were sacked by one of these woodchip corporations. I gave them advice about how to try to fight for justice in that unjust situation. Then I read in the paper just a couple of weeks ago that a whole bunch more truckies had been sacked by woodchip corporations, under the regional forest agreement which the Prime Minister signed with 
 the promise that there would not be any jobs lost. So much for the cant coming from this minister and the government about the battler.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-06,"—The rebate scheme is in place now, Senator. We are talking about a grants scheme. You seem to have difficulty getting your mind around that. This is a new scheme; this bill is about the grants scheme and it provides grants for eligible recipients, and we have set out the criteria.
You stand up in this chamber and talk about people who drive woodchip trucks coming to see you—when you basically want to close down the whole industry. That is what you want to do. The truth of the matter is that you want to put them all out of work. Your policy is to put out of work all these people who drive woodchips. That is your policy.
Senator Brown interjecting—
—That is what you are on about. You pretend that you can speak frankly with these people when you want to put them all out of work. That is what you want to do.
—Minister, please address your remarks through the chair.
—Thank you. I have been seriously provoked. Senator Brown stands up here and says he is very upset because people who drive woodchips have been put out of work, but you would have to say that the sole intention of Senator Brown's forest policy over the last decade has been to put every driver who drives woodchips out of work.
—It is going to be a long night.
—That is exactly your policy. I hope you made it clear to the truck drivers what your real intention was. I hope that you were honest and frank about your own policy and that you were prepared to stand behind your own policy—maybe you were not. Maybe you evinced concern. I think any decent person would evince concern about people who have lost their jobs. But it beggars belief that someone like you—whose guiding principle in this parliament has been to stop woodchip exports, to stop the produc 
 tion of woodchips, and to put all these drivers out of work—is able to stand up and say that. Can I make the point: we are talking about a grants scheme; we are not talking about the rebate scheme, which is already there, Senator.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech

Will they be marked on a radius basis or on a lineal kilometre basis from the GPO?,SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-06,"—I am not trying to be difficult, but in essence the answer is the same as the one I have given to Senator Sherry, and it is the same answer that I have given Senator Conroy. If Senator Brown wants to ask me, I will give him the same answer. We are currently working on the boundaries of the conurbations and, when those boundaries are completed and we are happy with them, they will be released. I hope this will be in a comparatively short period of time. I do not wish to go further than that, but we recognise it is an important issue. We recognise you have a valid interest in this; we do not doubt that. Senator Sherry may have given the impression that once there is a signing off with the stroke of a pen by the Treasurer or the Assistant Treasurer that is it. Of course, these matters come before the chamber as a regulation.
—I totally object to that.
—It will be difficult for the Labor Party because it will have to decide on a policy position, and that is not easy for the Labor Party. I understand that.
Senator Coonan interjecting—
—If you have not had a policy position in years, it becomes very difficult to work out where your policy is and to recognise, as Senator Coonan said, a policy position. We understand the dilemma that Senator Sherry has on all these debates. We have to live with that as Senator Sherry has to live with it. I recognise your interest, Senator Harris, and if you want to have a briefing once we have released these boundary lines, I would be very happy to arrange that for you. I recognise the genuine interest 
 that you have in this issue. We might not agree all the time, but I recognise your genuine interest. I regret to say I cannot pay the same compliment to Senator Brown, who basically wants to close down much of Australian industry—and I do not agree with that.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-12-06,"—Could the minister say how many jobs have been gained or lost since the regional forest agreement was signed in Tasmania at the start of 1998?
—Mr Temporary Chairman, I raise a point of order. Is the issue that Senator Brown is raising relevant to the bill that we are discussing?
—On the point of order, I think Senator Harris has made an excellent point. It is nothing to do with the bill.
—I will uphold the point of order. The issue that is being raised by Senator Brown is not relevant to the matter before the chair.
—The chair errs in that because we have just had a diatribe from the minister on the matter and I do not intend to be subjected to unequal treatment. But that is not unusual. For Senator Harris's interest, the standing order and the practice of it is to allow the development of an argument before a chair makes such a guillotine of a ruling. I would suggest that he not rely on that ruling for the future of proper debate in this place. Having said that, I would ask the minister if he can inform the chamber what the grant to the forest industry is going to be under this legislation.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-06,"—The grant to the forest industry will be the same as for any other eligible journey, provided they drive on a public road. We have not distinguished between the forest industry—which is an important industry—and others. You want to close down the forest industry and toss those Australians out of work. We do not agree with you on it. But I do not want to stray onto your wider policy.
—The Temporary Chairman will let you do almost anything.
—Seeing as the question was asked in such a polite manner, it would be churlish of me not to respond in a polite manner. Senator, an eligible journey will be entitled to the grant whether it is related to the forest industry or some other industry.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-12-06,"—There are a couple of issues I want to raise. I think we have had a fair debate on this issue so far. I can anticipate—the Labor Party being a positive opposition—
—Ha, ha!
—We can be negative if you want us to be, but at the moment we are attempting to be positive. We would certainly like to see this come to a vote very shortly after the dinner break. There are a couple of points that I want to raise, Senator Kemp, and you might give them some deep thought over your dinner this evening.
—Over my fish and chips.
—If it is fish and chips it is fish and chips. I will just go back to the question that Senator Harris asked about the boundaries. You cannot have estimates, as the government has given, without knowing the boundaries or at least having some fair idea of what the boundaries are, and the minister will not tell us or show us what the boundaries are. Senator Kemp is being very evasive about what these boundaries are going to be. He must have a good idea what they are, to be able to come up with these financial estimates.
I make the point to Senator Harris—as he may not be aware—that we do have the power to disallow the regulations, but it is an all or nothing scenario. We either have to vote them down in total or allow them to pass in total. If the boundaries were included within the legislation, we could amend as it suited us. But we do not have that option under the regulation route. We will look with interest at the boundaries of these so-called urban conurbations.
I want to make a comment about battlers. What concerns me about the Liberal-National approach is that we know that there are 
 battlers in the trucking industry, but they are not just in rural and regional Australia. I have met and talked to drivers who operate in urban conurbations—in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, the Gold Coast, wherever these boundaries are going to be. I have met couriers and drivers in the trucking industry who operate just in those areas, and they are battlers too, Senator Kemp. So we are going to have the battlers in the bush and rural and regional Australia who are advantaged over the battlers in urban conurbations. That is not treating people in the same business equitably. It is unfair. Senator Kemp, what you are saying is that you care about battlers in rural and regional Australia but you do not care about battlers in the outer suburbs of Australia's large cities, and there are a lot of battlers there.
From reading the press this week and last week, I think a number of your backbenchers from those outer urban areas and those so-called conurbations are getting a little bit nervous about the approach of this government on policy areas. This is a prime example of battlers in one area being assisted—and there is no argument about that—when, in the same industry, people on low incomes, working extraordinary hours, in urban areas are not going to be advantaged. They are in the same industry. In some cases, they will be competing against each other. It is a very competitive industry, as I think anyone who has participated in or listened to this debate knows.
We are just about to come to a close, but there is another point that I want to raise, Senator Kemp: the issue of private roads versus public roads. I understand the legislation applies only to public roads. I would think that there are a lot of journeys in this country where at least part of the journey is on a private road—across a property—and that may form a considerable part of the journey. Again, it depends on how these boundaries are drawn. I do not see a valid reason why the distances travelled on private roads should not be allowed. The minister may be able to give me an answer to that. It just seems to me to be a bit unfair if you have some distance to drive on a private road, and 
 I am sure we do have those circumstances existing in this country.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-06,"—We are aware of this issue. This was an issue that was raised by a number of senators. The government is looking at it.

"Harris, Sen Len",IND,1999-12-06,"—In relation to the minister's answer on whether the roads will be marked on a radius basis or a lineal kilometre basis, my reason for raising the issue was just for clarification. Because the formula is based on eligible and ineligible kilometres, drivers need to clearly understand where they are in relation to the boundaries so that they can log their eligible or ineligible kilometres—pre-empting that this legislation will be passed.

The point I would make, Senator, is that we are very keen to make sure that compliance is as straightforward as possible. We are not after creating unnecessary complexity. One of the reasons why this is taking time is that we want to make sure the compliance arrangements are straightforward. As I said, you will have to wait until we make the announcement on the boundary issue, but I can assure you that the aim of this is to simplify, not to add complexity.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-12-06,"—So far as the Labor opposition is concerned, I will just make some concluding remarks with a question or two, which I hope the minister will be able to address. What concerns us about urban conurbations versus 
 non-urban conurbations is that it requires new boundaries to be drawn. Inevitably, when new boundaries are drawn, there will be anomalies. There will have to be enforcement at those boundary points for obvious reasons. That will have to mean additional regulation, additional bureaucracy and additional cost for the trucking industry in this country. We had some discussion about battlers. We have battlers in rural and regional Australia in the trucking industry; equally, we have battlers in urban areas of Australia in the so-called urban conurbations.
The maps showing the boundaries have not been presented to the Senate. We are asked to trust this government and we have to wait to see the boundaries and the particular problems that those boundaries will throw up. There will certainly be some problems. For example, I have touched on agricultural industries which happen to fall one side or other of the boundary.
It is very disappointing that we have had almost no contribution from the Australian Democrats spokesperson, Senator Greig. As I said, we do not blame him for negotiating this. He was not involved in the process, as I understand. He has to defend it as a representative of the Democrats, the party that did the appalling deal with the Liberal-National Party on the goods and services tax, but he has not even done that. He has not defended it at all or attempted to explain it. Urban conurbation versus rural and regional was the Democrats' idea, as we understand it. He has not attempted to explain in any detail what was meant by this approach. Those aspects have been disappointing to us.
We have not had satisfactory explanations about the costings and the basis for those costings. We will be supporting this bill. We do not accept the government's assurances that prices in the bush are going to go down and that the price of goods and services will drop. We have had recent examples of the Prime Minister backing away from his assurances with respect to motor vehicles, for example. We were told in the lead-up to the last election that motor vehicle prices would go down by an average of $3,000, and the Prime Minister is backing away from that 
 rapidly. There is a range of other areas with respect to the goods and services tax. This week the Senate will be expected to pass a total of over 1,000 amendments to the goods and services tax package. Presumably there are at least 1,000 errors that need to be rectified. Very shortly, we will be passing on to the next piece of legislation, which the government has described as a mistake. We will make some comments on that legislation when we get to it.
The range of explanations and responses from the minister—and when he has not been here, his representative, the parliamentary secretary, Senator Ian Campbell—has not been particularly satisfactory. I think we raised quite legitimate questions on behalf of the trucking industry in this country, which will have to put up with the enforcement procedures, increased bureaucracy and some of the uncertainties that will arise as a result of the boundaries and the additional cost that will flow through.
There are two matters that the government may be considering. Firstly, I understand at some time in the past there has been discussion about colour-coding the diesel to try to use that as a basis for some sort of enforcement system. I would be interested to know whether or not you are discussing that in this context. Secondly, is it the government's intention to consider satellite tracking of trucks? That might sound a little absurd to some people, but I know in the fishing industry satellite tracking technology is used with respect to the location of fishing vessels.
I will conclude my remarks there and hope that we get some reasonably satisfactory answers to the new questions I have raised. That concludes the Labor Party's remarks on this legislation.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech

The purpose of the amendments is to remove the inherent subsidy from the logging of native forests. Before I get on to the terminology of the legislation itself, I ask the minister whether he would look at the Prime Minister's letter to Senator Meg Lees of 28 May this year, which consummated the agreement on the GST and, therefore, the diesel fuel rebate grant package, as he might like to label this piece. At page 7, under the heading `Off-road diesel and light fuels', it states—and these are the Prime Minister's words—`The extension to the off-road concession for diesel and like fuels will be not for forestry'. I have shortened that sentence. Is that the minister's understanding of the agreement?

Senator Brown keeps claiming that the woodchippers will be advantaged by this bill. What he fails to notice is that the Democrats woodchipping clause denies an extra 8c a litre to forestry operations.
So she is right. What she said is consistent with what the Prime Minister had to say. Is that the case?",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-06,"—I am speaking on behalf of the government. What is referred to here is the extension to the off-road concession for diesel and like fuels to be limited, 
 providing full credits for marine use, bush nursing hospitals, nursing homes, aged persons homes and private residences, but not for construction, power generation, manufacturing or forestry. It is not extending it. We are not extending the benefit. We are maintaining the benefit. The operative word, as I understand it, is the word `extension'. There was no intention to remove a benefit.
—Why don't you read the background to the bill and the report then?
—Senator Murphy, you probably had a good dinner. Good on you. You are a world champion in fly-fishing.
—If you want to be personal about it, be personal. But it would be more pertinent to the chamber if you addressed the questions you were asked.
—You should not be calling out when you are seated. You should not be creating a scene in the chamber. Quite rightly, I have drawn the Chair's attention to this unruly behaviour by Senator Murphy.
—I am trying not to make a judgment about this, Minister, but I suggest that the way you spoke across the chamber to the senator was close to unparliamentary. Would you like to return to the matter under discussion.
—Thank you, Madam Temporary Chairman, for your advice. Were you worried that your colleague called out across the chamber while I was providing an answer?
—As we know—
—Just for the record, I want to see whether you were or not. The silence is golden.
—Minister, I think it is not a good idea to ascribe motive to anybody, particularly not the Chair. I was about to speak when you interrupted me. All shouting across the chamber is unparliamentary. Would you care to attend to the matter under discussion, Minister. 
—Thank you. I take it that that was an oblique pat on the wrist for Senator Murphy. It was very oblique. We are talking here about an extension. The operative word, as I understand it, is `extension'. It is not `removal'. It is adding to a benefit, not removing any benefit. That is the context in which it is read.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-06,"—An inadvertent consequence of the passage of the overall package of amendments to the modified ANTS diesel fuel rebate scheme is that forestry and timber processing would have been required to pay approximately 8c per litre more for the off-road use of fuel than other agricultural industries. The intention of the government was always that these industries would receive the same rebate amount. This is perfectly consistent. The amendment contained in this bill ensures that this commitment is kept. This is not an extension. This is preserving a benefit which existed. This is entirely consistent.

"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-06,"—There is no extension of the benefit to forestry. You need to understand that. Perhaps it is my failure to explain this clearly to you. We are not seeking to add a new benefit to forestry. My understanding—my advisers also tell me this—is that we are trying to avoid an inadvertent effect of the bill where a particular benefit was removed from forestry. We are not extending a benefit 
 to forestry. As I have said, the intention of the government was always that these industries would receive the same rebate amount. The amendment contained in this bill ensures that this commitment is kept. Frankly, I do not see an inconsistency. There was a benefit to the timber industry.

—Thank you, Madam Temporary Chairman. I wanted to check that we were all in order. As I said, the Democrats will speak for themselves. I do not speak for the Democrats.
—They won't speak.
—Silence is golden.
—Here we go again.
—What are you sitting down for?
—I am waiting for the Chair to bring some order to the parliament.
—You have the call, Minister.
—You are certainly imposing authority on the chamber, Madam Temporary Chairman! Perhaps I will go through this again.
An inadvertent consequence of the passage of the overall package of amendments for the modified ANTS Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme is that the forestry and timber processing industries would have been required to pay approximately 8c per litre more for off-road use of fuel than other agricultural industries. That would have been the effect. In other words, a benefit which had existed for the forest industries was inadvertently removed.
Senator Murphy interjecting—
—Madam Temporary Chair, it is a bit hard to continue while there is relentless harassment from Senator Murphy. I do not know whether I can encourage you to take any action against your colleague, but I just make that point.
—I encourage you to be brave, Minister.
—You are certainly exercising authority from the chair in a way we have not seen for a while! They would have been required to pay approximately 8c per litre more. It seems to me everyone else is nodding in agreement. My advisers are nodding in agreement. Senator Sherry's advisers are nodding in agreement. It must surely be right 
 if Senator Sherry's advisers are nodding in agreement.
Senator Murphy interjecting—
—Dear, oh, dear! Thank you again, Madam Temporary Chair, for that exercise in authority! We are restoring the status quo as it then was. We are not extending a benefit. We are restoring the status quo as it existed and which the original bill inadvertently removed. We are not extending the scheme. We are restoring the status quo as it then was, because of an inadvertent drafting error. That is what has happened.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-12-06,"—Sorry to interrupt, Senator Brown. I want to make a point about this issue, because it is very important. I take exception to Senator Kemp describing this as `inadvertent'. It clearly was not. For the public record, the minister knows that the press release by the Prime Minister on 31 May 1999, following the negotiations with the Democrats, said:
The extension to the off-road concession for diesel and like fuels will be limited to providing full credits for marine use, bush nursing homes, hospitals, nursing homes, aged persons homes and private residences, but not for construction, power generation, manufacturing or forestry. The proposed full credit for mining currently accessing the DFRS will be maintained.
End of quote. Frankly, that is end of story. That is the position the Liberal-National Party agreed. Senator Kemp, I assume you saw this document. Your government agreed to that position; that is, take out the forest industry. If we had any doubt about that, we could look at Deputy Prime Minister Anderson's comments when he commenced the second speech. It was not a press release; it was a second reading speech. He stated that the bill:
. . . implements changes to the Diesel Fuel Rebate scheme agreed with the Australian Democrats as part of the package of environmental measures that will now accompany the introduction of the new tax system on 1 July 2000.
We then had Senator Greig at the Senate Economics Legislation Committee which considered this legislation. Page E24 of the Hansard  record reads:
Senator GREIG—I have some sympathy for these guys from the ATO. They are not in a 
 position to answer that. But, as far as the Democrats are concerned, the position is not unclear.
Senator CONROY—So, is forestry in or out?
This is in reference to the diesel fuel rebate. The discussion continued:
Senator GREIG—It is out.
Senator CONROY—Doesn't this bill put it back in?
Senator GREIG—It does.
So we have a position where the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister clearly and explicitly agreed to delete the forest industries from benefits relating to the diesel fuel rebate. Senator Kemp would have the Senate chamber believe that this was inadvertent. It clearly was not inadvertent. It was a deliberate part of the package that they signed up to with the Democrats to exclude the forest industries. That is fact. It is very clear. It is on the public record. I do not think we have got a clearer record of what the facts are.
So it is totally wrong for the minister to describe the legislation we are now considering that puts the forest industries back under the diesel fuel concession as `a mistake', or `an oversight' or `inadvertent'. The minister is just misleading the chamber and he knows it. We take exception to that. We should not be in the mess we are in on the diesel fuel rebate in respect of the forest industry. This has caused a lot of uncertainty in forest industries. In my home state of Tasmania there was great concern. As I said last week, Senator Brown and I have a very different perspective on the world in respect of forest industries. But we have always known Senator Brown's position.
—So you aren't supporting it?
—We are not going to support his amendments, and I will make some comments about that at the appropriate time. We have always known Senator Brown's position, but the Democrats waxed lyrical and made triumphant claims about the environmental credentials that they had in negotiating this package. The Democrats claimed, on the one hand, that the GST was a great environmental package. It was not, but 
 they claimed that. And yet here you have a clear example of this government welshing on the agreement. Nothing could be clearer. Why are the Australian Democrats supporting the GST package? If excluding forest industries from the diesel fuel rebate was so important, so critical for the environment and part of your grand negotiations, why have you allowed the government to do this? Why have you allowed the government to go back on their word? That is what you are doing.
You can pull the rug from under them. You can say, `It was part of the GST package; put it back in or else.' But you are not doing that. I have not seen any critical public comments by you or other Democrat spokespersons on this issue. You sit down and you negotiate. I do not agree with the deal you reached with the government, but you sit down, you sign off, you negotiate in good faith. If it is not delivered, you say, `Well, you have walked away. We are not going to vote for this GST package.'
That is my understanding of negotiations. If you do not deliver on the detail, you do not have a deal. The Democrats are being played for suckers on this issue. The government knows that Labor will support, as we always have done, forest industries and making sure that the diesel fuel rebate covers forest industries. The Liberals know our position. So they know this is going to pass, Senator Greig. They are playing you for suckers. I think it is a sorry day for the Democrats. There is still legislation to consider on the GST package. You can still say to the government, `Deliver or else.' You are not prepared to do that. I think that is duplicitous. You are just going along with a breach of the deal and the agreement.
They are the points I wanted to make. I am sorry to interrupt Senator Brown. I do not agree with some of his comments about forest industries, but on the points of principle Senator Brown is quite correct about what has happened. I will make some pertinent comments on Senator Brown's amendments a little later in the debate.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-12-06,"—What we are coming to here is the fact of the matter—that advantages were given to other 
 off-road industries by the deal signed between Senator Meg Lees and the Prime Minister, John Howard, specifically excluding off-road forestry uses. Then that became known, and the government moved to turn it around to give that advantage to forestry as well, so that they would not be disadvantaged. The difference is between a rebate of 35c per litre and 43c. That is where the 8c comes from.
Basically what we are doing here is catching up and giving a rebate of 43c instead of 35c. That was not there, because the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Democrats, Senator Lees, specifically excluded it in their pact of 28 May. The Leader of the Democrats asserted that a number of times in the public debate following. In fact, on 29 June Senator Lees, attacking me, said:
In this bill we have increased the costs for forestry by 8c a litre. It is probably not something that we should point out to the National Party, but there it is, and that is what we have done in this legislation. So for him—
that is, me—
to stand up here yet again and react to anything we try to do on the environment with his incessant undermining and incessant complaining is appalling.
Who is appalling? With a whimper, the Democrats have allowed the Prime Minister to welsh on a deal that they signed up to. They are going to vote against this measure in here, knowing that Labor is supporting it and therefore there is going to be no change. That is a very base form of politics.
The fact is that the industry was quite chuffed when it got the turnaround. The National Association of Forest Industries, in its press release on 2 September, said:
The industry is grateful to Mr Tuckey for pursuing vigorously this rectification of a mistake, the benefit of which will be felt by forestry operators in regional Australia.
That is as may be, but what we have is a statement of principle by the Democrats, viewed then as a mistake by the government under industry pressure, and a total turnaround, a breach of the agreement not just by Prime Minister Howard but by Democrat leader Senator Lees herself. She has not said one word in defence of that change. Last week, at the end of the debate on this matter, 
 I asked that Senator Lees come into this committee and explain this change. She has not. Senator Allison is missing. So it is left to Senator Greig, who was not there to put his signature on the agreement with the Prime Minister.
What we have is a clear case of the Democrat leadership not having the gumption to stand by an agreement which just a few short months ago they were beating their chests about as a means of scoring political points. They know that this will not be reported. Forestry issues in the main will not be reported by the press gallery. So they know that they can stay in their rooms, ignore this major change on a matter of principle, as they put it in May and June, and get away with it. And there is nothing to be done about that except to record it.
I hear in the last 24 hours another member of the Democrats is talking about their meeting a need to change another piece of legislation to protect people who might be taxed on lamington drives. It has been obvious for years—at least two years—that that tax was going to be in place. Did the Democrats at any stage in their discussions with the Prime Minister say charities should be protected? No, they did not. But now the heat is applied, they are going to renege.
They are going to try to appear as if they have been the protectors of the public interest, just as they were doing a while ago over forestry. On that occasion the loggers moved in, Mr Tuckey moved in and the Democrats caved. On this occasion they will be quite happy to change again an agreement they made, because they are not prepared to stand with that agreement. But it is there in black and white and nothing is going to change that, I guess. It just means that there has been a change in the political landscape in this place. The members of the opposition are quite right in pointing to that as well.
It is a pretty poor sign that, on a matter as important as this, the leadership of the Democrats cannot come down and say, `We did not make a mistake, because we at the time pointed out that this was a win for us. What we have done in the meantime is quietly cave in on the environment'—and of all things on 
 the forest environment—`over which we have been marching in the streets and protesting in years gone by. We are now going to support legislation which is going to subsidise the bulldozers at work in the wild forests of Australia, and we are not going to say a word about it.' That is the difference.
The other question I put to the minister is the one on agriculture. He says that this is simply ensuring that forestry as an agricultural industry gets the same benefits as the rest of the agricultural industry. I ask the minister this: is the logging of wilderness forests, which have never been touched before by any industry, agriculture?",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-12-06,"—We are seeking to maintain the status quo. You do not happen to like us maintaining the status quo; we understand this.
—Was that your position all the time? Oh, if you are going to sit down, I will stand up and ask a question.
—I am waiting for you to shut up, actually, so I can respond in a serious manner to the issue raised by Senator Brown. I have this old-fashioned view that the chair might like to take some action against you, Senator, when you constantly stand up and make an oaf of yourself, but apparently that is not the case.
Senator Brown, we are coming from different positions on this. That is the truth. We want to have a sensible arrangement in place to protect native forests in order to ensure there is a sustainable forest industry. You are not supportive of that; you have a different viewpoint. This is a debate that can go on forever. The point I am making to you is that we are seeking to maintain the status quo; we are not seeking to give an additional advantage. Senator Sherry did not like the use of the word `inadvertent'; I am sorry, but I do not agree with Senator Sherry. He can have his view; I think he is wrong. Not surprisingly, I think I am right.
I am not attempting to mislead the chamber; I am putting the government's position to it. Senators may not agree with that, but that is the position the government takes. We believe 
 that is sustained by what has occurred. There will be no extension for forestry activities, and the original amendment reduced the amount of the rebate. This bill simply restores the rebate for forestry. You can concoct a significant conspiracy if you wish, but it has no basis in fact. This was an inadvertent error and now it is being rectified, and we hope the chamber will pass it.
I am encouraged that Senator Sherry has fixed on a policy position. That is what we want to encourage the Labor Party to do: get a few policies and get used to getting out and advocating a few policies. We never mind if the Labor Party supports our policy position. We think this is a good policy, actually.
—This was ours! You are the ones who changed your position.
—We can have a debate about that, but the point is that it is not worth repeating what I have said to you and what I understand the position to be. It is a position that you do not agree with and we will just have to differ on that. We will not be supporting the amendments you have moved. I do not know whether you will get support around the chamber, but we will not be supporting those amendments. We are not extending a benefit to the forest industry; we are restoring the status quo as it existed.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-12-06,"—The question I asked the minister, as you would have heard, Madam Temporary Chairman, was: is logging of wilderness forests agriculture? I repeat that question.
While the minister is getting advice on that, I refer him to Senator Allison's statement on 29 June. She had carriage of this matter for the Democrats, in support of the government. She said:
Senator Brown keeps claiming that the woodchippers will be advantaged by this bill. What he fails to notice is that the Democrats woodchipping clause denies an extra 8c a litre to forestry operations.
Far from this being an oversight or a mistake or inadvertent or anything of that kind, Senator Allison went on to say:
The forests are finally distinguished from agriculture. 

Quite separate. That is the understanding between the government and the Democrats. That is why the Prime Minister singled forestry out as not getting the extra 8c in the first place. That is why Senator Allison added:
Off-road use of diesel for forestry will be capped at 35c which is what they get now.
I am not going to push the minister into ducking and weaving on this, because we will not get a straight answer, but there it is on the record. There was an agreement between the Prime Minister and the Democrats. The Prime Minister acknowledged that in his statement. He changed, and now the Democrats in effect are changing too. We are not going to get an answer to the question about wilderness forest logging being agriculture because the minister cannot give a straight answer to that question.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,1999-12-06,"—Minister, I tried to ask you this question but you would not answer because you perceived it to be an interjection. I think it is an important question, and Senator Brown has been pursuing it very well and I think accurately. The Prime Minister's letter to the Leader of the Australian Democrats I think makes it fairly clear. My question, how did you get it so wrong, is relevant. You say that the government's position did not change; it was always the same. It never intended to commit to the Democrats to not allow the forest industry access to the additional 8c a litre. I think that is fairly clear in the Prime Minister's letter, as has been pointed out by Senator Brown. What is interesting in the Prime Minister's letter is that in the second-last paragraph of the letter he says:
Moreover, the offer is subject to the Democrats supporting the funding arrangements and any consequential amendments necessary to implement this package.
The package is the ANTS package. Either you and the Prime Minister are attempting to mislead us, maybe inadvertently, or the Democrats have been conned into an arrangement that they never wanted.
I say that on this basis. We have the report of the Economics Legislation Committee on the consideration of legislation referred to the committee, the  Taxation Laws Amendment 
 Bill (No. 9) 1999 , a report signed by the chairman of the Economics Legislation Committee, Senator Gibson, who is a government member. But if we go to the back of the report we find a minority report signed by the Australian Democrats which says:
After careful consideration of the evidence before the Committee on this bill, the Australian Democrats are still of the view that it should be opposed. We urge the Labor Party to oppose it also.
The Democrats know what our position was with respect to the GST. We went through this exercise where the Democrats reached an agreement with the government to pass the GST legislation lock, stock and barrel subject to a set of arrangements, one of which was the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme in respect of forestry.
Senator Brown has pointed out from the Hansard record the statements that were made by Senator Lees and Senator Allison on a number of occasions which are a total contradiction of what you, Minister, have been saying here for the last almost 50 minutes. With the greatest of respect to you, what you have said would seem to be a contradiction of what your Prime Minister has said. You have been saying, `Look, we never intended for the status quo to change,' but the proposal before us in terms of amendment bill No. 9 does change the status quo. From the Labor Party point of view we do not oppose that, but what we are very interested in, and certainly I am very interested in, is how we get your story to fit with the Democrat story; how we get your position to fit with their position.
As Senator Brown rightly points out, why isn't Senator Lees or Senator Allison—or indeed Senator Murray, who was acknowledged in the Prime Minister's letter—in here to actually discuss and debate this issue? It was part of a deal to support a whole new tax regime that would increase taxation on a whole host of people in this country. Of course, the government proceeded to write the letter, and the Prime Minister very clearly made the point that this would not apply to forestry. This was after some degree of pressure. I have to say that this is where Senator Brown and I might slightly part company. I support the view that the 8c ought 
 to be paid to the forest industry. But, you see, this is a question of integrity, credibility and honesty on the part of the government and how you treat those people that you negotiate with at the other end of the chamber. The report signed by Senator Gibson says, in the section headed `Background to the bill':
1.5. The relevant part of the Government/Australian Democrats agreement was to exclude the forest industry from receiving the full diesel rebate. This decision meant that for the first time parity was broken between the various primary production sectors. Consequently, the forest and timber industries pay 8c per litre more for off-road use of fuel than other agricultural industries.
I understand that is exactly the point everybody has been trying to make to you, Senator Kemp, but you have been trying to say, `Oh, it was inadvertent, a mistake.' I think your Prime Minister and indeed your minister for resources clearly understood the circumstances; I know the Treasurer did. You were desperadoes and to get your ANTS package up per se you signed a letter—or the Prime Minister did on your behalf and on the rest of the government's behalf—that gave a commitment to the Australian Democrats that this would not be the case.
Senator Gibson, the author of the report who was on a committee which has a government majority, has allowed this statement to be made—in the opening paragraphs of the report in a statement of background to the bill—explaining exactly what this bill would have achieved and you, Minister, have now spent 50 minutes trying to tell us, `No, no, no—not us. We never intended that.' If that is so, I do not know what led the forest industry, NAFI and the Australian forest growers to appear before the committee screaming blue murder that somehow you had dudded them, which has subsequently led to you wanting to change it all. On the basis of inadvertency? No, I do not think so, Minister. So the Democrats ought to stand up here and accuse you of misleading this chamber and the government of being dishonest in its negotiations with them, or their credibility will really stand to suffer a lot.
—It already has.
—That is probably true, but we should give these people the oppor 
 tunity to actually seek to save themselves and redeem themselves in respect of this deal that they did, because there are other aspects of the ANTS package now coming to light which the Democrats also thought that they had locked away.
—Charities.
—Charities being one of them.
—Lamington drives.
—And lamington drives—Dad's Army  will never be the same!
—Where were you for the RFA vote?
—You should go and talk to Jeff Kennett about it, although he is not the Premier any more. I have great difficulty with what the minister has been trying to do here this evening—trying to indicate that somehow this was just a bit of a slip and that the government never intended that the forest industry actually receive less from the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme, because that simply is not true.
The minister has just winked at me across the chamber and, Senator Greig, maybe you would like to see that wink again because it really is the wink of a conman, and that is exactly what the government has done to the Democrats—it has conned them into an agreement that is now falling apart. Of course, as was pointed out by Senator Sherry earlier, you could say, `Let's put the whole thing back on the table.' If your party really wanted to maintain the integrity that your founder proclaimed about keeping the bastards honest, then you ought to get on and try to redeem yourselves from the position you are in.
—He supports the package, by the way. Bad luck, Shayne, you blew that one.
—I do not know about that. Senator Greig does not support this part of the package because he signed a minority report saying that the Democrats oppose it and that we should oppose it. It was a bit late—and I do not know whether he is going to try to lay some blame on us for the circumstances they got themselves into.
—They should be consistent. Bob Brown has been consistent on this.
—That is true, Senator Sherry. Senator Bob Brown has been consistent—at least I will give him that. I do not say that he has been right but he has been consistent.
—What's the use of that?
—I won't even acknowledge that interjection from Jeff Kennett's mate from Victoria, but I do have to say through you, Madam Temporary Chairman, that I really have a great concern with Senator Kemp's attempt to try to explain this away as an inadvertency on the part of the government, because it borders on a misleading of the chamber. I think that ought to be taken very seriously, and certainly it ought to be taken very seriously by Senator Greig, as the sole representative of the Democrats in the chamber.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,1999-12-06,"—The interpretation of the Democrats of this aspect of the ANTS package has always been that the 8c rebate ought not to apply to forestry. Our position on that has not changed. That is why we are here arguing against it and that is why we are here voting against it. The reason for that has always been our abhorrence of logging and woodchipping in native forests, a position from which we have not moved in 22 years. So the question before us now is: what are we going to do with this bill? We are voting against it.
When Senator Sherry was goading me earlier, he said, a bit like Professor Sumner Miller, `Why is this so? How can this happen?' The answer, Senator, is because Labor is going to vote for it. The Democrats will not be supporting the furtherance of the subsidy of woodchipping and logging of our native forests—we find that abhorrent—but Labor will. That is the reality of the numbers in this chamber—our position has not changed. What is Labor going to do? Labor will support the continued subsidy of and an extended subsidy for the woodchippers and the loggers. We are still here defending the forests; Labor is not.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,1999-12-06,"—I will not accept that for one second. This is the outcome of the breach of an agreement by Prime Minister John Howard, and Senator Greig has just said so, in effect. That breach has occurred over the last five months since, in the glare of national publicity, Senator Lees teamed up with the Prime Minister to sign on to this agreement. Since then, this particular part of the agreement—which was spelled out on page 7—has been changed. In other words, the Prime Minister has reneged.
Have we heard one word from Senator Lees in the public arena about that? Not a whisper. She went totally to water when it came to defending the forest environment. So has Senator Allison; so have the Democrats as a whole. They had enormous leverage to stand by this agreement, but they decided not to use it, because it was more comfortable for them to keep the cosy arrangement with the coalition than it was to stand for the forest environment.
It must have been manna from heaven when they found out, as Senator Greig just said, that Labor were going to support this amendment because they are consistently sticking with the forest industry, particularly in Tasmania. It is a shameful sell-out by the Democrats on the forest environment. This is a subsidy into the fuel tank of every bulldozer at work, every skipper at work and every other piece of diesel driven machinery at work in the wild forest environment.
I am not here, as the government would have it, to end the forest industry. It needs reform; it can be reformed. It ought to be on the plantation basis, because we have enough plantations in this country to meet all our wood needs. But that is not what is at stake here. At stake here is the way the Democrats have gone about allowing the Prime Minister to renege when they had the leverage to stop it. Here was a singular opportunity for the Democrats to stand up for their environmental platform, their own platform, because they had the leverage to do so. That is why they went to the Prime Minister's table. But instead of using that leverage and insisting the Prime Minister stick to his word, they sold out. 
We have heard not a word, not a whimper, from the Democrats. Senator Lees is absent from this chamber, absent from this debate and absent from the public arena when it comes to defending her own agreement. It does not matter that that is not going to get covered. The point is that this is a measure of the strength of the Democrats' commitment, first, to the agreement with the Prime Minister, second, to the forest environment and, third, to their own policies. They fail on all three counts. That is what is happening here tonight.
They are going to fail further down the line because, once you start doing that, once you do not have the integrity to stand up for core policies which you claim to have had wins on and you not only go to water but refuse to debate them either in public or in the parliamentary chamber in which you are represented, there is no limit. That is what has happened here tonight. The challenge went out to Senator Lees; she is not here. It ought not to have had to go to her, because she ought to have spoken up in the public arena, but she did not.	She has turned her back on the forests when they needed her and when she could have made a difference. I am not the one who says that: she said so herself. She said so in this place, and so did environment spokesperson Senator Allison. They both berated me for saying that they had not stood by the forests back in June and said, `We have. We've made a difference here.' This fuel rebate is a subsidy to the machines that work in our wild forests. But they are absent tonight. They are not going to come in here, and they are not going to stand by the forests.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-12-06,"—I should indicate at this stage that we will not be supporting the amendments moved by Senator Brown. I will also briefly indicate the reasons. On the substance of the debate that has occurred to date, you could summarise each party's position as follows. Labor has always held the view that the diesel fuel rebate should apply to forest industries. Those operators who use skippers, generators, bulldozers, cranes, portable sawmillers, chippers, chainsaws and the other range of machinery and forest operations should 
 receive the diesel fuel rebate. Labor has been very consistent on that. We have never suggested that it should be taken away. By way of example, in my home state of Tasmania, where forestry represents 15 per cent of the economy, this—call it what you like—subsidy or payment represents $2 million a year to the forest industries. From a personal perspective, I agree—and the Labor Party also agree—that the diesel fuel rebate should apply. That has been Labor's position.
The Liberal Party and the Democrats agreed to take the diesel fuel rebate away from the forest industries as part of the GST deal. The government and Senator Kemp say that it was inadvertent, but it was quite deliberately negotiated. I do not know what the National Party was doing at the time. The National Party allowed the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to negotiate away the diesel fuel rebate for the forest industry in rural and regional areas.
—We like to ambush!
—The problem, Senator McGauran—through you, Mr Temporary Chairman—is that, for some months, this has caused a great deal of uncertainty and worry amongst forest industries and amongst forest workers. You are saying no, but it did. You just have to look at the committee evidence or talk to some of the forest operators who are next door to you in Collins Street in Melbourne. They will explain to you the very nasty impact this is going to have. But the National Party dropped the ball.
The Democrats did a deal to exclude forestry. They walked away from the table. They had signed up to the deal, they had stated it publicly and the government has reneged. We have had nothing from the Democrats other than Senator Greig's comments in here again tonight. The Democrats know the position and appear to be quite relaxed and comfortable to let the government break the deal they signed with them. If someone breaks a deal you apply a sanction, and the sanction is, through you Mr Temporary Chairman to Senator Greig, that you say to the government, `You are backtracking on part of the package that we negotiated.' But you are not prepared to hold the government accountable, and from 
 that point of view I am very disappointed in the Democrats. You are not prepared to hold the government accountable to a deal that you signed up to. So you cannot with any credibility claim that you have done what you said you would do: defend the forest industries.
 As I say, as a matter of principle and from a policy perspective we do not agree with you on that. You have tried to have it every which way and you have accomplished nothing as a result of what you have tried to do. Senator Brown, as I have said, has been consistent. We have all known Senator Brown's position. Unlike the Democrats, he has been consistent on the principles and issues that he has always been very clear on. That is to his credit, even though I and the Labor Party do not agree with some of those principles that he enunciates. I do not know where One Nation stands on this issue as we have not heard from them to date.
 We will not be supporting the amendments. Firstly, as I have said, Labor have always believed that the diesel fuel rebate should apply to the total forest industry. Secondly, Senator Brown is attempting via his amendments to separate plantation forests from native forests so that the diesel fuel rebate would apply to plantation operations but not to native forests. That would create an uneven playing field between the two sectors of the forest industry. Senator Brown is not giving the total picture, of course. Native forests are not all wilderness forests; in fact, only a very small proportion of native forests are wilderness forests. The vast majority of native forest that is logged in this country is regrowth; it has been logged before. To attempt to split it in this way and disadvantage native forest logging over plantation operations is inappropriate. Some logging of some native forests is appropriate. In some areas that is what the RFA process has been all about.
 I conclude by saying that there is a real debate emerging now about plantation forestry. Plantation forestry is monoculture. It is growing a crop on a 15- or 20-year cycle. You do not have any diversity of wildlife—of the flora and fauna—in plantation forests. By its very definition it is monoculture. We are starting to see a significant reaction to planta 
 tions in Tasmania for those reasons and for others. We do not want this debate to go too late so, from a Labor perspective, we have made the points we need to make. We will not be supporting the amendments, and I am very disappointed in the approach of the Australian Democrats to this matter.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,1999-12-06,"—As we are speaking directly, or ought to be speaking directly, to Senator Brown's amendments, I want to make it very clear that they have the full support of the Australian Democrats. If this vote goes through on the voices we will be supporting the bill. If Senator Brown wishes to call a division, we too will support that and vote for his amendments.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,1999-12-06,"—There was one other point, and I will be very brief. Senator Greig did not object to the second reading of the bill. I do not know why; it may have been because he is a new senator. I just make the point that the Democrats have been all over the shop on this issue, and they should have called for a division at the end of the second reading debate if what he is proposing to do now is call a division on the amendments.",SENATE,<title>DIESEL AND ALTERNATIVE FUELS GRANTS SCHEME (ADMINISTRATION AND COMPLIANCE) BILL 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,24,1,speech
"Greig, Sen Brian",AD,1999-12-06,"—In response to that question from Senator Sherry I make the point that, as I recall it, when the second reading vote was taken it was confused in the sense that, at that point in time, both the diesel and alternative fuels rebate scheme bill and the TLAB 9 bill were being taken in tandem. It was not possible, therefore, to make a decisive vote on that given that we were supporting one and not the other. But I have subsequently made our position very clear on both bills throughout debate.

"Murphy, Sen Shayne",ALP,1999-12-06,"—In terms of these bills, we are dealing with more amendments to a package—the ANTS package—that was supposed to have been signed, sealed and delivered and which did all things for all people, for all organisations and for everybody else. But as we saw in the debate on the previous legislation, we had a set of circumstances where the forest industry was going to be treated unequally in terms of the diesel fuel rebate scheme. We have seen a whole raft—I think some 1,100—of amendments proposed for the ANTS package, the latest of which relates to the debacle of the charitable organisations, where we had a position put out on behalf of the government that charitable organisations will be required to support the government's position before they will actually receive their grants.
 A number of matters were raised in meetings of the Economics References Committee with respect to A New Tax System (Tax Administration) Bill 1999  and taxation bills No. 8 and No. 9. These included the pay as you go withholding system and PAYG instalments; collection and recovery rules; binding oral advice on income tax matters; payment; the Australian business number and identification verification system; a shorter period of 
 review for taxpayers with simple tax affairs; endorsement of deductible gift recipients and tax exempt charities—and we now have a clearer view of the government's position on that; administration of the business activity statement obligation; and provisional tax technical correction.
We have seen a whole raft of potential impacts, and I am glad Senator Minchin has just come into the chamber because another matter that has arisen is the impact this package has had on the car industry. We know how many times Senator Minchin—in response to questions from us and in response to dorothy dixers from his own side—has tried to imply that the circumstances in the car industry as a result of the ANTS package are all hunky-dory. He has tried to imply publicly that sales of passenger vehicles are exactly the same as they have been in recent years; in fact on one occasion I think he said that they were even better. I will be very interested to hear what Senator Minchin has to say about the most recent reports.
Senator Kemp, in response to a question today about the car industry—a dorothy dixer from Senator Ferguson—said, `Look, the November figures were slightly down on last year, but I will check that.' Perhaps Senator Minchin might be able to inform us more accurately of that. More importantly, he ought to be able to inform us about claims that the car industry is now experiencing a 16 per cent downturn—something that we have been pointing out to the government for some time in respect of the impact this package of bills is having. The Ford factory is now in shut-down mode, and, according to an article in the Financial Review, the Director of the Motor Traders' Association, Jim Gibbons, said that `the slowdown had been pronounced since June'. Certainly the minister has been telling us since June that all is well and that things are sailing along. Up until last week, the minister, the Prime Minister and everybody else on the government side were saying that cars were going to be cheaper. What has happened? The Prime Minister all of a sudden has said, `Oh, well, perhaps they won't be cheaper. Perhaps the poor old punters out there are not going to get cheaper cars.'
Part of this bill deals with the treatment of charities, and it has now been exposed exactly what the circumstances are really going to be for charities. It is very important, in consideration of all of the amendments to the ANTS package, that we take account of all of these things. The government has told us from the outset that nothing would be a problem, that they had worked this out thoroughly, and that there would not be an impact on this and there would not be an impact on that. The chickens are really coming home to roost, and the government has some major problems.
The Democrats—none of whom are currently in the chamber—were the party that helped pass this legislation, and they have sort of disappeared into thin air. We have just had a debate on the diesel fuel rebate scheme and the forest industry. Senator Greig—I do not know if he was even in the Senate when the negotiations took place between Senator Lees and Senator Murray on behalf of the Democrats—has had to sign a minority report saying that they were opposed to the forest industry receiving the additional 8c a litre, when in fact his party leader and the economic spokesman of the party had agreed with the Prime Minister that that would not be the case. They negotiated an arrangement to pass an overall tax package that has problems, for charities and for nursing homes, in terms of imposing an increased tax on the general public of this country. They came in here and championed their participation in and support for the ANTS package as being of great importance. They said they had succeeded in significantly protecting the environment. They  said they had achieved a new outcome for the environment, but  nothing could be further from the truth.
As this whole package has been unravelling, so has the deal that the Democrats have done with the government. There are some major impacts as a result of this. I know the car industry is important to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, as a senator from South Australia. The minister is a senator from South Australia who has said on many occasions, `The opposition has it all wrong. Car sales have not slumped. It is all okay. It is all plain sailing. Of course, even if there was a 
 slight downturn, they will make it up after 1 July 2000, because car prices will go down and all the Mr and Mrs Averages are going to rush out and buy new cars, so things will be really fantastic.'
I note that Senator Ferguson has come into the chamber—another senator from South Australia; and the one who has asked the dorothy dixers of the minister in respect of the car industry and the sales within the car industry. Senator Ferguson might also like to make a contribution about the most recent reports in the newspaper with respect to the slump in passenger car sales. I have made the point to the minister before that the figures that he has used in the past do not actually reflect car sales, that they in fact reflect overall vehicle sales, including Mack trucks. I do not know any families who have a Mack truck to use as their family car. There may be one or two, but I am certainly not aware of any. It would seem to me that they would be fairly expensive to buy in the first place and even more expensive to run. But, of course, the minister wanted to roll all of those, including other trucks and other vehicles, into the overall sale of vehicles. What the minister has failed to address, and what the car industry has been very concerned about, as Mr Gibbons points out, is that since June there has been a marked downturn. That has been a major problem.
We have also had as part of this package of bills the issue that relates to the payment of the new 16c a litre in terms of the new diesel grants scheme and the conurbations in respect of trucks between 4.5 and 20 tonnes.
—Are they big trucks?
—No. I understand big trucks remain exempt. We may have to consult Senator Macdonald on big trucks. He is not in the chamber at the moment, but he may come in later and tell us a bit more about big trucks. We do not know what the administration process will be for that particular program. Senator Kemp earlier tried to convince us that the Australian Taxation Office—who are so well versed and so expert on the self-assessment process—would have it all worked out and that they would be able to 
 deal with the problems. But I do not think so. This is the Taxation Office who appeared before the Economics Legislation Committee—who Senator Kemp claims knows it all—and we did not get too good an explanation from them. They said, `This is a new scheme and it will have its problems,' and they acknowledged problems in the past with the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme and its application.
This whole package seems to be unravelling. In terms of the administration of the package, we do not know what the cost to business will be. I cannot recall the figure that the government stated in the package originally, but it was only small. It is now being assessed at something like $3 billion. All in all, I think the amendments that we are going to deal with during the course of maybe finally passing some sort of legislation will throw into major confusion the businesses of this country, the taxpayers of this country and also transport—in respect of which the National Party thought they got a good deal for the bush. The Victorians did not think too much of the good deal for the bush. The invincible former Premier of Victoria, Jeff Kennett, obviously did not sell your new package or could not sell your new package because the people did not believe it.
Senator McGauran interjecting—
—An interjection from Senator McGauran—a Victorian senator; friend of Jeff Kennett.
—From the bush.
—`From the bush'—I do not know how long ago that was. This National Party senator stood up and championed this so-called deal for the bush that was supposed to be worth so much for the bush. The Victorians realised that it was not so good for the bush, as will be the case around this country as this tax package is implemented. They too will come to realise that all of the claims that the government has made and will endeavour to continue to make about the reduction in costs and the benefits to exporters—and I do not argue, I have to say, about trying to make things better for rural Australia and trying to make things 
 better for the export industries of this country—
—Why do you want to keep the wholesale sales tax?
—It is not about keeping the wholesale sales tax system. That is not the argument. If you are going to change something and you say that it is a change for the better, it ought be the case that it is a change for the better. But that is the point: this is not a change for the better, and that is being demonstrated. As we move into the implementation phases of this new tax package, we are seeing more and more on a daily basis that that is the case. We are seeing more and more that this tax package, with all of the claims of the light on the hill, the sunny side of the street—
—How many amendments are there?
—Over 1,000.
—This is a simple tax.
—I have to disagree with you, Senator; it is not simple.
—The Prime Minister said it is simple.
—The Prime Minister may have said that it is simple, but it is not a simple tax system. It is becoming more complicated by the day with the amendments that the government is having to get through this parliament to make this new tax system, as has been described—
—Did you bring me back a fish?
—Good heavens! Senator Heffernan is in the chamber. Where have you been?
—I can't clean my fish and you've been away two weeks fishing.
—I know you could not clean a fish. Not only could you not clean one; you couldn't catch one.
Senator Heffernan interjecting—
—Order, Senator Heffernan! 
—Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. As I said, this whole package is unravelling. The Democrats clearly could not see the problems that were going to be associated with it. They could not even see the con with regard to the Diesel Fuel Rebate Scheme and its application with respect to forestry. I have to acknowledge that I always thought they were a party of integrity, that when they did a deal, if the deal was ratted on, which it was, firstly they would have said to the Prime Minister, `This is not on.' Then the Leader of the Democrats would have come in here and said, `The Prime Minister of Australia and the Treasurer have dudded us.' They would have said at least that but, as has been pointed out, that simply has not been the case.
I turn to the cheap car claims and the whole process associated with the car industry—and I am pleased that the minister, Senator Minchin, is still here. Over some months now he has made this grand claim that all is well with the car industry and that it is going to continue to be well. It would be useful if you could respond to some of the reports in the paper in an accurate way, in a way that actually deals with the concerns of the car industry.
Senator Heffernan interjecting—
—Senator Heffernan could not respond to anything. With regard to charities and business, there is a major concern with the administration processes and the implementation of this overall package. There is nothing wrong if you want to change something. We have always had thrown back at us, `You just want to keep the wholesale sales tax system.'
—And you do.
—Whether we do or whether we don't is not necessarily important. What is important is that, if the government and those people opposite who are part of the government want to change laws with respect to tax or anything else in a country, they should endeavour to do so for the better and then they would at least receive some acknowledgment. I understand that we actually helped you get the Ralph business tax reforms through the parliament.

"Ferguson, Sen Alan",LP,1999-12-06,"—Senator Murphy's speech has proved one thing; that is, if you go fly-fishing up in the Snowy Mountains for two weeks in clean air, where you can have fresh thoughts, it does nothing to allow you to collect your thoughts so that you can come back here and talk commonsense. Senator Murphy, in the two weeks you have had away, I would have thought you would have had time to at least make a note or two and have some semblance of order in what you were going to say to the chamber tonight. The only thing I found out in the whole of the 20 minutes that you were talking was that there is some chance, after all, that the Labor Party do not like the wholesale sales tax system, because just before you finished speaking you said, `We might or might not want to keep the wholesale sales tax system.' This is a revelation. I am wondering whether Senator Murphy ought inform Mr Beazley. Certainly Mr Latham would want to know. There just may be a tax policy in the wind, formulated while Senator Murphy was fly-fishing. He probably knows that he paid 22 per cent on his fly-fishing tackle; if it was not 22 per cent, it was probably 32 per cent—I am not sure. The thing that he is really narky about is the fact that he has paid his 32 per cent and, if he had waited a while, he would have had to pay only 10 per cent.
It really is a revelation. After all this time, the Labor Party do not like the wholesale sales tax. Senator Murphy is not sure whether he likes the wholesale sales tax and, in a 20-minute speech, he got to 19 minutes before he made any sort of revelation of what the Labor Party actually believe in.
I can tell you what the Labor Party really believe in. They believe in higher taxes and broken promises. Senator Murphy was not here for the 1993 election. Senator Collins certainly was not. Although it is a fair time ago, I vaguely remember that in the 1993 election the Labor Party promised income tax cuts with no sales tax increases. That was their policy: cut income tax and no sales tax increases.
What did we do after the 1993 election? True to form, the Labor Party broke its 
 promise, took away the income tax cuts and increased sales taxes. That is the sort of policy you get from the Labor Party. With Senator Murphy coming in here and saying, `We might or might not want to keep the wholesale sales taxes,' it is about time he went to his party and talked to Mr Latham, Mr Beazley, Mr Crean and all those other people who may have some input into policy—although they obviously have not yet had any input because we are yet to see a policy. Then we might find out what the Labor Party believes in.
 This party—the government—has always believed that we require a modern, competitive tax system, something the Labor Party has never heard of—a tax system that provides incentives to save, to invest, to create jobs and to increase living standards. Since this government came to power in 1996, it has delivered all those things. There are more jobs. Living standards are better.
Senator Jacinta Collins interjecting—
—Despite Senator Collins's interjection, her living standards, as well as those of many other people in Australia, are better than they were in 1996. One reason that there are amendments to the bill is that this is a government that consults. It listens to the representations made to it. Since the announcement and the initial passage of the legislation, there has been a lot of consultation. A lot of representations have been made to the government because of certain aspects of this bill. The government has been true to its word. It has said that it wants to have a tax system which is both competitive and does not disadvantage people. So it has been prepared to make the changes that you will see in the amendments in this bill.
We have a situation where the Labor Party is probably the only party left in the OECD countries that thinks that wholesale sales tax is the right way to tax a country today. Senator Murphy is gradually changing that view. I think he knows that it is not nice being the only party out of all the recognised developed countries in the world that actually favours a wholesale sales tax. I think Senator Murphy has a future in the Labor Party. He is showing a bit of foresight, something 
 nobody else has shown for years and years. It might not be a bad idea if, next time he goes fly-fishing, he takes Mr Crean, Mr Beazley and probably even Senator Quirke—although Senator Quirke is much better at some other sports than fly-fishing—up there to a get a bit of the fresh air that he got. They may actually change their view and show enough foresight to realise that, when you are the only party in the recognised developed countries of the world that thinks that a wholesale sales tax is right for today, it is time to change your mind.
I congratulate Senator Murphy. He has shown in his speech tonight that at least he is someone who has some foresight. Some would say that Mr Latham is the leader of policy in the Labor Party, that he is the only one with any foresight. He is the sort of person who might lead the Labor Party into the next millennium because at least he has some modern ideas. But now we have Senator Murphy as well. Between the two of them, there is a chance that we might reinvigorate the Labor Party and have a bit of a resurgence of policy ideas. Quite honestly, they are not going to have too much difficulty because currently they are working in a policy vacuum. There are no policies. Senator Murphy, once again, I congratulate you.
Senator Murphy raised a number of issues in his speech. One was the car industry. Senator Murphy comes from Tasmania. The car industry is not all that prominent in Tasmania, so I do not expect him to have had a lot of talks with people involved in the car making industry in Australia. But I can tell you that the government has. The government is in constant contact with the car industry.
—With the Tasmanian car industry?
—Not with the Tasmanian car industry, I promise you, Senator Collins. In Tasmania they tend to cart cars over there and cart them back. This government is in constant contact with the car making industry in South Australia. They know that this minister and the rest of the cabinet recognise that the car industry is very important to Australia. They are monitoring closely what is happening with car sales 
 throughout Australia. The point that Senator Murphy does not seem to be able to grasp is that car sales in Australia are at their second highest level on record.
—That is not true.
—It is true, Senator Murphy. I do not know what papers you were reading when you were fly-fishing, but had you read some of the major dailies you would have found out that the industry had the second highest level of sales on record. I understand that even last month the sales were down about 0.1 per cent on November last year.
Senator Minchin interjecting—
—I am corrected by the minister. The figure was 0.5; not 0.1. Car sales are down 0.5 per cent on the record levels of last year. Senator Murphy probably does quite a few miles in the car that he drives. If he were to order himself a new Holden, he would have to wait over five months to get it. That does not sound to me like a car industry that is in trouble. If you wanted a Holden, you would have to wait five months. I think that all the figures that Senator Murphy tries to bandy about concerning the car industry—
Senator Murphy interjecting—
—I bet you cannot buy one tomorrow. You certainly will not get one through DASfleet tomorrow, I can tell you that. You will have to wait five months. With Fords, the wait is about three months. It is a bit less for Fords. If you want a Holden, it is five months. The car industry is being closely monitored. This government has watched what is happening. When you have an industry that is having its second best year on record, you can hardly say that it is in crisis.
Senator Murphy also spoke about rural Australia. He said that he understood all about rural Australia. He understands a lot about rural Australia because it is pretty hard to go fly-fishing in the cities. Most of the time that Senator Murphy goes fly-fishing, he has to go into the country. He goes to very pretty places. He says he understands a lot about rural Australia, but he does not understand how much rural Australia welcomes the new 
 tax policy of this government. There is scarcely a person—I use the word `person' carefully—who does not believe that the wholesale sales tax system that we had was totally out of date and was hindering production. It hindered exports. The sales tax that was in-built into the cost of exports impinged on the cost of the goods that could be exported. They were built into the product and there was no way they could be removed.
This is the first tax system that has ever been given to Australia where it is possible to remove that cost impediment to exporters and rural producers. I do not know of a rural producer yet who says that he does not want the wholesale sales tax system removed and replaced by the goods and services tax. The exporters of Australia are very pleased that we are doing what we are.
Senator Murphy mentioned Mr Kennett at one stage. I am not sure how Mr Kennett got involved. To the best of my knowledge, he had no input into these bills that are going through the parliament or the changes that are being made. Senator Murphy said that he did not mind things changing as long as they represented a change for the better. He has proved that. He has changed his thinking. He is now considering the removal of the wholesale sales tax. That is the first piece of good news for years. That might be a change for the better in his thinking. If he can convince his party to do the same thing and to support the removal of sales tax, that is a change for the better. I quite understand why he thinks that it would be a change for the better.
The Labor Party is tied to an antiquated, unfair and complex tax system. It supports the current system that taxes exports and business inputs. Senator Murphy is in favour of a tax system that taxes exports and taxes the inputs of business. Find me any businessman or exporter who does not believe that those inputs taxes should be removed and I will be very pleased. I would sit and listen very carefully while they explained to me how they would be better off if we did not remove the costs on their business inputs. You will not find one.
—You name one.
—Senator Murphy interjects that I should name one. I have asked him to find one. I want him to find just one person who does not want those business inputs and the taxes on exports removed. As someone who has lived all his life in the country, I know that we are far better off without any of those taxes on exports or business inputs.
The Labor Party opposed our tax reform plan, which includes the broad-based consumption tax. We went to the election with it. The people voted for it. They said that this is the plan they want. Otherwise they would have voted Senator Murphy in. They wanted a reduction in marginal income tax rates. We have done all those things, yet after all that time the Labor Party has no plan of its own, except Senator Murphy's slight move towards the removal of the wholesale sales taxes. I hope that he gets reported, because he is the first Labor Party man that I have actually heard say on the public record that it might be a good idea to get rid of the wholesale sales taxes.
—That's not what I said.
—I will look carefully at the Hansard . I wrote it down exactly when he said it. He said, `We might or might not want to keep the wholesale sales tax system.'
The Labor Party opposes any reform of or improvement to the tax system. It opposes anything that is going to give income tax system cuts to middle Australia. It opposes that. It does not want to give any tax relief to those people in Australia who are paying the highest rates at the middle level of income. They are the people who have suddenly gone up to the highest rate of taxation and are earning $35,000 per year. Senator Murphy may think that a person who earns $35,000 per year is wealthy. However, they are paying the highest rate of taxation. They are paying the highest rate of marginal income tax at $35,000. Senator Murphy considers that they are wealthy because he does not want to give them any income tax cuts.
We are a party that believes that people earning between $35,000 and $50,000 are not wealthy. In many cases, they are battling just 
 as hard as a couple with two incomes of a lower level. We have said that it was absolutely imperative that those people got an income tax break. What did the Labor Party say? It was not in favour of that at all. They said that you must not give tax cuts to the wealthy, the people earning $35,000 per year. They consider them to be wealthy. It is probably less than half of what Senator Murphy gets.
We have always believed that in order to deliver those income tax cuts there had to be a change to the whole taxation system. That is exactly what we did; we reformed the whole taxation system. We have given Australia a competitive taxation system for the next century. The plan was launched in 1998 so that people had plenty of time to consider what we were doing and what plan we proposed. It was passed into law last July so that people had 12 months to know exactly what they were going to be faced with after 1 July 2000.
In drawing that plan together, we made sure that people who needed help would not be affected by the system. We talk about health, education, child care, food, local government rates, water and sewerage charges. All those things will be GST free. People will also receive $12 billion per year in income tax cuts. This means that 80 per cent of Australians will no longer pay any more than 30 per cent income tax.
This is something that the Labor Party could only ever dream about. Many Labor Party supporters and previous Labor Party supporters believe that the strong point of our taxation plan was that it gave some relief in income tax rates to those on middle incomes. They are the people who have been hurt most by the Labor Party's taxation system, which gave them very high income tax rates and very high wholesale sales tax rates. The Labor Party never talk about the 32 per cent sales tax rates that they were applying to people on the lowest incomes. It was 32 per cent for goods that attracted that rate. There was never an endeavour to make it any easier.
In fact, all they did after 1993 was to put the rates up. They promised they would not put them up. It was a typical Labor Party 
 election promise: `We will give you income tax cuts and we won't raise any other taxes.' But, once they were re-elected, what did they do? They forgot all about the income tax cuts. They made sure they were not delivered and put up the sales tax rates. That is the Labor Party's way. That is the Labor policy: no reform whatsoever, stick your head in the sand like an ostrich, hope that everything will just hang together and keep battling away and eventually falling behind the other developed countries in the world.
This government was not prepared to do that. It was not prepared to let the other countries in the developed world get a significant advantage over us. It was not prepared to let our trading competitors have a significant advantage over us because they had no taxes on their business inputs or no taxes on their exports. This government was concerned to make sure that we become as competitive as we possibly can, and we have. We will continue to do so with the introduction of the new tax system next year, when all of those people who are producing goods for export will be able to take advantage of the tax system that this government was prepared to put to the Australian people. It was prepared to put it into practice and it has.
This bill is providing some amendments in order to finetune the package because of representations that have been made to us. This government is a listening government and is prepared to make changes where they are worth while and where they can be proved to be beneficial both to the country and to the people who are making those representations. I am sorry my time has run out and I am sorry Senator Murphy has gone, because he had so many new ideas for the Labor Party. I hope he has gone to see Mr Beazley to give him the benefit of his vision.

"West, Sen Sue",ALP,1999-12-06,"—Tonight we are debating another raft of the new tax system, otherwise known as ANTS bills. One of them, A New Tax System (Indirect Tax and Consequential Amendments) Bill 1999 , has 255 amendments in its schedule 1, 32 in schedule 2, nine in schedule 3, four in schedule 4—they nearly got that right—10 in schedule 5, 14 in schedule 6, 20 
 in schedule 7 and 26 in schedule 8. In this one piece of legislation, there are 454 amendments that this government sees it has to make to what was going to be a wonderful and simple law. It is quite apparent that this is not the case.
One of the other bills,  A New Tax System (Tax Administration) Bill 1999 , is only 223 pages in size! Of course the government got this right—like fun! This government is obviously obsessively ideological.
—It's Protestant. Protestants don't have fun.
—Some of us are Protestant and we do, thank you, Senator Collins. It is a pity that Senator Ferguson, when he has his overseas trips, does not talk to some of the Europeans, in particular, about value added taxes or GSTs. Certainly in a recent parliamentary delegation that I led, one of the key things that my colleague Senator Sherry and I were told was that these countries were looking at ways to unravel their VAT—the same as our GST. The government keep saying that we allegedly were the only ones that had a wholesale sales tax while everybody else had a VAT. I had an interesting conversation with the United States congressional delegation which was out this week. They only levy their tax once. The point was made to me by a congressman that you do that so that it makes thing more simple. If you only levy a tax at one stage, the administration is more simple and it is more readily identifiable, instead of happening at every stage.
I am sorry Senator Heffernan has left the chamber tonight, because the issue I want to concentrate on is how the payments to wheat producers from the Australian Wheat Board are going to be handled. It arises from some answers I got to a question I placed on notice, question No. 1697. I placed it on notice on 22 October and it took 39 days to get an answer.
—Who was the minister?
—Senator Kemp was the minister. I wanted to know if he could outline the goods and services tax arrangements for loan payments made to wheat producers 
 through the Australian Wheat Board in lieu of crop sales being finalised. I also wanted to know if the Wheat Board would need to differentiate between domestic and export wheat sales from their pool to determine what sales are subject to GST and what sales are exempt and, if it is determined that the AWB loan payments are GST free, would this exemption extend to other grain growers. As many primary producers are now planning their crop rotations for the next 12 to 18 months, I asked if the Assistant Treasurer could explain what responsibilities primary producers and agricultural marketing boards have under the GST.
The answer is very interesting and I will pursue a number of aspects of it in the committee stage of this bill, because some of it does not make a great deal of sense to me. If what I thought I understood by the GST is correct, then I think there will be many primary producers, particularly wheat growers, out there who will suddenly realise that they have been sold a pup—and a pretty mongrel pup at that—because there are some major implications, I think.
—Mongrels are nice.
—This one is not, Senator. I think this one is potentially not nice.
—Son of a fatherless child, is it? It is that kind of mongrel, is it?
—`Not very nice' is all I wish to say. I think the implications for wheat producers and other cereal producers and many primary producers and also other—
Senator Quirke interjecting—
—It is not a laughing matter. It is very serious. There is a problem for these primary producers because it borders on whether their product is actually being exported.
We had Senator Ferguson tell us that taxes on inputs will be removed for those crops and those products that are exported. Let me use a current example. In New South Wales, and I guess in other states, it is the beginning of the wheat harvest time. In the north-west, in some areas—in fact in Mr Anderson's electorate—they have had a lot of rain. The crop has 
 been downgraded in a number of parts to being fit only for stockfeed wheat.
I am not aware of stockfeed wheat being in any demand on the export market. It is usually sold off at about $80 a tonne as opposed to $160 a tonne—those sorts of comparative figures—on the domestic market. From my reading of the answer that I have received and from Senator Ferguson's comment, for any wheat that goes overseas that is prime hard growers are going to receive premium payments—be paid well—and be able to claim the taxes off their inputs and not pay them. But those primary producers whose wheat is weather affected and is classified as stock wheat only and therefore is not able to be exported will have to pay the GST.
Not only will they then be getting less money for their product; they will be having to pay more for their input costs than those who are able to produce for export. It is sheer luck as to whether a storm may have hit their crop and the neighbour's crop might not have got that rain. You could well have, in adjoining paddocks almost, one crop being affected and another one not. The affected crop could well end up getting a lower price to the farmer, but he will not be able to claim his inputs as tax deductions, as opposed to the chap or woman who gets the better crop—gets an export crop—and is able to get a higher price and also claim the tax deductions for their inputs. That does not strike me as being fair. I am led to believe that that is correct, because part of the answer says:
Export sales of wheat by the AWB will be GST free and domestic sales will be subject to the GST. Therefore, the AWB will have to account separately for these sales.
What is not clear to me is what the implications are to the AWB for their running costs, but it is very clear to me that there are some potential stings in the tail here for primary producers. When we get to the committee stage, I would certainly like that question to be answered.
Getting back to the answer to my question (1), about outlining the arrangements for loan payments, it said:
Where a loan arrangement is entered into with, amongst other things, loan repayments and interest 
 charges with commercial terms, details of conditions in the event of loan default, risks borne by the lender and a genuine expectation of repayment, no GST will be applicable to the loan principal and no GST is payable on interest charges. However, the supply of the loan facility by the AWB itself will be input taxed as a financial supply.
That obviously has some implications for grain producers. Later I asked whether these sorts of situations would apply to producers of other grains. The answer was: `See (1).' It then said:
Where a genuine loan agreement is entered into with a producer, a liability for GST on the supply of the wheat will arise either at the time the producer is paid or issues an invoice for their wheat, depending on whether the producer accounts on a cash or non-cash basis.
First of all, when we get to the committee stage, I would like all that interpreted into English that is plain and simple, so I can understand it and so that I can send it out to my wheat producers.
The reason for these questions going on notice was that I was asked these questions by grain producers. They, it is obvious, are quite concerned and quite unsure of what the situation is. In answer (2) we are told:
If the AWB sells wheat directly to a non resident customer and actually exports the wheat, the supply will be GST free. The conditions which must be met to make a GST free export are that the goods are exported from Australia by the supplier within 60 days of the supplier receiving any consideration or issuing an invoice for the goods (whichever occurs first).
I would like that also in plain English, but I would also like the Department of the Treasury to tell me, if they can, how much wheat is sold in such a situation that there is less than 60 days eventuating from the export where the supplier has received any consideration or issues an invoice for the goods. These are pertinent questions which were not answered in the answer that I got. For other grains I was told to see answer (1). The final answer says:
Broadly, primary producers and agricultural marketing boards will have the same responsibilities as all other GST registered businesses. Each entity will have to apply for an Australian Business Number to be registered for the GST. After 1 July 2000 GST will have to be remitted for taxable supplies made in the course of their business. An input tax 
 credit will be allowed for GST paid on creditable business acquisitions. Regular returns called Business Activity Statements will need to be completed and lodged with the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) (quarterly or monthly). A net payment of GST will have to be made at the same intervals. Where a business has paid out more GST than has been collected then the ATO will refund the amount within 14 days of the lodgement of the return.
As I said, I want all of that put into plain English, because it is not in plain English at present.
I want to go back to the beginning in terms of the loan payments or the payments by the AWB to wheat producers. My understanding is that when these payments are made they do not get a single payment but that payments are made over two or three pools, as they are called. The bulk comes through first and then after the wheat sale has been finalised more will come through in maybe one or two different lots. It is of course possible that for this year's wheat harvest the pools will not be finalised until after 1 July 2002—that is, after the introduction of the GST. I want to know what transition arrangements have been put into place for the GST for farmers who actually are getting paid for the crop that they harvested this year and for the work that they put in for this year. This is not clear.
I also want to know from the department and from the minister how they are going to work out which farmers have had their grain exported, or is it going to be done on the basis of a collective allocation or assessment? A truck load of wheat is made up of many grains. The farmer will have some idea, when he takes his wheat to the silo, of its grading. The wheat is put into different grades; part of it may end up being exported, but part of it may be used domestically. How is how much a particular grower has contributed to a particular pool going to be assessed? How is the assessment going to be done so that we know that all—or maybe only part—of grower X's crop went overseas? No-one knows, because it is made up of individual grains and they are all pooled.
Presumably an assessment will be done and a pro rata applied. For example, if 50 per cent of one particular category gets exported and 
 somebody has 100 tonnes of that particular grade, then they will get 50 per cent notionally allocated to them as having been exported, and for that 50 per cent they will be able to claim their input taxes back. For the other 50 per cent they will not. This has some severe ramifications, because that will lead to higher prices in terms of value adding—or disincentives to value adding. If a farmer is lucky enough to have all of a particular pool exported, they will get all their inputs removed. But if it goes to some value adding within Australia, which might eventually end up being exported, the farmers are not going to be able to recoup the tax on their inputs.
I come from the central west of New South Wales. We have Uncle Ben's and Friskies. They are two pet food providers, and a large part of the base for pet foods is cereals—wheat, barley, et cetera. A lot of their product for dogs and cats ends up on the shelves of supermarkets in Japan and other countries overseas. Are Treasury telling me that they will be able to work it all the way back and calculate the percentage of the grain the Wheat Board sells to Uncle Ben's and Friskies—say 100 tonnes made up into 100 tonnes of pet food, of which 50 tonnes goes overseas—so that Uncle Ben's gets the benefit, the Wheat Board gets the benefit and the farmers get the benefit? If they are telling me that, then it sounds like an extremely difficult and time consuming paper trail.
I do not think primary producers will want to be involved in that sort of thing. I do not think primary producers realise just how confusing this particular issue is. I have grave concerns because I do not know just how the government are going to be able to explain that. From the reading of the answer that I have been given, it strikes me that there are still some answers to be had on this. We are now only seven months away from the introduction of this tax. Grain producers and other farmers are planning not just for this season's crop but for next year and the following years. How can they plan with any certainty? How can banks and lending institutions lend them money with any certainty when they know that any export sales of wheat will be GST free and domestic sales will be subject 
 to GST? It does not affect just the farmers in this region; it affects the whole region. If there is less income and more paperwork to be done, the farmers will not be spending as much money in the communities and the town. This is another example of where this tax would appear to be more iniquitous.
When we come to the committee stage of the debate on this bill, there are a lot of questions I want answers to, and I want answers in plain English so that the wheat producers that are asking me these questions can have the answers they want in language they can understand. This answer is not given in language they can understand. It also took 39 days to come. I would have thought that, so close to the introduction of this bill, the department and the minister would have been able to almost pull the answer off the shelf and have a one-day turnaround in answering. But they did not; it has taken 39 days. That is indicative of the unprepared state the government are in as they attempt to introduce this piece of iniquitous legislation that is impacting on the whole community.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (PAY AS YOU GO) BILL 1999</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1,speech
"Gibson, Sen Brian",LP,1999-12-06,"—I rise to support these government bills, the A New Tax System (Pay As You Go) Bill 1999  and three related bills, which are about amending and tidying up the key bills which went through this parliament in June about the new tax system. Why are we here talking about tax? The fundamental reason we are talking about tax is that Australians know that the Australian tax system has been an absolute mess for a long, long time. It was designed in the 1930s when the Australian economy was based on goods and not services. Back in the 1930s, about two-thirds of the Australian economy, as in most Western world economies, was goods and about a third was services. Today the reverse applies: two-thirds or more of the Australian economy and of most of the Western world's economies is services and about a third is goods, and it is shifting rapidly to services. That is what people are spending their money on. So the system that was designed back in the 1930s, a long time ago, is basically out of date. Not only that, we had a process since the 1930s of adding complexity to a system which was 
 not based on principles. So we built up this superstructure of complicated tax in Australia, and we have ended up with one of the most complicated tax structures in the world.
Both sides of politics have known this for a long time. The Asprey committee reported in the mid-1970s about what a mess the Australian tax system was and how it needed to be changed. The Hawke government in 1986 came to the same conclusion, but unfortunately politics between the ACTU and the Prime Minister of the day defeated Mr Keating and option C went out the window. Instead of going ahead with what was needed by the Australian economy and what was needed by our children and our grandchildren for the future, it was thrown out the door for short-term politics. Fightback in 1993 was the next major attempt, by our side of politics, to get the situation right, but again unfortunately scare tactics led to the defeat of the coalition's proposals in 1993.
It took John Howard to have the courage to set the record straight. In August two years ago he said, `This government has the guts to take on board tax reform and change the tax system for Australia—not for us for today or tomorrow but for our kids and our grandkids for the future.' Everyone who knew anything about tax recognised that this had to be done. From that day back in August 1997, the coalition has been through this long process of tax reform. I had the honour of being chairman of the Prime Minister's tax task force, which was seeking views from the community for seven months about what was wrong with the tax system and what needed to be changed. The government considered those views, came out with this package and went to the election on it, followed by a Senate select committee on the ANTS package and then Ralph and business tax. So Australia now has a modern tax system before us, and what we are talking about today is minor amendments to tidy up the ANTS bills as a result of consultation with industries about the detail—just a normal, sensible process of consultation with the various interest groups and getting the fine detail right. The principles have been set right. They have been set in legislation and they are now 
 law. What we are about today is setting the detail and getting that right.
In spite of all this, we have the opposition continuing with the lie that this is all nonsense, that the GST is nonsense, when in their hearts their leaders know that tax reform was required in Australia. Their leaders took part in the debates and led the debates in the 1980s requiring those changes, but they have left all that behind because they want to go ahead with short-term scare politics with the Australian community. That is very sad for our children and our grandchildren. Even though the opposition woke up in the last couple of weeks—and thank goodness they did wake up and agreed to the Ralph changes on business tax going through—it is time that they also woke up and agreed to the GST changes going through so that Australia does end up with a sensible, practical, modern tax system fitting in with the rest of the world. They want to stay with wholesale sales tax. They want to put us back into the category of Botswana and three other Third World countries, in contrast with anyone else in the rest of the world.

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,1999-12-06,"—I would like to take just a few moments this evening to talk about the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties and its role in assisting this parliament to govern in the national interest. I joined the treaties committee when I first entered the Senate and believe that today it is one of parliament's most important committees. It does not have a very long history, having been established a little over three years ago, but it fulfils a very important and a very crucial role. The committee provides a voice for parliament and a voice for the community in developing international law. It is a voice that the people of Australia have been demanding for a very long time.
Many people think that international law is an esoteric matter with little bearing on the way we lead our lives here in Australia, but this is not so. Increasingly, as the international community grows and matures, more and more aspects of our daily lives and our interactions with others are governed by internationally developed rules and norms of conduct. Whether it is in the field of defence and security, nuclear disarmament, trade and investment, the environment, civil aviation, social security and health services, science and technology or human rights, international agreements affect us all.
While some mistakenly see treaties as of little importance in everyday life, some others equally mistakenly go to the other extreme and ascribe far too much—often sinister—influence to international treaties that bind this country. In a rapidly changing world, the extent to which domestic policy options are limited by our international obligations—by our treaties—can be a source of concern for some people in our community. Some people fear that treaties unduly infringe on our rights and on our national sovereignty.
Recent protests on the streets of Seattle—against free trade and globalisation in general and the activities of the World Trade Organisation in particular—are a reminder to governments of the need to subject international agreements to close scrutiny. In the absence of public input, international organisations far too readily become the focal points for alleged conspiracies and plots by special interests and unaccountable bureaucrats. In my view, in a civilised global society the advantages of international agreements far outweigh any potential disadvantages: treaties can help to establish fair, agreed and transparent rules to guide the relations between nations.
But Australia's entry into international treaties goes much further than simply being a good international citizen. Treaty making is not a matter of altruism: this country negotiates treaties because it is in our national interest to do so. Nations with relatively small populations, such as Australia, benefit greatly from a world where relations between countries are based upon agreement and not aggression. If the rules of international engagement 
 were to be governed simply by the projection of military and economic power, Australia would be at a distinct disadvantage. But in a world where international relations are based upon effective rules, our country can have an influence that extends beyond what our military and economic strength might suggest. Already Australia has advanced her national objectives by helping to shape the standards and the rules by which international relations are conducted. A recent example is the United Nations Law of the Sea Convention, which establishes globally accepted regimes for access to the resources of the sea and the seabed.
Australia is one of the world's very great trading nations but, because of our relatively isolated geographical position, we are heavily reliant upon efficient transport and communications systems. The treaties establishing the much maligned World Trade Organisation assist Australian industries in developing global markets. Without international cooperation of this sort, Australia's standard of living and our quality of life would suffer. For example, treaties can help communities around the world tackle environmental problems that cross national borders and require coordinated international action to resolve. Treaties can help establish fair taxation regimes for small Australian export firms seeking to trade in international markets. Treaties can help ensure that international air services meet minimum safety standards and that Australian travellers who fall ill while overseas have access to local health care services. Treaties can also help establish agreed plant and animal quarantine standards.
The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties is part of Australia's response to this challenge of ensuring that global rule making reflects, and is responsive to, local concerns. In its work it operates in the best tradition of parliamentary committees: it is objective and inquiring and it recognises that the commitment to Australia's national interest is far more important than considerations of partisanship. Since 1996 the treaties committee has tabled in parliament 28 reports reviewing 160 separate treaty actions. Since July this year, when I joined the committee, we have pro 
 duced six reports reviewing 26 treaty actions. Not only is it a prolific committee but I believe it is an extremely effective one.
Our terms of reference provide that all proposed international treaties be reviewed by the treaties committee before action is taken by this government to bind Australia to the terms of the treaty. In short, we expose all treaty actions to the bright light of public examination. The questions we ask in our reviews are generally very straightforward. Why is this treaty action being proposed? What obligations, costs and benefits will be associated with this treaty action? What other government and community groups have been involved in the development of this treaty? These questions are directed at gathering sufficient information to allow us to determine whether or not the treaty or proposed treaty action is in Australia's national interest.
In doing so, we gratefully acknowledge the assistance we are given by the submissions we receive from members of the public, community organisations and state and territory governments. A good example comes from my home state of Queensland. Last month the treaties committee travelled to Rockhampton to talk to the local community about their views on a proposed treaty allowing the Singapore Armed Forces to use the defence training area at Shoalwater Bay. Although we have not yet reported to parliament on this treaty, I can say that we found it to be extremely useful to speak to representatives of the local community, government, business and environmental groups about the impact of the proposed treaty.
Australia is changing dramatically in economic and social terms along with the rest of the world. The changes are driven primarily by new technology which has the potential to dramatically increase the productivity, the wealth and the quality of life of the Australian community. Australia cannot opt out of these developments nor opt out of the international system that seeks to make rules for orderly progress. Rather, we must try to influence developments in order to protect and promote our national interest. The echoes of Seattle convince me that our role in this parliament is to explain to Australians—and perhaps 
 others—why international agreements serve our interests.
It is about leadership. While we cannot tell people who have concerns about a changing world and about the pace of globalisation that their concerns have no validity, neither can we merely echo and massage the ill-informed fears that Australia can somehow opt out. In a way, the treaties committee simply seeks to ensure that international agreements to which Australia might become a party benefit the national interest. We want to ensure that the strengthening of economic, social and cultural ties between Australia and other countries—call it globalisation if you wish—are the bonds of benefit and not the shackles of subservience.

"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,1999-12-06,"—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:
Two committees with separate roles were involved in the process of developing the neutral public education campaign for the referendum.
The Referendum Steering Group—consisting of the Attorney-General (the Chairman), the Special Minister of State and a representative from the Prime Minister's Office—was responsible for the wording of the advertising. The Referendum Steering Group was supported by the Referendum Taskforce, a unit of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.
The Ministerial Committee on Government Communications is responsible for oversighting the Government's communications activities. It consists of the Special Minister of State (the Chairman), Mr Georgiou MP, Mr Nutt and, in the case of the Referendum neutral campaign, the Attorney-General. In line with normal practice, the MCGC considered the structure of the campaign and the concept and creative elements of the advertisements. The MCGC is supported by the Government Communications Unit in the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet.
The brief to advertising agencies for the neutral campaign was cleared by both the Referendum Steering Group and the MCGC. Also in line with normal practice, the creative agency was selected by the MCGC following presentations by shortlisted agencies. The presentations included the television commercial concepts.
The neutral campaign was considered by MCGC in line with normal arrangements. For the Yes and No advertising campaigns, special arrangements were made for MCGC oversight to ensure the activities met basic standards and that there was accountability for use of public funds.
(1) (a) The MCGC saw proposed scripts for the neutral program TV advertisements as part of its consideration of the proposed advertisements on 24 August 1999, but noted that it was not its role to approve the detail of the content of the scripts. The Referendum Steering Group approved the final scripts.
(b) The materials for the MCGC were delivered by hand to committee members' offices. 

(2) (a) and (b) Scripts were received by members of MCGC constituted as described above, and by advisers to the Attorney-General and the Special Minister of State in their capacity as advisers.
(3) (a) The MCGC saw the scripts on 24 August 1999.
