"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2014-03-05,"



Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland) (09:31):  This is a bill that implements a change that Labor announced in August last year. It goes to the question of price disclosure for the way that the government purchases pharmaceuticals and the interaction between the manufacturers and pharmacies in our country. Price disclosure started in 2007 under the Howard government. The purpose then was to ensure that the government received price reductions when generic medicines were listed on the PBS schedule. It was further refined and extended in 2010 with an expanded and accelerated price disclosure program, which expanded the types of medicine that were included in schedule and it also reduced the cycle of data collection to 18 months. This bill today reduces the price disclosure cycle from 18 months to 12 months. It reduces the amount of time between when a company advises the price reduction of a drug and when the government starts paying that reduced cost. It is expected that this bill will save $835 million over three years and for that reason, of course, Labor will be supporting it.


In government we used the $1.9 billion that was saved through the measures that we introduced to make investments in health that delivered benefits to all Australians. Labor built more than 25 regional integrated cancer centres through an investment of $656 million—centres that are providing support to Australians in regional areas. Those patients were previously required to travel long distances over a long time to receive their treatment, but now can be provided with great services in regional centres. We invested a record $3.5 billion in medical research from 2008. This provided the record levels of National Health and Medical Research Council grants of $771 million in 2013, supporting over 8,500 researchers at more than 80 hospitals, medical research institutes and universities. The Health and Hospitals Fund also delivered $700 million to build and upgrade medical facilities right across the country, a fund that the coalition did not support in opposition and a fund we are unlikely to see again under this government. Labor's record in health, when in government, was one of reform and investment and one of which we are particularly proud.


With health costs increasing over time it does make sense to implement this change. What is important is to make sure that this money is reinvested into the health system. The shadow minister, Catherine King, in the other place urged the government to make sure that this money—this $835 million—is reinvested into health. The money, we believe, should be reinvested into the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, not used to prop up government coffers. We as Australians can be particularly proud of our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. It is a scheme that has been operating, as we know, for many years now and it is one that is the envy of the Western world. It is a scheme that provides equitable access to pharmaceuticals in this country and at the best price possible for a nation of our size and of our population.


We wait with great interest to see what the government will actually do when it comes to the health portfolio. Minister Dutton has, in our view, very little vision for health other than finding savings for the Prime Minister. Despite consistently saying and promising not to cut money from the health budget, the government has already ripped $100 million from the Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital. We have seen the abolition of the Alcohol and Other Drugs Council, a body that has existed for over 50 years and has provided good research and advice to government about how to better manage the scourge of drugs and that misuse of alcohol in our community. The government has already backflipped on the promise not to close any of our Medicare Locals. Unfortunately, it has also abolished the expert advisory panel on the marketing of infant formula. Frankly, this government is not interested in getting accurate information about these significant aspects of health policy. Then we have seen the debacle of the pulling down of the health star-rating website, a website designed to provide good information to consumers and also to food manufacturers about the products that they make and use. 


I acknowledge the view of the Pharmacy Guild, but we need to balance that view with the need to ensure that we are paying the right price—the right price, and not too much, not too little—for the pharmaceuticals that are purchased with taxpayers' money. The current government when in opposition was somewhat disingenuous, in our view, by whispering to pharmacists that it would not proceed with simplified price disclosure. On coming to government, it conceded that this policy was good policy, but I daresay it already knew this in opposition. The policy ensures that taxpayers pay the right price for pharmaceuticals. I urge the government to ensure that the savings are reinvested into the PBS for the benefit of all Australians. I can indicate to the chamber that Labor will be supporting this amendment to the national health legislation.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2014-03-05,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria) (09:38):  I rise to support this bill. Price disclosure is a very important and effective mechanism in ensuring that the cost of pharmaceuticals on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is kept affordable, both for individuals who access those drugs and for the health budget. It is a sensible measure and it is an important measure. Reducing the threshold from 18 months to 12 months makes perfect sense—in fact, some people would argue that there is no good reason that threshold could not be lowered even further. This is a very important step in ensuring that continued sustainability of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. It is going to save $835 million and what that money does is to give people access to new drugs, to drugs that would not otherwise be listed and to new services that otherwise would be unavailable. The Greens certainly support this reform.


The bill does arrive at a time when we are having a fierce debate about the future of Australia's health system. We heard talk in the lead-up to the election of a budget emergency, and we saw the establishment of the Commission of Audit who were charged with looking for inefficient spending and for savings that could be made to the bottom line of the budget. The Greens have had concerns about the Commission of Audit inquiry, and that is why we moved to have a Senate probe into the work of the commission. What we have learnt through that process is that 'everything is on the table', in the words of the commissioner. We have been told that health is one area where savings must be made. We have had the proposal of a co-payment to access GP services mooted. We heard the Minister for Health invite an open and public debate on that issue. We heard from the AMA that $400 million has been withdrawn from the nation's public hospital system. We have seen defunding of the Alcohol and Other Drugs Council on the premise that its role is being duplicated by other agencies. We now know that, in fact, many of the functions of that council were stand-alone and have now been lost.


We saw the dismantling of the star rating website on foods. This has been part of a worrying trend of secrecy in this government. One of the concerns is not just that the process for the dismantling of that website was secretive—and there still remain some serious questions about that—but the very act of denying individuals, consumers, ordinary citizens access to information about the food they eat is, at its heart, a very secretive policy position. Surely there is nothing wrong with open, transparent and honest government, in the words of the Prime Minister. That should also apply to ensuring that people have open and honest information about the foods they eat.


We have seen all of those things in the context of a debate in which it has been said that we cannot continue to have the health system that we currently enjoy, that health spending is unsustainable and out of control and that we need to make deep cuts to health. I think that proposition needs to be examined. Firstly, we spend as a proportion of our GDP about nine per cent on health care. That compares very favourably with other nations that have similar levels of economic development. In fact, when we look at the United States' health system, we see a country spending twice what we spend and yet which has much poorer health outcomes and a much less fair health system.


Health spending is projected to increase by a per cent or so over the next decade—from nine per cent to 10 per cent of GDP. But if economic growth is not to serve the health of its citizens then why on earth do we strive for it? The whole point of an economy that is strong and delivers economic growth, surely, should be to ensure that we are able to carry out what is really one of the primary responsibilities of government—that is, delivering good health care to all of its citizens.


Our health system does very well on that front. It is efficient. Most of the increase in spending is because we have new, exciting, life-saving health technologies. That is hardly a crisis. In fact, it is the precise opposite. Most countries around the world strive to have the challenges that we have in health—that is, to fund new technology that will deliver people longer lives, better quality lives and healthier lives. That is not a crisis; that is a wonderful opportunity, and we should be doing everything we can to meet that challenge.


Of course we can look for savings in health, but first let's look elsewhere. We hear about the government's statement that we are now at the end of the era of entitlement—




Senator Xenophon:
  The age of entitlement.




Senator DI NATALE:
  the age of entitlement—thank you, Senator Xenophon; how could I forget?—and that corporate welfare is now over. Let us ensure that we match that rhetoric with action. Let us end the huge subsidies that are given to the fossil fuel industry, for example, in an era of catastrophic climate change. Why do we continue to subsidise the mining industry with things like the diesel fuel rebate to the tune of billions of dollars?


Let us look at other areas where large corporations are the beneficiaries of government largesse. We heard the Prime Minister talk about his support of the forestry industry only last night when in my state of Victoria the forestry industry is a basket case. It is propped up by government support, and if it were a private company, it would have been wrapped up many years ago. It is the epitome of corporate welfare and it is an industry that does rely on government handouts.


So let us look at those areas before we start looking at health because most Australians consistently regard health as the most important area of government expenditure. In essence, if a government cannot provide decent health care for its people, cannot give kids a decent education and cannot look after the environment, then I am not sure what we are doing here.


Of course there are some savings to be made in health care. We have talked about this bill, which goes some way to addressing some cost savings through the PBS. There are other potential savings through the PBS. We have heard about the potential for the increased use of generic drugs, for example, and incentives to ensure that people are opting for cheaper generic drugs which are doing exactly the same thing as their branded equivalent. So let us look at providing more incentives in the system to ensure that generic drugs are prescribed at a higher frequency. Let us look at the way we negotiate prices for medicines and examine the potential for reducing the total budget of the PBS by looking at some models overseas and learning from those.


Let us ensure that we do the opposite of what is being proposed through the GP co-payment, which is driving people away from hospitals into primary care. Let us do that rather than doing what is proposed, which is putting a disincentive for people to access their GP. It goes precisely in the opposite direction of all public policy in health care that we have seen over the past few decades. We should be making sure that people are accessing primary care ahead of much more expensive hospital services, and to do anything that compromises that important objective is to raise costs in health.


Let us try and get better coordination of the system. Let us ensure that we have our primary care system, our hospitals and our allied health network working better together, and Medicare Locals provide an opportunity to do that. And let us ensure that we protect Medicare. Some of the changes that have been proposed, such as the GP co-payment and the current initiative to allow private health insurers to insure services delivered through general practice, are some very significant nails in the coffin of Medicare.


We have to do everything we can to protect Medicare, build it up and continue creating more access to it—because we know it is a very effective way of keeping healthcare costs down through a single public insurer and a very fair way of delivering health services—rather than what we are doing at the moment which looks like an attempt to tear up some of the most fundamental pillars of our public health system and Medicare.


We are at a crossroads in health care. We have an opportunity here to protect and build upon one of the world's great health systems. But we are equally in a position where we may start to see some of the most effective tools for delivering health care dismantled as a result of some of the proposals that have been suggested through the Commission of Audit. I am very worried about it. We need only look to the US to see a health system that is based on a user-pays model where there are a number of competing private health insurers delivering the bulk of health services rather than a single public insurer. We only need to look to the US to know what that leads to. It leads to spiralling health costs, people who are no longer able to afford health care and a two-tiered health system. That is not what the Australian health system was designed to be. It was designed to provide decent health care to everybody, regardless of their ability to pay for it.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",Ind.,2014-03-05,"



Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (09:50):  I want to express my very serious concerns in relation to this bill. Price disclosure is important. It is important for consumers. It is important for transparency. I am very supportive of price disclosure. I believe it is a very important part of managing the PBS, which costs taxpayers some $9 billion each year but is an essential part of our health system. I agree in part with Senator Di Natale that we do not want to go down the US path where they are having a huge debate about Obamacare. It is referred to as 'socialised medicine' when in fact it is not even Medicare-lite, in many respects.


I am deeply concerned about how this policy of price disclosure has been implemented. I believe that the 5,500 community pharmacies in this country have been absolutely dudded by the previous government and unfortunately by this government as well. Last year we saw concerns raised by some pharmacists about price disclosure relating to chemotherapy drugs, because that price reduction was implemented with little or no consultation with or warning to them. The consequences of that were dire, causing great uncertainty and distress to many chemotherapy patients and creating genuine hardship for pharmacies. We heard evidence from some pharmacies in regional Australia that they were basically having to close down their provision of those vital chemotherapy drugs and patients had to go 100 kilometres, 200 kilometres or more away to get them. That was just cruel.


I was very grateful for the work that I did with a number of my colleagues on the Senate committee that I was part of instigating in relation to that. In particular, Senator Dean Smith and Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells took a real interest in that. Also, Senator Siewert and Senator Moore were part of that. What was clear from that Senate inquiry was that there needed to be greater consultation. There needed to be a fair system of implementing price disclosure, because you can have all sorts of unintended and cruel consequences if you do not get the policy right.


We are now seeing the same thing happen again, as the price disclosure cycle is shortened from some 18 months to 12 months or even shorter than that. Price disclosure commenced in late 2007 and has been part of the community pharmacy agreement since. However, accelerated price disclosure is not part of the agreement. This legislation is to change this. The Pharmacy Guild, which I have been speaking to in respect of this, would like to go back to the original agreement. And why shouldn't they? A deal was done. That deal should have been stuck to. The previous government changed it. This government is implementing those changes. That is wrong.


Every pharmacist I have spoken to, including representatives from the Pharmacy Guild, have expressed their support for the price disclosure policy. But they have all said that the lack of warning and consultation has not given them time to prepare or plan for an even more significant reduction in their income. Let's put this into perspective. One pharmacist who wrote to me estimated that the shortened time period would have an impact of at least $32,000 per annum on their bottom line. That is in addition to the existing $56,000 per annum reduction from price disclosure. Pharmacy Guild representatives I spoke to just this morning indicate that the income for the average pharmacy could be reduced by around another $50,000 a year; that is on top of the $50,000 per annum they are already losing. There are about 60,000 people employed in community pharmacies. If you are a pharmacist, you are essentially a small business in difficult economic circumstances and that $50,000 could mean laying off one or two part-time employees—employees you have spent a lot of money training, employees with great skills in dealing with customers who have myriad medical problems. I dread to think of the impact on employment in this sector as a result of this lack of consultation and this sudden and draconian drop in income for community pharmacies.


The pharmacist who wrote to me expecting a $32,000 drop in his income is actually supportive of the policy, but he just wants more warning so that he can prepare his business for change. Community pharmacies play a vital role in our health system. There is no question about that. Senator Di Natale was talking about preventative health, and he is absolutely right: let's stop people getting sick in the first place and stop them ending up in hospital at enormous cost to the community and the additional trauma to themselves. Pharmacists are trying to provide support and advice to members of their community. Relatively recent changes in legislation have given them the ability to write prescriptions for some medication; they also help to reduce the strain on GPs and emergency rooms by providing basic medical advice. I have two cousins who are community pharmacists, and they tell me what it is like to run their business and about their travails. They take great pride in what they do and in training their staff to incredibly high standards in order to provide that service to the community. 


While shorter price reduction cycles may save the PBS money in the short term, pushing community pharmacists out of business will only cause this delicate ecosystem of health care to break down. The Pharmacy Guild representative I spoke to a few minutes ago is someone I have great regard for. His information has always been accurate and, unfortunately, I believe his latest information is also accurate. According to him, there are in the order of 5,500 community pharmacies and 10 per cent of them are quite marginal—they are either in receivership or facing serious difficulties in trading. His fear is that, if this government implements this ill-considered policy from the former government, it could push up to 20 per cent of pharmacies over the edge. That is over 1,000 pharmacies. It would mean double the loss of this accelerated process and it would mean that many pharmacies would see $50,000 wiped off their bottom line. They are not saying that they do not want to do it; they just want time to adjust. We are talking about industries around the country that are under enormous pressure, and they just need time to adjust. Even the Productivity Commission has acknowledged that in relation to the manufacturing sector; it is about the transition. That is why this piece of legislation is so wrong—not in respect of the price disclosure but about the transition.


It is worth noting that, while medium annual household income rose 118 per cent between 1991 and 2012, the cost of pharmaceutical products rose by 58 per cent. By comparison, medical and hospital services rose 191 per cent. So, in relative terms, community pharmacies have been given a raw deal. They are the poor cousins of the health system, and their ever-diminishing income is, quite frankly, unsustainable. What will the impact be of up to 1,000 pharmacies closing down through accelerated price disclosure? That is a very real concern to me. What will the impact be on regional communities if their local pharmacy closes down and residents have to travel another 10, 20, 30 or 50 kilometres down the road to get access to basic medicines?


The purpose of the community pharmacy agreement is to provide community pharmacists with financial certainty over the longer term. Although pharmacists are offering a service, they still have to run a business. They have to stock their pharmacy. They have to pay the rent. They have to train and pay highly skilled staff. A community pharmacy is a type of small business which does not rely just on its skills and advice and business acumen; it is also at the mercy of regulatory changes. Some changes, such as those in this bill, are poorly thought out, and these changes will be poorly implemented because you are not giving community pharmacies enough time to adjust.


The recent changes to price disclosure implementation have undermined certainty. The questions I have for the minister, which must be answered during the committee stages of this bill, are as follows. What consultation has there been with the community pharmacy sector? What are the proposed savings from the extra price disclosure? My understanding is that it is in the order of $149 million a year. If that is the case, what will be the drop in income for average, typical pharmacies—taking into account that some pharmacies are very small, niche businesses which are attached to a medical clinic or a doctor's rooms? Will it be in the order of $50,000 per annum, an accelerated drop in income which could have disastrous consequences for the viability of community pharmacies?


Mr Temporary Chairman Sterle, I know that as a senator for Western Australia you are very familiar with Broome. I do not know how many pharmacies there are in Broome, and I know that you cannot respond because you are in the chair. But I wonder what impact the changes in this bill will have in, for instance, the wonderful town of Broome. I think there might be about three pharmacies in Broome. I wonder whether any of them will be under pressure as a result of the changes in this bill.


So that there is no mistaking that my criticism of the proposals in this bill is bipartisan, I point out that the proposals were announced by the previous government the night before the commencement of caretaker mode prior to the last election. I do not think that that is good enough. In my view it showed a contemptuous—or, at least, a cavalier—disregard for the community pharmacy sector. There is no sense in robbing Peter to pay Paul in trying to minimise the cost of the PBS by putting community pharmacies under further strain. I have stated the figures: annual household income rose 118 per cent from 1991 to 2012, and medical and hospital services costs have risen 191 per cent in the same period; but the cost of pharmaceutical products rose only 58 per cent. Technological advances and generic medicines have of course been important in driving prices down, but this bill will cause a shock to community pharmacies and a sudden drop in their income.


I will later be moving an amendment to this bill to require the government to table a financial impact statement detailing the costs and benefits to the Commonwealth, to approved pharmacists and to consumers if any other day than 1 April or 1 October is prescribed for the bill's coming into effect. I believe that the date changes in the amendment will encourage further consultation before any further changes are made to the disclosure cycle. While the date changes proposed in the amendment do not address all the concerns of community pharmacists, I believe they would give them greater warning of changes if any were made to the cycle.


Ultimately the amendment is not about stopping price disclosure—and nor should it be—or about increasing the regulatory burden on government or, in a sense, on pharmacists. It is only about ensuring that proper consultation and research take place before the price disclosure cycle in the bill is changed. I do not believe that the amendment will add an unfair burden; instead it is an insurance policy against further strain on a very important part of our health sector.


The changes in this bill are bad news for community pharmacies. Ultimately they will be bad news for consumers if we see more average, typical pharmacies hit the wall or need to shed staff, as I believe they will, in order to cope with a $50,000 drop in income. It will be disastrous. It will mean fewer staff and less expertise when people want assistance with their medication. There is a pharmacy model under which pharmacies run a bit like supermarkets: with very little service. That sort of model concerns me. I think there is a compelling reason for the traditional pharmacy model, under which you get the advice you need from your pharmacist and from highly trained and skilled pharmacy staff so that you take the appropriate medication rather than a mix of medication which could cause adverse effects.


My questions to the government therefore are: what will the actual drop in income be in terms of this accelerated price disclosure? What modelling has the government undertaken of what the potential impact will be on community pharmacies? Has it considered the employment effects on community pharmacies by just bringing forward these changes so suddenly? Does the government concede that in terms of previous community pharmacy agreements this goes outside if not the letter of those community pharmacy agreements, then clearly against the spirit of those community pharmacy agreements? Has the government considered how many pharmacies are under strain in our current system and has it considered the representations that there could be up to a thousand pharmacies that could be pushed over the edge as a result of these changes? These are fundamental questions; I am hoping that they can be answered in the committee stages of this bill.

"Nash, Sen Fiona",Nats,2014-03-05,"



Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Health) (10:05):  I take this opportunity to thank senators for their contribution to this debate, in particular this morning: Senator McLucas, Senator Di Natale and Senator Xenophon. I can assure you that this government understands the very real interest that senators and Australians in general have for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Australians rely on the great work done by this country's network of community pharmacies for access to the medicines they need. We also rely on other groups right across the pharmaceutical supply chain, from the pharmaceutical companies to wholesalers, who all work together with government to deliver timely access to medicines at a cost individuals and the community can afford.


Australians want and expect a world-class health system, and we want it for them. The PBS is a key part of that health system. It is world class and it is a major government investment in the health of Australians, but that investment needs to be sustainable. The PBS currently costs about $9 billion per year. We have heard over past months that there was negative growth in the PBS in 2012-13 compared with the previous year. I am pleased to see the pricing policy introduced by the Howard government in 2007 is working to maintain the system. However, we must not lose sight of the fact that prior to this average growth in the PBS was nine per cent and over the longer term is expected to rise to between four and five per cent annually. This reflects that we have a growing ageing population with an increasing incidence of chronic disease, and Australians have higher expectations for access to new, innovative and expensive medicines in the future. The bottom line is the PBS will only continue to remain sustainable if we manage it responsibly. This bill is part of that responsible management, particularly in the tight fiscal environment that we face.


The government is taking seriously the future of Australia's budget. In 2007, Labor inherited a $20 billion surplus. In 2013, we inherited a projected $30 billion deficit. At the time this price disclosure measure was announced by the former government in August 2013, the savings of $835 million had already been factored into the budget and forward estimates for the PBS and for the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The current budget situation means we need to proceed with this change. Not implementing simplified price disclosure would require the government to find almost a billion dollars in savings from other programs.


The amendments in this bill will streamline the operation of PBS price disclosure policy. The current arrangements will be simplified, and price disclosure cycles and data collection periods will be shorter. Disclosed prices will be calculated more frequently, and price reductions will apply sooner. This more incremental approach to price changes will deliver savings and better value for money for PBS medicines, whether that is via the amount paid as government subsidies or as prices paid by individuals. It will also mean that the price the government and consumers pay will more closely reflect the market price for PBS medicines.


Price disclosure was introduced by the Howard government in 2007. It was a fundamental reform and is now an established part of supplying and dispensing medicines under the PBS. It is accepted as a fair and equitable pricing mechanism, which fits well with the aims of the PBS, and we remain committed to it. Under price disclosure, the price of a PBS medicine is adjusted to reflect discounting in the market. This approach allows market forces and competition to steer the PBS price rather than the price being set by the government.


The PBS price is reduced to a weighted average rather than the lowest price in the market, and the price is only reduced if the weighted average is at least 10 per cent lower than the PBS price to which it is compared. This approach allows suppliers of PBS medicines, including generic companies, to continue to compete in the market. It leaves room for further discounting and avoids threatening continuity of supply. It protects low-volume, high-need medicines when there is little competition in the market. It also reduces the risk of essential drugs being withdrawn from the Australian market.


All these features are retained under simplified price disclosure. The aim is not to reduce prices below the amount they would have reached under the current arrangements; the aim is to simplify the process and allow PBS prices to be adjusted more quickly. Under simplified price disclosure, the cycles will be 12 months long rather than 18 months. The rolling 12-month cycles will consist of six months of data collection followed by the current six months of price calculations, advance notice of new prices and any dispute resolution which are a feature of the current system. The changes in this bill are also a small step in reducing regulatory burden, because they will reduce complexity in administration for business.


I acknowledge that some sectors have been strongly opposed to the simplified price disclosure changes. I am aware from representations from pharmacists that they are worried these changes will impact on the viability of their businesses. Some are also worried that they will not be able to provide some add-on services that were being cross-subsidised by the discounting on PBS medicines. The government has said before that it wants to champion the viability of companies along the PBS supply chain and to partner with them to pursue the efficient delivery of health outcomes. The government is also committed to bringing the budget back under control. We recognise that policies which drive value for money for the PBS need to capture the benefits of competition and efficiency in ways that build business confidence along the pharmaceutical supply chain. It is also important the policies do not unduly impact upon one part of the sector significantly more than others. Price disclosure is designed to strike a balance for all stakeholders, including government.


Price disclosure was introduced to improve PBS pricing policy and the value achieved for PBS subsidies. The changes in this bill refine the application of that policy and support that aim. Simplified price disclosure is not designed to increase the magnitude of reductions to PBS prices. Rather, it is about translating discounting in the market into PBS prices sooner. The amendments in the bill will help to ensure that the government and consumers do not pay higher prices than they should for longer than they should. Implementing simplified price disclosure will deliver savings for consumers via decreased prescription costs. It will reduce PBS expenditure for taxpayers and also assist with the listing of new and innovative medicines. It will also provide greater confidence that multiple-brand medicines are delivering value for money for the PBS. Again I thank senators for their contribution to the debate on this bill.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:15):  Bingo! If you change the time frame, that makes all the difference. The complaint of these pharmacists is not about price disclosure per se but about the fact that they cannot adjust in time. They are having to make significant adjustments to their businesses, their community pharmacies, because of the price disclosure being truncated in this way. That is what is causing significant hardship. They are having to change their business models and restructure staffing. These are some of the issues.


The next question is: what will the additional savings of this accelerated price disclosure—I think the government refers to it as a 'simplified price disclosure'—be compared to what was in place prior to the changes announced by the former government on the eve of the caretaker mode coming in?

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Health) (10:16):  I do understand the concerns out there in the community. Coming from a rural and regional area myself, I have been well aware of the concerns. I concur with others who have raised the issue around the lack of consultation under the previous government. That is not something that this government intend to mirror. Indeed, our approach will be entirely different. Senators have raised the fact that under the previous government this legislation was introduced just before we moved into caretaker mode, with almost no consultation. I understand the very real difficulties that were created under those arrangements.


In terms of the timing, though, Senator Xenophon, it has been very clearly known by those in the sector since last August that we were moving towards this legislation. I would also indicate to Senator Xenophon that the initial impact from this legislation will not occur until October this year. So, while I do understand the concerns, I would not like there to be a misconception that the impact of this legislation is going to be immediate. I am very cognisant of the concerns that have been raised by the community pharmacy sector, but I will point out that October will be the point in time when this legislation will have an impact on those pharmacies.


In relation to Senator Xenophon's question regarding savings, while there are savings for the government of $835 million over the forward estimates, as we have discussed, I suspect the question was more on the impact on pharmacies through reduced income. My understanding is that the guild modelling suggests it will be around $30,000 per annum. My understanding is also that government modelling broadly reflects that. I think perhaps some of the confusion around the figures related to the funding for this is that some figures are for over the life of simplifying the price disclosure. But when you look at the impact just from this legislation, as I understand it, the guild says it will be around $30,000 a year.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:18):  Just in response to that, firstly, the government say that there was a lack of consultation on the part of the previous government in their negotiations with pharmacists. But what I do not understand is that if they say that the process was flawed—that is the allegation made by the government about the previous government—why are they going through with these changes? I do not understand that. I make that as an observation and, if the government want to respond, so be it. The fact that there is an average $30,000 shortfall—and the Pharmacy Guild indicated to me a $149 million shortfall for community pharmacies as a result of this accelerated disclosure—would mean that for many average pharmacies that reduction in income would be in the order of $50,000 per annum.


My question to the government is: has any modelling been done about the potential effects on employment and service delivery of such a significant diminution in income over that much shorter period?

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Health) (10:20):  I do not think that I indicated to the chamber that the process was flawed. The process of consultation, we believe, was flawed, and there could have been more timely consultation provided by the previous government.


The previous government had already factored the $835 million worth of savings into the forward estimates. What we were up against coming to this legislation was that that had already been done. I think the Australian people clearly understand the very difficult economic circumstances which the nation is in. We had to take into account the fact that the previous government had factored in $835 million worth of savings, and we had to take that fact into account. We will take a different approach to consultation. On our coming to government there were very comprehensive consultations done with the stakeholders by the government.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:21):  It seems clear that, while the price of medical and hospital services rose 191 per cent from 1991 to 2012—that is, over a 21 year period—the cost of pharmaceutical products rose 58 per cent: a much smaller price rise. The concern is that community pharmacies, when compared to other health service sectors, have unfairly borne the brunt of cost savings, and the concern of community pharmacies is that they seem to be a soft target for successive governments.


We know from the Senate inquiry into chemotherapy drugs—docetaxel in particular, in which Senator Di Natale had a very strong interest—that if, with changes to price disclosure legislation, you muck the method of payment around and have a sudden, sharp shock in the form of a reduction in income for pharmacies, pharmacies are put in an untenable and unsustainable situation. The fear I have is that up to 1,000 pharmacies in this country could hit the wall as a result of the accelerated price disclosure provisions in the bill.


The questions are: is the government aware of any modelling on whether the changes in the bill will mean that some pharmacies will have to close their doors or shed staff and therefore reduce their service levels? Does the government concede that the cost of pharmaceutical products appears to have risen 58 per cent in a 21-year period compared to a 191 per cent rise in the cost of medical and hospital services? Is the burden being unfairly placed on the community pharmacy sector rather than on other parts of the health sector?

I am not in any way saying that what you are alluding to may not be correct, but I think it is useful to point out that there has not been no decrease in the number of pharmacies; in fact, I think there has indeed been a slight increase.


No, there has not been specific modelling done, as I understand it. But I think it is also useful to the Senate to place on record some of the facts around the potential increases to pharmacies, which are on average around $71,500 per annum. That includes: $16,000 per annum for increased prescription volumes; an estimated $14,000 per pharmacy from high-cost listings from 2014-15 alone; and $21,000 per annum in funding the Premium Free Dispensing Initiative. I would also point out to the Senate that the dispensing fees that are in place at the moment and other fees are not impacted on by this piece of legislation. Indeed, I think there is around $13.8 billion worth that goes to those dispensing fees and the other fees.

Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Health) (10:25):  I indicate to the chamber, to provide some clarity, that it is not a saving. The legislation is simply shortening the time frame and bringing forward, from an 18-month period to a 12-month period, when those impacts would occur. I think it is very important for senators to be clear that this is a time frame issue—that these impacts were going to occur anyway under simplified price disclosure. They are now happening in a shorter time frame, with the reduction to 12 months under the legislation.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (10:26):  I will not take this any further, other than to restate the position that this simplified price disclosure or accelerated price disclosure is actually going to make it more difficult for a number of pharmacies to adjust—because the time period has been truncated. Whenever you bring in any reforms or changes such as this, it is about how you implement it, it is the transitional arrangements, and what the community pharmacists have said to me is that, in good faith, they negotiated an agreement for price disclosure but not for accelerated price disclosure on these terms. I will not take it any further. I understand the minister's position on behalf of the government. I move the amendment on sheet 7459 revised:


(1) Schedule 1, item 2, page 3 (after line 13), after subsection 99ADH(2), insert:


(2A) For the purposes of the Legislative Instruments Act 2003, the explanatory statement in relation to a determination under paragraph (1)(aa) of this section must include a statement of the financial impact of the determination, including an analysis of the costs and benefits of the determination to the Commonwealth, approved pharmacists and consumers.


The aim of this amendment is to ensure greater consultation and disclosure when changes are made to price disclosure cycles. The amendment applies to subsection 99ADH(2b) in the bill, which allows a day other than 1 April or 1 October to be prescribed. The amendment requires, when another day is prescribed, that the government must present a statement of the financial impact of the determination, including an analysis of the costs and benefits of the determination to the Commonwealth, approved pharmacists and consumers. 


I have consulted with the Pharmacy Guild on this amendment. Their primary concern is not the principle of price disclosure but the way it has been implemented with so little consultation. This amendment will ensure that consultation.


I am grateful for the work of the office of the Minister for Health, the Hon. Peter Dutton, and his adviser, Mr Simpson. They have been very helpful in providing information to me and having a discussion about this. I will wait for the minister's response, but I think that the neatest and best way of ensuring consultation is via this amendment. I look forward to the minister's response.

I do appreciate Senator Xenophon's very real concerns in this area. Regarding the transparency and information that is requested, all the parameters to calculate the financial impact of the simplified price disclosure are already publicly available, primarily in two ways. Firstly, a legislative instrument will be tabled every six months to allow the price changes to take effect. The instrument will include the full list of the medications subject to price disclosure, the form of the drug, the adjusted price and the percentage reduction. Secondly, concurrently, the department releases information on its website with a summary of the changes to ensure that consumers are aware of the expected price reductions. This is usually accompanied by a media release. The government believes that the appropriate arrangements are in place in terms of information and transparency and, as I said, will not be supporting the amendment.

There was material on the website to reflect the feedback from the industry, and those consultations were used to inform the regulations that were developed in support of the legislative change.

There seems to have been a gradual but continual cutting of the revenue that community pharmacies get. In respect of that, is the government concerned about the long-term viability of community pharmacies, particularly in regional Australia? Will there be any ongoing dialogue that goes beyond this specific aspect of price disclosure, and goes to the viability of community pharmacies, in acknowledgement of the role they play in providing assistance and service to communities, particularly in regional Australia, in dispensing medicine and providing general medical advice?

There is commentary in there for senior health economists that indicates the figures that have been arrived at by the Pharmacy Guild are not agreed with by everybody. I think this is a contested space.


I acknowledge the view of the Pharmacy Guild but I would like to put on the record that I think we need to balance that view with the principle that we need to pay the right price—not too much and not too little—for pharmaceuticals in this country. We are purchasing those pharmaceuticals on behalf of the taxpayers of our country. We have to get the right price that ensures we have a viable, strong community pharmacy sector, particularly for regional Australia, but we have to make sure that we are paying the right price for pharmaceuticals.


I also think it is a bit disingenuous for the assistant minister to say that this is all the Labor Party's fault. You are the government now. It is your decision and you have to own it. To blame Labor is just not good enough. This is legislation that you are introducing into this chamber, so to blame Labor for this is frankly just a bit unfair.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2014-03-05,"



Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland) (09:31):  This is a bill that implements a change that Labor announced in August last year. It goes to the question of price disclosure for the way that the government purchases pharmaceuticals and the interaction between the manufacturers and pharmacies in our country. Price disclosure started in 2007 under the Howard government. The purpose then was to ensure that the government received price reductions when generic medicines were listed on the PBS schedule. It was further refined and extended in 2010 with an expanded and accelerated price disclosure program, which expanded the types of medicine that were included in schedule and it also reduced the cycle of data collection to 18 months. This bill today reduces the price disclosure cycle from 18 months to 12 months. It reduces the amount of time between when a company advises the price reduction of a drug and when the government starts paying that reduced cost. It is expected that this bill will save $835 million over three years and for that reason, of course, Labor will be supporting it.


In government we used the $1.9 billion that was saved through the measures that we introduced to make investments in health that delivered benefits to all Australians. Labor built more than 25 regional integrated cancer centres through an investment of $656 million—centres that are providing support to Australians in regional areas. Those patients were previously required to travel long distances over a long time to receive their treatment, but now can be provided with great services in regional centres. We invested a record $3.5 billion in medical research from 2008. This provided the record levels of National Health and Medical Research Council grants of $771 million in 2013, supporting over 8,500 researchers at more than 80 hospitals, medical research institutes and universities. The Health and Hospitals Fund also delivered $700 million to build and upgrade medical facilities right across the country, a fund that the coalition did not support in opposition and a fund we are unlikely to see again under this government. Labor's record in health, when in government, was one of reform and investment and one of which we are particularly proud.


With health costs increasing over time it does make sense to implement this change. What is important is to make sure that this money is reinvested into the health system. The shadow minister, Catherine King, in the other place urged the government to make sure that this money—this $835 million—is reinvested into health. The money, we believe, should be reinvested into the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, not used to prop up government coffers. We as Australians can be particularly proud of our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. It is a scheme that has been operating, as we know, for many years now and it is one that is the envy of the Western world. It is a scheme that provides equitable access to pharmaceuticals in this country and at the best price possible for a nation of our size and of our population.


We wait with great interest to see what the government will actually do when it comes to the health portfolio. Minister Dutton has, in our view, very little vision for health other than finding savings for the Prime Minister. Despite consistently saying and promising not to cut money from the health budget, the government has already ripped $100 million from the Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital. We have seen the abolition of the Alcohol and Other Drugs Council, a body that has existed for over 50 years and has provided good research and advice to government about how to better manage the scourge of drugs and that misuse of alcohol in our community. The government has already backflipped on the promise not to close any of our Medicare Locals. Unfortunately, it has also abolished the expert advisory panel on the marketing of infant formula. Frankly, this government is not interested in getting accurate information about these significant aspects of health policy. Then we have seen the debacle of the pulling down of the health star-rating website, a website designed to provide good information to consumers and also to food manufacturers about the products that they make and use. 


I acknowledge the view of the Pharmacy Guild, but we need to balance that view with the need to ensure that we are paying the right price—the right price, and not too much, not too little—for the pharmaceuticals that are purchased with taxpayers' money. The current government when in opposition was somewhat disingenuous, in our view, by whispering to pharmacists that it would not proceed with simplified price disclosure. On coming to government, it conceded that this policy was good policy, but I daresay it already knew this in opposition. The policy ensures that taxpayers pay the right price for pharmaceuticals. I urge the government to ensure that the savings are reinvested into the PBS for the benefit of all Australians. I can indicate to the chamber that Labor will be supporting this amendment to the national health legislation.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,0,2
"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2014-03-05,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria) (09:38):  I rise to support this bill. Price disclosure is a very important and effective mechanism in ensuring that the cost of pharmaceuticals on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is kept affordable, both for individuals who access those drugs and for the health budget. It is a sensible measure and it is an important measure. Reducing the threshold from 18 months to 12 months makes perfect sense—in fact, some people would argue that there is no good reason that threshold could not be lowered even further. This is a very important step in ensuring that continued sustainability of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. It is going to save $835 million and what that money does is to give people access to new drugs, to drugs that would not otherwise be listed and to new services that otherwise would be unavailable. The Greens certainly support this reform.


The bill does arrive at a time when we are having a fierce debate about the future of Australia's health system. We heard talk in the lead-up to the election of a budget emergency, and we saw the establishment of the Commission of Audit who were charged with looking for inefficient spending and for savings that could be made to the bottom line of the budget. The Greens have had concerns about the Commission of Audit inquiry, and that is why we moved to have a Senate probe into the work of the commission. What we have learnt through that process is that 'everything is on the table', in the words of the commissioner. We have been told that health is one area where savings must be made. We have had the proposal of a co-payment to access GP services mooted. We heard the Minister for Health invite an open and public debate on that issue. We heard from the AMA that $400 million has been withdrawn from the nation's public hospital system. We have seen defunding of the Alcohol and Other Drugs Council on the premise that its role is being duplicated by other agencies. We now know that, in fact, many of the functions of that council were stand-alone and have now been lost.


We saw the dismantling of the star rating website on foods. This has been part of a worrying trend of secrecy in this government. One of the concerns is not just that the process for the dismantling of that website was secretive—and there still remain some serious questions about that—but the very act of denying individuals, consumers, ordinary citizens access to information about the food they eat is, at its heart, a very secretive policy position. Surely there is nothing wrong with open, transparent and honest government, in the words of the Prime Minister. That should also apply to ensuring that people have open and honest information about the foods they eat.


We have seen all of those things in the context of a debate in which it has been said that we cannot continue to have the health system that we currently enjoy, that health spending is unsustainable and out of control and that we need to make deep cuts to health. I think that proposition needs to be examined. Firstly, we spend as a proportion of our GDP about nine per cent on health care. That compares very favourably with other nations that have similar levels of economic development. In fact, when we look at the United States' health system, we see a country spending twice what we spend and yet which has much poorer health outcomes and a much less fair health system.


Health spending is projected to increase by a per cent or so over the next decade—from nine per cent to 10 per cent of GDP. But if economic growth is not to serve the health of its citizens then why on earth do we strive for it? The whole point of an economy that is strong and delivers economic growth, surely, should be to ensure that we are able to carry out what is really one of the primary responsibilities of government—that is, delivering good health care to all of its citizens.


Our health system does very well on that front. It is efficient. Most of the increase in spending is because we have new, exciting, life-saving health technologies. That is hardly a crisis. In fact, it is the precise opposite. Most countries around the world strive to have the challenges that we have in health—that is, to fund new technology that will deliver people longer lives, better quality lives and healthier lives. That is not a crisis; that is a wonderful opportunity, and we should be doing everything we can to meet that challenge.


Of course we can look for savings in health, but first let's look elsewhere. We hear about the government's statement that we are now at the end of the era of entitlement—




Senator Xenophon:
  The age of entitlement.




Senator DI NATALE:
  the age of entitlement—thank you, Senator Xenophon; how could I forget?—and that corporate welfare is now over. Let us ensure that we match that rhetoric with action. Let us end the huge subsidies that are given to the fossil fuel industry, for example, in an era of catastrophic climate change. Why do we continue to subsidise the mining industry with things like the diesel fuel rebate to the tune of billions of dollars?


Let us look at other areas where large corporations are the beneficiaries of government largesse. We heard the Prime Minister talk about his support of the forestry industry only last night when in my state of Victoria the forestry industry is a basket case. It is propped up by government support, and if it were a private company, it would have been wrapped up many years ago. It is the epitome of corporate welfare and it is an industry that does rely on government handouts.


So let us look at those areas before we start looking at health because most Australians consistently regard health as the most important area of government expenditure. In essence, if a government cannot provide decent health care for its people, cannot give kids a decent education and cannot look after the environment, then I am not sure what we are doing here.


Of course there are some savings to be made in health care. We have talked about this bill, which goes some way to addressing some cost savings through the PBS. There are other potential savings through the PBS. We have heard about the potential for the increased use of generic drugs, for example, and incentives to ensure that people are opting for cheaper generic drugs which are doing exactly the same thing as their branded equivalent. So let us look at providing more incentives in the system to ensure that generic drugs are prescribed at a higher frequency. Let us look at the way we negotiate prices for medicines and examine the potential for reducing the total budget of the PBS by looking at some models overseas and learning from those.


Let us ensure that we do the opposite of what is being proposed through the GP co-payment, which is driving people away from hospitals into primary care. Let us do that rather than doing what is proposed, which is putting a disincentive for people to access their GP. It goes precisely in the opposite direction of all public policy in health care that we have seen over the past few decades. We should be making sure that people are accessing primary care ahead of much more expensive hospital services, and to do anything that compromises that important objective is to raise costs in health.


Let us try and get better coordination of the system. Let us ensure that we have our primary care system, our hospitals and our allied health network working better together, and Medicare Locals provide an opportunity to do that. And let us ensure that we protect Medicare. Some of the changes that have been proposed, such as the GP co-payment and the current initiative to allow private health insurers to insure services delivered through general practice, are some very significant nails in the coffin of Medicare.


We have to do everything we can to protect Medicare, build it up and continue creating more access to it—because we know it is a very effective way of keeping healthcare costs down through a single public insurer and a very fair way of delivering health services—rather than what we are doing at the moment which looks like an attempt to tear up some of the most fundamental pillars of our public health system and Medicare.


We are at a crossroads in health care. We have an opportunity here to protect and build upon one of the world's great health systems. But we are equally in a position where we may start to see some of the most effective tools for delivering health care dismantled as a result of some of the proposals that have been suggested through the Commission of Audit. I am very worried about it. We need only look to the US to see a health system that is based on a user-pays model where there are a number of competing private health insurers delivering the bulk of health services rather than a single public insurer. We only need to look to the US to know what that leads to. It leads to spiralling health costs, people who are no longer able to afford health care and a two-tiered health system. That is not what the Australian health system was designed to be. It was designed to provide decent health care to everybody, regardless of their ability to pay for it.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (09:50):  I want to express my very serious concerns in relation to this bill. Price disclosure is important. It is important for consumers. It is important for transparency. I am very supportive of price disclosure. I believe it is a very important part of managing the PBS, which costs taxpayers some $9 billion each year but is an essential part of our health system. I agree in part with Senator Di Natale that we do not want to go down the US path where they are having a huge debate about Obamacare. It is referred to as 'socialised medicine' when in fact it is not even Medicare-lite, in many respects.


I am deeply concerned about how this policy of price disclosure has been implemented. I believe that the 5,500 community pharmacies in this country have been absolutely dudded by the previous government and unfortunately by this government as well. Last year we saw concerns raised by some pharmacists about price disclosure relating to chemotherapy drugs, because that price reduction was implemented with little or no consultation with or warning to them. The consequences of that were dire, causing great uncertainty and distress to many chemotherapy patients and creating genuine hardship for pharmacies. We heard evidence from some pharmacies in regional Australia that they were basically having to close down their provision of those vital chemotherapy drugs and patients had to go 100 kilometres, 200 kilometres or more away to get them. That was just cruel.


I was very grateful for the work that I did with a number of my colleagues on the Senate committee that I was part of instigating in relation to that. In particular, Senator Dean Smith and Senator Concetta Fierravanti-Wells took a real interest in that. Also, Senator Siewert and Senator Moore were part of that. What was clear from that Senate inquiry was that there needed to be greater consultation. There needed to be a fair system of implementing price disclosure, because you can have all sorts of unintended and cruel consequences if you do not get the policy right.


We are now seeing the same thing happen again, as the price disclosure cycle is shortened from some 18 months to 12 months or even shorter than that. Price disclosure commenced in late 2007 and has been part of the community pharmacy agreement since. However, accelerated price disclosure is not part of the agreement. This legislation is to change this. The Pharmacy Guild, which I have been speaking to in respect of this, would like to go back to the original agreement. And why shouldn't they? A deal was done. That deal should have been stuck to. The previous government changed it. This government is implementing those changes. That is wrong.


Every pharmacist I have spoken to, including representatives from the Pharmacy Guild, have expressed their support for the price disclosure policy. But they have all said that the lack of warning and consultation has not given them time to prepare or plan for an even more significant reduction in their income. Let's put this into perspective. One pharmacist who wrote to me estimated that the shortened time period would have an impact of at least $32,000 per annum on their bottom line. That is in addition to the existing $56,000 per annum reduction from price disclosure. Pharmacy Guild representatives I spoke to just this morning indicate that the income for the average pharmacy could be reduced by around another $50,000 a year; that is on top of the $50,000 per annum they are already losing. There are about 60,000 people employed in community pharmacies. If you are a pharmacist, you are essentially a small business in difficult economic circumstances and that $50,000 could mean laying off one or two part-time employees—employees you have spent a lot of money training, employees with great skills in dealing with customers who have myriad medical problems. I dread to think of the impact on employment in this sector as a result of this lack of consultation and this sudden and draconian drop in income for community pharmacies.


The pharmacist who wrote to me expecting a $32,000 drop in his income is actually supportive of the policy, but he just wants more warning so that he can prepare his business for change. Community pharmacies play a vital role in our health system. There is no question about that. Senator Di Natale was talking about preventative health, and he is absolutely right: let's stop people getting sick in the first place and stop them ending up in hospital at enormous cost to the community and the additional trauma to themselves. Pharmacists are trying to provide support and advice to members of their community. Relatively recent changes in legislation have given them the ability to write prescriptions for some medication; they also help to reduce the strain on GPs and emergency rooms by providing basic medical advice. I have two cousins who are community pharmacists, and they tell me what it is like to run their business and about their travails. They take great pride in what they do and in training their staff to incredibly high standards in order to provide that service to the community. 


While shorter price reduction cycles may save the PBS money in the short term, pushing community pharmacists out of business will only cause this delicate ecosystem of health care to break down. The Pharmacy Guild representative I spoke to a few minutes ago is someone I have great regard for. His information has always been accurate and, unfortunately, I believe his latest information is also accurate. According to him, there are in the order of 5,500 community pharmacies and 10 per cent of them are quite marginal—they are either in receivership or facing serious difficulties in trading. His fear is that, if this government implements this ill-considered policy from the former government, it could push up to 20 per cent of pharmacies over the edge. That is over 1,000 pharmacies. It would mean double the loss of this accelerated process and it would mean that many pharmacies would see $50,000 wiped off their bottom line. They are not saying that they do not want to do it; they just want time to adjust. We are talking about industries around the country that are under enormous pressure, and they just need time to adjust. Even the Productivity Commission has acknowledged that in relation to the manufacturing sector; it is about the transition. That is why this piece of legislation is so wrong—not in respect of the price disclosure but about the transition.


It is worth noting that, while medium annual household income rose 118 per cent between 1991 and 2012, the cost of pharmaceutical products rose by 58 per cent. By comparison, medical and hospital services rose 191 per cent. So, in relative terms, community pharmacies have been given a raw deal. They are the poor cousins of the health system, and their ever-diminishing income is, quite frankly, unsustainable. What will the impact be of up to 1,000 pharmacies closing down through accelerated price disclosure? That is a very real concern to me. What will the impact be on regional communities if their local pharmacy closes down and residents have to travel another 10, 20, 30 or 50 kilometres down the road to get access to basic medicines?


The purpose of the community pharmacy agreement is to provide community pharmacists with financial certainty over the longer term. Although pharmacists are offering a service, they still have to run a business. They have to stock their pharmacy. They have to pay the rent. They have to train and pay highly skilled staff. A community pharmacy is a type of small business which does not rely just on its skills and advice and business acumen; it is also at the mercy of regulatory changes. Some changes, such as those in this bill, are poorly thought out, and these changes will be poorly implemented because you are not giving community pharmacies enough time to adjust.


The recent changes to price disclosure implementation have undermined certainty. The questions I have for the minister, which must be answered during the committee stages of this bill, are as follows. What consultation has there been with the community pharmacy sector? What are the proposed savings from the extra price disclosure? My understanding is that it is in the order of $149 million a year. If that is the case, what will be the drop in income for average, typical pharmacies—taking into account that some pharmacies are very small, niche businesses which are attached to a medical clinic or a doctor's rooms? Will it be in the order of $50,000 per annum, an accelerated drop in income which could have disastrous consequences for the viability of community pharmacies?


Mr Temporary Chairman Sterle, I know that as a senator for Western Australia you are very familiar with Broome. I do not know how many pharmacies there are in Broome, and I know that you cannot respond because you are in the chair. But I wonder what impact the changes in this bill will have in, for instance, the wonderful town of Broome. I think there might be about three pharmacies in Broome. I wonder whether any of them will be under pressure as a result of the changes in this bill.


So that there is no mistaking that my criticism of the proposals in this bill is bipartisan, I point out that the proposals were announced by the previous government the night before the commencement of caretaker mode prior to the last election. I do not think that that is good enough. In my view it showed a contemptuous—or, at least, a cavalier—disregard for the community pharmacy sector. There is no sense in robbing Peter to pay Paul in trying to minimise the cost of the PBS by putting community pharmacies under further strain. I have stated the figures: annual household income rose 118 per cent from 1991 to 2012, and medical and hospital services costs have risen 191 per cent in the same period; but the cost of pharmaceutical products rose only 58 per cent. Technological advances and generic medicines have of course been important in driving prices down, but this bill will cause a shock to community pharmacies and a sudden drop in their income.


I will later be moving an amendment to this bill to require the government to table a financial impact statement detailing the costs and benefits to the Commonwealth, to approved pharmacists and to consumers if any other day than 1 April or 1 October is prescribed for the bill's coming into effect. I believe that the date changes in the amendment will encourage further consultation before any further changes are made to the disclosure cycle. While the date changes proposed in the amendment do not address all the concerns of community pharmacists, I believe they would give them greater warning of changes if any were made to the cycle.


Ultimately the amendment is not about stopping price disclosure—and nor should it be—or about increasing the regulatory burden on government or, in a sense, on pharmacists. It is only about ensuring that proper consultation and research take place before the price disclosure cycle in the bill is changed. I do not believe that the amendment will add an unfair burden; instead it is an insurance policy against further strain on a very important part of our health sector.


The changes in this bill are bad news for community pharmacies. Ultimately they will be bad news for consumers if we see more average, typical pharmacies hit the wall or need to shed staff, as I believe they will, in order to cope with a $50,000 drop in income. It will be disastrous. It will mean fewer staff and less expertise when people want assistance with their medication. There is a pharmacy model under which pharmacies run a bit like supermarkets: with very little service. That sort of model concerns me. I think there is a compelling reason for the traditional pharmacy model, under which you get the advice you need from your pharmacist and from highly trained and skilled pharmacy staff so that you take the appropriate medication rather than a mix of medication which could cause adverse effects.


My questions to the government therefore are: what will the actual drop in income be in terms of this accelerated price disclosure? What modelling has the government undertaken of what the potential impact will be on community pharmacies? Has it considered the employment effects on community pharmacies by just bringing forward these changes so suddenly? Does the government concede that in terms of previous community pharmacy agreements this goes outside if not the letter of those community pharmacy agreements, then clearly against the spirit of those community pharmacy agreements? Has the government considered how many pharmacies are under strain in our current system and has it considered the representations that there could be up to a thousand pharmacies that could be pushed over the edge as a result of these changes? These are fundamental questions; I am hoping that they can be answered in the committee stages of this bill.

"Nash, Sen Fiona",Nats,2014-03-05,"



Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Health) (10:05):  I take this opportunity to thank senators for their contribution to this debate, in particular this morning: Senator McLucas, Senator Di Natale and Senator Xenophon. I can assure you that this government understands the very real interest that senators and Australians in general have for the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Australians rely on the great work done by this country's network of community pharmacies for access to the medicines they need. We also rely on other groups right across the pharmaceutical supply chain, from the pharmaceutical companies to wholesalers, who all work together with government to deliver timely access to medicines at a cost individuals and the community can afford.


Australians want and expect a world-class health system, and we want it for them. The PBS is a key part of that health system. It is world class and it is a major government investment in the health of Australians, but that investment needs to be sustainable. The PBS currently costs about $9 billion per year. We have heard over past months that there was negative growth in the PBS in 2012-13 compared with the previous year. I am pleased to see the pricing policy introduced by the Howard government in 2007 is working to maintain the system. However, we must not lose sight of the fact that prior to this average growth in the PBS was nine per cent and over the longer term is expected to rise to between four and five per cent annually. This reflects that we have a growing ageing population with an increasing incidence of chronic disease, and Australians have higher expectations for access to new, innovative and expensive medicines in the future. The bottom line is the PBS will only continue to remain sustainable if we manage it responsibly. This bill is part of that responsible management, particularly in the tight fiscal environment that we face.


The government is taking seriously the future of Australia's budget. In 2007, Labor inherited a $20 billion surplus. In 2013, we inherited a projected $30 billion deficit. At the time this price disclosure measure was announced by the former government in August 2013, the savings of $835 million had already been factored into the budget and forward estimates for the PBS and for the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. The current budget situation means we need to proceed with this change. Not implementing simplified price disclosure would require the government to find almost a billion dollars in savings from other programs.


The amendments in this bill will streamline the operation of PBS price disclosure policy. The current arrangements will be simplified, and price disclosure cycles and data collection periods will be shorter. Disclosed prices will be calculated more frequently, and price reductions will apply sooner. This more incremental approach to price changes will deliver savings and better value for money for PBS medicines, whether that is via the amount paid as government subsidies or as prices paid by individuals. It will also mean that the price the government and consumers pay will more closely reflect the market price for PBS medicines.


Price disclosure was introduced by the Howard government in 2007. It was a fundamental reform and is now an established part of supplying and dispensing medicines under the PBS. It is accepted as a fair and equitable pricing mechanism, which fits well with the aims of the PBS, and we remain committed to it. Under price disclosure, the price of a PBS medicine is adjusted to reflect discounting in the market. This approach allows market forces and competition to steer the PBS price rather than the price being set by the government.


The PBS price is reduced to a weighted average rather than the lowest price in the market, and the price is only reduced if the weighted average is at least 10 per cent lower than the PBS price to which it is compared. This approach allows suppliers of PBS medicines, including generic companies, to continue to compete in the market. It leaves room for further discounting and avoids threatening continuity of supply. It protects low-volume, high-need medicines when there is little competition in the market. It also reduces the risk of essential drugs being withdrawn from the Australian market.


All these features are retained under simplified price disclosure. The aim is not to reduce prices below the amount they would have reached under the current arrangements; the aim is to simplify the process and allow PBS prices to be adjusted more quickly. Under simplified price disclosure, the cycles will be 12 months long rather than 18 months. The rolling 12-month cycles will consist of six months of data collection followed by the current six months of price calculations, advance notice of new prices and any dispute resolution which are a feature of the current system. The changes in this bill are also a small step in reducing regulatory burden, because they will reduce complexity in administration for business.


I acknowledge that some sectors have been strongly opposed to the simplified price disclosure changes. I am aware from representations from pharmacists that they are worried these changes will impact on the viability of their businesses. Some are also worried that they will not be able to provide some add-on services that were being cross-subsidised by the discounting on PBS medicines. The government has said before that it wants to champion the viability of companies along the PBS supply chain and to partner with them to pursue the efficient delivery of health outcomes. The government is also committed to bringing the budget back under control. We recognise that policies which drive value for money for the PBS need to capture the benefits of competition and efficiency in ways that build business confidence along the pharmaceutical supply chain. It is also important the policies do not unduly impact upon one part of the sector significantly more than others. Price disclosure is designed to strike a balance for all stakeholders, including government.


Price disclosure was introduced to improve PBS pricing policy and the value achieved for PBS subsidies. The changes in this bill refine the application of that policy and support that aim. Simplified price disclosure is not designed to increase the magnitude of reductions to PBS prices. Rather, it is about translating discounting in the market into PBS prices sooner. The amendments in the bill will help to ensure that the government and consumers do not pay higher prices than they should for longer than they should. Implementing simplified price disclosure will deliver savings for consumers via decreased prescription costs. It will reduce PBS expenditure for taxpayers and also assist with the listing of new and innovative medicines. It will also provide greater confidence that multiple-brand medicines are delivering value for money for the PBS. Again I thank senators for their contribution to the debate on this bill.


Question agreed to.

"Birmingham, Sen Simon",LP,2014-03-05,"



Senator BIRMINGHAM
 (South Australia—Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Environment) (12:50):  I rise to contribute to this matters of public interest debate on a matter of extreme importance to my home state of South Australia. In just 10 days time, on Saturday, 15 March, South Australia will reach a crossroad—a defining moment for the state's future. It will be a moment in which South Australians will choose whether to continue down the same path—a path that is taking South Australia in the direction of becoming truly a mendicant state, reliant almost entirely upon the largesse of the federal government, upon redistribution of wealth from other states and upon government spending, seeing the continual demise of any sense of industry, private enterprise or job creation in South Australia—or to change direction, to take a new path in which it has a strong and prosperous future, where it works to restore its competitiveness, where it works to again become a productive and innovative state. These are the stark choices that South Australians face on 15 March when the state election is held.


It is perhaps an indictment of the campaigning skills of my party that we have governed in South Australia for only 11 of the last 44 years. We have won only three of the last 13 elections. While these statistics may show that the Labor Party have been better political campaigners, it also demonstrates that the state of affairs in South Australia is the sole responsibility of the Labor Party and that the melee and the rot that have set into the South Australian economy sits firmly at the feet of the Labor Party, who have governed the state in the overwhelming majority of the last four decades.


Let the facts speak for themselves. On an economic front, CommSec's State of the States report released in December last year found South Australia to have the worst economic performance of the mainland states. SA was the fifth state for business investment in terms of economic rankings, and then either sixth or seventh on every other economic performance indicator. Deloitte, in their December 2013 economic growth forecast, found South Australia's potential economic growth for 2014-15 to be the worst of all states. That is not just mainland states but all states. It had a growth rate at half of the national rate.


The Australian Bureau of Statistics, in September 2013, found that South Australia's state final demand contracted by half a per cent in the September quarter. It is the only state to so contract. The South Australian economy, measured by state final demand and net exports, contracted overall by 1.1 per cent in the September quarter. Deloitte, in their December 2013 report, found that in 2012-13 SA was the only state to record a decline in exports. They went on to forecast that exports from South Australia were expected to continue to decline in each of the next two years. The ABS found that spending on mining exploration in South Australia fell by 48 per cent in the 12 months to September 2013. Again, it is the worst result of all the states. Quarterly SA mining exploration spending sits at an eight-year low.


Retail trade, a good sign of where consumer sentiment sits, grew in SA by 1.3 per cent in the last 12 months, as compared to a national increase of 3.2 per cent. Once again, it is the worst result of all the states. This is reflecting itself in population trends as it affects South Australia. SA's population growth of 0.9 per cent in 2012-13 was half of the national growth rate and the lowest on the mainland. Net interstate migration out of SA rose by 78 per cent in 2012-13. Under the current Labor government, in net terms, 34,000 people have left South Australia. They are voting with their feet.


The ABS also found that in the last two years the number of venture capital investee companies in SA decreased by 36 per cent, demonstrating that the future looks rather grim in terms of new innovation and investment. Whilst, on the other side of the ledger, insolvencies in 2013 increased from 394 to 452. That is the highest single figure in 15 years in South Australia. It is an increase of 14.7 per cent in just 12 months. Again, it is the worst of all the states.


NAB, in their small business conditions report of 2013, found that South Australian businesses have the worst business conditions on the mainland, the worst business confidence on the mainland and the weakest cash flows on the mainland. Clearly, the state of the economy in South Australia is in a parlous position and it is something that desperately needs turning around. This reflects itself in jobs, because economic statistics are just statistics. How they play out is in the jobs and economic opportunities for individual people.


In the employment market, South Australia has the sad statistic of having the highest percentage of underemployed workers on mainland Australia. In the year to September 2013, the number of underemployed workers increased by 11,200 or 18 per cent. The state has lost 25,000 full-time jobs since the 2013-14 state budget was released. Just in that period of time, some seven or eight months, there were 1,000 full-time jobs lost according to the ABS in January. South Australia's unemployment rate, at 6.6 per cent, is the highest on the mainland and has been persistently so under this Labor government. They are at 26 per cent, with more South Australians jobless under this government.


South Australia's jobs in total declined by 1.9 per cent last year. That is the worse result of all the states. The youth jobless rate climbed from 34.4 per cent to 36.1 per cent in January of this year. Once again, it is the highest in the mainland states. The national rate stands at 27.8 per cent, for comparison, which is nearly 10 points lower. People are checking out of the labour market because of the dire straits of the economy and the jobs market. South Australia's trend workforce participation rate stands at 61.9 per cent, which is the lowest level it has been for eight years. Again, it shows that South Australians are in some ways giving up hope.


Worse still, despite a tanking economy and a parlous jobs record, South Australians are facing ever escalating cost-of-living pressures. In the 12 years of this Labor government, South Australia's CPI has increased 39 per cent, housing rentals have increased 53 per cent, property charges have gone up 87 per cent, state taxes have gone up 92 per cent, gas bills have gone up 136 per cent, electricity bills have gone up 140 per cent and water bills—thanks to the mismanagement of water investments by the state government—have gone up 227 per cent. South Australians face a situation where they have less chance of getting a job and less chance of earning an income, and yet they have ever increasing costs that they have to bear.


All of this is equally reflected in the mismanagement of the state's budget. We saw a worsening, by some $380 million, in the state's budget position in just 50 days since the mid-year budget update. We see deficits piling up on top of one another—six deficits in seven years. Labor promised in the time that they would deliver $2.6 billion in surpluses. Instead they have delivered $2.9 billion in deficits. Debt has blown out by $14 billion in 2016 and it increased under Labor by $4.1 million a day over the last eight years. Another blow-out of $212 million is forecast for state debt in 2017-18. Interest on that debt will be around $1 million per day by 2017, which is more than the state's entire police budget. Total liabilities will soon exceed $25 billion. All of this debt is mounting up despite the fact that South Australia is the highest taxed state in the nation.


South Australia's workers compensation levy rate sits at 2.75 per cent, compared to a national average of 1.76 per cent. And what do the credit rating agencies have to say about the outlook for South Australia's budget? Standard and Poor's, in September 2013, found 'the budgetary performance to be very weak, debt burden rapidly rising to a sizeable level, and assumptions within the state's budget in recent years were lower than forecasted'. They have downgraded South Australia's rating five times in two years. Moody's found 'the rapid rise in SA's debt burden flags potential deterioration, an economic profile that is weaker than other states, and the government's resolve to implement measures necessary to reverse budget deterioration has diminished in recent years'.


It is indeed a sorry state of affairs. It is little wonder, though, that Labor do not seem capable of turning it around in SA, because the Premier himself does not really seem to know what the problem is. On 20 June 2012 the Premier admitted to the parliament that 'we are a high-cost jurisdiction'. And yet, on 5AA radio during the election campaign just recently, he said: 'Let's get away from this nonsense about South Australia being a high-cost jurisdiction.' Well, the truth is that South Australia is a high-cost jurisdiction and, just as high costs from the Commonwealth have crippled much of the nation's economy, it is those high costs in South Australia that are crippling the South Australian economy and impacting on jobs in SA.


I said at the outset that the state faces a decision point, a crossroads, on 15 March—and indeed it does. The choice is between a government which, Mr Weatherill admits, believes government is the solution and a government under Steven Marshall and the state Liberals which would get government out of the way and restore a level of competitiveness. If elected, Steven Marshall's government will not go ahead with Labor's new car-parking tax which would add another level of tax to the South Australian economy—another $26 million per annum tax to the state's city centre itself. He will implement reforms to our land tax regime—the highest in the nation. He will increase from $316,000 to $400,000 the threshold for land tax and he will decrease from 3.7 per cent to three per cent the peak rate of land tax for properties valued up to $5 million.


Steven Marshall will implement reforms to payroll tax. Currently South Australia's $600,000 payroll tax threshold is the second lowest of all states, meaning payroll tax is paid by many more small businesses in South Australia than in other states. The reforms that the Marshall government, if elected, will implement will result in savings to more than 8,000 businesses, ensuring more than 1,100 businesses will no longer have to pay payroll tax. It will provide savings of up to $9,000 per year to businesses and make South Australia's payroll tax regime, for small businesses with wages of $800,000 per annum or less, more competitive than Victoria, New South Wales and Western Australia and in line with Tasmania and Queensland.


These are just some of the concrete policy proposals that the Marshall Liberal team have put out to provide a very clear point of difference to Labor's high-spending, high-taxing, high-debt, high-waste ways. A Marshall government will be a leaner government, a smaller government, a government of less tax that will set South Australia on a pathway to restore its level of competitiveness, allow it to compete and be productive, and align it with the direction in which the federal government is going to restore business confidence and competitiveness overall. I urge my fellow South Australians to embrace change on 15 March and allow our state to return to its heyday.

Leader of the Opposition in the Senate
) (
14:35
):  Pursuant to contingent notice of motion, I move:



That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent her moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely a motion to give precedence to a motion of censure of the Assistant Minister for Health (Senator Nash)


There is no more serious act—




Honourable senators interjecting
—




The PRESIDENT:  Senator Wong, resume your seat. Order! Senator Wong has moved a motion for the suspension of standing orders. Senator Wong, continue.




Senator WONG:
  There is no more substantive accusation in this chamber than that a minister has misled this chamber. There is no more important issue when you are a minister than accountability to this chamber. And what we are seeking to do is to ensure this chamber properly debates a censure motion on the Assistant Minister for Health, arising out of her misleading of this chamber—her persistent misleading of this chamber—and her failure to comply with an order for production of documents and failure to account for her actions to the Senate.


The fact that the government is not prepared to debate this censure really reflects on the standards that this government has when it comes to ministerial accountability and transparency. In the period of time since this matter first came to light we have been treated to this senator—this minister—coming in to this chamber and repeatedly and persistently misleading it, failing to provide answers to reasonable questions and, today, failing to provide a document which grounds what she says is her compliance with ministerial standards. That is what we are seeing from this minister. It is entirely reasonable for this chamber to debate this censure motion, and it does not reflect well on the Leader of the Government in this place that he did not take this censure motion. He has sought to take the chamber down the path requiring a suspension of standing orders in order to debate this censure motion. I would also say that there is no greater obligation on a minister in this place than to ensure that they do not mislead the chamber. We have given this minister many, many opportunities. I have invited her time and time again to come in here and correct the record.



Honourable senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! I remind honourable senators that if you wish to participate in the debate you will get an opportunity. Senators on both sides are reminded that interjections are disorderly.




Senator WONG:
  We on this side have given this minister many, many opportunities to correct the record, far more than I anticipate those on that side would have given a minister in our government when we were on the benches opposite. For example, yesterday after question time I wrote to the minister, attaching the extracts from the register of lobbyists which demonstrated that her answer was incorrect and inviting her to do what she should do as a minister of the Crown, what she should do according to the principles of ministerial accountability and what she should do under the ministerial standards, which is come into this place and correct the record. That was yesterday after question time—well, she did not do those things. That is simply indicative of this minister's behaviour and attitude towards this chamber. She has repeatedly indicated facts to this chamber which simply are not true.


This is not a question of whether or not Senator Nash is a decent person. This is a question of whether or not she is a decent minister. Over these last weeks, whether in Senate estimates or in question time here, the chamber has been presented with repeated examples of why this minister is not prepared to comply with basic principles of accountability. The Senate chamber has been presented over and over again with examples of this minister not complying with ministerial standards and the principle of accountability to the Senate chamber. It is entirely reasonable that this censure motion be moved, and it is entirely reasonable that it be debated. As I said, it really does reflect on Senator Abetz that he chooses not to take this censure motion for debate, given the enormity of the evidence confronting the government about the failure of this minister and the Prime Minister to uphold the standards that the Australian people expect of ministers in this place. It is entirely reasonable for standing orders to be suspended so that we can debate a censure motion. There have been repeated examples of misleading of the chamber, and the Senate ought to deal with them appropriately.

I would say to the Senate that the reason I have stood 'time and time again' was to ensure that the facts were placed on the table and to ensure that the facts surrounding this issue were brought forward.

A government senator:  Come on girls, give her a crack.



The PRESIDENT:  Order on my left! I asked for Senator Wong to be heard in silence, as I do for any speaker who stands on their feet. Senator Nash is entitled to be heard in silence as well, and that applies to all members of the Senate.




Senator NASH:
  The opposition has been inferring that there was a conflict of interest regarding my former chief of staff and his role in my office. As I have explained to the Senate and to the Senate estimates committee time and time again that there was no conflict of interest, perhaps it might assist senators if I again run through the processes that were put in place to ensure there was no conflict of interest. Every step of the way in this process, with every question that has been asked of me relating to this issue, I have acted in good faith and I have provided to the Senate and the Senate estimates committee the facts. I will again, to assist senators opposite, go through the steps I undertook to ensure there was no conflict of interest regarding the former chief of staff in my office.


I proposed Mr Furnival to my office in a temporary capacity to help with the transition arrangements of my staff. He was initially proposed by me for two months to help set up my office. His role as a former government relations practitioner is on the public record and I was aware of this. I also say to the Senate that there is no rule against somebody who has previously worked in government relations becoming a member of staff. Under the code of conduct for staff, he advised me of his private interests. I put him forward to the government staff committee shortly following the swearing-in. The committee came back to me and indicated I needed to obtain a series of undertakings, which I did. I have outlined those for the Senate previously. I have outlined them for the Senate estimates committee previously.


I refer senators to the Hansard record. Those undertakings have been outlined on several occasions to senators. I say to senators opposite, to be very clear: at the outset of his time of employ with me, my former chief of staff's wife undertook to maintain a series of undertakings in relation to the company. I have put this on the record time and time again, but I will do so again for senators.


Ms Cain undertook that APA would make no representations to me, no representations to Minister Dutton, and no representations to my health department nor indeed to any other minister of the Commonwealth in relation to the health portfolio. That was upheld. We have had several weeks now of questioning from the opposition relating to this matter—the matter being the conflict of interest perceived by them, in the role of my former chief of staff, which does not exist. At no time has any opposition senator provided any evidence to the Senate or to the Senate estimates committee about the existence of a conflict of interest. They have not because there is none. There was no conflict of interest. The appropriate undertakings were put in place. They were adhered to. I invite those opposite to consider the facts. There was no conflict of interest.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (14:48):  I rise today to support the suspension of standing orders so that—



Honourable senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! The same silence that Senator Nash was able to receive should be received by Senator Milne, as well.




Senator MILNE:
  I support the suspension of standing orders because a censure motion is a really serious motion. It is no support for, or defence of, Senator Nash for the government to refuse to take it on. It reinforces to the community that the government have plenty to hide—because they will not engage in the debate on the substantive issue of whether or not there is a case to be answered. Frankly, I find it extraordinary that in this debate it is Senator Nash who has been on her feet—rather than the Leader of the Government, to tell us why he has blocked a debate on such a substantive matter.


We will go to this debate on the substantive matter because the government is allowing the minister to dig a bigger and bigger hole for herself by allowing that to happen. I can tell you this: what we have now—



Government senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  We were going well. If senators wish to participate in the debate there will be an opportunity. Senator Milne is entitled to be heard in silence.




Senator MILNE:
  The point is this: there was originally a denial that there was any association between the chief of staff and the lobbying firm Australian Public Affairs. That was corrected. There clearly is a relationship. In fact, it is a part-ownership of that company. That is the fact of the matter. Secondly, you simply cannot deny a conflict of interest—right up until the day that the chief of staff has resigned—and rely on what the chief of staff's wife has said. It is not the chief of staff's wife who is responsible here; it is the chief of staff and the minister who are responsible here. It is the chief of staff who had to divest under the ministerial staffers' code of conduct.


It is not about getting an undertaking from his wife or partner that they will do this or that. It is about a divestment requirement of the ministerial code of conduct, and that was not adhered to. It is no use trying to protect the minister by running around trying to block a motion to discuss this censure. There will be a debate on the censure. We need to go to this and we need to drop this defence of the minister's chief of staff on the basis of undertakings given by Ms Cain. That is not the point here. The point is that the minister has denied, right up until the end, the conflict of interest, and has given the Senate no explanation as to why the divestment was not required before the person concerned took on the chief-of-staff role.


I am supporting the motion to suspend standing orders because, ultimately, ministerial responsibility has to mean something. And it is clear from the way Prime Minister Tony Abbott's government is operating that they do not believe in ministerial responsibility—whether it is for Minister Morrison, who tries behind the military; or whether, now, it is for Senator Nash, who is trying to hide behind a refusal to debate this. We will debate this. But we will debate this because ministerial responsibility has to mean something in a Westminster system, and the Greens want to make sure that it does.

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (14:52):  I am more than delighted to take on the challenge of Senator Milne to partake in this debate. The simple fact is: there is nothing of substance to the allegations that have been made, day after day, hour after hour, against Senator Nash. The Labor Party have spun their wheels on this issue—



Honourable senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! We have been going fairly well in that the people speaking in this debate have been shown reasonable respect in terms of having silence whilst they are speaking. I ask that that continues.




Senator ABETZ:
  The Labor Party have spun their wheels on this issue in question time, day after day, without traction. They did so hour after hour in Senate estimates as well and got absolutely nowhere. The reason: there is no substance to the case. Sure, they called in Senator Faulkner. Sure, they called in Senator Wong. But I know that when I used to be a counsel—and I am sure Senator Brandis would be able to recollect this as well: no matter how good a counsel you are, if you ain't got a case, you ain't going to win. That is the problem with the prosecution by Senators Wong and Faulkner of this case. There simply is no substance. All the rhetoric in the world simply will not build the case for you—and there is no substance whatsoever.


The Labor Party had a choice. They might have moved to suspend standing orders to fight for Qantas jobs. No. What about manufacturing jobs? No. What about the plight of the drought afflicted farmers in this country? No; they are into the smear as soon as they can get there. Considering the seriousness of this, you would nearly think that somebody had misused their credit card—which reminds me that the Labor Party are bringing this issue of integrity before the Senate when their former national president is languishing in remand awaiting sentencing for gross dishonesty. Mr Thomson, their former member, has been found guilty by a court of law of ripping off low-paid workers. And what is the allegation against Senator Nash in all those circumstances?



Honourable senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order, on both sides! It is not helping the debate when people are interjecting, and interjections are disorderly.



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald! Senator Abetz is entitled to be heard in silence from both sides.




Senator ABETZ:
  The rank transparency of the Leader of the Greens is shown by this. Even if we were to believe everything that Labor, with their exaggerated hyperbole, would have us believe—even if we were to believe all that, why was it that Senator Milne refused to utter a single word when the seat that Senator Johnston now occupies was occupied by one Senator Bob Carr, former Minister for Foreign Affairs, who, throughout the whole 18 months that he was Minister for Foreign Affairs, maintained his shareholding in a lobbying company, RJ Carr Pty Ltd? Where was the moral outrage from the Greens? They were in lock step with the Labor government. They did nothing about ministerial standards when there was a very clear breach. Might I add, the Standard of Ministerial Ethics requires:


… Ministers divest themselves of investments and other interests in any public or private company or business …


Throughout Senator Bob Carr's 18-month reign in this place as foreign minister, Senator Milne stood guiltily silent—a very guilty silence. Why? Because she was in cahoots, maintaining that dysfunctional and disgraceful government on life support. The Australian people have spoken—




Senator Milne:
  Mr President—



Government senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! On my right!




Senator Milne:
  Thank you, Mr President. I do not want to disrupt Senator Abetz's train of thought, but I do want to put on the record that that statement about Senator Carr is the first I have heard of it.



The PRESIDENT:  Order! That is not a point of order; that is a point of debate.



Government senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! I remind those on my right, there needs to be silence. Senator Abetz is entitled to be heard in silence. When there is silence on my right, we will proceed. Senator Abetz has one minute and eight seconds remaining.




Senator ABETZ:
  Thank you, Mr President. Senator Milne has just now confirmed everything that I ever thought about the Greens: ignorance is bliss. That is why they are so happy in that corner. They do not bother reading the Hansards; they do not bother reading the newspapers; they do not bother informing themselves with that which is general knowledge. That way they do not have to make a moral judgement on their alliance partners in the Australian Labor Party. That is why the Australian Greens, of course, voted with Labor to suppress the documents that Senator Fierravanti-Wells wanted to expose in relation to the Craig Thomson matter. I daresay Senator Milne has not heard of Craig Thomson either. You have not heard of Michael Williamson—



Honourable senators interjecting—

Senator ABETZ:
  We have just now been told everything we needed to know about the Greens. Ignorance is bliss. They wallow in ignorance day after day.

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (15:00):  The debate we are having now is to do with the suspension of standing orders, and we have gone nowhere near that issue, which is how this is normally played out in this place. The issue before the chair—



Honourable senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Moore, resume your seat. I remind those on both sides of the chamber that Senator Moore is entitled to be heard in silence.




Senator MOORE:
  The motion before the chair is for a suspension to debate a censure motion. You would not be able to pick that if you were listening to this debate, because that has not come up. We have proposed a censure motion because of a series of issues, one of which is a specific request today for a document relating to undertakings. That document was not brought forward, as is the usual process. We have been told consistently from those on the government side that, because a range of questions have been asked, that should be the end of the debate. We have been told that there is nothing to worry about, that there is no problem, and that we should end the debate. The last several minutes of this debate have not been about the substance of the issues. No, let us not go anywhere near the substance of the issues!


This debate is about whether or not there should be a suspension. We have not had that concluded. What we have had from those on the other side is a series of arguments about other cases. They say that we should not be asking for a suspension to debate this issue, because in other cases—which they have outlined in depth—nothing happened. I am completely confounded about why we go through this process. In trying to get information from the minister, we made a request, as a result of a series of actions by the opposition, for a censure motion to look at the substance of the issue. We have now heard comments from those on the other side about previous cases, along with dismissive comments from Senator Scullion about why people—'girls'—on this side of the chamber should not be involved in the debate.


We are asking for a suspension to allow us to move a motion to debate a censure motion. That is the question before the chair. We seek to continue to ask for information concerning actions in the minister's office. That is the process that we have sought to follow through Senate estimates and through a series of questions in this place to those on the other side—which has often resulted in more information being provided by the minister in dribs and drabs. We put forward a request for documentation yesterday but we did not get the document about which we were concerned. We got an attached letter which I believe said that information could not be shared because of privacy. We need to have those issues fully explained and debated.


As Senator Milne said in her contribution, it is all fine for us to have interchanges in this place, but people in the wider community need to know that issues of trust and ministerial responsibility are taken seriously in this chamber. What we are proposing is that there will be a debate—



Honourable senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Moore, resume your seat. Senators on my right, if you wish to participate in the debate, you may be given an opportunity at a later stage.




Senator MOORE:
  We are now having a discussion about whether we will be able to debate the substance of the issues. I do not understand why the government would not just allow the debate to happen so that we would not have to go through this process a number of times. Look at the core issue; look at what we are talking about in terms of ministerial responsibility and conflict of interest. The issue before the chamber today relates to statements and answers which Senator Nash gave in Senate estimates about the fact that there were undertakings provided. We seek to see the undertakings. Instead of debating that issue, we have to waste the time of everybody in this chamber, we have to waste the time of anyone who is interested in the debate and, most importantly, we have to waste the time of Senator Nash, who—instead of being able to present her arguments—has had to go through a process not on the original issue; rather, it is about whether or not the debate will continue.


We continue to put forward our request for a suspension. I think there is interest in this issue. Certainly, we have seen interest in this issue in the chamber. No-one could say that there is not some interest in getting this information. Let us proceed with the appropriate suspension so that we can have the core debate. (Time expired)

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2014-03-05,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (15:05): A censure motion against a minister is one of the most serious parliamentary procedures there is. Those who listen to this broadcast are entitled to make a judgement based on what Senator Wong had to say and, most particularly, based on the dignified and specific reply that Senator Fiona Nash was able to give. One of the most disgraceful things a member of parliament can do, indeed one of the most disgraceful things a human being can do, is to make allegations of dishonesty or a lack of integrity against another human being and not be able to specify the occasion that gives rise to that allegation. Those who heard Senator Wong's shrill, belligerent speech a few moments ago would have been left wondering what, specifically, is being alleged against Senator Fiona Nash. The answer is that the Labor Party, in their allegations, have been able to point to nothing—



Honourable senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! Senators on my left!




Senator BRANDIS:
  The Labor Party have been able to point to nothing that Senator Nash has not answered comprehensively and in detail. This is about an allegation of conflict of interest and, more particularly, an allegation of conflict of interest affecting the former chief of staff of the minister. As Senator Wong should know, but obviously does not know, there are two ways in which a conflict of interest can be dealt with. The first of those is to remove the occasion of the conflict of interest by divesting oneself of the commercial interest concerned—and that is what Senator Nash required of her former chief of staff, and that is what he did.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator Wong:
  You should show the letter that shows that. You do not know the facts!



The PRESIDENT:  Order! No, we are not going to carry on this debate on across the chamber like that. We will have an orderly debate; we will not have people shouting at each other across the chamber. That is completely disorderly. If you disagree with the views that are being expressed, there are opportunities in the proper processes of this chamber to put your views. Comments should be addressed to the chair.




Senator BRANDIS:
  The allegation is of a conflict of interest. The two ways in which that conflict of interest could have been satisfactorily addressed are by divestment and by undertaking. Both of those courses of action were insisted upon by the minister and both of them were followed by Mr Alastair Furnival.



Honourable senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Brandis is entitled to be heard in silence.




Senator BRANDIS:
  Through you, Mr President, Senator Wong: rest content to spray allegations around with no substance to back them up. And then she refuses to hear Senator Fiona Nash's detailed and specific response to her allegations. So the first course of action—divestment—was followed. The second course of action was to give undertakings that no situation would ever be allowed to arise in which there was a conflict of interest between APA and the role of the minister's chief of staff. Those detailed and specific undertakings were sought by the minister, and they were received from Mr Furnival, and from his wife and from the company; and those undertakings were honoured. The undertakings were honoured, and the divestment took place. Nothing more could have been done or could have been demanded of those concerned to avoid a conflict of interest. And yet Senator Wong chooses to disregard the fact that every one of her allegations has been answered. They were answered today by Senator Nash in her contribution and they have been answered in previous question times. They were answered with specificity in Senate estimates last week.


This chutzpah on stilts, from a person who was a minister in a government maintained in power for the last three years by a criminal, Mr Craig Thomson; and who has enjoyed most of her ministerial career as a member of the political party whose federal president was a criminal, Mr Michael Williamson. So please, Senator Wong, do not come into this chamber and smear an honest, decent, dignified and competent woman when the political party you represent is racked with criminality from the top to the very bottom.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the motion moved by Senator Wong be agreed to.

"Wong, Sen Penny",ALP,2014-03-05,"



Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:19):  I move:



That the Senate censures the Assistant Minister for Health (Senator Nash) for misleading the Senate, failing to comply with an order for the production of documents, and failing to account for her actions to the Senate.


Today we saw the Assistant Minister for Health fail to comply with an order to produce a document that would support her claim to this chamber that her decision-making has not been corrupted by a conflict of interest. Her defiance of the chamber is the latest in a series of acts which warrant censure by this chamber. I say to my colleagues: the Senate needs to pass this censure motion to uphold the ministerial standards the Prime Minister has failed to enforce. I should not need to move this censure motion; the Prime Minister should have acted. But over recent weeks the Senate, the press gallery and the Australian public have been treated with contempt by an Assistant Minister for Health who has an unhealthy tendency to mislead. The minister has failed to account for her actions by answering questions and, when she has answered questions, she has demonstrated, at best, a reckless disregard for the truth.


At the heart of this matter is the failure of the Assistant Minister for Health to explain how an individual with interests in a lobbying firm with food clients came to be appointed as her chief of staff; and her failure to explain how that chief of staff came to order a government health information website to be shut down. I first asked a question about the taking down of the health star rating system website during question time on 11 February, the first sitting day of the year. Rather than providing a full and frank account of the actions taken by herself and by her office, the minister presented a completely fanciful account. She claimed that the website had been inadvertently placed, and that state and territory ministers had decided to conduct a cost-benefit analysis in a more expansive way than had previously been decided, before the voluntary star rating system would proceed. Neither of the minister's claims was true. And, having got off to this bad start, her answers to legitimate questions about this matter have only become more and more evasive, more and more misleading, and more and more untruthful. And this pattern of behaviour culminated earlier today when she failed to comply with the Senate's order to produce the letter—not just any letter, but the letter which she says sets out undertakings from her former chief of staff to address the conflict of interest in her office.


This matter goes to the heart of ministerial responsibilities in our system of government. Ministers are required to exercise their ministerial duties in a disinterested manner—that is, unaffected by bias or irrelevant considerations, including private advantage for others. Ministers are also required to demonstrate that their decisions are made with the sole objective of advancing the public interest, and to explain their actions to the parliament.


The Assistant Minister for Health's principal adviser had interests in a lobbying firm with food industry clients at the same time as he was advising her and acting for her in relation to policy matters affecting the food industry. This minister has failed to demonstrate how she was able to conduct her affairs in a disinterested manner, acting solely in the public interest, when she had a conflict of interest at the heart of her office. Despite admitting that her staff member's direct and family interests in a lobbying firm were known to her, the minister failed to take effective action to require him to divest his shareholding in the relevant businesses. The Assistant Minister for Health has failed to uphold ministerial standards, and the Prime Minister has failed to enforce compliance.


Let me take senators through the facts of the conflict of interest in Senator Nash's office. We know that Mr Furnival was engaged as her chief of staff from 19 September 2013. He was a director and a 50 per cent shareholder of Strategic Issues Management, which wholly owns a lobbying business, Australian Public Affairs. Australian Public Affairs has a number of clients in the food industry, including Mondelez, which owns Kraft; Cadbury; and the Australian Beverages Council, which represents soft drink and fruit juice manufacturers.


This is a textbook example of a conflict of interest. Yet Senator Nash denies and continues to deny that there was anything untoward here. So let me spell it out. The assistant health minister makes decisions which directly affect the commercial interests and the profits of companies in the food industry. While she was making these decisions, her most senior adviser owned a lobbying firm which profited from helping food industry clients get what they wanted out of the government. As I said, this is a textbook example of a conflict of interest. But it is not just a hypothetical example; it is a conflict of interest which has been played out in the real world. And, as we all know, on 5 February, the assistant minister decided to take down the health star rating system website, a website designed to help Australians make healthy food choices. It is an important initiative in the effort to prevent serious health conditions, such as obesity, diabetes and heart disease. Public health experts strongly supported the star rating website. It is a system that was more than two years in the making, and a project agreed to by federal, state and territory governments in December 2011. Yet all it took was one phone call to Senator Nash's office from the Australian Food and Grocery Council. The next thing that happened was the assistant minister's chief of staff instructed her department to take down the website immediately. That is a highly unusual chain of events.


Senate estimates heard evidence of the flurry of four phone calls, late in the afternoon of 5 February, from the minister's office to the department, demanding that the website be taken down. The departmental officer responsible quite properly referred the matter to a deputy secretary in the department. At the same time as the minister was ordering the website be taken down at the behest of the Food and Grocery Council, her most senior adviser had a financial interest in a lobbying firm representing confectionery and food manufacturers. This has undermined confidence in the minister, stakeholders and the wider public. In fact, Australians are entitled to ask whether her title should be changed from Assistant Minister for Health to 'Senator for Snack Foods'.


This erosion of public confidence is exactly why there is an onus on ministers to ensure that there are no real or perceived conflicts of interest in their decision-making. It is a responsibility recognised in the Prime Minister's Statement of Standards for Ministerial Staff, which requires staff members to divest themselves of any interest in companies or businesses involved in the area of their ministers' portfolio responsibilities. Under these standards, this minister should have required her chief of staff to divest himself of his interests in Strategic Issues Management. This did not happen until 13 February this year, after questions were asked in the Senate—five months after his employment with the assistant minister commenced; after she took down the website, and only after the conflict of interest was publicly exposed.


I did agree with one thing that Senator Brandis said in his speech. He said, 'Accusing someone of misleading is a serious matter.' And it is. I will take the Senate through why it is that the opposition maintains this accusation.


First mislead: during question time on 11 February, Senator Nash said:


There is no connection, whatsoever, between my chief of staff and the company Australian Public Affairs.


That is not true. It took Senator Nash six hours, on 11 February, to come into the Senate and reveal that Mr Furnival did in fact have an interest in Australian Public Affairs.


Second mislead: during question time on 13 February 2014, Senator Nash said that one of the reasons that the health star rating website was removed is that the Legislative and Governance Forum on Food Regulation:


… took a unanimous decision to have an extensive cost-benefit analysis done.


That is not true. The communique of the forum's meeting on 13 December shows that it took no such decision, unanimous or otherwise. In an attempt to justify her own unjustifiable decision the minister has pretended it was a decision of the forum.


Third mislead: in estimates last week, Senator Nash said that after she engaged Mr Furnival, he:


… resigned as a director from all the related companies.


That is not true. ASIC records show Mr Furnival continued to be a director of Strategic Issues Management until 13 February 2014.


Fourth mislead: yesterday in the Senate, Senator Nash said—and I, again, quote:


Mondelez has not been a client of APA—


that is, Australian Public Affairs—


since my former chief of staff worked for me.


Again, that is not true. Mr Furnival was engaged as the assistant minister's chief of staff on 19 September 2013. The Australian Public Affairs entry on the federal register of lobbyists listed Mondelez as a client as of 11 February this year. Australian Public Affairs also updated its entry on the Victorian register of lobbyists on Monday of this week, and that entry continues to list Mondelez as a client. So it is demonstrably untrue. And I even gave the minister the courtesy of sending her the extracts yesterday afternoon and inviting her to correct the record, which she has not done.


It is a fundamental feature of our system of government that ministers are accountable to the parliament and, through the parliament, to the Australian people. But the Assistant Minister for Health has persistently refused to account for her conduct. She has refused to outline the appointment process that resulted in the engagement of her former chief of staff. She has refused to explain her failure to uphold the government's Statement of Standards for Ministerial Staff, which require ministerial staff to divest themselves of interests in business involved in their minister's portfolio area, something which was not done. She has refused to tell the Senate when the Australian Food and Grocery Council called her office on 5 February which staffer took the call in her office. And she has today refused an order of the Senate to produce the letter setting out the actions that would be taken to address conflicts of interest between the business affairs of her former chief of staff and his ministerial staff role.


We have also seen senior members of this government give entirely inconsistent accounts of how the conflict of interest in Senator Nash's office was being dealt with. The Prime Minister has said the conflict was dealt with by requiring Senator Nash's former chief of staff to divest his shareholding in the lobbying business—that is what the Prime Minister told the House of Representatives. But the Special Minister of State, Senator Ronaldson, has conceded that the Government Staffing Committee, which is run out of the Prime Minister's office, did not require Mr Furnival to divest. Senator Nash has said she ensured there was no conflict of interest through a series of undertakings from her chief of staff. Last week she told Senate estimates that these undertakings were set out in a letter her former chief of staff submitted on his engagement. She has rested her whole defence of her conduct on her claim that she imposed undertakings to avoid the conflict of interest, and today she has refused to table the document she claims sets out those undertakings.


Senator Nash has breached the Prime Minister's statement of ministerial standards. The Prime Minister's own standards provide that ministers must ensure that official decisions 'are unaffected by bias or irrelevant consideration such as considerations of private advantage or disadvantage'. Senator Nash has breached this requirement. The Prime Minister's standards also provide that ministers must provide an 'honest and comprehensive account of their exercise of public office' in response to questions from members of parliament. Senator Nash has breached this requirement. The Prime Minister's standards provide that ministers are 'expected to be honest in the conduct of public office and take all reasonable steps to ensure that they do not mislead the public or the parliament', and Senator Nash has breached this requirement.


As I said in the debate on the suspension of standing orders, this is not about whether or not the Assistant Minister for Health is a decent person. It is not about that; it is about whether she is a decent minister. Regrettably, her behaviour as a minister falls so far short of acceptable standards that she must be censured by this Senate. This is not a step, a procedure, that this opposition takes lightly. And, as I said at the outset, I should not need to move a censure motion. The Prime Minister should have acted. He should have acted to uphold his own statement of ministerial standards. He should have acted to uphold the content of his promise to the Australian people to ensure accountability and transparency. The very first statement of his own statement of ministerial standards says:


Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries are entrusted with the conduct of public business and must act in a manner that is consistent with the highest standards of integrity and propriety.


Yet all this Prime Minister has done is turn a blind eye to his assistant minister's conduct.


This is the very first big test of the integrity of the Abbott government and of the Prime Minister. And the Prime Minister and this government have failed this test comprehensively. The Prime Minister has shown that he is not serious about leading a government that upholds basic standards of transparency, accountability and honesty. His failure to take action against Senator Nash is part of a wider pattern in this government—a culture of secrecy, a culture of misleading the public and a culture of refusing to be accountable to the parliament and, through the parliament, to the Australian people.


In conclusion, there was a conflict of interest at the heart of the assistant health minister's office. Her chief of staff owned a lobbying firm representing food industry clients while she was making decisions affecting the commercial interests of those clients. This raises serious questions over her decision to take down the website designed to help Australians make healthy food choices. Senator Nash has breached the government's own ministerial standards. She has repeatedly made misleading statements to the parliament. She has repeatedly refused to answer legitimate questions about her conduct. She has refused to comply with an order of the Senate—an order simply requiring her to table the very document that she claims proves she ensured that there was no conflict of interest. For these reasons, the Assistant Minister for Health should be censured by this chamber and, if the Senate passes this censure motion, she should resign.

 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (15:36):  Devoid of policies, devoid of direction and racked by disunity over the repeal of the carbon tax and of the mining tax; over Qantas, over the Registered Organisations Commission and over the Australian Building and Construction Commission, the ALP have embarked on the tired old transparent tactic of trying to unite the troops by attacking somebody on the other side. But the attack should at least have a skerrick of substance, some semblance of logic to it. Let's be very clear: we on this side know Senator Nash to be a minister of integrity, a minister of capacity. She will continue to be a minister of integrity, she will continue to be a minister of capacity—committed to the service of the people of Australia.


Let me deal with one issue that the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate raised—that Senator Nash had failed to respond to an order of the Senate. Well, if that were a crime, Senator Wong and the Labor Party would have been in jail and been censured many, many a time. It is quite proper and reasonable, from time to time, in this chamber, for the chamber to vote for certain matters to be tabled and for the government of the day to decide against it for a variety of reasons. Indeed, Senator Nash has given the Senate a very good reason. Just to make it absolutely clear, let me read into the record a letter from Senator Nash, dated 5 March 2014, directed to our President:


Dear President


I refer to the Return to Order agreed to by the Senate on 4 March 2013, requesting a copy of the letter submitted by my former Chief of Staff, Mr Alastair Furnival, at the commencement of his employment in my office in September 2013.


The correspondence referred to contains information relating to the personal affairs of an individual staff member. It was provided to me on a confidential basis and it is not practice, of either past or present governments, to divulge personal information about individual staff.


I have outlined the relevant undertakings to the Senate previously and I refer honourable Senators to the relevant Senate and Estimates Hansards.


Yours sincerely,


FIONA NASH


Clearly dealing with the issue of the motion and setting out rationally, reasonably and comprehensively why she will not be complying with the order of the Senate—but, nevertheless, treating this Senate with respect by responding, the very next day, with a letter to the President outlining the reasons and the rationale.


I think that was item No. 1 in the great attack by Senator Wong. I am sure that those listening in could not help but notice that Senator Wong started running out of puff after about the first minute and just laboriously read through the typewritten speech that she had, word for word, with about as much excitement as reading it out word for word. There was not much commitment in it.


But let me just refer to my good friends the Australian Greens. It will be recalled that, during the discussion in relation to the suspension of standing orders, when I mentioned the matter of the former Labor minister with whom the Greens were in cahoots to allow them to be in government, to allow Senator Bob Carr to serve as the foreign minister, he maintained a shareholding in his lobbying company. Can I just ask a question? Even if everything that is asserted by the Labor Party is correct, what do you reckon is worse—the minister or a staff member holding shares in a lobbying company? I wonder which one might be worse! I think everybody listening would say it would be the minister.


Here we have exhibit A, indicating that Minister Bob Carr maintained his shareholding in a lobbying company. When I raised that Senator Milne got up and said, 'This is the first time I've heard about it! We know nothing!' It was like Colonel Klink, wasn't it?




Senator Kim Carr:
  Oh, you shouldn't bring that up!




Senator ABETZ:
  Ah, now we get the racial—



Senator Kim Carr interjecting—




Senator ABETZ:
  Very good, Senator Carr, you come in each time—



Senator Kim Carr interjecting—




Senator ABETZ:
  If you had any degree of integrity about you, you would be apologising—but, look, let's keep on. Our friends in the Australian Greens claimed that they knew nothing about Senator Bob Carr. Can I refer senators to a little extract from our Journals and from Hansard of 14 August 2012, where my good friend Senator Ryan moved a motion headed 'Standards of Ministerial Ethics'. It asked that 'The Senate notes', among other things, 'R.J. Carr Pty Ltd, his former lobbying company', and talked about the standards of ministerial ethics, which requires 'that ministers divest themselves of investments and other interests in any public or private company or business'. It further called on 'Senator Bob Carr to table any advice he has received'.


Does that sound familiar: tabling advice in relation to matters of conflict of interest and standards of ethics? Do you know what happened when that got put to the vote? Not one Green, not two Greens, not three Greens, not four—but all nine of them, including Senator Milne, voted against the motion! And Senator Milne says, 'The first time I've heard about this company and Senator Bob Carr's standards of ministerial ethics being breached is today'! Doesn't that once again tell you everything you need to know about the Greens? They will vote against matters to protect the Labor Party when they have no understanding of the issues. They know nothing, they claim, but they will vote against it no matter what.



Senator Kim Carr interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! On my left.




Senator ABETZ:
  What that shows is that the Greens and that Labor Party will always support each other when they are in strife, even in circumstances where they do not understand the issues that are involved.




Senator Kim Carr:
  Lord Brandis will have to step in here!



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Williams, you have a point of order?




Senator Williams:
  Mr Deputy President, I am trying to listen to Senator Abetz speaking, presenting his strong arguments, while Senator Carr is on the other side squealing like a stuck pig. I cannot hear the speaker. Will you please ask Senator Carr—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Williams. I remind all senators to listen to the speaker in silence. Senator Abetz, you have the call.




Senator ABETZ:
  So here we have the squeaky-clean Australian Greens saying that we have to vote for this motion because Senator Nash has allegedly misled the parliament. Excuse me! Senator Milne has misled the parliament during the debate by asserting she knew nothing about the motion for which she is recorded as voting against. It was not only Senator Milne. Every single one of the Greens senators came rushing in to defend Senator Bob Carr over an open and shut case in relation to a breach of ministerial ethics. Way back at law school I remember the line we were taught: he who comes to equity must come with clean hands. So one would hope those who claim that there has been some breach of some parliamentary standards are the upholders of the very highest standard.


The first allegation is 'misleading the Senate'. I wonder who might have misled the Senate about the emissions trading scheme and its consequences? I wonder who that might have been? Not Senator Wong, surely! Or how about the carbon tax: there will be no carbon tax. That wouldn't have been Senator Wong, would it? No! And what about the deficit that was left behind and the budget blow-outs as finance minister? No—no misleading of the Senate there! And what about the vote protecting Senator Bob Carr?




Senator Wong:
  Nash is her name. You might want to defend her at some time.




Senator ABETZ:
  Here we go, you see. What I am pointing out, Senator Wong,—and I am sure you understand it—is the gross hypocrisy and indecency of this motion. Because if that were the standard applied to the Australian Labor Party over the past six years then the whole front bench would have been removed. Senator Wong knows, as everybody in this place knows, that the ministerial standards on this side are so much higher than they ever were in the Labor Party.


Let us be very clear. When there was a motion in this place to expose the documents the Fair Work Commission had gathered together, in great detail, relating to Craig Thomson, the former Labor member for Dobell, whose one vote was helping to prop up the Gillard/Greens government, the Labor Party and the Greens voted together to ensure that those documents would not be made available for public viewing. I wonder why? Because it would have exposed once and for all the gross dishonesty of Mr Thomson, who we now know has been found guilty by a court of law. So, please, I say to the Labor Party: don't insult the intelligence of our fellow Australians by pretending, on a broadcast day, that you somehow adhere to standards of ministerial and parliamentary behaviour that you came nowhere near standing by or abiding by during your six years.


In relation to Senator Nash, I understand that there were three allegations. First, there was 'misleading the Senate'. There was no misleading of the Senate. Senator Nash, on re-reading her Hansard, thought further information should be added to an answer, and that was done on the very same day. You could not be quicker and clearer and more conscious of your ministerial responsibilities than Senator Nash was when, upon realising there was a potential ambiguity in an answer, she came back into the chamber on the same day to clarify the situation.




Senator Wong:
  It was not an ambiguity. It was completely untrue.




Senator ABETZ:
  Senator Wong continues thinking that noise and repetition somehow obviates the need for fact. In a debate such as a censure motion noise and mindless repetition never obviates the actual need for facts to base the censure on, and there simply has been no basis in fact for this censure. There has been no misleading in any way, shape or form by Senator Nash.


The second point was that she had allegedly failed to comply with an order of the Senate. If that were a sin Senator Wong would have had to have resigned as a minister. I indicate that Senator Nash did respond to the order of the Senate the very next day—in rough terms, one assumes, within a 24-hour turnaround she provided a comprehensive answer to our President of this place, to indicate that she was treating this place with the respect it deserves, unlike those who have been hollering throughout this debate. She has complied with the order in the normal tradition. So, the second point fails.


Point three was that she had failed to account for her actions. We have had question time after question time and we have had Senate estimates going on and on, and Senator Nash has given a fantastic account of herself, and of her ministerial role and responsibility, in a manner that I think every minister should be able to aspire to. She has set a high standard and has answered all of the questions in great detail.


This is the Labor Party whose former national president is currently in remand on charges of criminality—the man who organised the numbers to get Craig Thomson into the parliament, who helped organise the numbers for Ms Gillard and who was right up there and right in it. This is the same Labor Party, having those people at the top, that voted to ensure the document that absolutely exposed Mr Thomson for what he had done—ripping off the low-paid workers who are members of the Health Services Union—was kept secret, despite the Fair Work Commission saying that they had no concern as to whether or not those documents would be made available. In those circumstances the Labor Party voted to do what? To keep the documents secret. Why? To keep their tainted, dysfunctional and disunited government in power. That is the only reason they did it. And who helped keep them there? The other party that will undoubtedly vote for this censure as well—namely, the Australian Greens.


The Australian Greens, who claim they knew nothing about Bob Carr's conflict of interest, voted against him reporting to the Senate about it—not one of them but all of them, including the leader. They made sure that everybody came into the chamber. They made sure that not one of them was missing. They were showing to the Labor Party their complete and utter loyalty in the Labor Party's hour of need, when Bob Carr was under the microscope in clear breach of the ministerial standard. Just in case there is any doubt, the ministerial standard requires that ministers divest themselves of investments and other interests in any private company. He kept his shareholding for the full 18 months. Nothing could be more open and shut: throughout his 18 months as a minister, he kept that shareholding in his lobbying company.



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—




Senator ABETZ:
  Senator Whish-Wilson, who is interjecting, voted to ensure that the matter did not proceed before the Senate. He was part of the protection racket for Senator Bob Carr. The Australian Greens will always join the Labor Party in the protection racket. That is why they are against the registered organisations commission; that is why they are against the Australian Building and Construction Commission—because they do not want to see proper standards apply to registered organisations and trade unions, they do not want to see the rule of law apply on our building sites around this country, and nor do they want to see any standard applied on Labor ministers. But, when it comes to the coalition, we have a completely different standard.



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—




Senator ABETZ:
  Senator Whish-Wilson says he has to take a stand against lobbyists. Isn't that very interesting? Pity he did not take the stand against Mr Graeme Woods' $1 million donation that was personally negotiated by his leader—something that not even the Labor Party would allow under its code of conduct of fundraising, and we most definitely would not allow it. You come into this place claiming you are squeaky-clean on ethics, your leader deals personally with the biggest donation in Australian political history, and you have the audacity, the hypocrisy, the duplicity, to assert that somehow you are the harbinger of all moral standards in this place. Your actions speak so much louder than your words, Senator Whish-Wilson. The Australian Greens actions speak so much louder than their words.


If we really thought that Senator Wong was genuine in this—we knew she was running out of puff; we knew she was running out of arguments—she then tried the very lame line that this minister might be named as the 'Minister for Snack Foods'. Here we are in the middle of, allegedly, the most serious matter ever to confront this parliament and we have Senator Wong making the horrendous allegation that Senator Nash might be known as the 'Minister for Snack Foods'. Really? Is this as serious as the Labor Party gets? Is this as good as Senator Wong gets in relation to these matters? The listening public would be saying to themselves, 'We thought the Labor Party might actually be interested in the issues of the day, like Qantas, the repeal of the carbon tax and the repeal of the mining tax. What can we do to get jobs generated in this country?'



I think Senator Wong might have form in this regard. I know what happened to Ms Gillard and I know what Senator Wong is trying to do to Senator Nash, but the good news is this: we on the coalition side will look after our ministers, and our female ministers as well. We will not see them knifed off by the likes of Senator Wong, especially when we know that they uphold the— (Time expired)



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Abetz, just for the completeness of the record, can you table the letter that was produced by Senator Nash to the President of the Senate?




Senator ABETZ:
  Absolutely.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2014-03-05,"



Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (15:57):  It is true: any motion to censure a minister is serious. I agree with Senator Brandis who said earlier this afternoon that in this chamber a motion of censure of a Senate minister is important as an accountability tool. A censure motion should never be moved lightly and should never be agreed to unless a strong case is made.


In relation to this matter, Senator Nash's serious failure in the exercise of her ministerial responsibilities, her failure to account for her actions and conduct as a minister, her failure to comply with an order of the Senate, and her failure to correct misleading statements made both before the Senate and Senate committees do warrant severe censure. In this case, serious questions arise regarding Senator Nash's competence and her suitability for ministerial office. Senator Nash has been given ample time and ample opportunity to correct misleading statements she has made and to answer questions directed to her, not to mention provide a full explanation to the Senate regarding all the circumstances surrounding the removal of the Health Star Rating website. She has failed to do so.


First, some background. This website provided details of the Health Star Rating system, designed to give clear and accurate information about the nutritional content of packaged food. And given this government's repeated declarations that this is the age of personal responsibility, you might think that this website is exactly the sort of thing the government would be in favour of: providing tools to Australians to take personal responsibility for their choice of food. But Senator Nash's office went into overdrive to have the website removed. Mr Furnival—then Senator Nash's chief of staff—phoned an assistant secretary from the Department of Health, on 5 February, demanding the website be taken down. This occurred, of course, on the same day that the CEO of the Australian Food and Grocery Council, Mr Gary Dawson, phoned Senator Nash's office to express his concern that the website was premature.


The secretary of the Department of Health provided evidence at Senate estimates that the official who received Mr Furnival's call reported the call to a senior officer because 'it was above my pay grade'. An assistant adviser in the minister's office then spoke to an acting deputy secretary of the department, advising 'We would like the website to be taken down.' The deputy secretary advised that he was in a meeting and would look into it 'as soon as possible'. The assistant adviser again called the deputy secretary, 'roughly 15 minutes later', asking for progress—just 15 minutes later—and the pressure was really on. But the deputy secretary advised that he was still looking into the matter and consulting the acting secretary of the department. The acting deputy secretary then took a phone call from Senator Nash—approximately half an hour after her assistant adviser's last call requesting that the website be taken down. The department at this time, I suspect, probably realised they were fighting a losing battle and complied with the request.


Mr Furnival was not only Senator Nash's chief of staff at that point but also a co-owner and director of Strategic Issues Management, which wholly owns the company Australian Public Affairs—which lobbied on behalf of Mondelez, the parent company of Kraft Cadbury, a company which expressed concerns about the Health Star Rating system. And prior to becoming a ministerial staffer, Mr Furnival said that he was an economist for Cadbury. Another client of Mr Furnival's co-owned company APA was the Australian Beverages Council, whose members include Coca-Cola and PepsiCo and which also has a close interest in the development of the Health Star Rating system. 


In question time in the Senate, on 11 February, Senator Nash told the Senate:


… There is no connection, whatsoever, between my chief of staff and the company Australian Public Affairs. My chief of staff has no connection with the food industry and is simply doing his job …


This was simply not true. In fact, it was very far from the truth. Senator Nash claimed, in question time, on 12 February:


… my chief of staff complies with proper internal standards under the Statement of Standards for Ministerial Staff …


This was not true either. Senator Nash did make a statement to the Senate indicating Mr Furnival's spouse gave undertakings that APA:


… would not (a) make representations to either myself or Minister Dutton; (b) make representations to the Department of Health; or (c) make representations on behalf of any clients to other ministers of the Commonwealth in relation to the health portfolio.


That is not the test to be met in relation to ministerial staff standards—in fact, it is an arrangement that should not be necessary at all.


Unfortunately for the government and Senator Nash, we know that Mr Furnival breached at least three of the standards that all ministerial staff are obligated to adhere to. For the record, they are clauses 3, 4 and 6 of the Statement of Standards for Ministerial Staff. Mr Furnival failed to disclose and take reasonable steps to avoid any conflict of interest in connection of his employment, which is essential to conform with clause 3 of the statement.


Senator Nash should not have allowed that to happen. Mr Furnival also breached paragraph 4 of the standards. It says staff must:


Divest themselves, or relinquish control, of interests in any private company or business and/or direct interest in any public company involved in the area of their Ministers’ portfolio responsibilities.


Senator Nash should not have allowed that to happen either. He also breached paragraph 6 of the standards. It requires staff:


Have no involvement in outside employment or in the daily work of any business, or retain a directorship of a company, without the written agreement of their Minister and the Special Minister of State.


Senator Nash should not have allowed that to happen either. I note for the record that the Government Staffing Committee considers all ministerial appointments. This committee is centrally controlled by the Prime Minister's office—as so much is in the Abbott government. I also note that reasonable questions asked by senators at Senate estimates committees of ministers about the role of the Government Staffing Committee in the appointment of Mr Furnival were not answered, and I suspect reasonable questions that should have been asked about Mr Furnival's employment were not asked by any member of Mr Abbott's Government Staffing Committee either. But one thing that we can say for sure, as the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has confirmed, is that the Prime Minister personally approves all ministerial staff appointments.


Senator Nash claimed in Senate estimates on Wednesday, 26 February, in relation to her former chief of staff, Mr Furnival, that 'he had resigned as a director from the companies.' That was not true either, as the records of Australian Securities and Investments Commission showed. In fact, Mr Furnival ceased being a director of Strategic Issues Management Pty Ltd on 13 February 2013, about five months after he joined the minister's office and only after this became a matter of notoriety after questions were asked in this very chamber by the opposition. Then Senator Nash claimed in question time yesterday:


Mondelez has not been a client of APA since my former chief of staff worked for me. APA did no work for Mondelez. I cannot be any clearer than that.




Senator Abetz:
  That is right.




Senator FAULKNER:
  'That is right,' says the Leader of the Government—big mistake! But I will have to give you this, Eric, it is the only time you have actually engaged in the substance of the debate at all. The facts are that Mondelez was listed as a client on the federal lobbyists register until last month, and I understand—as we have heard today—it was still listed on the Victorian lobbyists register yesterday. It was another statement about this matter, this time in question time just yesterday, that is simply not true. In Senate estimates on Wednesday, 26 February, Senator Nash indicated that Mr Furnival provided her with a letter on his engagement as her chief of staff relating to conflicts of interest between his business affairs and his role as a ministerial staffer. The minister was asked in estimates by Senator Wong, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, to provide a copy of that letter. The minister refused to do so. But not only did the minister refuse to do so in Senate estimates, she has now refused to provide it to this chamber. She has now refused to comply with an order of the Senate to provide a copy of the letter. I would say that is a very, very contemptuous attitude from a very, very embattled minister.


It appears that the failure to declare conflict of interest became a habit. There is a standing item on the agenda of the Legislative and Governance Forum on Food Regulation which requires members and supporting staff to declare any conflict of interest. Mr Furnival attended a meeting of that forum on 13 December 2013 in his official capacity with the minister. He made no declaration, and this also is a clear breach of the standing arrangements for what is a very important ministerial council. There are two key paragraphs in the statement of ministerial standards that I think are of particular relevance to Senator Nash and her conduct, and Senator Wong has mentioned these. The first of these is paragraph 3.2, which states:


… Ministers are required to ensure that official decisions made by them as Ministers are unaffected by bias or irrelevant consideration, such as considerations of private advantage or disadvantage.


The second is paragraph 4.4, which states:


Ministers are required to provide an honest and comprehensive account of their exercise of public office, and of the activities of the agencies within their portfolios, in response to any reasonable and bona fide enquiry by a member of the Parliament or a Parliamentary Committee.


Now we have codes of conduct for staff and for ministers, and everybody in this place knows it. This is because the decisions of government must be made and must be known to be made on their merits, because decisions must be made transparently and because ministers must represent the interests of the Australian public, not serve the interests of private companies. As the Prime Minister said in the forward to his own statement of ministerial standards:


… it is vital that Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries conduct themselves in a manner that will ensure public confidence in them and in the government.


The integrity of government processes is a fundamental underpinning to our democracy and to our democratic system. If the Australian community cannot have confidence that government decisions and actions are based on policy not patronage, then we cannot have faith that the votes that are cast are part of the directing government in determining our country's direction.


Senator Nash's clear breach of the standards relating to private advantage and disadvantage has far more widespread and extensive consequences than just the removal of a food-rating website. Her failure to provide an honest and comprehensive account of her actions compounds the damage of her actions. Ministers provide answers to parliament as a crucial part of accountability. It is one of the most important ways the Australian community finds out what is done by the government—what is done in their name.


To treat questions in the parliament and in parliamentary committees with contempt, is to treat with contempt the right of Australians to know how their government acts. It undermines the basic tenet of democracy: that we cast our votes based on the assessment of the alternatives. We have been invited by the government to put the case against Senator Nash in this censure motion. Senator Wong and I have addressed these issues in substance and in detail this afternoon.


This is why Senator Nash's actions are so serious and so deserving of censure. If the Prime Minister will not take any steps to protect what I think are the principles at the heart of our democracy, by acknowledging Senator Nash's egregious failures, and if he will not take the appropriate action then I say—and I hope the majority of the Senate will join me in saying this—the Senate must do just that by passing this censure motion.

"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2014-03-05,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Social Services) (16:17):  I think it is important to pause for a moment to reflect on the reason we are debating this censure motion. It is because Labor and the Greens combined to suspend standing orders. What we witnessed in that act was the band getting back together. The much heralded divorce proved to be only a trial separation. Those on this side of the chamber know that Labor and the Greens—



Honourable senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order, on my left and on my right! The speakers have been heard in silence. It does not help if either side intervenes when the speaker is on their feet. The speaker is entitled to be heard in silence. If you wish to participate in the debate that is obviously something that remains within your province in this chamber. I ask both sides to respect the speaker.




Senator FIFIELD:
  As I was saying, the band is back together. Those of us on this side knew that Labor and the Greens were continuing to secretly cohabit. I know those on the left of politics around Australia will be rejoicing for this reunion.


The other interesting thing about the debate we have heard this afternoon is the deployment of Senator Faulkner. The Labor Party think, 'In case of emergency, break glass and deploy Senator Faulkner!' Whenever an argument is failing, they roll out Senator Faulkner to try and lend some of that well-honed gravitas to the argument that is before the chamber. We saw that today. Senator Faulkner was in high dudgeon, doing his very best confected-outrage routine. We know when we see Senator Faulkner mounting an argument in this place that Labor have effectively given up the case that they are prosecuting. 


If Labor had their hearts in this—if they believed for a second the argument that they are seeking to put in this place—why would we not have had a single frontbencher other than Senator Wong? Senator Moore spoke on the suspension motion. I acknowledge Senator Moore's contribution there. When we move down the line, was Senator Conroy going to participate? I do not think so. I really do not think Senator Conroy would be in a very strong position to contribute to this debate. Perhaps Senator Polley could have spoken? I will let that be a rhetorical proposition! Senator Cameron?—again, I do not think so. I guess colleagues are getting my point: there are not too many options on the front bench on the other side when it comes to people to prosecute cases. When an argument is particularly in trouble they bring back Senator Faulkner. We saw that today, so we can put that aside.


There have been some very serious allegations made today against Minister Nash. She has been accused of misleading the Senate. She has been accused of failure to comply with an order of the Senate. She has been accused of a failure to account for her actions. They are serious allegations and they should never be made lightly in this place. As Senator Brandis said, to impugn someone's motives, someone's behaviour or someone's conduct without being able to back that up is a very serious thing to do. It is an appalling thing to do.


What we have witnessed in the course of this debate is that the goalposts have continually moved, in terms of what it is that minister Nash is supposedly guilty of. The goalposts keep changing. I must say I have been following this debate in this place, in estimates and in question time, very closely. I have found it extremely difficult to work out what the precise charge against Minister Nash is. This first that was levelled was the question of whether there was a delay between the first question that Minister Nash answered in question time and when she came into the chamber to provide additional information that she thought was appropriate and necessary.


Labor have been getting hysterical. They have been hyperventilating over the fact that Senator Nash came into the chamber on the same day. I would have thought that it was a minimum standard that a colleague comes into this place on the same day. The time period that elapsed was six hours, and we are meant to gasp that there was a six-hour gap.


I would encourage colleagues who may not have been in the community affairs estimates committee last week to refer to the Hansard evidence of Senator Stephen Parry, the Deputy President of the Senate. An unusual thing happened in that Senate estimates hearing. Senator Parry sought the opportunity in that committee to make a statement. Usually, as we know, the format for estimates is that questions are asked and answers are given. Senator Parry sought the indulgence of the committee because he wanted to assist in their deliberations—and I acknowledge that Senator Faulkner and Senator Wong provided Senator Parry with that opportunity. What Senator Parry wanted to do was to forensically go through that six-hour period which Senator Nash supposedly was using to not come into this chamber. I refer colleagues—it is well worth reading—to the Hansard of the community affairs estimates of Wednesday, 26 February 2014. Senator Parry went through the pattern and the flow of what happened in this chamber on that day and made it very clear that Senator Nash availed herself of the first practical, reasonable opportunity to provide additional information to this chamber. I know colleagues around this room hold Senator Parry in some regard, and Senator Parry did a very forensic job at analysing the pattern and flow of that day. So I think we can put completely to one side that argument that Senator Nash in some way delayed providing information to the Senate. She takes her responsibilities very seriously, and she took the first appropriate and reasonable opportunity to provide that information.


Then there is the issue of the failure to comply with the Senate order, which, I guess, is the latest charge. The first charge was the six-hour delay; this failure, supposedly, to provide information to the Senate chamber is the latest charge. Senator Nash did respond to the order of the Senate. We all know in this place that, when you respond to an order of the Senate, those who put in the request might not necessarily like the way that you respond. They might not necessarily like the content of your response to the Senate, but the fact is that Senator Nash did respond to that order of the Senate. As to her response, which was in relation to documentation related to with Mr Furnival, her former chief of staff: I am pretty unsurprised by the content of her letter. I quote: 'The correspondence referred to contains information relating to the personal affairs of an individual staff member. It was provided to me on a confidential basis and it is not the practice of either past or present governments to divulge personal information about individual staff. I have outlined the relevant undertakings to the Senate previously and I refer honourable senators to the relevant Senate and estimates Hansard.' That is an entirely appropriate approach. Staff members of members and senators are entitled to some confidentiality about their particular circumstances. They are not members of parliament; they cannot defend themselves in various forums. So I think it is an entirely orthodox approach that Senator Nash has taken in responding to the order of the Senate.


The other allegation which, I guess, has been thrown about—between the first charge of a delay in providing information to the Senate and the last charge of failing to respond to an order of the Senate; the accusation that has bounced around between those two goalposts—has been that of a conflict of interest. I have listened closely to Senator Nash and I believe that appropriate steps were taken to deal with potential conflicts of interest. In any ministerial office there are a range of potential conflicts of interest. What matters is what steps are taken and how those are managed. We know that there were steps taken towards divestment and that there were appropriate undertakings given. So I struggle with the proposition of a conflict of interest.


Then, between those two goalposts I mentioned before, we have had thrown around the issue of disclosure. Has Minister Nash appropriately disclosed all that she needs to? Minister Nash has answered question after question in this chamber during question time. Minister Nash answered question after question, hour after hour, in the community affairs estimates committee. And today, where Minister Nash, in the debate about the suspension of standing orders, did not shy away from rising to her feet and making her case—she had no hesitation at all. She has taken every opportunity to provide a full account of herself.


I guess what this debate really comes down to—and I think it is something that we probably would all agree with—is that public life is a test of character, ultimately. The conduct of senators in this place is a test of character on a daily basis. The conduct of ministers in their roles is, on a daily basis, a test of character. I have no doubt that Minister Nash, as a senator, passes the test of character in terms of her behaviour and conduct. I have no doubt that Minister Nash, in her capacity as a minister in the execution of her duties, passes that test of character. But, when it comes to a test of character in the conduct of one's duties as a frontbencher, I want to draw a contrast between Minister Nash as a frontbencher and Senator Conroy as a frontbencher. I think we all recall Senator Conroy in the immigration estimates committee, where it is now a matter of record that Senator Conroy accused Lieutenant General Angus Campbell AO DSC of being engaged in a political cover-up. I witnessed Senator Conroy warming up for that particular activity in the communications estimates hearing, where he accused Dr Ziggy Switkowski of being a liar, of misleading the Senate and of being in contempt of the Senate. So, if we are going to compare the conduct of frontbenchers as a test of character, I will put Minister Nash up against Senator Conroy any day of the week.


I cannot help but think, knowing how fond Senator Conroy is of Jack Nicholson movies, having cited A Few Good Men, that in the immigration estimates hearing he was combining two other Jack Nicholson roles—Jack Nicholson in The Shining and Jack Nicholson in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest—such is his fondness for Jack Nicholson movies. I refer to Senator Conroy to make the point that those opposite throw words around like confetti. They forget that words have meaning. That is why we saw Senator Conroy, in the communications estimates hearing, talking about Dr Switkowski lying, talking about Dr Switkowski being in contempt, talking about Dr Switkowski misleading the Senate: lying, contempt, misleading. Here today, we are again seeing that pattern of throwing words around as though they have no meaning. This time we are seeing the word 'censure'—this chamber seeks to censure Minister Nash for the charges laid out by Senator Wong. I point out to those opposite that words do have meaning. You cannot just walk into a Senate estimates hearing and accuse someone of being a liar. You cannot just walk into a Senate estimates hearing and accuse someone of misleading the Senate. You cannot just walk into a Senate estimates hearing and accuse someone of being in contempt.




Senator Wong:
  You can't walk in here as a minister and say things that are a lie.




Senator FIFIELD:
  And you cannot just walk into this place and throw the word 'censure' out there in relation to the activities of a minister.




Senator Wong:
  She keeps saying things which are not true, and you are defending it.



The PRESIDENT:  Order! You have had your opportunity to participate. Senator Fifield has the call.




Senator FIFIELD:
  I guess I would call this approach to discourse in this place a Conrovian approach. Those opposite do need to pause and they do need to think very carefully before they make charges against people, whether they be witnesses at estimates hearings or ministers in this place. You must think very carefully about the words that you use and that you choose to level against people in the conduct of the parliament.


I think there are examples of genuine misconduct in public life—genuine misconduct in the form of the Australian Labor Party before an election saying that they would not introduce a carbon tax. I think that is serious political misconduct. And they did—we know they did. Before another election, they promised that they would be abolishing the carbon tax, and they have opposed that. I refer to those two examples because, as I say, the debate before us is about character. The charge that is being levelled at Minister Nash is that she has failed the test of character in her conduct as a minister, which I reject. I level the charge at the other side that they have failed, collectively, the test of character in public life with their repeated misleading of the Australian people before subsequent elections. I make the charge that Senator Conroy has failed the test of character in his conduct as a frontbench member.


Senator Wong has said that if this motion passes, she thinks that Senator Nash should resign. We have got to see it for what it is—it is a trumped up charge, and no such thing should happen if this motion passes. I think Senator Conroy should resign for his conduct. If we are talking about failing character tests, he has failed clearly, absolutely and utterly.


At the heart of the allegations made in the censure motion is the accusation that there has been a vested interest of some sort at play in Minister Nash's office—again, I have seen no evidence of this. However, on the other side of politics we see vested interests at play each and every day. We see them at play in the cheek by jowl relationship between the Australian Labor Party and various trade unions—not all trade unions; there are some good trade unions, but there are some trade unions that are not so good, and one of those is the HSU. If we want examples of vested interests inappropriately at play in public life then we need look no further than the relationship the Australian Labor Party has with certain trade unions. We have also seen some very curious relationships between the Australian Greens and certain individuals who give money to the Australian Greens. There are vested interests at the heart of the activities of the Australian Greens.


Senator Nash is a person of the utmost integrity. Those of us who know her well have no difficulty in trusting in her appropriate execution of the roles and responsibilities of a minister. Those of us who know Senator Nash have no difficulty trusting that she appropriately fulfils her obligations as a senator and—even more importantly—that she fulfils her obligations to this chamber, that she is accountable to it, that she is answerable to it, and that she answers each and every question put to her. We have seen her do that day after day.


We need in this place to be very careful before moving censure motions. As I say, words have meaning; words have power. They are not to be used lightly. We have seen a pattern emerging from those opposite where they will say anything about anyone for political advantage. Senator Conroy is exhibit No. 1 in that regard. I would urge those opposite to take the opportunity to pause and step back from this motion. It is not justified. It is not warranted. The charges against Senator Nash have not been proved. She has taken every opportunity to account for herself. As far as I am concerned, the fact that Mr Furnival has now left Senator Nash's office means the matter is closed. I do not accept for a second that there was an issue at play, but the fact that Mr Furnival has now left the office puts beyond any doubt that there is any matter that remains to be addressed.


I would urge colleagues not to support this motion, I would urge the Australian Greens not to support this motion and I would urge Labor senators not to support this motion. It is one of the gravest allegations that can be levelled against a colleague—that they are deserving of censure. Senator Nash is not deserving of censure; she is a person of integrity, she is a senator of integrity and she is a minister of integrity. She has given tremendous service to this place and she will continue to give tremendous service to this place, not only as a senator but also as a minister, for many years to come.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2014-03-05,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria) (16:38):  The substance of the defence from the government is that Senator Nash has provided answers to the allegations before her. It was the substance of the defence outlined by Senator Fifield and, previously, by Senator Abetz and Senator Brandis. On that we agree: she has provided answers. She has provided answers to the Senate during question time, she has provided answers during Senate estimates and she has provided answers here today. What we take issue with is the content of those answers. That is the issue here: it is not good enough to say that you have answered allegations, and that is the end of the matter. It is the content of those answers that is at issue.


Senator Wong and Senator Faulkner have gone through the sequence of events in great detail. I will not do that again. I will not dwell on the specific issues that have been addressed. I will, however, turn to a few points. The first issue is that—and people who are following this debate may not necessarily have followed every detail, so I will try and summarise it—during Senate estimates, Senator Nash said, clearly she knew Mr Furnival; she had known him for years; they had a longstanding relationship; due diligence was carried out; and they were fully aware of his relationship with the lobbying firm. There were no questions about that. What I cannot square off is that, in Senate question time, Senator Nash went on to say, very clearly:


There is no connection whatsoever between my chief of staff and the company Australian Public Affairs.


I understand that sometimes we are caught on the hop in this place. Sometimes we panic. Sometimes we might not understand the question correctly. That is fine; that is what happens. But Senator Nash has been given a number of occasions to explain how we can square those two completely contradictory statements from her. On one hand, 'I have known him for a long time; I am fully aware of his connection to the company—in fact, we performed due diligence on his appointment', and on the other hand, to come in here and say, 'There is no connection whatsoever between Mr Furnival and the company.' It does not make sense. And without a thorough explanation, the only conclusion that we can come to is that the Senate was deliberately misled.


Then there is the issue of the conflict of interest. Again, just a few facts: that Mr Furnival owned the company with his wife. Let us be clear about that. He was a director of the company with his wife. He owned it and directed the company. We know that the ministerial code of conduct says very clearly—and this is not an area of ambiguity, if you have a pecuniary interest in an area in which a minister is involved, then that is a conflict of interest. This is a clear conflict of interest. Yet what we are told is that steps were undertaken to ensure that conflict of interest was dealt with—and we are provided with no evidence to confirm that those steps in fact have taken place. It is a clear conflict and, for me, it is a lesson in how you deal with a situation like this. The first thing is, you have to accept this point—that facts do not matter; that when you come into the Senate, facts simply do not matter. We are entering a parallel universe here, where black is white and white is black. When you are in a political crisis, dig in; if you are going to tell a lie, tell a big one and tell it often.


For me the biggest concern here is not the issue around the appointment of Mr Furnival. It is not the fact that there was a conflict of interest. It goes to the heart of everything that is wrong with our Australian democracy at the moment—that is, the privileged role of special interests in the Australian parliament. Earlier today, we voted against gambling reforms because of the power of the pokies industry. Everybody remembers what happened during the mining tax debate, when the mining industry came to town and we saw the previous government turn its back on what would have been an excellent reform. We are hearing now about moves afoot to wind back protections for consumers in the financial services industry. We have my colleague, Senator Whish-Wilson, pushing to try and get container deposit legislation. And who are the biggest obstacles to that? The Australian Beverages Council, one of Mr Furnival's clients. That is the issue here. That is the problem that makes meaningful reform very difficult. It has a corrosive impact on the Australian parliament. If we look at the specific portfolio area that Minister Nash is responsible for, what are the great health challenges? What are they? One is obesity. We have a country with one of the highest obesity rates anywhere in the world. What was proposed? Providing consumers with information via a star rating website that made it very clear to consumers—to individuals—that some foods that they may have thought were healthy were in fact less healthy than they thought, or the reverse. That is what this reform was about.


What really confuses me here is that on the one hand we have a conservative government that says the only way for markets to work efficiently is if we have a decent flow of information, yet here we are with a reform that provides consumers with information and we have Mr Furnival, whose lobbying firm works on behalf of the junk food industry, preventing consumers from getting access to that information. Here is the paradox for the coalition: are they going to be true to that Liberal philosophy that says consumers should get access to good information, or is their connection to big business so entrenched that they will deny people that information?


Look at the area of alcohol reform. We recently had a big national debate about the issue of alcohol fuelled violence and alcohol related harm. At the same time, we had the defunding of an alcohol and other drugs agency on the basis that the work they were doing was duplicated by other agencies—which, we learnt through Senate estimates, simply was not true. When it comes to tobacco control we have a party—and a minister who belongs to that party—continuing to take donations from the tobacco industry. How is it that a party, and a minister, who has control over tobacco policy can continue to be the only party in the Australian parliament that continues to take donations from an industry that kills people? It is another obvious conflict.


No-one here enjoys this business. A censure motion is a serious thing. And of course there is a human element to all of this. I do not know Senator Nash. I am sure she is a decent person. But this is not about whether she is a decent person. Sometimes, good people make serious mistakes. Senator Nash has made a number of serious mistakes. What needs to happen now is straightforward. The website that was taken down should immediately be reinstated. People should not be denied access to information that will improve their health. If it is not the role of government to protect the health of the Australian community, then I do not know what we are doing here. The funding for the Alcohol and Other Drugs Council should be immediately reinstated. We need to ensure that the National Party are dragged into the 21st century and that they join the Greens, the Australian Labor Party and, most recently, the Liberal Party in ruling out donations from the tobacco industry. In taking these actions, the minister can demonstrate that she does put the health of the Australian community ahead of those privileged special interests. She needs to correct the record on the statements she has made, and then she should do the dignified thing and resign as minister.

Senator WONG

 (
South Australia
—
Leader of the Opposition in the Senate
) (
14:35
):  Pursuant to contingent notice of motion, I move:



That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent her moving a motion to provide for the consideration of a matter, namely a motion to give precedence to a motion of censure of the Assistant Minister for Health (Senator Nash)


There is no more serious act—




Honourable senators interjecting
—




The PRESIDENT:  Senator Wong, resume your seat. Order! Senator Wong has moved a motion for the suspension of standing orders. Senator Wong, continue.




Senator WONG:
  There is no more substantive accusation in this chamber than that a minister has misled this chamber. There is no more important issue when you are a minister than accountability to this chamber. And what we are seeking to do is to ensure this chamber properly debates a censure motion on the Assistant Minister for Health, arising out of her misleading of this chamber—her persistent misleading of this chamber—and her failure to comply with an order for production of documents and failure to account for her actions to the Senate.


The fact that the government is not prepared to debate this censure really reflects on the standards that this government has when it comes to ministerial accountability and transparency. In the period of time since this matter first came to light we have been treated to this senator—this minister—coming in to this chamber and repeatedly and persistently misleading it, failing to provide answers to reasonable questions and, today, failing to provide a document which grounds what she says is her compliance with ministerial standards. That is what we are seeing from this minister. It is entirely reasonable for this chamber to debate this censure motion, and it does not reflect well on the Leader of the Government in this place that he did not take this censure motion. He has sought to take the chamber down the path requiring a suspension of standing orders in order to debate this censure motion. I would also say that there is no greater obligation on a minister in this place than to ensure that they do not mislead the chamber. We have given this minister many, many opportunities. I have invited her time and time again to come in here and correct the record.



Honourable senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! I remind honourable senators that if you wish to participate in the debate you will get an opportunity. Senators on both sides are reminded that interjections are disorderly.




Senator WONG:
  We on this side have given this minister many, many opportunities to correct the record, far more than I anticipate those on that side would have given a minister in our government when we were on the benches opposite. For example, yesterday after question time I wrote to the minister, attaching the extracts from the register of lobbyists which demonstrated that her answer was incorrect and inviting her to do what she should do as a minister of the Crown, what she should do according to the principles of ministerial accountability and what she should do under the ministerial standards, which is come into this place and correct the record. That was yesterday after question time—well, she did not do those things. That is simply indicative of this minister's behaviour and attitude towards this chamber. She has repeatedly indicated facts to this chamber which simply are not true.


This is not a question of whether or not Senator Nash is a decent person. This is a question of whether or not she is a decent minister. Over these last weeks, whether in Senate estimates or in question time here, the chamber has been presented with repeated examples of why this minister is not prepared to comply with basic principles of accountability. The Senate chamber has been presented over and over again with examples of this minister not complying with ministerial standards and the principle of accountability to the Senate chamber. It is entirely reasonable that this censure motion be moved, and it is entirely reasonable that it be debated. As I said, it really does reflect on Senator Abetz that he chooses not to take this censure motion for debate, given the enormity of the evidence confronting the government about the failure of this minister and the Prime Minister to uphold the standards that the Australian people expect of ministers in this place. It is entirely reasonable for standing orders to be suspended so that we can debate a censure motion. There have been repeated examples of misleading of the chamber, and the Senate ought to deal with them appropriately.

"Nash, Sen Fiona",Nats,2014-03-05,"



Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Health) (14:42):  I rise to take part in this debate and will acknowledge some of the comments that have been made by Senator Wong, particularly her comments relating to her having asked questions 'time and time again'. I would say to the Senate that the reason I have stood 'time and time again' was to ensure that the facts were placed on the table and to ensure that the facts surrounding this issue were brought forward.



Honourable senators interjecting—



A government senator:  Come on girls, give her a crack.



The PRESIDENT:  Order on my left! I asked for Senator Wong to be heard in silence, as I do for any speaker who stands on their feet. Senator Nash is entitled to be heard in silence as well, and that applies to all members of the Senate.




Senator NASH:
  The opposition has been inferring that there was a conflict of interest regarding my former chief of staff and his role in my office. As I have explained to the Senate and to the Senate estimates committee time and time again that there was no conflict of interest, perhaps it might assist senators if I again run through the processes that were put in place to ensure there was no conflict of interest. Every step of the way in this process, with every question that has been asked of me relating to this issue, I have acted in good faith and I have provided to the Senate and the Senate estimates committee the facts. I will again, to assist senators opposite, go through the steps I undertook to ensure there was no conflict of interest regarding the former chief of staff in my office.


I proposed Mr Furnival to my office in a temporary capacity to help with the transition arrangements of my staff. He was initially proposed by me for two months to help set up my office. His role as a former government relations practitioner is on the public record and I was aware of this. I also say to the Senate that there is no rule against somebody who has previously worked in government relations becoming a member of staff. Under the code of conduct for staff, he advised me of his private interests. I put him forward to the government staff committee shortly following the swearing-in. The committee came back to me and indicated I needed to obtain a series of undertakings, which I did. I have outlined those for the Senate previously. I have outlined them for the Senate estimates committee previously.


I refer senators to the Hansard record. Those undertakings have been outlined on several occasions to senators. I say to senators opposite, to be very clear: at the outset of his time of employ with me, my former chief of staff's wife undertook to maintain a series of undertakings in relation to the company. I have put this on the record time and time again, but I will do so again for senators.


Ms Cain undertook that APA would make no representations to me, no representations to Minister Dutton, and no representations to my health department nor indeed to any other minister of the Commonwealth in relation to the health portfolio. That was upheld. We have had several weeks now of questioning from the opposition relating to this matter—the matter being the conflict of interest perceived by them, in the role of my former chief of staff, which does not exist. At no time has any opposition senator provided any evidence to the Senate or to the Senate estimates committee about the existence of a conflict of interest. They have not because there is none. There was no conflict of interest. The appropriate undertakings were put in place. They were adhered to. I invite those opposite to consider the facts. There was no conflict of interest.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (14:48):  I rise today to support the suspension of standing orders so that—



Honourable senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! The same silence that Senator Nash was able to receive should be received by Senator Milne, as well.




Senator MILNE:
  I support the suspension of standing orders because a censure motion is a really serious motion. It is no support for, or defence of, Senator Nash for the government to refuse to take it on. It reinforces to the community that the government have plenty to hide—because they will not engage in the debate on the substantive issue of whether or not there is a case to be answered. Frankly, I find it extraordinary that in this debate it is Senator Nash who has been on her feet—rather than the Leader of the Government, to tell us why he has blocked a debate on such a substantive matter.


We will go to this debate on the substantive matter because the government is allowing the minister to dig a bigger and bigger hole for herself by allowing that to happen. I can tell you this: what we have now—



Government senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  We were going well. If senators wish to participate in the debate there will be an opportunity. Senator Milne is entitled to be heard in silence.




Senator MILNE:
  The point is this: there was originally a denial that there was any association between the chief of staff and the lobbying firm Australian Public Affairs. That was corrected. There clearly is a relationship. In fact, it is a part-ownership of that company. That is the fact of the matter. Secondly, you simply cannot deny a conflict of interest—right up until the day that the chief of staff has resigned—and rely on what the chief of staff's wife has said. It is not the chief of staff's wife who is responsible here; it is the chief of staff and the minister who are responsible here. It is the chief of staff who had to divest under the ministerial staffers' code of conduct.


It is not about getting an undertaking from his wife or partner that they will do this or that. It is about a divestment requirement of the ministerial code of conduct, and that was not adhered to. It is no use trying to protect the minister by running around trying to block a motion to discuss this censure. There will be a debate on the censure. We need to go to this and we need to drop this defence of the minister's chief of staff on the basis of undertakings given by Ms Cain. That is not the point here. The point is that the minister has denied, right up until the end, the conflict of interest, and has given the Senate no explanation as to why the divestment was not required before the person concerned took on the chief-of-staff role.


I am supporting the motion to suspend standing orders because, ultimately, ministerial responsibility has to mean something. And it is clear from the way Prime Minister Tony Abbott's government is operating that they do not believe in ministerial responsibility—whether it is for Minister Morrison, who tries behind the military; or whether, now, it is for Senator Nash, who is trying to hide behind a refusal to debate this. We will debate this. But we will debate this because ministerial responsibility has to mean something in a Westminster system, and the Greens want to make sure that it does.

Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (14:52):  I am more than delighted to take on the challenge of Senator Milne to partake in this debate. The simple fact is: there is nothing of substance to the allegations that have been made, day after day, hour after hour, against Senator Nash. The Labor Party have spun their wheels on this issue—



Honourable senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! We have been going fairly well in that the people speaking in this debate have been shown reasonable respect in terms of having silence whilst they are speaking. I ask that that continues.




Senator ABETZ:
  The Labor Party have spun their wheels on this issue in question time, day after day, without traction. They did so hour after hour in Senate estimates as well and got absolutely nowhere. The reason: there is no substance to the case. Sure, they called in Senator Faulkner. Sure, they called in Senator Wong. But I know that when I used to be a counsel—and I am sure Senator Brandis would be able to recollect this as well: no matter how good a counsel you are, if you ain't got a case, you ain't going to win. That is the problem with the prosecution by Senators Wong and Faulkner of this case. There simply is no substance. All the rhetoric in the world simply will not build the case for you—and there is no substance whatsoever.


The Labor Party had a choice. They might have moved to suspend standing orders to fight for Qantas jobs. No. What about manufacturing jobs? No. What about the plight of the drought afflicted farmers in this country? No; they are into the smear as soon as they can get there. Considering the seriousness of this, you would nearly think that somebody had misused their credit card—which reminds me that the Labor Party are bringing this issue of integrity before the Senate when their former national president is languishing in remand awaiting sentencing for gross dishonesty. Mr Thomson, their former member, has been found guilty by a court of law of ripping off low-paid workers. And what is the allegation against Senator Nash in all those circumstances?



Honourable senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order, on both sides! It is not helping the debate when people are interjecting, and interjections are disorderly.



Senator Ian Macdonald interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Macdonald! Senator Abetz is entitled to be heard in silence from both sides.




Senator ABETZ:
  The rank transparency of the Leader of the Greens is shown by this. Even if we were to believe everything that Labor, with their exaggerated hyperbole, would have us believe—even if we were to believe all that, why was it that Senator Milne refused to utter a single word when the seat that Senator Johnston now occupies was occupied by one Senator Bob Carr, former Minister for Foreign Affairs, who, throughout the whole 18 months that he was Minister for Foreign Affairs, maintained his shareholding in a lobbying company, RJ Carr Pty Ltd? Where was the moral outrage from the Greens? They were in lock step with the Labor government. They did nothing about ministerial standards when there was a very clear breach. Might I add, the Standard of Ministerial Ethics requires:


… Ministers divest themselves of investments and other interests in any public or private company or business …


Throughout Senator Bob Carr's 18-month reign in this place as foreign minister, Senator Milne stood guiltily silent—a very guilty silence. Why? Because she was in cahoots, maintaining that dysfunctional and disgraceful government on life support. The Australian people have spoken—




Senator Milne:
  Mr President—



Government senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! On my right!




Senator Milne:
  Thank you, Mr President. I do not want to disrupt Senator Abetz's train of thought, but I do want to put on the record that that statement about Senator Carr is the first I have heard of it.



The PRESIDENT:  Order! That is not a point of order; that is a point of debate.



Government senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! I remind those on my right, there needs to be silence. Senator Abetz is entitled to be heard in silence. When there is silence on my right, we will proceed. Senator Abetz has one minute and eight seconds remaining.




Senator ABETZ:
  Thank you, Mr President. Senator Milne has just now confirmed everything that I ever thought about the Greens: ignorance is bliss. That is why they are so happy in that corner. They do not bother reading the Hansards; they do not bother reading the newspapers; they do not bother informing themselves with that which is general knowledge. That way they do not have to make a moral judgement on their alliance partners in the Australian Labor Party. That is why the Australian Greens, of course, voted with Labor to suppress the documents that Senator Fierravanti-Wells wanted to expose in relation to the Craig Thomson matter. I daresay Senator Milne has not heard of Craig Thomson either. You have not heard of Michael Williamson—



Honourable senators interjecting—

Senator ABETZ:
  We have just now been told everything we needed to know about the Greens. Ignorance is bliss. They wallow in ignorance day after day.

Senator MOORE
 (Queensland) (15:00):  The debate we are having now is to do with the suspension of standing orders, and we have gone nowhere near that issue, which is how this is normally played out in this place. The issue before the chair—



Honourable senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Senator Moore, resume your seat. I remind those on both sides of the chamber that Senator Moore is entitled to be heard in silence.




Senator MOORE:
  The motion before the chair is for a suspension to debate a censure motion. You would not be able to pick that if you were listening to this debate, because that has not come up. We have proposed a censure motion because of a series of issues, one of which is a specific request today for a document relating to undertakings. That document was not brought forward, as is the usual process. We have been told consistently from those on the government side that, because a range of questions have been asked, that should be the end of the debate. We have been told that there is nothing to worry about, that there is no problem, and that we should end the debate. The last several minutes of this debate have not been about the substance of the issues. No, let us not go anywhere near the substance of the issues!


This debate is about whether or not there should be a suspension. We have not had that concluded. What we have had from those on the other side is a series of arguments about other cases. They say that we should not be asking for a suspension to debate this issue, because in other cases—which they have outlined in depth—nothing happened. I am completely confounded about why we go through this process. In trying to get information from the minister, we made a request, as a result of a series of actions by the opposition, for a censure motion to look at the substance of the issue. We have now heard comments from those on the other side about previous cases, along with dismissive comments from Senator Scullion about why people—'girls'—on this side of the chamber should not be involved in the debate.


We are asking for a suspension to allow us to move a motion to debate a censure motion. That is the question before the chair. We seek to continue to ask for information concerning actions in the minister's office. That is the process that we have sought to follow through Senate estimates and through a series of questions in this place to those on the other side—which has often resulted in more information being provided by the minister in dribs and drabs. We put forward a request for documentation yesterday but we did not get the document about which we were concerned. We got an attached letter which I believe said that information could not be shared because of privacy. We need to have those issues fully explained and debated.


As Senator Milne said in her contribution, it is all fine for us to have interchanges in this place, but people in the wider community need to know that issues of trust and ministerial responsibility are taken seriously in this chamber. What we are proposing is that there will be a debate—



Honourable senators interjecting—

Senator MOORE:
  We are now having a discussion about whether we will be able to debate the substance of the issues. I do not understand why the government would not just allow the debate to happen so that we would not have to go through this process a number of times. Look at the core issue; look at what we are talking about in terms of ministerial responsibility and conflict of interest. The issue before the chamber today relates to statements and answers which Senator Nash gave in Senate estimates about the fact that there were undertakings provided. We seek to see the undertakings. Instead of debating that issue, we have to waste the time of everybody in this chamber, we have to waste the time of anyone who is interested in the debate and, most importantly, we have to waste the time of Senator Nash, who—instead of being able to present her arguments—has had to go through a process not on the original issue; rather, it is about whether or not the debate will continue.


We continue to put forward our request for a suspension. I think there is interest in this issue. Certainly, we have seen interest in this issue in the chamber. No-one could say that there is not some interest in getting this information. Let us proceed with the appropriate suspension so that we can have the core debate. (Time expired)

Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister for Arts and Attorney-General) (15:05): A censure motion against a minister is one of the most serious parliamentary procedures there is. Those who listen to this broadcast are entitled to make a judgement based on what Senator Wong had to say and, most particularly, based on the dignified and specific reply that Senator Fiona Nash was able to give. One of the most disgraceful things a member of parliament can do, indeed one of the most disgraceful things a human being can do, is to make allegations of dishonesty or a lack of integrity against another human being and not be able to specify the occasion that gives rise to that allegation. Those who heard Senator Wong's shrill, belligerent speech a few moments ago would have been left wondering what, specifically, is being alleged against Senator Fiona Nash. The answer is that the Labor Party, in their allegations, have been able to point to nothing—



Honourable senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! Senators on my left!




Senator BRANDIS:
  The Labor Party have been able to point to nothing that Senator Nash has not answered comprehensively and in detail. This is about an allegation of conflict of interest and, more particularly, an allegation of conflict of interest affecting the former chief of staff of the minister. As Senator Wong should know, but obviously does not know, there are two ways in which a conflict of interest can be dealt with. The first of those is to remove the occasion of the conflict of interest by divesting oneself of the commercial interest concerned—and that is what Senator Nash required of her former chief of staff, and that is what he did.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator Wong:
  You should show the letter that shows that. You do not know the facts!



The PRESIDENT:  Order! No, we are not going to carry on this debate on across the chamber like that. We will have an orderly debate; we will not have people shouting at each other across the chamber. That is completely disorderly. If you disagree with the views that are being expressed, there are opportunities in the proper processes of this chamber to put your views. Comments should be addressed to the chair.




Senator BRANDIS:
  The allegation is of a conflict of interest. The two ways in which that conflict of interest could have been satisfactorily addressed are by divestment and by undertaking. Both of those courses of action were insisted upon by the minister and both of them were followed by Mr Alastair Furnival.



Honourable senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Brandis is entitled to be heard in silence.




Senator BRANDIS:
  Through you, Mr President, Senator Wong: rest content to spray allegations around with no substance to back them up. And then she refuses to hear Senator Fiona Nash's detailed and specific response to her allegations. So the first course of action—divestment—was followed. The second course of action was to give undertakings that no situation would ever be allowed to arise in which there was a conflict of interest between APA and the role of the minister's chief of staff. Those detailed and specific undertakings were sought by the minister, and they were received from Mr Furnival, and from his wife and from the company; and those undertakings were honoured. The undertakings were honoured, and the divestment took place. Nothing more could have been done or could have been demanded of those concerned to avoid a conflict of interest. And yet Senator Wong chooses to disregard the fact that every one of her allegations has been answered. They were answered today by Senator Nash in her contribution and they have been answered in previous question times. They were answered with specificity in Senate estimates last week.


This chutzpah on stilts, from a person who was a minister in a government maintained in power for the last three years by a criminal, Mr Craig Thomson; and who has enjoyed most of her ministerial career as a member of the political party whose federal president was a criminal, Mr Michael Williamson. So please, Senator Wong, do not come into this chamber and smear an honest, decent, dignified and competent woman when the political party you represent is racked with criminality from the top to the very bottom.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the motion moved by Senator Wong be agreed to.

Senator WONG
 (South Australia—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (15:19):  I move:



That the Senate censures the Assistant Minister for Health (Senator Nash) for misleading the Senate, failing to comply with an order for the production of documents, and failing to account for her actions to the Senate.


Today we saw the Assistant Minister for Health fail to comply with an order to produce a document that would support her claim to this chamber that her decision-making has not been corrupted by a conflict of interest. Her defiance of the chamber is the latest in a series of acts which warrant censure by this chamber. I say to my colleagues: the Senate needs to pass this censure motion to uphold the ministerial standards the Prime Minister has failed to enforce. I should not need to move this censure motion; the Prime Minister should have acted. But over recent weeks the Senate, the press gallery and the Australian public have been treated with contempt by an Assistant Minister for Health who has an unhealthy tendency to mislead. The minister has failed to account for her actions by answering questions and, when she has answered questions, she has demonstrated, at best, a reckless disregard for the truth.


At the heart of this matter is the failure of the Assistant Minister for Health to explain how an individual with interests in a lobbying firm with food clients came to be appointed as her chief of staff; and her failure to explain how that chief of staff came to order a government health information website to be shut down. I first asked a question about the taking down of the health star rating system website during question time on 11 February, the first sitting day of the year. Rather than providing a full and frank account of the actions taken by herself and by her office, the minister presented a completely fanciful account. She claimed that the website had been inadvertently placed, and that state and territory ministers had decided to conduct a cost-benefit analysis in a more expansive way than had previously been decided, before the voluntary star rating system would proceed. Neither of the minister's claims was true. And, having got off to this bad start, her answers to legitimate questions about this matter have only become more and more evasive, more and more misleading, and more and more untruthful. And this pattern of behaviour culminated earlier today when she failed to comply with the Senate's order to produce the letter—not just any letter, but the letter which she says sets out undertakings from her former chief of staff to address the conflict of interest in her office.


This matter goes to the heart of ministerial responsibilities in our system of government. Ministers are required to exercise their ministerial duties in a disinterested manner—that is, unaffected by bias or irrelevant considerations, including private advantage for others. Ministers are also required to demonstrate that their decisions are made with the sole objective of advancing the public interest, and to explain their actions to the parliament.


The Assistant Minister for Health's principal adviser had interests in a lobbying firm with food industry clients at the same time as he was advising her and acting for her in relation to policy matters affecting the food industry. This minister has failed to demonstrate how she was able to conduct her affairs in a disinterested manner, acting solely in the public interest, when she had a conflict of interest at the heart of her office. Despite admitting that her staff member's direct and family interests in a lobbying firm were known to her, the minister failed to take effective action to require him to divest his shareholding in the relevant businesses. The Assistant Minister for Health has failed to uphold ministerial standards, and the Prime Minister has failed to enforce compliance.


Let me take senators through the facts of the conflict of interest in Senator Nash's office. We know that Mr Furnival was engaged as her chief of staff from 19 September 2013. He was a director and a 50 per cent shareholder of Strategic Issues Management, which wholly owns a lobbying business, Australian Public Affairs. Australian Public Affairs has a number of clients in the food industry, including Mondelez, which owns Kraft; Cadbury; and the Australian Beverages Council, which represents soft drink and fruit juice manufacturers.


This is a textbook example of a conflict of interest. Yet Senator Nash denies and continues to deny that there was anything untoward here. So let me spell it out. The assistant health minister makes decisions which directly affect the commercial interests and the profits of companies in the food industry. While she was making these decisions, her most senior adviser owned a lobbying firm which profited from helping food industry clients get what they wanted out of the government. As I said, this is a textbook example of a conflict of interest. But it is not just a hypothetical example; it is a conflict of interest which has been played out in the real world. And, as we all know, on 5 February, the assistant minister decided to take down the health star rating system website, a website designed to help Australians make healthy food choices. It is an important initiative in the effort to prevent serious health conditions, such as obesity, diabetes and heart disease. Public health experts strongly supported the star rating website. It is a system that was more than two years in the making, and a project agreed to by federal, state and territory governments in December 2011. Yet all it took was one phone call to Senator Nash's office from the Australian Food and Grocery Council. The next thing that happened was the assistant minister's chief of staff instructed her department to take down the website immediately. That is a highly unusual chain of events.


Senate estimates heard evidence of the flurry of four phone calls, late in the afternoon of 5 February, from the minister's office to the department, demanding that the website be taken down. The departmental officer responsible quite properly referred the matter to a deputy secretary in the department. At the same time as the minister was ordering the website be taken down at the behest of the Food and Grocery Council, her most senior adviser had a financial interest in a lobbying firm representing confectionery and food manufacturers. This has undermined confidence in the minister, stakeholders and the wider public. In fact, Australians are entitled to ask whether her title should be changed from Assistant Minister for Health to 'Senator for Snack Foods'.


This erosion of public confidence is exactly why there is an onus on ministers to ensure that there are no real or perceived conflicts of interest in their decision-making. It is a responsibility recognised in the Prime Minister's Statement of Standards for Ministerial Staff, which requires staff members to divest themselves of any interest in companies or businesses involved in the area of their ministers' portfolio responsibilities. Under these standards, this minister should have required her chief of staff to divest himself of his interests in Strategic Issues Management. This did not happen until 13 February this year, after questions were asked in the Senate—five months after his employment with the assistant minister commenced; after she took down the website, and only after the conflict of interest was publicly exposed.


I did agree with one thing that Senator Brandis said in his speech. He said, 'Accusing someone of misleading is a serious matter.' And it is. I will take the Senate through why it is that the opposition maintains this accusation.


First mislead: during question time on 11 February, Senator Nash said:


There is no connection, whatsoever, between my chief of staff and the company Australian Public Affairs.


That is not true. It took Senator Nash six hours, on 11 February, to come into the Senate and reveal that Mr Furnival did in fact have an interest in Australian Public Affairs.


Second mislead: during question time on 13 February 2014, Senator Nash said that one of the reasons that the health star rating website was removed is that the Legislative and Governance Forum on Food Regulation:


… took a unanimous decision to have an extensive cost-benefit analysis done.


That is not true. The communique of the forum's meeting on 13 December shows that it took no such decision, unanimous or otherwise. In an attempt to justify her own unjustifiable decision the minister has pretended it was a decision of the forum.


Third mislead: in estimates last week, Senator Nash said that after she engaged Mr Furnival, he:


… resigned as a director from all the related companies.


That is not true. ASIC records show Mr Furnival continued to be a director of Strategic Issues Management until 13 February 2014.


Fourth mislead: yesterday in the Senate, Senator Nash said—and I, again, quote:


Mondelez has not been a client of APA—


that is, Australian Public Affairs—


since my former chief of staff worked for me.


Again, that is not true. Mr Furnival was engaged as the assistant minister's chief of staff on 19 September 2013. The Australian Public Affairs entry on the federal register of lobbyists listed Mondelez as a client as of 11 February this year. Australian Public Affairs also updated its entry on the Victorian register of lobbyists on Monday of this week, and that entry continues to list Mondelez as a client. So it is demonstrably untrue. And I even gave the minister the courtesy of sending her the extracts yesterday afternoon and inviting her to correct the record, which she has not done.


It is a fundamental feature of our system of government that ministers are accountable to the parliament and, through the parliament, to the Australian people. But the Assistant Minister for Health has persistently refused to account for her conduct. She has refused to outline the appointment process that resulted in the engagement of her former chief of staff. She has refused to explain her failure to uphold the government's Statement of Standards for Ministerial Staff, which require ministerial staff to divest themselves of interests in business involved in their minister's portfolio area, something which was not done. She has refused to tell the Senate when the Australian Food and Grocery Council called her office on 5 February which staffer took the call in her office. And she has today refused an order of the Senate to produce the letter setting out the actions that would be taken to address conflicts of interest between the business affairs of her former chief of staff and his ministerial staff role.


We have also seen senior members of this government give entirely inconsistent accounts of how the conflict of interest in Senator Nash's office was being dealt with. The Prime Minister has said the conflict was dealt with by requiring Senator Nash's former chief of staff to divest his shareholding in the lobbying business—that is what the Prime Minister told the House of Representatives. But the Special Minister of State, Senator Ronaldson, has conceded that the Government Staffing Committee, which is run out of the Prime Minister's office, did not require Mr Furnival to divest. Senator Nash has said she ensured there was no conflict of interest through a series of undertakings from her chief of staff. Last week she told Senate estimates that these undertakings were set out in a letter her former chief of staff submitted on his engagement. She has rested her whole defence of her conduct on her claim that she imposed undertakings to avoid the conflict of interest, and today she has refused to table the document she claims sets out those undertakings.


Senator Nash has breached the Prime Minister's statement of ministerial standards. The Prime Minister's own standards provide that ministers must ensure that official decisions 'are unaffected by bias or irrelevant consideration such as considerations of private advantage or disadvantage'. Senator Nash has breached this requirement. The Prime Minister's standards also provide that ministers must provide an 'honest and comprehensive account of their exercise of public office' in response to questions from members of parliament. Senator Nash has breached this requirement. The Prime Minister's standards provide that ministers are 'expected to be honest in the conduct of public office and take all reasonable steps to ensure that they do not mislead the public or the parliament', and Senator Nash has breached this requirement.


As I said in the debate on the suspension of standing orders, this is not about whether or not the Assistant Minister for Health is a decent person. It is not about that; it is about whether she is a decent minister. Regrettably, her behaviour as a minister falls so far short of acceptable standards that she must be censured by this Senate. This is not a step, a procedure, that this opposition takes lightly. And, as I said at the outset, I should not need to move a censure motion. The Prime Minister should have acted. He should have acted to uphold his own statement of ministerial standards. He should have acted to uphold the content of his promise to the Australian people to ensure accountability and transparency. The very first statement of his own statement of ministerial standards says:


Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries are entrusted with the conduct of public business and must act in a manner that is consistent with the highest standards of integrity and propriety.


Yet all this Prime Minister has done is turn a blind eye to his assistant minister's conduct.


This is the very first big test of the integrity of the Abbott government and of the Prime Minister. And the Prime Minister and this government have failed this test comprehensively. The Prime Minister has shown that he is not serious about leading a government that upholds basic standards of transparency, accountability and honesty. His failure to take action against Senator Nash is part of a wider pattern in this government—a culture of secrecy, a culture of misleading the public and a culture of refusing to be accountable to the parliament and, through the parliament, to the Australian people.


In conclusion, there was a conflict of interest at the heart of the assistant health minister's office. Her chief of staff owned a lobbying firm representing food industry clients while she was making decisions affecting the commercial interests of those clients. This raises serious questions over her decision to take down the website designed to help Australians make healthy food choices. Senator Nash has breached the government's own ministerial standards. She has repeatedly made misleading statements to the parliament. She has repeatedly refused to answer legitimate questions about her conduct. She has refused to comply with an order of the Senate—an order simply requiring her to table the very document that she claims proves she ensured that there was no conflict of interest. For these reasons, the Assistant Minister for Health should be censured by this chamber and, if the Senate passes this censure motion, she should resign.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2014-03-05,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Public Service and Minister for Employment) (15:36):  Devoid of policies, devoid of direction and racked by disunity over the repeal of the carbon tax and of the mining tax; over Qantas, over the Registered Organisations Commission and over the Australian Building and Construction Commission, the ALP have embarked on the tired old transparent tactic of trying to unite the troops by attacking somebody on the other side. But the attack should at least have a skerrick of substance, some semblance of logic to it. Let's be very clear: we on this side know Senator Nash to be a minister of integrity, a minister of capacity. She will continue to be a minister of integrity, she will continue to be a minister of capacity—committed to the service of the people of Australia.


Let me deal with one issue that the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate raised—that Senator Nash had failed to respond to an order of the Senate. Well, if that were a crime, Senator Wong and the Labor Party would have been in jail and been censured many, many a time. It is quite proper and reasonable, from time to time, in this chamber, for the chamber to vote for certain matters to be tabled and for the government of the day to decide against it for a variety of reasons. Indeed, Senator Nash has given the Senate a very good reason. Just to make it absolutely clear, let me read into the record a letter from Senator Nash, dated 5 March 2014, directed to our President:


Dear President


I refer to the Return to Order agreed to by the Senate on 4 March 2013, requesting a copy of the letter submitted by my former Chief of Staff, Mr Alastair Furnival, at the commencement of his employment in my office in September 2013.


The correspondence referred to contains information relating to the personal affairs of an individual staff member. It was provided to me on a confidential basis and it is not practice, of either past or present governments, to divulge personal information about individual staff.


I have outlined the relevant undertakings to the Senate previously and I refer honourable Senators to the relevant Senate and Estimates Hansards.


Yours sincerely,


FIONA NASH


Clearly dealing with the issue of the motion and setting out rationally, reasonably and comprehensively why she will not be complying with the order of the Senate—but, nevertheless, treating this Senate with respect by responding, the very next day, with a letter to the President outlining the reasons and the rationale.


I think that was item No. 1 in the great attack by Senator Wong. I am sure that those listening in could not help but notice that Senator Wong started running out of puff after about the first minute and just laboriously read through the typewritten speech that she had, word for word, with about as much excitement as reading it out word for word. There was not much commitment in it.


But let me just refer to my good friends the Australian Greens. It will be recalled that, during the discussion in relation to the suspension of standing orders, when I mentioned the matter of the former Labor minister with whom the Greens were in cahoots to allow them to be in government, to allow Senator Bob Carr to serve as the foreign minister, he maintained a shareholding in his lobbying company. Can I just ask a question? Even if everything that is asserted by the Labor Party is correct, what do you reckon is worse—the minister or a staff member holding shares in a lobbying company? I wonder which one might be worse! I think everybody listening would say it would be the minister.


Here we have exhibit A, indicating that Minister Bob Carr maintained his shareholding in a lobbying company. When I raised that Senator Milne got up and said, 'This is the first time I've heard about it! We know nothing!' It was like Colonel Klink, wasn't it?




Senator Kim Carr:
  Oh, you shouldn't bring that up!




Senator ABETZ:
  Ah, now we get the racial—



Senator Kim Carr interjecting—




Senator ABETZ:
  Very good, Senator Carr, you come in each time—



Senator Kim Carr interjecting—




Senator ABETZ:
  If you had any degree of integrity about you, you would be apologising—but, look, let's keep on. Our friends in the Australian Greens claimed that they knew nothing about Senator Bob Carr. Can I refer senators to a little extract from our Journals and from Hansard of 14 August 2012, where my good friend Senator Ryan moved a motion headed 'Standards of Ministerial Ethics'. It asked that 'The Senate notes', among other things, 'R.J. Carr Pty Ltd, his former lobbying company', and talked about the standards of ministerial ethics, which requires 'that ministers divest themselves of investments and other interests in any public or private company or business'. It further called on 'Senator Bob Carr to table any advice he has received'.


Does that sound familiar: tabling advice in relation to matters of conflict of interest and standards of ethics? Do you know what happened when that got put to the vote? Not one Green, not two Greens, not three Greens, not four—but all nine of them, including Senator Milne, voted against the motion! And Senator Milne says, 'The first time I've heard about this company and Senator Bob Carr's standards of ministerial ethics being breached is today'! Doesn't that once again tell you everything you need to know about the Greens? They will vote against matters to protect the Labor Party when they have no understanding of the issues. They know nothing, they claim, but they will vote against it no matter what.



Senator Kim Carr interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! On my left.




Senator ABETZ:
  What that shows is that the Greens and that Labor Party will always support each other when they are in strife, even in circumstances where they do not understand the issues that are involved.




Senator Kim Carr:
  Lord Brandis will have to step in here!



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order! Senator Williams, you have a point of order?




Senator Williams:
  Mr Deputy President, I am trying to listen to Senator Abetz speaking, presenting his strong arguments, while Senator Carr is on the other side squealing like a stuck pig. I cannot hear the speaker. Will you please ask Senator Carr—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Williams. I remind all senators to listen to the speaker in silence. Senator Abetz, you have the call.




Senator ABETZ:
  So here we have the squeaky-clean Australian Greens saying that we have to vote for this motion because Senator Nash has allegedly misled the parliament. Excuse me! Senator Milne has misled the parliament during the debate by asserting she knew nothing about the motion for which she is recorded as voting against. It was not only Senator Milne. Every single one of the Greens senators came rushing in to defend Senator Bob Carr over an open and shut case in relation to a breach of ministerial ethics. Way back at law school I remember the line we were taught: he who comes to equity must come with clean hands. So one would hope those who claim that there has been some breach of some parliamentary standards are the upholders of the very highest standard.


The first allegation is 'misleading the Senate'. I wonder who might have misled the Senate about the emissions trading scheme and its consequences? I wonder who that might have been? Not Senator Wong, surely! Or how about the carbon tax: there will be no carbon tax. That wouldn't have been Senator Wong, would it? No! And what about the deficit that was left behind and the budget blow-outs as finance minister? No—no misleading of the Senate there! And what about the vote protecting Senator Bob Carr?




Senator Wong:
  Nash is her name. You might want to defend her at some time.




Senator ABETZ:
  Here we go, you see. What I am pointing out, Senator Wong,—and I am sure you understand it—is the gross hypocrisy and indecency of this motion. Because if that were the standard applied to the Australian Labor Party over the past six years then the whole front bench would have been removed. Senator Wong knows, as everybody in this place knows, that the ministerial standards on this side are so much higher than they ever were in the Labor Party.


Let us be very clear. When there was a motion in this place to expose the documents the Fair Work Commission had gathered together, in great detail, relating to Craig Thomson, the former Labor member for Dobell, whose one vote was helping to prop up the Gillard/Greens government, the Labor Party and the Greens voted together to ensure that those documents would not be made available for public viewing. I wonder why? Because it would have exposed once and for all the gross dishonesty of Mr Thomson, who we now know has been found guilty by a court of law. So, please, I say to the Labor Party: don't insult the intelligence of our fellow Australians by pretending, on a broadcast day, that you somehow adhere to standards of ministerial and parliamentary behaviour that you came nowhere near standing by or abiding by during your six years.


In relation to Senator Nash, I understand that there were three allegations. First, there was 'misleading the Senate'. There was no misleading of the Senate. Senator Nash, on re-reading her Hansard, thought further information should be added to an answer, and that was done on the very same day. You could not be quicker and clearer and more conscious of your ministerial responsibilities than Senator Nash was when, upon realising there was a potential ambiguity in an answer, she came back into the chamber on the same day to clarify the situation.




Senator Wong:
  It was not an ambiguity. It was completely untrue.




Senator ABETZ:
  Senator Wong continues thinking that noise and repetition somehow obviates the need for fact. In a debate such as a censure motion noise and mindless repetition never obviates the actual need for facts to base the censure on, and there simply has been no basis in fact for this censure. There has been no misleading in any way, shape or form by Senator Nash.


The second point was that she had allegedly failed to comply with an order of the Senate. If that were a sin Senator Wong would have had to have resigned as a minister. I indicate that Senator Nash did respond to the order of the Senate the very next day—in rough terms, one assumes, within a 24-hour turnaround she provided a comprehensive answer to our President of this place, to indicate that she was treating this place with the respect it deserves, unlike those who have been hollering throughout this debate. She has complied with the order in the normal tradition. So, the second point fails.


Point three was that she had failed to account for her actions. We have had question time after question time and we have had Senate estimates going on and on, and Senator Nash has given a fantastic account of herself, and of her ministerial role and responsibility, in a manner that I think every minister should be able to aspire to. She has set a high standard and has answered all of the questions in great detail.


This is the Labor Party whose former national president is currently in remand on charges of criminality—the man who organised the numbers to get Craig Thomson into the parliament, who helped organise the numbers for Ms Gillard and who was right up there and right in it. This is the same Labor Party, having those people at the top, that voted to ensure the document that absolutely exposed Mr Thomson for what he had done—ripping off the low-paid workers who are members of the Health Services Union—was kept secret, despite the Fair Work Commission saying that they had no concern as to whether or not those documents would be made available. In those circumstances the Labor Party voted to do what? To keep the documents secret. Why? To keep their tainted, dysfunctional and disunited government in power. That is the only reason they did it. And who helped keep them there? The other party that will undoubtedly vote for this censure as well—namely, the Australian Greens.


The Australian Greens, who claim they knew nothing about Bob Carr's conflict of interest, voted against him reporting to the Senate about it—not one of them but all of them, including the leader. They made sure that everybody came into the chamber. They made sure that not one of them was missing. They were showing to the Labor Party their complete and utter loyalty in the Labor Party's hour of need, when Bob Carr was under the microscope in clear breach of the ministerial standard. Just in case there is any doubt, the ministerial standard requires that ministers divest themselves of investments and other interests in any private company. He kept his shareholding for the full 18 months. Nothing could be more open and shut: throughout his 18 months as a minister, he kept that shareholding in his lobbying company.



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—




Senator ABETZ:
  Senator Whish-Wilson, who is interjecting, voted to ensure that the matter did not proceed before the Senate. He was part of the protection racket for Senator Bob Carr. The Australian Greens will always join the Labor Party in the protection racket. That is why they are against the registered organisations commission; that is why they are against the Australian Building and Construction Commission—because they do not want to see proper standards apply to registered organisations and trade unions, they do not want to see the rule of law apply on our building sites around this country, and nor do they want to see any standard applied on Labor ministers. But, when it comes to the coalition, we have a completely different standard.



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—




Senator ABETZ:
  Senator Whish-Wilson says he has to take a stand against lobbyists. Isn't that very interesting? Pity he did not take the stand against Mr Graeme Woods' $1 million donation that was personally negotiated by his leader—something that not even the Labor Party would allow under its code of conduct of fundraising, and we most definitely would not allow it. You come into this place claiming you are squeaky-clean on ethics, your leader deals personally with the biggest donation in Australian political history, and you have the audacity, the hypocrisy, the duplicity, to assert that somehow you are the harbinger of all moral standards in this place. Your actions speak so much louder than your words, Senator Whish-Wilson. The Australian Greens actions speak so much louder than their words.


If we really thought that Senator Wong was genuine in this—we knew she was running out of puff; we knew she was running out of arguments—she then tried the very lame line that this minister might be named as the 'Minister for Snack Foods'. Here we are in the middle of, allegedly, the most serious matter ever to confront this parliament and we have Senator Wong making the horrendous allegation that Senator Nash might be known as the 'Minister for Snack Foods'. Really? Is this as serious as the Labor Party gets? Is this as good as Senator Wong gets in relation to these matters? The listening public would be saying to themselves, 'We thought the Labor Party might actually be interested in the issues of the day, like Qantas, the repeal of the carbon tax and the repeal of the mining tax.

Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (15:57):  It is true: any motion to censure a minister is serious. I agree with Senator Brandis who said earlier this afternoon that in this chamber a motion of censure of a Senate minister is important as an accountability tool. A censure motion should never be moved lightly and should never be agreed to unless a strong case is made.


In relation to this matter, Senator Nash's serious failure in the exercise of her ministerial responsibilities, her failure to account for her actions and conduct as a minister, her failure to comply with an order of the Senate, and her failure to correct misleading statements made both before the Senate and Senate committees do warrant severe censure. In this case, serious questions arise regarding Senator Nash's competence and her suitability for ministerial office. Senator Nash has been given ample time and ample opportunity to correct misleading statements she has made and to answer questions directed to her, not to mention provide a full explanation to the Senate regarding all the circumstances surrounding the removal of the Health Star Rating website. She has failed to do so.


First, some background. This website provided details of the Health Star Rating system, designed to give clear and accurate information about the nutritional content of packaged food. And given this government's repeated declarations that this is the age of personal responsibility, you might think that this website is exactly the sort of thing the government would be in favour of: providing tools to Australians to take personal responsibility for their choice of food. But Senator Nash's office went into overdrive to have the website removed. Mr Furnival—then Senator Nash's chief of staff—phoned an assistant secretary from the Department of Health, on 5 February, demanding the website be taken down. This occurred, of course, on the same day that the CEO of the Australian Food and Grocery Council, Mr Gary Dawson, phoned Senator Nash's office to express his concern that the website was premature.


The secretary of the Department of Health provided evidence at Senate estimates that the official who received Mr Furnival's call reported the call to a senior officer because 'it was above my pay grade'. An assistant adviser in the minister's office then spoke to an acting deputy secretary of the department, advising 'We would like the website to be taken down.' The deputy secretary advised that he was in a meeting and would look into it 'as soon as possible'. The assistant adviser again called the deputy secretary, 'roughly 15 minutes later', asking for progress—just 15 minutes later—and the pressure was really on. But the deputy secretary advised that he was still looking into the matter and consulting the acting secretary of the department. The acting deputy secretary then took a phone call from Senator Nash—approximately half an hour after her assistant adviser's last call requesting that the website be taken down. The department at this time, I suspect, probably realised they were fighting a losing battle and complied with the request.


Mr Furnival was not only Senator Nash's chief of staff at that point but also a co-owner and director of Strategic Issues Management, which wholly owns the company Australian Public Affairs—which lobbied on behalf of Mondelez, the parent company of Kraft Cadbury, a company which expressed concerns about the Health Star Rating system. And prior to becoming a ministerial staffer, Mr Furnival said that he was an economist for Cadbury. Another client of Mr Furnival's co-owned company APA was the Australian Beverages Council, whose members include Coca-Cola and PepsiCo and which also has a close interest in the development of the Health Star Rating system. 


In question time in the Senate, on 11 February, Senator Nash told the Senate:


… There is no connection, whatsoever, between my chief of staff and the company Australian Public Affairs. My chief of staff has no connection with the food industry and is simply doing his job …


This was simply not true. In fact, it was very far from the truth. Senator Nash claimed, in question time, on 12 February:


… my chief of staff complies with proper internal standards under the Statement of Standards for Ministerial Staff …


This was not true either. Senator Nash did make a statement to the Senate indicating Mr Furnival's spouse gave undertakings that APA:


… would not (a) make representations to either myself or Minister Dutton; (b) make representations to the Department of Health; or (c) make representations on behalf of any clients to other ministers of the Commonwealth in relation to the health portfolio.


That is not the test to be met in relation to ministerial staff standards—in fact, it is an arrangement that should not be necessary at all.


Unfortunately for the government and Senator Nash, we know that Mr Furnival breached at least three of the standards that all ministerial staff are obligated to adhere to. For the record, they are clauses 3, 4 and 6 of the Statement of Standards for Ministerial Staff. Mr Furnival failed to disclose and take reasonable steps to avoid any conflict of interest in connection of his employment, which is essential to conform with clause 3 of the statement.


Senator Nash should not have allowed that to happen. Mr Furnival also breached paragraph 4 of the standards. It says staff must:


Divest themselves, or relinquish control, of interests in any private company or business and/or direct interest in any public company involved in the area of their Ministers’ portfolio responsibilities.


Senator Nash should not have allowed that to happen either. He also breached paragraph 6 of the standards. It requires staff:


Have no involvement in outside employment or in the daily work of any business, or retain a directorship of a company, without the written agreement of their Minister and the Special Minister of State.


Senator Nash should not have allowed that to happen either. I note for the record that the Government Staffing Committee considers all ministerial appointments. This committee is centrally controlled by the Prime Minister's office—as so much is in the Abbott government. I also note that reasonable questions asked by senators at Senate estimates committees of ministers about the role of the Government Staffing Committee in the appointment of Mr Furnival were not answered, and I suspect reasonable questions that should have been asked about Mr Furnival's employment were not asked by any member of Mr Abbott's Government Staffing Committee either. But one thing that we can say for sure, as the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has confirmed, is that the Prime Minister personally approves all ministerial staff appointments.


Senator Nash claimed in Senate estimates on Wednesday, 26 February, in relation to her former chief of staff, Mr Furnival, that 'he had resigned as a director from the companies.' That was not true either, as the records of Australian Securities and Investments Commission showed. In fact, Mr Furnival ceased being a director of Strategic Issues Management Pty Ltd on 13 February 2013, about five months after he joined the minister's office and only after this became a matter of notoriety after questions were asked in this very chamber by the opposition. Then Senator Nash claimed in question time yesterday:


Mondelez has not been a client of APA since my former chief of staff worked for me. APA did no work for Mondelez. I cannot be any clearer than that.




Senator Abetz:
  That is right.




Senator FAULKNER:
  'That is right,' says the Leader of the Government—big mistake! But I will have to give you this, Eric, it is the only time you have actually engaged in the substance of the debate at all. The facts are that Mondelez was listed as a client on the federal lobbyists register until last month, and I understand—as we have heard today—it was still listed on the Victorian lobbyists register yesterday. It was another statement about this matter, this time in question time just yesterday, that is simply not true. In Senate estimates on Wednesday, 26 February, Senator Nash indicated that Mr Furnival provided her with a letter on his engagement as her chief of staff relating to conflicts of interest between his business affairs and his role as a ministerial staffer. The minister was asked in estimates by Senator Wong, the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, to provide a copy of that letter. The minister refused to do so. But not only did the minister refuse to do so in Senate estimates, she has now refused to provide it to this chamber. She has now refused to comply with an order of the Senate to provide a copy of the letter. I would say that is a very, very contemptuous attitude from a very, very embattled minister.


It appears that the failure to declare conflict of interest became a habit. There is a standing item on the agenda of the Legislative and Governance Forum on Food Regulation which requires members and supporting staff to declare any conflict of interest. Mr Furnival attended a meeting of that forum on 13 December 2013 in his official capacity with the minister. He made no declaration, and this also is a clear breach of the standing arrangements for what is a very important ministerial council. There are two key paragraphs in the statement of ministerial standards that I think are of particular relevance to Senator Nash and her conduct, and Senator Wong has mentioned these. The first of these is paragraph 3.2, which states:


… Ministers are required to ensure that official decisions made by them as Ministers are unaffected by bias or irrelevant consideration, such as considerations of private advantage or disadvantage.


The second is paragraph 4.4, which states:


Ministers are required to provide an honest and comprehensive account of their exercise of public office, and of the activities of the agencies within their portfolios, in response to any reasonable and bona fide enquiry by a member of the Parliament or a Parliamentary Committee.


Now we have codes of conduct for staff and for ministers, and everybody in this place knows it. This is because the decisions of government must be made and must be known to be made on their merits, because decisions must be made transparently and because ministers must represent the interests of the Australian public, not serve the interests of private companies. As the Prime Minister said in the forward to his own statement of ministerial standards:


… it is vital that Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries conduct themselves in a manner that will ensure public confidence in them and in the government.


The integrity of government processes is a fundamental underpinning to our democracy and to our democratic system. If the Australian community cannot have confidence that government decisions and actions are based on policy not patronage, then we cannot have faith that the votes that are cast are part of the directing government in determining our country's direction.


Senator Nash's clear breach of the standards relating to private advantage and disadvantage has far more widespread and extensive consequences than just the removal of a food-rating website. Her failure to provide an honest and comprehensive account of her actions compounds the damage of her actions. Ministers provide answers to parliament as a crucial part of accountability. It is one of the most important ways the Australian community finds out what is done by the government—what is done in their name.


To treat questions in the parliament and in parliamentary committees with contempt, is to treat with contempt the right of Australians to know how their government acts. It undermines the basic tenet of democracy: that we cast our votes based on the assessment of the alternatives. We have been invited by the government to put the case against Senator Nash in this censure motion. Senator Wong and I have addressed these issues in substance and in detail this afternoon.


This is why Senator Nash's actions are so serious and so deserving of censure. If the Prime Minister will not take any steps to protect what I think are the principles at the heart of our democracy, by acknowledging Senator Nash's egregious failures, and if he will not take the appropriate action then I say—and I hope the majority of the Senate will join me in saying this—the Senate must do just that by passing this censure motion.

"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2014-03-05,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Social Services) (16:17):  I think it is important to pause for a moment to reflect on the reason we are debating this censure motion. It is because Labor and the Greens combined to suspend standing orders. What we witnessed in that act was the band getting back together. The much heralded divorce proved to be only a trial separation. Those on this side of the chamber know that Labor and the Greens—



Honourable senators interjecting—



The PRESIDENT:  Order, on my left and on my right! The speakers have been heard in silence. It does not help if either side intervenes when the speaker is on their feet. The speaker is entitled to be heard in silence. If you wish to participate in the debate that is obviously something that remains within your province in this chamber. I ask both sides to respect the speaker.




Senator FIFIELD:
  As I was saying, the band is back together. Those of us on this side knew that Labor and the Greens were continuing to secretly cohabit. I know those on the left of politics around Australia will be rejoicing for this reunion.


The other interesting thing about the debate we have heard this afternoon is the deployment of Senator Faulkner. The Labor Party think, 'In case of emergency, break glass and deploy Senator Faulkner!' Whenever an argument is failing, they roll out Senator Faulkner to try and lend some of that well-honed gravitas to the argument that is before the chamber. We saw that today. Senator Faulkner was in high dudgeon, doing his very best confected-outrage routine. We know when we see Senator Faulkner mounting an argument in this place that Labor have effectively given up the case that they are prosecuting. 


If Labor had their hearts in this—if they believed for a second the argument that they are seeking to put in this place—why would we not have had a single frontbencher other than Senator Wong? Senator Moore spoke on the suspension motion. I acknowledge Senator Moore's contribution there. When we move down the line, was Senator Conroy going to participate? I do not think so. I really do not think Senator Conroy would be in a very strong position to contribute to this debate. Perhaps Senator Polley could have spoken? I will let that be a rhetorical proposition! Senator Cameron?—again, I do not think so. I guess colleagues are getting my point: there are not too many options on the front bench on the other side when it comes to people to prosecute cases. When an argument is particularly in trouble they bring back Senator Faulkner. We saw that today, so we can put that aside.


There have been some very serious allegations made today against Minister Nash. She has been accused of misleading the Senate. She has been accused of failure to comply with an order of the Senate. She has been accused of a failure to account for her actions. They are serious allegations and they should never be made lightly in this place. As Senator Brandis said, to impugn someone's motives, someone's behaviour or someone's conduct without being able to back that up is a very serious thing to do. It is an appalling thing to do.


What we have witnessed in the course of this debate is that the goalposts have continually moved, in terms of what it is that minister Nash is supposedly guilty of. The goalposts keep changing. I must say I have been following this debate in this place, in estimates and in question time, very closely. I have found it extremely difficult to work out what the precise charge against Minister Nash is. This first that was levelled was the question of whether there was a delay between the first question that Minister Nash answered in question time and when she came into the chamber to provide additional information that she thought was appropriate and necessary.


Labor have been getting hysterical. They have been hyperventilating over the fact that Senator Nash came into the chamber on the same day. I would have thought that it was a minimum standard that a colleague comes into this place on the same day. The time period that elapsed was six hours, and we are meant to gasp that there was a six-hour gap.


I would encourage colleagues who may not have been in the community affairs estimates committee last week to refer to the Hansard evidence of Senator Stephen Parry, the Deputy President of the Senate. An unusual thing happened in that Senate estimates hearing. Senator Parry sought the opportunity in that committee to make a statement. Usually, as we know, the format for estimates is that questions are asked and answers are given. Senator Parry sought the indulgence of the committee because he wanted to assist in their deliberations—and I acknowledge that Senator Faulkner and Senator Wong provided Senator Parry with that opportunity. What Senator Parry wanted to do was to forensically go through that six-hour period which Senator Nash supposedly was using to not come into this chamber. I refer colleagues—it is well worth reading—to the Hansard of the community affairs estimates of Wednesday, 26 February 2014. Senator Parry went through the pattern and the flow of what happened in this chamber on that day and made it very clear that Senator Nash availed herself of the first practical, reasonable opportunity to provide additional information to this chamber. I know colleagues around this room hold Senator Parry in some regard, and Senator Parry did a very forensic job at analysing the pattern and flow of that day. So I think we can put completely to one side that argument that Senator Nash in some way delayed providing information to the Senate. She takes her responsibilities very seriously, and she took the first appropriate and reasonable opportunity to provide that information.


Then there is the issue of the failure to comply with the Senate order, which, I guess, is the latest charge. The first charge was the six-hour delay; this failure, supposedly, to provide information to the Senate chamber is the latest charge. Senator Nash did respond to the order of the Senate. We all know in this place that, when you respond to an order of the Senate, those who put in the request might not necessarily like the way that you respond. They might not necessarily like the content of your response to the Senate, but the fact is that Senator Nash did respond to that order of the Senate. As to her response, which was in relation to documentation related to with Mr Furnival, her former chief of staff: I am pretty unsurprised by the content of her letter. I quote: 'The correspondence referred to contains information relating to the personal affairs of an individual staff member. It was provided to me on a confidential basis and it is not the practice of either past or present governments to divulge personal information about individual staff. I have outlined the relevant undertakings to the Senate previously and I refer honourable senators to the relevant Senate and estimates Hansard.' That is an entirely appropriate approach. Staff members of members and senators are entitled to some confidentiality about their particular circumstances. They are not members of parliament; they cannot defend themselves in various forums. So I think it is an entirely orthodox approach that Senator Nash has taken in responding to the order of the Senate.


The other allegation which, I guess, has been thrown about—between the first charge of a delay in providing information to the Senate and the last charge of failing to respond to an order of the Senate; the accusation that has bounced around between those two goalposts—has been that of a conflict of interest. I have listened closely to Senator Nash and I believe that appropriate steps were taken to deal with potential conflicts of interest. In any ministerial office there are a range of potential conflicts of interest. What matters is what steps are taken and how those are managed. We know that there were steps taken towards divestment and that there were appropriate undertakings given. So I struggle with the proposition of a conflict of interest.


Then, between those two goalposts I mentioned before, we have had thrown around the issue of disclosure. Has Minister Nash appropriately disclosed all that she needs to? Minister Nash has answered question after question in this chamber during question time. Minister Nash answered question after question, hour after hour, in the community affairs estimates committee. And today, where Minister Nash, in the debate about the suspension of standing orders, did not shy away from rising to her feet and making her case—she had no hesitation at all. She has taken every opportunity to provide a full account of herself.


I guess what this debate really comes down to—and I think it is something that we probably would all agree with—is that public life is a test of character, ultimately. The conduct of senators in this place is a test of character on a daily basis. The conduct of ministers in their roles is, on a daily basis, a test of character. I have no doubt that Minister Nash, as a senator, passes the test of character in terms of her behaviour and conduct. I have no doubt that Minister Nash, in her capacity as a minister in the execution of her duties, passes that test of character. But, when it comes to a test of character in the conduct of one's duties as a frontbencher, I want to draw a contrast between Minister Nash as a frontbencher and Senator Conroy as a frontbencher. I think we all recall Senator Conroy in the immigration estimates committee, where it is now a matter of record that Senator Conroy accused Lieutenant General Angus Campbell AO DSC of being engaged in a political cover-up. I witnessed Senator Conroy warming up for that particular activity in the communications estimates hearing, where he accused Dr Ziggy Switkowski of being a liar, of misleading the Senate and of being in contempt of the Senate. So, if we are going to compare the conduct of frontbenchers as a test of character, I will put Minister Nash up against Senator Conroy any day of the week.


I cannot help but think, knowing how fond Senator Conroy is of Jack Nicholson movies, having cited A Few Good Men, that in the immigration estimates hearing he was combining two other Jack Nicholson roles—Jack Nicholson in The Shining and Jack Nicholson in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest—such is his fondness for Jack Nicholson movies. I refer to Senator Conroy to make the point that those opposite throw words around like confetti. They forget that words have meaning. That is why we saw Senator Conroy, in the communications estimates hearing, talking about Dr Switkowski lying, talking about Dr Switkowski being in contempt, talking about Dr Switkowski misleading the Senate: lying, contempt, misleading. Here today, we are again seeing that pattern of throwing words around as though they have no meaning. This time we are seeing the word 'censure'—this chamber seeks to censure Minister Nash for the charges laid out by Senator Wong. I point out to those opposite that words do have meaning. You cannot just walk into a Senate estimates hearing and accuse someone of being a liar. You cannot just walk into a Senate estimates hearing and accuse someone of misleading the Senate. You cannot just walk into a Senate estimates hearing and accuse someone of being in contempt.




Senator Wong:
  You can't walk in here as a minister and say things that are a lie.




Senator FIFIELD:
  And you cannot just walk into this place and throw the word 'censure' out there in relation to the activities of a minister.




Senator Wong:
  She keeps saying things which are not true, and you are defending it.



The PRESIDENT:  Order! You have had your opportunity to participate. Senator Fifield has the call.




Senator FIFIELD:
  I guess I would call this approach to discourse in this place a Conrovian approach. Those opposite do need to pause and they do need to think very carefully before they make charges against people, whether they be witnesses at estimates hearings or ministers in this place. You must think very carefully about the words that you use and that you choose to level against people in the conduct of the parliament.


I think there are examples of genuine misconduct in public life—genuine misconduct in the form of the Australian Labor Party before an election saying that they would not introduce a carbon tax. I think that is serious political misconduct. And they did—we know they did. Before another election, they promised that they would be abolishing the carbon tax, and they have opposed that. I refer to those two examples because, as I say, the debate before us is about character. The charge that is being levelled at Minister Nash is that she has failed the test of character in her conduct as a minister, which I reject. I level the charge at the other side that they have failed, collectively, the test of character in public life with their repeated misleading of the Australian people before subsequent elections. I make the charge that Senator Conroy has failed the test of character in his conduct as a frontbench member.


Senator Wong has said that if this motion passes, she thinks that Senator Nash should resign. We have got to see it for what it is—it is a trumped up charge, and no such thing should happen if this motion passes. I think Senator Conroy should resign for his conduct. If we are talking about failing character tests, he has failed clearly, absolutely and utterly.


At the heart of the allegations made in the censure motion is the accusation that there has been a vested interest of some sort at play in Minister Nash's office—again, I have seen no evidence of this. However, on the other side of politics we see vested interests at play each and every day. We see them at play in the cheek by jowl relationship between the Australian Labor Party and various trade unions—not all trade unions; there are some good trade unions, but there are some trade unions that are not so good, and one of those is the HSU. If we want examples of vested interests inappropriately at play in public life then we need look no further than the relationship the Australian Labor Party has with certain trade unions. We have also seen some very curious relationships between the Australian Greens and certain individuals who give money to the Australian Greens. There are vested interests at the heart of the activities of the Australian Greens.


Senator Nash is a person of the utmost integrity. Those of us who know her well have no difficulty in trusting in her appropriate execution of the roles and responsibilities of a minister. Those of us who know Senator Nash have no difficulty trusting that she appropriately fulfils her obligations as a senator and—even more importantly—that she fulfils her obligations to this chamber, that she is accountable to it, that she is answerable to it, and that she answers each and every question put to her. We have seen her do that day after day.


We need in this place to be very careful before moving censure motions. As I say, words have meaning; words have power. They are not to be used lightly. We have seen a pattern emerging from those opposite where they will say anything about anyone for political advantage. Senator Conroy is exhibit No. 1 in that regard. I would urge those opposite to take the opportunity to pause and step back from this motion. It is not justified. It is not warranted. The charges against Senator Nash have not been proved. She has taken every opportunity to account for herself. As far as I am concerned, the fact that Mr Furnival has now left Senator Nash's office means the matter is closed. I do not accept for a second that there was an issue at play, but the fact that Mr Furnival has now left the office puts beyond any doubt that there is any matter that remains to be addressed.


I would urge colleagues not to support this motion, I would urge the Australian Greens not to support this motion and I would urge Labor senators not to support this motion. It is one of the gravest allegations that can be levelled against a colleague—that they are deserving of censure. Senator Nash is not deserving of censure; she is a person of integrity, she is a senator of integrity and she is a minister of integrity. She has given tremendous service to this place and she will continue to give tremendous service to this place, not only as a senator but also as a minister, for many years to come.

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2014-03-05,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria) (16:38):  The substance of the defence from the government is that Senator Nash has provided answers to the allegations before her. It was the substance of the defence outlined by Senator Fifield and, previously, by Senator Abetz and Senator Brandis. On that we agree: she has provided answers. She has provided answers to the Senate during question time, she has provided answers during Senate estimates and she has provided answers here today. What we take issue with is the content of those answers. That is the issue here: it is not good enough to say that you have answered allegations, and that is the end of the matter. It is the content of those answers that is at issue.


Senator Wong and Senator Faulkner have gone through the sequence of events in great detail. I will not do that again. I will not dwell on the specific issues that have been addressed. I will, however, turn to a few points. The first issue is that—and people who are following this debate may not necessarily have followed every detail, so I will try and summarise it—during Senate estimates, Senator Nash said, clearly she knew Mr Furnival; she had known him for years; they had a longstanding relationship; due diligence was carried out; and they were fully aware of his relationship with the lobbying firm. There were no questions about that. What I cannot square off is that, in Senate question time, Senator Nash went on to say, very clearly:


There is no connection whatsoever between my chief of staff and the company Australian Public Affairs.


I understand that sometimes we are caught on the hop in this place. Sometimes we panic. Sometimes we might not understand the question correctly. That is fine; that is what happens. But Senator Nash has been given a number of occasions to explain how we can square those two completely contradictory statements from her. On one hand, 'I have known him for a long time; I am fully aware of his connection to the company—in fact, we performed due diligence on his appointment', and on the other hand, to come in here and say, 'There is no connection whatsoever between Mr Furnival and the company.' It does not make sense. And without a thorough explanation, the only conclusion that we can come to is that the Senate was deliberately misled.


Then there is the issue of the conflict of interest. Again, just a few facts: that Mr Furnival owned the company with his wife. Let us be clear about that. He was a director of the company with his wife. He owned it and directed the company. We know that the ministerial code of conduct says very clearly—and this is not an area of ambiguity, if you have a pecuniary interest in an area in which a minister is involved, then that is a conflict of interest. This is a clear conflict of interest. Yet what we are told is that steps were undertaken to ensure that conflict of interest was dealt with—and we are provided with no evidence to confirm that those steps in fact have taken place. It is a clear conflict and, for me, it is a lesson in how you deal with a situation like this. The first thing is, you have to accept this point—that facts do not matter; that when you come into the Senate, facts simply do not matter. We are entering a parallel universe here, where black is white and white is black. When you are in a political crisis, dig in; if you are going to tell a lie, tell a big one and tell it often.


For me the biggest concern here is not the issue around the appointment of Mr Furnival. It is not the fact that there was a conflict of interest. It goes to the heart of everything that is wrong with our Australian democracy at the moment—that is, the privileged role of special interests in the Australian parliament. Earlier today, we voted against gambling reforms because of the power of the pokies industry. Everybody remembers what happened during the mining tax debate, when the mining industry came to town and we saw the previous government turn its back on what would have been an excellent reform. We are hearing now about moves afoot to wind back protections for consumers in the financial services industry. We have my colleague, Senator Whish-Wilson, pushing to try and get container deposit legislation. And who are the biggest obstacles to that? The Australian Beverages Council, one of Mr Furnival's clients. That is the issue here. That is the problem that makes meaningful reform very difficult. It has a corrosive impact on the Australian parliament. If we look at the specific portfolio area that Minister Nash is responsible for, what are the great health challenges? What are they? One is obesity. We have a country with one of the highest obesity rates anywhere in the world. What was proposed? Providing consumers with information via a star rating website that made it very clear to consumers—to individuals—that some foods that they may have thought were healthy were in fact less healthy than they thought, or the reverse. That is what this reform was about.


What really confuses me here is that on the one hand we have a conservative government that says the only way for markets to work efficiently is if we have a decent flow of information, yet here we are with a reform that provides consumers with information and we have Mr Furnival, whose lobbying firm works on behalf of the junk food industry, preventing consumers from getting access to that information. Here is the paradox for the coalition: are they going to be true to that Liberal philosophy that says consumers should get access to good information, or is their connection to big business so entrenched that they will deny people that information?


Look at the area of alcohol reform. We recently had a big national debate about the issue of alcohol fuelled violence and alcohol related harm. At the same time, we had the defunding of an alcohol and other drugs agency on the basis that the work they were doing was duplicated by other agencies—which, we learnt through Senate estimates, simply was not true. When it comes to tobacco control we have a party—and a minister who belongs to that party—continuing to take donations from the tobacco industry. How is it that a party, and a minister, who has control over tobacco policy can continue to be the only party in the Australian parliament that continues to take donations from an industry that kills people? It is another obvious conflict.


No-one here enjoys this business. A censure motion is a serious thing. And of course there is a human element to all of this. I do not know Senator Nash. I am sure she is a decent person. But this is not about whether she is a decent person. Sometimes, good people make serious mistakes. Senator Nash has made a number of serious mistakes. What needs to happen now is straightforward. The website that was taken down should immediately be reinstated. People should not be denied access to information that will improve their health. If it is not the role of government to protect the health of the Australian community, then I do not know what we are doing here. The funding for the Alcohol and Other Drugs Council should be immediately reinstated. We need to ensure that the National Party are dragged into the 21st century and that they join the Greens, the Australian Labor Party and, most recently, the Liberal Party in ruling out donations from the tobacco industry. In taking these actions, the minister can demonstrate that she does put the health of the Australian community ahead of those privileged special interests. She needs to correct the record on the statements she has made, and then she should do the dignified thing and resign as minister.



The PRESIDENT:  The question is that the motion moved by Senator Wong be agreed to.

The speech read as follows—



TRADE AND FOREIGN INVESTMENT (PROTECTING THE PUBLIC INTEREST) BILL 2014


Trade is a crucial part of Australia’s economic development. It helps Australia grow, it opens markets overseas, and it allows us to export our world class goods and services across the world. It is also good for our trading partners; it allows them more access to our marketplace and our consumers.


Dismantling trade barriers promotes competition; domestic industries must compete with the best in the world. This forces them to adapt, innovate and focus on the most successful parts of their business.


However, for many, the dismantling of trade barriers can be a disruptive experience. Governments need to be aware of the impact trade agreements can have on ordinary people and their families. The Government’s role is to be there to help people make the necessary transition with financial and retraining support.


There are many positives in trade and trade agreements but it is incorrect to assert that those who find fault in free trade agreements are anti-trade. It is a simplistic and spurious line designed to dismiss the genuine concerns that individuals and organisations have.


One focus of great concern in current free trade agreements is the inclusion of Investor State Dispute Settlement provisions, commonly known as ISDS. ISDS clauses are designed to allow foreign corporations to sue governments if their business activities and interests are impinged on by the policy and legislative decisions of the government. The key concept which is enshrined in these clauses is the idea of ‘indirect expropriation,’ under which any law or policy of government that reduces the value of the investment is considered harmful.


Foreign investment is an important part of trade and in fact it has become a more central part of trade agreements than the traditional exchange of goods and services. The conflict between corporations and policy sovereignty is a very complex and sensitive area. Foreign investment is important for Australia and many other countries. Sovereign risk is an important consideration for companies who want to invest in foreign countries; risk is a part of doing business. The purpose of ISDS clauses is to push more of that risk onto governments and away from corporations.


The Australian Government is currently being sued under ISDS clauses as a result of the legislative decision the previous Government took to only allow cigarettes to be sold in plain packaging. This is occurring under the 1993 Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of Hong Kong for the Promotion and Protection of Investments.


This followed two High Court challenges to the plain packaging legislation which were dismissed. Ukraine, Honduras and the Dominican Republic are currently using World Trade Organisation rules to also challenge this piece of Government legislation which is aimed at protecting the health of Australians.


The highest court in Australia has dismissed the case and the World Trade Organisation’s mechanisms are being used to dispute it; there are clearly mechanisms in place to appeal decisions. The case for why an additional avenue of litigation needs to be established in this area has not been made.


There are ISDS clauses in a number of Australia’s agreements with other countries, including in the recently signed Korea Australia Free Trade Agreement (KAFTA), the Singapore FTA, the Chile FTA, the ASEAN FTA and the Thai FTA. It is believed that the Trans-Pacific partnership agreement which is currently under negotiation has ISDS clauses on the table as well.


In May 2013 the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development, in a paper entitled Recent developments in Investor State Dispute Settlement (ISDS), asserted that 244 cases under ISDS have been completed. Of the 244, approximately 42% were decided in favour of the State and approximately 31% in favour of the investor. This left 27% of the cases that were settled before an arbitration decision was made. These figures show that statistically states are hardly the overwhelming winners in these cases.


The Government has said on the record that the majority of cases have found against the companies. The figures I just quoted do not bear this out.


Even if it were true, that in the majority of cases signatory governments do win ISDS cases brought against them, there is still the cost that governments must bear to defend their cases. I have put questions on notice to the all the Departments currently involved in defending the ISDS case Australia is currently defending over cigarette plain packaging to ask about the costs. I look forward to their answers and to sharing them with the Parliament and the public.


In the plain packaging example, the Government has taken a straightforward public health measure that has survived two High Court challenges and still the Government must defend itself to corporations whose only interest, whose only reason for being, is to make profit.


The influence of ISDS goes beyond the direct impact of cases. In their 2010 report the Productivity Commission identified the phenomenon of ‘regulatory chilling.’ In other words ISDS provisions mean governments second guess themselves on whether a public policy initiative will cause an arbitration claim to be made against them by a foreign corporation. Government decision making not only has to take into account the country’s interest but also those of foreign companies. This is not something I believe governments should prioritise when they are formulating public policy.


The Government justifies ISDS by giving examples of countries where they believe the rule of law will be a problem for Australian companies who are investing. If this is the reason why are there ISDS clauses in the Korea-Australia FTA and the Singapore-Australia FTA, just to provide two examples?


In the FTA that was negotiated with the United States and was implemented in 2004, there was an acknowledgment, and I quote, from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade fact sheet released at the time and still available on the website:


“Reflecting the fact that both countries have robust, developed legal systems for resolving disputes between foreign investors and government, the Agreement does not include any provisions for investor-state dispute settlement.”


What exactly has changed? The robust, developed legal system we have in Australia certainly hasn’t been altered in any material way. This example demonstrates just how fast moving the trade space is. As Nobel Laureate Paul Krugman wrote in the New York Times on February 27:


“The first thing you need to know about trade deals in general is that they aren’t what they used to be. The glory days of trade negotiations … which sharply reduced tariffs around the world—are long behind us.”


Trade deals revolve around accommodating investment flows into and out of countries more than the dismantling of trade barriers. This is why ISDS provisions, which were seen as unnecessary in the early part of the 2000s, have become part of the standard template for free trade agreements.


The Government tells us there are carve outs for important areas of public policy such as health and the environment. This hasn’t stopped corporations trying their hand across the world through these types of clauses. When there are profits on the line, corporations will do their best—in fact they are set up to pursue profits and earnings—to try to find loopholes in these clauses. If they see some kind of advantage in litigating they will do it. What happens to a state or local government who is sued by a foreign corporation with vastly deeper pockets? Why is the Government opening Australia up to this?


This Government by its own admission is ‘open for business.’ It’s more than a slogan to this Government. The Prime Minister thinks saying it on the world stage miraculously leads to economic growth. What it really means is this Government is open to influence from business. Forget the public interest; special interests are what really matters to them.


Corporate interests in Australia are in favour of ISDS because it protects them from risk in investing in other countries. According to the United Nations ‘in 66% of new cases respondents are developing or transition economies and while the number of cases initiated by developing country investors has increased, the majority of new cases (64%) still originate from developed countries.’


The Productivity Commission in their November 2010 report Bilateral and Regional Trade Agreements made clear their thinking on ISDS. They outlined:


“In relation specifically to investor-state dispute settlement provisions, the government should seek to avoid accepting provisions in trade agreements that confer additional substantive or procedural rights on foreign investors over and above those already provided by the Australian legal system. Nor is it advisable in trade negotiations for Australia to expend bargaining coin to seek such rights over foreign governments, as a means of managing investment risks inherent in investing in foreign countries. Other options are available to investors”.


The Productivity Commission made a number of other recommendations about trade agreements and anyone interested in Australia’s approach to trade agreements should take the time to read the report.


The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development 2013 issues note, Recent Developments in Investor-State Dispute Settlement, has also indicated the problems inherent in the global system of ISDS. They sound a warning and I quote:


“the continuing trend of investors challenging generally applicable public policies, contradictory decisions issued by tribunals, an increasing number of dissenting opinions, concerns about arbitrators’ potential conflicts of interest all illustrate the problems inherent in the system”.


Transparency in trade agreements generally is an ongoing concern. Parliament is only able to review trade agreements once Cabinet has signed off on them. Even then Parliament is only entitled to a yes or no vote. There is no scope for amendments or exemptions. This means consultation is a crucial element of trade agreements.


The European Union is currently negotiating an FTA with the US. They recently decided to suspend negotiations for three months as a result of community concern about ISDS and run a comprehensive, transparent consultation process about ISDS.


The same level of community concern exists in Australia about ISDS and this concern is only rising. I would urge the Government to monitor this EU process closely and strongly consider doing something similar in Australia. I believe that most Australians would agree with the Productivity Commission and would be opposed to the powers extended to private corporations under ISDS.


This Bill seeks to ban ISDS provisions in new trade agreements. The Greens believe there shouldn’t be ISDS provisions in any agreements, but we recognise that the legislation we are presenting is not retrospective.


Sovereign governments should not be challenged simply for making laws to govern their country or making a decision to protect their environment or the health of their citizens. What happens to laws governing coal seam gas legislation or the ban on genetically manipulated organisms in my home state of Tasmania? Under ISDS there is great uncertainty. Uncertainty that is unnecessary.


The Australian people elect their governments and their parliaments to design and implement legislation. Their sovereignty should be respected.


I seek leave to continue my remarks later.


Leave granted; debate adjourned.

   (C) this nation has smashed just about every glass ceiling, but we need to do more - we need to do more,


(ii) that there is still a 17 per cent gap in pay between Australian men and women,


(iii) the Workplace Gender Equality Agency is now collecting and analysing data from eligible businesses which will enable employers to develop better gender equality strategies,


(iv) the important work done by the Workplace Gender Equality Agency, including the collection of critical gender workplace reporting data needed to address the gender pay gap in Australia, and


(v) that continued collections of such data will provide evidence of improvements over time; and


(b) recognises and congratulates the Workplace Gender Equality Agency on its work since inception of the reporting data on gender equality indicators.

Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Social Services) (17:05):  Mr Deputy President, I seek leave to make a short statement.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted.




Senator FIFIELD:
  The coalition is proud of its achievements for the advancement of gender equality. It was, after all, the former Howard government that passed laws in 1999 to create reporting requirements and establish the Equal Opportunity for Women in the Workplace Agency. When Mr Abbott was workplace relations minister the gender pay gap in Australia was at 15.3 per cent. But now, after six years of Labor, it is at 17.1 per cent. The government is also proposing a fair dinkum Paid Parental Leave scheme, holding a childcare review by the Productivity Commission and fleshing out individual flexibility agreements to allow for working women to better balance their work and family needs.


As a government, we do hold concerns about the minimum reporting standards that Labor created, which will take effect on 1 April. We know, for instance, that the compliance costs of the new standards will cost employers a further $9 million a year, regardless of whether they are good gender equality employers or not. We want to see genuine and meaningful change, not burdensome red tape that does not actually change behaviour.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  The question is that the motion moved by Senator Waters be agreed to.

  I raise the same matter I have raised before: as a member of this committee I know that the committee is fully engaged currently on inquiries into chemicals, into beef levies, into beehives and into a number of other issues of great importance to Australia—and committee members simply do not have the time to address this as well. I know what the outcome of this inquiry will be, because Labor and the Greens have already announced their positions in relation to Qantas. So we are going to go through the whole process of having an inquiry to come up with what Labor and the Greens have already announced is their view of Qantas. It seems to me to be just another waste of the very valuable time of the Senate and senators.

The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Leave is granted for one minute.




Senator XENOPHON:
  I indicate that, notwithstanding what Senator Macdonald has said, I have faith not only in the secretariat and in the committee but also in the members of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee to look at these issues. It is important to ensure that the future of Qantas is examined very closely. This is an opportunity to do so—




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  So the Greens are going to give you some idea of how to run a business?



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Order!




Senator XENOPHON:
  I think it is fair to say, to respond to Senator Macdonald, that because there is a Qantas Sale Act and Qantas has sought a debt guarantee from taxpayers, these are legitimate matters that ought to be looked at in a Senate inquiry. That is why I think it is important that we deal with this: because of the critical juncture that Qantas is at.

Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (17:22):  I move:


That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:


""The need for the Government to honour its election commitment to rollout fibre-to-the-premises broadband to no less than 200,000 premises in Tasmania.""


Those opposite come in here and talk about mandates. They yell and scream and huff and puff about their mandate to do this and their mandate to do that; yet, on one clear infrastructure project that they do have a mandate on, they perform an almighty backflip and get completely tangled in the wires. There was a clear commitment to rollout fibre-to-the-premises broadband to no fewer than 200,000 premises in Tasmania. The people of Tasmania have been deceived once by the Liberal Party. They deserve to know the Liberal Party's true intentions today.


 


The challenge for those on the other side, if they are able to keep their election commitment, will be not only to speak to the urgency motion and to quietly allow this motion to pass later this afternoon but to outline their party's path to ensuring the fibre-to-the-premises rollout is completed in Tasmania. It is simply not good enough to say that the aerial rollout trial has been announced, because such a trial was announced almost three weeks ago by the minister. It is a trial that Dr Switkowski seemed totally disinterested in at Senate estimates last week, a trial without locations, a trial without a start date and a trial without a purpose, because the work has already been done.


Tasmania has been on the path to fibre to the home since the state Labor government first completed an aerial fibre-to-the-home trial in 2008. The trial of over 1,200 premises was found by an independent review to be successful, and the learnings were incorporated into the federal government's National Broadband Network. Most of stage 1 of the NBN rollout in Tasmania incorporated an aerial fibre-to-the-premises rollout. Stage 2 of the rollout, currently underway, utilises above-ground infrastructure. With many thousands of Tasmanians connected to the NBN with above-ground fibre, it is no wonder that NBN Co has not released any details about a trial.


They know, like we all do, that the time for trials is over. Now it is time to complete the fibre-to-the-premises rollout that was contracted for by NBN Co in March 2012—the rollout that the Liberals opposed, then supported, then opposed and then supported before the election, have since supported and then opposed and now say they will support again but only if a further trial meets undisclosed hurdles.


The Liberals in opposition relied on precise technicalities of their commitment to appear bipartisan on this issue. There was never unqualified support for the fibre-to-the-premises rollout. They understood how much Tasmanians wanted this rollout, how Tasmanians saw high-speed broadband as a way of connecting their island to the world and how Tasmanian businesses are delivering their products to customers quicker with the NBN and enabling them to compete in the global market and live in the most beautiful place on earth.


Let me just take the Senate through the great entanglement the Liberal Party has got itself into on this issue. As we know, the contracts were signed by NBN Co and Visionstream in March 2012. The media release from NBN Co at the time remarked that the construction contract would see Tasmania be the first state in Australia with the NBN. The whole entanglement stems from Mr Turnbull's desire to only ever commit to anything based on existing contracts. The coalition released its broadband policy around a year ago, amongst much fanfare and complete with holograms. Crucially, this policy failed to mention the special case of the fibre-to-the-premises NBN rollout in Tasmania. There was no mention of Tasmania in the whole document. Two months later Mr Turnbull sought to clarify the concerns of Tasmanians with the now infamous line 'that the coalition intended to honour existing contracts'.


At the start of the election campaign Mr Turnbull repeated his assurance on ABC radio. However, when Mr Abbott launched the coalition's economic growth plan for Tasmania, the commitment had been watered down to honouring only contracts that were underway. In response to concerns raised by Labor, Mr Turnbull again told Tasmanians on 16 August that he would honour all contracts. It was clear that Mr Turnbull's intention was for Tasmanians to believe that this meant full fibre to the premises. Of course, buried inside the coalition policy document of March last year is their out-clause:


The Coalition reserves the right to review and seek to vary any of those contracts in light of the Coalition’s broadband policy …


If genuine about their commitment to the fibre-to-the-premises rollout in Tasmania, Mr Turnbull or one of his federal Tasmanian colleagues would have corrected the reports of August 2013 that did not mention this crucial fact. If genuine, they would have included this line in media releases, in promotional material and in letters to the editor. But the spin was working too well. At least twice that week Senator Bushby backed up his shadow minister with public comments. The first was:


In opposition, we're not fully au fait with what those contracts are, but we understand that those contracts are in place to roll out right across the state, and if that is the case, we will honour that.


Five days later Senator Bushby again sought to make sure Tasmanians believed that there was a unity ticket. He said:


… Malcolm Turnbull has made a crystal clear commitment that the Coalition will honour all contracts in place for the rollout of the NBN in Tasmania. If contracts are in place for the full fibre rollout, there will be no difference in who gets fibre to their home in Tasmania under Labor or Liberal.


The Tasmanian IT industry group released a statement welcoming Mr Turnbull's announcement of the commitment to complete the fibre-to-the-home rollout in Tasmania. Of course Mr Turnbull and Senator Bushby did nothing to correct the record. In trade practices law this is known as misleading and deceptive conduct by inaction.


Of course, Mr Turnbull, Senator Bushby and the Liberal Party were quite happy with the misinformation they had created. In fact, it continued right through until February this year. In October there was the 'what is construction' debacle when new Tasmanian Liberal MP Brett Whiteley sought to justify the sudden change in the rollout maps by dismissing the work of planners, engineers and estimators, despite Mr Turnbull participating on the Joint Committee on the National Broadband Network, which included vital design stages and consultation work on the definition of 'construction'. In December Dr Switkowski confirmed to Senator Thorp at a Senate committee hearing that NBN Co is still releasing work for all fibre rollouts. He said:


The release of work happens in smaller quantities, and the next significant quantity, which is an all-fibre rollout, is being currently negotiated.


This is a matter of urgency because Tasmanians need to hear about where the Liberals went so wrong. Liberal senators need to justify their election commitment that there would be no difference under Labor or Liberal, because there never was a unity ticket. NBN Co. boss Ziggy Switkowski confirmed the great fears of many Tasmanians last month. On ABC radio in Tasmania, Dr Switkowski confirmed that the contracts had been renegotiated and that many thousands of Tasmanians would actually get the multi-technology mix—a fancy way of saying substandard copper.


Tasmanian Premier Lara Giddings was straight onto Mr Turnbull and Dr Switkowski to offer an alternative. Tasmanian Labor offered NBN Co. the use of Aurora Energy power poles for distribution of fibre to the premises across the state. Tasmanian Labor's plan would see a faster rollout of fibre to the home. The plan would see the rollout completed at one-sixth of the cost of building underground. The plan presents a way for the federal Liberal government to meet its commitment to the Tasmanian people.


So great was this Labor initiative that Tasmanian Liberal leader Will Hodgman used a pre-existing trip to Sydney to meet with Mr Turnbull to seek federal support for the aerial rollout. In his press conference after the meeting, Mr Turnbull said that Mr Hodgman had 'definitely drunk the fibre-to-the-premises Kool Aid.' Instead of accepting this good proposal, Mr Turnbull would only commit to a trial. It is a trial that we all know is unnecessary; a trial that Dr Switkowski could not confirm any details about; a trial that many Tasmanians view as a nice smokescreen to get Mr Hodgman through the state election next week; a trial that will no doubt face extraordinarily—even impossibly—high hurdles; a trial that will no doubt be designed to fail; a trial that is just another Liberal con, because anyone who recognises the benefits of fibre to the premises has drunk the Kool Aid, in the words of Minister Turnbull 


This urgency motion aims to ensure that Mr Turnbull keeps just one promise. That promise is to build fibre to the premises in Tasmania as originally planned by Labor. Liberal senators must outline their path to delivering fibre to the premises. (Time expired)

"Fifield, Sen Mitch",LP,2014-03-05,"



Senator FIFIELD
 (Victoria—Manager of Government Business in the Senate and Assistant Minister for Social Services) (17:32):  I know that a Tasmanian state election is only about 10 days away, but it is still no excuse or justification for Senator Urquhart to misrepresent what Senator Bushby said before the election in relation to the NBN in Tasmania. I will leave it to Senator Bushby to do a forensic dissection of Senator Urquhart's misrepresentation. I very much look forward to listening to Senator Bushby when he has the opportunity to set the record straight as a result of the misrepresentations by those opposite.


I will start at more of a macro level, to put the NBN as a national venture into a bit of context. When it comes to the NBN nationwide, it would be fair to say that never before has so much been spent on so few for so little. Minister Turnbull has likened the scope and scale of Labor's mismanagement of the NBN to that of the state bank debacles in Victoria and South Australia. I think that, when it has been tallied, in the fullness of time, the cost of the NBN and Labor's mismanagement of it will be shown to have been greater than those financial disasters. It is very difficult to underestimate just how badly it was mismanaged and what the cost to the Australian people will be. I stand in great admiration of Minister Turnbull and his efforts to bring the NBN back onto a sustainable footing and to put the NBN in a position where it will be able to start seriously rolling out a National Broadband Network to the Australian people.


The great lie that has been perpetrated by those opposite is that Labor is for the National Broadband Network and the coalition is against the National Broadband Network. That has never been true. We are for a National Broadband Network. Everyone in Australia is for a National Broadband Network. The question is: how do you deliver a National Broadband Network quickly, at lowest cost to the taxpayer and in a way that delivers for consumers a product that is within their reach? That is all this debate in relation to the National Broadband Network has ever been about. We are for the National Broadband Network.


It is important to note that Labor's plan would have cost $29 billion more than they had let on before the election and would have increased monthly internet bills by up to 80 per cent, or $43, a month. It is very important that I make the point that everyone in Tasmania will still receive the National Broadband Network. The job of those of us in the government is to do that sooner than would have happened under the Australian Labor Party and to do it at a lower cost to the taxpayer than would have been the case under the Australian Labor Party. We are going to incorporate into the NBN technologies that can be readily upgraded and that are already delivering high-speed broadband to families in other countries. We will be able to do just that. We are on course to deliver more NBN connections to Tasmanian homes and businesses this calendar year than over the entire five years since the rollout began.


Premier Giddings in Tasmania is attempting to distract attention. You can understand that. They have been in government for 16 years. They have been in an alliance with the Greens—something those opposite know very well. You cannot be critical of Premier Giddings for wanting to distract from the fact that they have been there for 16 years or for wanting to distract from the fact that they had been in an alliance with the Greens before they performed one of those quickie faux-divorces that those opposite have done with the federal Greens. However, we know that the Greens and Labor are secretly still cohabiting. They are trying to pretend that they have gone their separate ways and that they do not know each other, but when it comes to the political night they are together under the same roof, where they feel most at home.


From the middle of July 2013, just before the last election, virtually no houses in the state were passed with optical fibre. There were reasons for this—there will always be reasons for everything. There were delays due to asbestos and there were ongoing issues with the contractor Visionstream. It is a matter of public record that Visionstream asked for more money in Tasmania. They were the ones who said they could not complete the job under the terms of the contract that they had already signed. As a result, NBN Co signed an amending agreement for 16 fibre serving area modules to get the rollout back on track in December. There were good reasons for doing this. The objective was to get that provider and that rollout back on track. I am very happy to report that by the end of year about a third of the premises in the state will be passed by fibre. We are on course to deliver more NBN connections to Tasmanian homes and businesses this calendar year than over the entire five years since the rollout began. 


The clearest sign that the coalition will honour the contract already signed, contrary to everything those opposite say, is that after many months of delay and inaction under the previous government NBN Co have agreed with Visionstream to remobilise their workforce before Christmas. We are honouring the contracts, but contracts do require both sides to perform. It would only be an irresponsible government—we all know what an irresponsible government looks like—that would agree to honour contracts at any cost. We need to be clear that the coalition never promised to deliver fibre to the premises at any cost, as that would be reckless and irresponsible. We are getting on with the job of putting the rollout back on track. We are ensuring that there are workers out in the field undertaking this important endeavour. I am sure that Senator Bushby will further touch on issues like the overhead wiring proposals and the work with Aurora on that proposed trial. 


Coming back to where I started, we always have to remember that these are taxpayer dollars. Government has no source of funds other than taxpayers. Government always has to make sure that every dollar it expends—that it has received from the taxpayers and that it expends on behalf of the taxpayers—goes to the most productive and beneficial use possible. The previous government were not doing that. There is an opportunity cost for every single dollar that government spends—it is a dollar that cannot be spent on something else. It cannot be spent on schools, cannot be spent on hospitals and cannot be spent on roads. So you have to make sure that you make every dollar count. Not only were the previous government wasting dollars; they were borrowing massively which means that we now have a massive interest bill. The opportunity cost of the money spent on servicing the interest bill is even greater, because those are dollars which are going towards precisely nothing other than repaying debt.


On this side of the chamber, we make absolutely no apology for wanting to make sure that the taxpayer exposure to the NBN is lessened. We want to make sure that the NBN is rolled out quicker—it would not be hard to roll out an NBN quicker than the guys on the other side did—and we want to make sure that the final product is affordable for consumers. To the people of Tasmania and the people of Australia more generally: you will get the NBN sooner under this government, you will get it at lower taxpayer cost, you will get it cheaper than would have previously been the case, and you will receive the quality and level of service that you need.

Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (17:42):  I am very pleased to be able to talk about this matter of urgency tonight in the short 10 minutes that I have. I certainly support the full rollout of NBN—not just fibre to the node but fibre to the home. I would like to pay tribute to Senator Ludlam, who I am sure would also like to be here tonight speaking on this topic, because he has done an incredible amount of work with Labor over the years by participating in committees and pushing this policy agenda. 


Technology moves on exponentially. I reviewed a plan that the Greens had put in 20 years ago for building a tech industry in Tasmania. Back then, a printer cost nearly $4,000. They talked about businesses sending faxes to each other to share information. In that period, we have gone from some people having really basic PCs to suddenly everyone carrying an iPhone. When I look at my house, what used to be just one internet connection on the PC is now six and counting—four handheld devices, one gaming console and an Apple. Most average households have a lot more than that. They have up to 10 devices that rely on wireless and rely on broadband. It makes a lot of sense that if you are going to put in nation-building infrastructure with a capacity to provide broadband for homes and businesses—this is not just about consumers; it is also about business—do it all up front and do it well. What is the point of going through this half-cocked by putting through fibre to the node and then copper to the home, when in 10 years' time demand is going to have at least quadrupled, if not more, for broadband bandwidth and we will have to do it then?




Senator Cameron:
  Like New Zealand did.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  Yes, exactly. Why not do it properly now? Senator Fifield talked about taxpayers' funds. He would understand that this type of infrastructure is securitised against future cash flows and rents that you are going to get from the broadband network. If I am a consumer or a business, I am going to have to pay to access the network when it is rolled out. If my gumption is right about how quickly technology is moving—and let us not forget that it is very likely that wireless will be turning on your toaster and changing the temperature of your fridge—wireless is going to be used for all sorts of things in our households in the future, and we are going to need the bandwidth. So, if this is taxpayer funds, I am pretty confident that we are going to get a good return on our investment in the future.


If governments have any role to play, even the Liberals must understand that they have a role to play in providing essential infrastructure. In this case, I have no doubt at all that they are going to get a good return on their investments. We have also seen a lot of chief economists around the country saying that now is the time to do this. While interest rates are so low in this country and globally, now is the time to lock in 20/30-year bonds against infrastructure, and that is exactly what would suit this type of project.


This really is not just about consumers. The big issue with fibre to the node and then copper to the home is upload speeds, not download speeds. Quite frankly, I could not give a damn about how quickly my kids download their home movies. I am more interested in the advantages to business. While I am very excited about the prospect of broadband in Tasmania, I am disappointed that, as a state who has had first-mover advantage in this area, we have capitalised enough on it. We have not developed a business around how we are going to use the broadband, but it is coming.


I looked at a submission to the recent NBN inquiry from an ICT company in Singapore who said that when the Singapore government outlaid their infrastructure—fibre-optic cable—they set a whole series of KPIs that the government needed to achieve, including, for example, doubling their ICT exports and doubling their employment in the IT industry. This is exactly what Tasmania is now embarking on. It is no secret that we are an island on the bottom of the world. It might not be the arse end of the world, but you can see it from there with a good telescope! We need to do things that we have a competitive advantage in. We need to be able to facilitate and enable people to work from home and from businesses where they can be as competitive as anyone else the world.


We have some of the best creative industries in this country. In Hobart, we have two big proposals underway, including the creative industry hubs under construction. One of them is a joint-venture between MONA—which has been a stunning international success and a hugely important contributor to the Tasmanian economy—Theatre Royal and the University of Tasmania. We have another private hub being developed around digital media and content creation and delivery, which requires broadband. These are the types of jobs that our kids in Tassie want to stay for if you go ask them, 'What sort of jobs would you want to come back to Tassie for?' These are the areas that kids are interested in: high-tech information communications technology.


The University of Tasmania is another example. We have no doubt that in the next 10 to 20 years a lot of universities are going to be virtual. You will do your courses online. We already do much of our content delivery online.  I have taught online courses and I know how difficult it is for students. With broadband it is suddenly so much easier for me to do live streaming of lectures and content into places like Shanghai, Indonesia and the Philippines. The University of Tasmania in my state already has a competitive advantage in delivering online courses. This sort of thing would be a huge boom. The University of Tasmania is already the second biggest employer in my state. This is the type of infrastructure that we need to get another leg up and to drive the future innovation that will create employment in Tasmania, retain our youth and make them want to come back.


If we do not get the full rollout to the home, the Tasmanian Greens have said that they will put together a business unit to help finance this at a state level. I was in the Senate inquiry when rolling out fibre-optic cable on overhead lines was talked about. I am yet to make a decision as to whether I think that is the right way to go. Disruptions are certainly going to be a serious issue. There were 70 power poles down in the last storm in Tasmania. That would cause a disruption to the network. Nevertheless, we are happy to consider it if it is going to deliver some effectiveness. But it is an election stunt for Will Hodgman to say that he is going to deliver broadband to the home, not from the node, by rolling it out under a trial. It has already been trialled. Aurora Energy has already trialled overhead network technology with fibre-optic cable. It is already there if you want to use it. If you have the conviction, then come out and say it. To not go for some half-cocked plan about a trial.


I would like to take the opportunity tonight to say that I have also been very focused on this area around broadband in Launceston, the little town that I come from, where my office is and where my family live. Last year, I and the Greens delivered $3 million to build a technology innovation hub in the centre of Launceston. It is called Macquarie House. It is a beautiful old four-storey building that has not been used for 67 years. It is right in the centre of town. We asked the youth what they wanted, and this hub was the answer we got.


I went and visited Brisbane, where they have The Edge, and Sydney, where they have ICE, which are very similar innovative digital hubs used by the community, and they are renting space to businesses. We are setting up a collaborative working space in the centre of town that is going to be cash flow neutral because you have to pay to use it. We are but also hoping that it is going to create energy, which Launceston desperately needs, energy for youth and creativity and be a people space where people will want to go. It already has broadband going past the premise. I can say hand on my heart it is absolutely critical that, if we are going to make business decisions around the use of this infrastructure, these are the types of projects that we as government need to start getting involved with. There is a role for us to play in providing infrastructure for collaboration and in the collaborative economy.


I would say very clearly here tonight, and I know that if Senator Ludlam were here he would also say, 'Let's do it properly. Let's get it done up-front. Yes, it costs money.' It is a massive project, and enormous projects always have hiccups. Why is it that we cannot accept that that is the reality? Because, there is politics involved.


Tonight I say: let us put the politics aside. I would urge the Liberal Party, in Tasmania and federally—as I would certainly urge Labor—to focus on putting the politics aside and getting this done properly so that my state can trade on its competitive advantages, on its creative economy and on the innovation that we are seeing in our youth. We know that we can do things as well as anywhere in the world from Tasmania—from my home, from my university and from my business.


It is already a growing sector for my state. I am very excited about the prospects and I wanted to share that optimism with the Senate tonight.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2014-03-05,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (17:52):  I rise today to speak on this urgency motion, to impress upon the Abbott government the need to actually honour its election commitment to roll out fibre-to-the-premises broadband for no less than 200,000 premises across the state.


Holding the government to this commitment has many benefits for my home state, including the fact that it would stop a digital divide from tearing Tasmania apart. Today, I want to focus on one of the particular benefits that fibre-to-the-premises broadband would have for Tasmania and that I believe is of particular urgency.


In comparison to other states and territories, Tasmania has a high percentage of older people. In fact, the state's population is the oldest in the country and ageing faster than any other state or territory. It is actually for this very reason that world-class, fibre-optic-cable-connected broadband is so essential to Tasmania. It is nothing short of urgent, because the state needs this technology.


Late last year I spoke in this chamber about why Labor's broadband model had the potential to assist in transforming the lives of older Australians. I noted that the NBN is not, as the coalition would have you believe, just about providing people with superior video entertainment systems. In fact, some experts have estimated that 30 to 40 per cent of total NBN usage across all areas would be for health applications. That is why we need to pause and consider just how vital a reliable, medical-grade broadband connection is for technologies such as telehealth. Today, medical professionals can engage in face-to-face consultations and examinations via high-definition monitors and cameras. This means that instead of visiting a hospital or being moved into a residential facility older Australians can stay at home, where they feel comfortable. They can communicate with others and in the process help to combat social isolation.


The sky really is the limit. Earlier this year I spoke to an ehealth expert, Kathy Kirby, who has worked diligently for years to update and expand the existing telehealth network in Tasmania. Her message to me was quite clear: the technology to support the expansion of telehealth is available. The opportunities are right there in front of all of us. It is no surprise that the momentum really is gathering behind the conviction that technologies like telehealth can change the lives of older Australians and dramatically enhance the cost-effectiveness of our health and aged care systems.


Several weeks ago I was fortunate enough to join several other shadow ministers in meeting with Age Discrimination Commissioner, Susan Ryan. Ms Ryan is a strong advocate for improvement to internet access for older Australians, and she impressed upon us the great potential of telehealth to assist older people who may otherwise miss the digital revolution. The problem, of course, is that the coalition's NBN infrastructure plans may well not be sufficient to support such innovations fully. We are talking about remote consultation, examinations and diagnosis: the bandwidth requirements in both directions are high, and they are only going to get higher.


The difficulty is this: even if a medical practitioner in, say, Launceston, Devonport or Queenstown can afford to extend the connection from the node to his or her premises, many people will not. There will be insufficient service at the recipient's end in terms of the bandwidth going out of the home. So it is important that this issue is put front and centre in Tasmania and, indeed, across the nation.


It is of course entirely predictable that the strongest proponents of fibre-to-the-premises broadband are often younger, tech-savvy people—people well versed in the language of megabytes, nodes and download speeds. But it is time for this to change. It is time for older Australians and those who care for and support them to stand up and say, 'We need fast, reliable, medical-grade broadband connections right now, across the board.'


I think it is telling that the people of Tasmania have given a clear message to state opposition leader, Will Hodgman. We want our households and businesses connected to world-class broadband. It comes as absolutely no surprise that Mr Hodgman was caught out saying in front of a live ABC microphone that the NBN issue could cost him the upcoming state election. Tasmanians know that they were given a clear promise—all existing NBN contracts would be honoured. Instead, the communications minister went back on his word and is intent on creating a digital divide in Tasmania.


This motion is a matter of urgency for Tasmanians, because we deserve better and we should not be lied to. The coalition's approach is not good enough. It is not good enough for households and businesses and, as I have focused on today, it is certainly not good enough for those older Tasmanians who simply want access to technology— (Time expired)

If you look at the state of the economy, if you look at the state of jobs and if you look at any of the economic or social indicators, Tasmania is at or near the bottom in just about every particular category. The fault for that has to be pointed directly at the fact that we Tasmanians have suffered under 16 years of Labor, and the last four years from Labor in bed with their good friends, the Greens.


And so what are they doing here at the last minute? They are trying to create an issue, because they cannot stand on their record about the NBN.




Senator Polley:
  Will Hodgman is concerned that it will cost him the election! You're leaving him out to dry!



Senator Cormann interjecting—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Boyce
):  Order! Senator Polley! Senator Cormann!




Senator BUSHBY:
  As Senator Polley mentioned, the Leader of the Opposition in Tasmania, Will Hodgman, was overheard saying that the NBN could cost him government. That is because Labor are working very hard to try to make this into an issue. The reality is that Tasmanians need to make their decisions based on the record of Labor and the Greens and the appalling state of the economy in Tasmania; the embarrassing fact that Tasmania is at the bottom of so many economic and social indicators. I think Tasmanians are smart enough to see through this. I think Tasmanians will look at the record of Labor and the Greens over the last 16 years and they will make the appropriate decision. I think they will see past this smokescreen that Labor is trying to create, surrounding the NBN issues, and will vote accordingly. I am confident that on 15 March we will see the Liberals do significantly better than the Labor Party, and the Labor Party will get a real lesson—but, of course, because of the Hare-Clark system that does not necessarily mean we are going to win. That is why they are going so hard with this. They are going so hard because a few votes here or there could mean they end up getting a second seat in an electorate, even though they are going to suffer the judgement of the Tasmanian people.



Honourable senators interjecting—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senators on my left, please stop interjecting.




Senator BUSHBY:
  Coming to the actual subject of this motion, the only promise that has been broken here is the promise that the Labor Party made to the people of Australia prior to the 2007 election—namely, that they would deliver and build an NBN that would be finished in 2013, for $4.7 billion. We all know that under Labor the timeframe and the cost blew out horribly.


The rollout in Tasmania last year—even when they did get it going, and it was at a much higher cost—ground to a halt in the middle of last year, due to Labor's incompetence. Labor has also peddled the line that the NBN is free. There is nothing free about the NBN. Under Labor's plan taxpayers were on track to foot a $73 billion bill—that is, seventy-three thousand million dollars—and increased monthly internet bills, by up to 80 per cent. That raises the issue of affordability, which if I have time I will touch on later.


Senators opposite appear to live in a world where blank cheques are doled out and money grows on trees. If it is somebody else's money they do not care about spending it. On this side of the chamber we actually take the decision to spend taxpayers' money responsibly, and we want to make sure we get the best possible outcome for the money we spend.


There is also a misconception that under Labor's proposal 100 per cent of premises will get optic fibre, right up to their doors. But of course that is not the case. Senator Polley was talking about e-health and people who might be able to take advantage of that in remote areas. People in remote Tasmania were not getting any fibre to their door. They were getting a mixture of wireless and satellite, and that will continue. We are delivering exactly the same outcome to people in those areas as they would have under Labor's plan. Under Labor they would get wireless and satellite and under us they will get the same, only they will get it a bit quicker. They will get it sooner than they would have under Labor. Tasmanian Labor senators, most of whom seem to be here, did not seem too concerned when they were in government—



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator BUSHBY:
  You are showing concern now, but when you were in government you did not show concern about the fact that the NBN practically stopped under Labor. In the middle of last year it stopped, and it took a change of government to get it back on track in Tasmania.


I have a couple of general points on our mixed technology plan. Firstly, there seems to be a misapprehension that businesses, education and health will miss out on getting fibre to their premises. That is just not true. Senator Whish-Wilson and Senator Polley both made comments in their contributions about how there would be missed opportunities in business, health and education. Under our plan, every school, every hospital and every business hub will get fibre to the premises. So you are spinning things that just are not true if you suggest anything otherwise.


Further, under our plan approximately one-third of all Tasmanian premises will get fibre to their door. Fibre on demand means that anyone who is running a business from their home will be able to get fibre to their premises for a matter of a few thousand dollars, which, if you are running a business, is usually not the end of the world. But it certainly is available to you to do that. A lot of people will not do that, and I will tell you why in a minute. Where premises do not get fibre to the premises they will get fibre to the node. This is seriously upgraded compared with the broadband we have now. There is, I think, somewhat of an impression out there—and certainly the Labor Party are doing their best to foster it—that under our plan there will be no improvement and there will not be any super-fast broadband being delivered to premises around the country. The reality is that all premises under our plan will get super-fast broadband to their premises. That will come via fibre to the node, and then that will deliver super-fast broadband to houses, the last 400 metres or so using the copper network. In other countries that technology is delivering 100-megabit downloads and 40-megabit uploads. That technology is currently being used in other countries and it is delivering those speeds now. It is hard to conceive how a normal household could possibly use 100-megabit downloads or, alternatively, 40-megabit uploads.



Senator Polley interjecting—




Senator BUSHBY:
  Senator Polley interjects to talk about health. If you are getting 100-megabit downloads and 40-megabit uploads you will be able to do any of the e-health things that Senator Polley is suggesting. That is 10, 12 or 15 times faster than the fastest broadband you can get using the existing copper that is in the ground now. This will increase the speed 10 or 15 times. So it is hard to conceive how a household—




Senator POLLEY:
  I rise on a point of order. Senator Bushby is misleading the Senate. To have fibre to the home will cost households $5,000 to $6,000, so they will not have that—



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Polley, there is no point of order. Senator Bushby has the call.




Senator BUSHBY:
  I agree that there was no point of order, but Senator Polley made an interesting point in saying that I was misleading the Senate. I indicated that fibre on demand will cost a few thousand dollars. It may be five or six thousand or it may be two or three thousand—we do not know yet. But what I am talking about is our plan to deliver superfast broadband to the premises using fibre to the node. That technology in other countries is delivering 100-megabit downloads and 40-megabit uploads. The technology is improving all the time and the speed is getting faster all the time. In coming years we can expect to actually see much higher download and upload speeds than we are currently seeing in other countries.


The suggestion that Tasmanians or Australians are going to miss out completely, because they are getting fibre to the node, is just not true. The other thing to remember is that, in Korea, Samsung, I think it is, has recently been trialling wireless superfast broadband that delivers one-gigabit downloads over wireless. That is probably not going to be commercially rolled out for a good five years, but it highlights that technology is developing in a way that may well usurp the benefits of delivering fibre to the premise which Senator Whish-Wilson was talking about.


Labor has managed this project incompetently—there is no doubt about that. Their plan would have cost $29 billion more than they had let on and would have increased monthly internet bills by up to 80 per cent, or $43 a month. Crucially, everybody in Tasmania will receive superfast NBN. Our job is to do that sooner and at less cost to the taxpayer. Incorporating technologies into the NBN that can be readily upgraded and are already delivering high-speed broadband to families in other countries will enable us to do just that. We are on course to deliver more NBN connections to Tasmanian homes and businesses this calendar year than over the entire five years since the rollout began. I make this point: since we got into government, we started rolling out fibre to the premise again. That is what we are doing. We will double the number of homes in Tasmania that have fibre to the premise and we will do it in a year when it took you five years.

"Bilyk, Sen Catryna",ALP,2014-03-05,"



Senator BILYK
 (Tasmania—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (18:08):  When the Prime Minister visited Cadbury in Hobart prior to the election, he said it was unusual for a federal government to co-invest with a profitable company but that Tasmania is a special case. I agree: Tasmania is a special case. It is an island state heavily dependent on exports, and Tasmania has been hit hardest by the global financial crisis and high Australian dollar. But a decade ago, when the Tasmanian Labor government developed the backbone for our optical fibre network, they knew that Tasmania's economic future lay in information and communications technology. The full fibre optic rollout of the National Broadband Network in Tasmania is vital to securing Tasmania's economic future. Tasmanian Labor understands this; federal Labor understands this. The only ones who do not seem to understand it are the Liberal-National coalition, and yet they pretend to care about jobs.


Let me tell those opposite what will create jobs in Tasmania. In Tasmania, a state which is heavily dependent on primary industries, an organisation called Sense-T is developing the world's first economy-wide sensor network. The data being gathered by the Sense-T project is increasing the productivity of farms, oyster growers, wineries and a variety of other businesses across Tasmania, and this is just one example of the economic and jobs potential that is possible with the speeds of Labor's NBN—the real NBN, not the coalition's fraud-band alternative.


Many Tasmanians, especially those engaged in the digital economy, understand the importance of high-speed broadband to create the jobs of the future. They understand Tasmania's potential to be a leader, not just a passive participant in the digital economy. They understand that to be a leader we need fast broadband, and 25 megabits per second just is not going to cut it. They understand that if Mr Abbott is serious about his promise to create a million jobs in five years the full fibre-to-the-premise rollout in Tasmania is a good place to start. But Mr Abbott and his colleagues just do not get it.


When Mr Turnbull was appointed shadow communications minister, the riding orders from his party's leaders were to demolish Labor's NBN. Today, Mr Turnbull has executed those orders with distinction. Knowing that fast broadband is popular in Tasmania, those opposite, including Tasmanian Liberal senators, kept the coalition's real agenda deliberately hidden before the federal election. Every time Senator Bushby or Mr Turnbull or any other Liberal member or senator was asked whether the full fibre rollout in Tasmania will be honoured, they could not give a straight answer. Instead, they said that existing contracts would be honoured. In the words of Senator Bushby: 'If contracts are in place for the full fibre rollout, there will be no difference in who gets fibre to their home in Tasmania under Labor or Liberal.' Those were obviously weasel words—a deception designed to give Tasmanians the impression that a full fibre rollout was a coalition election commitment. They deliberately misled Tasmanians into thinking that those who were in the optic fibre footprint under Labor's NBN would have fibre delivered to their home. Then they had the temerity to accuse us of a scare campaign when we pointed out that 85,000 homes would miss out, and yet now it appears that the actual number will be much higher. What a joke; what a hoax from those on the other side; what a ruthless deception those opposite perpetuated against the Tasmanian people when they dashed one of the best hopes for our state's social and economic future.


Tasmania's opposition leader, Will Hodgman, said that this issue could cost him the election, and it should. State Labor has always offered unqualified support for the NBN. In fact, it was thanks to the work of the state Labor government that Tasmania became the first rollout site, whereas Mr Hodgman's recent conversion to the full fibre rollout in Tasmania absolutely smacks of opportunism and political desperation. I know Mr Hodgman has found the road to Damascus, but I am not quite sure he is going to walk down it. You would want to be very, very careful: Tasmanians will not want to pay and should not have to pay because you made a promise to them before the federal election that they would have fibre to the home. My question to those opposite is: how much is it going to cost Tasmanians to get fibre from the node to the home? It will cost $5,000 or $6,000.


Tasmanian voters were conned and deceived by the coalition prior to last year's federal election. I hope that Tasmanians do not allow themselves to be conned a second time. They should not be conned into thinking that the Abbott government's agreement to run a trial of fibre to the home using aerial wiring is anything but a decoy to get their state colleagues through the next election.

Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia) (18:13):  On the issue of broadband in Tasmania, the perspective of a Western Australia Liberal Party senator can be trusted. Labor is clutching at fibre straws. Let's go to the beginning. Let's go back in time to 2009. You would know it better than me. What did Kevin Rudd and Senator Conroy say?




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Boyce
):  I am sorry, Senator Smith, you need to refer to current members and former members by their correct name and title.




Senator SMITH:
  It is a pleasure to call the former member for Griffith and former Prime Minister 'former'. Indeed, if Senator Conroy were proud of his Tasmanian experiment, he would be here. He has left you hanging out. I only have a limited amount of time and I have a lot of material to get through.



Opposition senators interjecting—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Members on my left; Senators!




Senator SMITH:
  This is not a laughing matter and I would like an opportunity to put my case. I have been sitting here diligently—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Just proceed, Senator Smith.




Senator SMITH:
  So what did the former Prime Minister say about the National Broadband Network? He said: 'Like the building of the Sydney Harbour Bridge, this is a historic act of nation building.' You should be very grateful that he did not get to complete it. I would like to introduce you to the strategic review document that was released in December. If you have not had a chance to read it, you should. It is a very sorry tale.


Let me jump ahead, because of limited time. If you were genuinely interested in broadband access to Tasmanians you would be talking about the Interim Satellite Service, which is a disgrace. Those Tasmanians living in remote and regional communities have been failed by Labor.




Senator Polley:
  You have no credibility at all.



Opposition senators interjecting—




Senator SMITH:
  Do you know about the interim satellite solution?



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator Smith, please address you remarks to the chair. Would the senators on the left please allow the senator to speak in silence. As you know, Senator Smith is not allowed to ask you questions, so please do not respond to them.




Senator SMITH:
  The Interim Satellite Service is a very important issue and goes to the people I represent, as a Western Australian senator; they are those electors across regional Australia—not just in Tasmania but also in Western Australia.


Here is a very brief history lesson. In 2011 when the Interim Satellite Service was launched, 165,000 households and businesses were told they were eligible. That probably sounds fair enough, except that the satellite only had capacity for 48,000. So why was the minister for communications, Senator Conroy, not telling the truth? Then again, in early 2013, the former government—of which you were all members—said that the number of eligible households and businesses that could get the Interim Satellite Service would rise to 250,000 off the same satellite that still only had capacity for 48,000.




Opposition senators interjecting
—





Senator SMITH:
  You should be grateful you live in Tasmania, because I will share with you what happened in Western Australia. If you read the strategic review, you will discover that the National Broadband Network, under your former government, passed just 55 per cent of the almost 846,000 that were detailed in the corporate plan. Do you know what that is? Guess what percentage of the total rollout that is—three. There was just three per cent of the total rollout under your plan. There is much to be embarrassed about.


But let us talk about Western Australia. Of the 335,000 premises passed in this country under the NBN, under your guidance, guess how many were passed in Western Australia—just 16,000. Guess how that compares with Tasmania—30,000. We have something to complain about; you have little to complain about. Of the 16,000 that were actually activated in Western Australia, guess how many were activated at existing premises—guess how many of 16,000— (Time expired)

"Thorp, Sen Lin",ALP,2014-03-05,"



Senator THORP
 (Tasmania) (18:19):  This has been most entertaining and I thank Senator Smith for his valiant effort to try to justify his government's position on this incredibly important area for Tasmania. I am extremely disappointed, but I cannot say surprised, to notice that there are no Tasmanian government senators in this place. Even Senator Bushby bolted as soon as he possibly could, because he knows what he was saying was complete rubbish.


The announcement that Tasmania was likely to be the first jurisdiction in the country to have the NBN rolled out was some of the best news Tasmania had had for a long time. And as Senator Bilyk noted quite effectively, Tasmania does require special treatment. We are an isolated jurisdiction. We are an island state. We have an ageing population. An incredibly large proportion of our population is in receipt of Commonwealth benefit. We do have special circumstances. The concept of the NBN—the proper NBN; the real NBN—being rolled out in Tasmania was some of the best news that our state had had for a long time. Then Premier David Bartlett celebrated it. As someone who is expert in the IT area, he had the vision to realise what it could do for Tasmania. There has been a lot of talk about contracts and weasel words around contracts. But I have in my hand the press release—



Senator McKenzie interjecting—




Senator THORP:
  Senator McKenzie may chuckle but here it is, in black and white:


NBN Co seals construction contract to complete broadband rollout in Tasmania.


Up to 800 new jobs to be created at peak of rollout.


State Government backs training for school leavers and job seekers.


Very good news for the state, and celebrated at the time. At about the same time, Visionstream—subsidiary of the people to whom the contract was awarded, Leighton contractors—secured the $300 million NBN contract. It is in black and white.


NBN Co confirms it; the successful contractor confirms it. There were contracts let for the full rollout of NBN to Tasmania. Senator Bushby may try to obfuscate, but the reality is we knew that the rollout would involve about 20 per cent of wi-fi and 10 per cent of satellite from day one. This is because of the disparate nature of our population centres and because of our geography. We all knew that. But we knew that 70 per cent of Tasmanians, whether they be businesses or homes, would receive fibre to the-premises.


Of course, the election loomed and there was a bit of nervousness around. So we needed to get some clarification about what was really going to happen. Malcolm Turnbull said:


As we have stated in our policy we intend to honour existing contracts—the alternative would be to breach them and that is a course we would not countenance.


That was in May 2013. Then in August he said: 


What we will do is honour the NBNco’s contracts.


The contract that I have just shown here is for a full, complete broadband rollout in Tasmania. You cannot get away from it. Mr Turnbull also said:


We’re not about to tear contracts up or walk away from contracts.


Now, that gave a certain level of confidence to the Tasmanian community, and TASICT Executive Officer, Mr Dean Winter, was comforted, as were many people in Tasmania, that the coalition—the now government—would honour their commitment to Tasmania. He welcomed the statements by now Minister Turnbull to that effect, by saying:


Tasmania is assured now to be the first jurisdiction fully connected to the NBN and may end up being the only jurisdiction to boast the full fibre to the premises rollout.


This is based on the fact that if the coalition's plan took off and our contract was honoured, we would be the only ones. We were not convinced though. We asked time and time again for confirmation of that.


The then Minister Julie Collins wrote letters to the editor—she wrote all over the place to try and get some confirmation—and was accused by Senator Bushby of manufacturing mistruths and distorting the truth as part of a scare campaign. But we were right, because look what has happened. We even had some comfort earlier from comments from Ziggy Switkowski who said that we should be encouraged that things could be fixed. But they are not going to be. Tasmania has been conned. We are going to be conned again.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Boyce
):  The question is that the need for the government to honour its election commitment to rollout fibre-to-the-premises broadband to no less than 200,000 premises in Tasmania is a matter of urgency.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (18:26):  by leave, I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


I am extremely disappointed with the minister's response to the resolution of the Senate, which called on him to review the exemption of the shark cull from the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act with a view to terminating it. This is having a huge impact on sharks in Western Australia.


The Minister for the Environment has a responsibility to look after the great white shark because it is listed as a vulnerable species under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. He also has a broader responsibility to protect the environment in Australia. He made an extremely political decision to exempt the shark cull, trying to imply that it was an emergency because exemptions under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act are used for emergencies. They are not used for political purposes so that they can give Premier Barnett a leave pass to put in drum lines that are indiscriminately taking sharks off the Western Australian coast. The decision was not based on science. It was based on the fact that the Premier wanted to get a bit of a bounce in the popularity polls. He made a mistake, of course, because he misread Western Australians' love for the marine environment and, in fact, their love for sharks.


When you get over 7,000 people on a beach in the middle of summer in Cottesloe showing the Premier just how much they think of sharks and how much they deplore his approach to killing sharks, maybe the Premier should rethink and look at his responsibility to protect our marine environment and listen to West Australians who say they love their marine environment. These are the West Australians who show unwavering support for marine protected areas and who, through their public pressure, managed to ensure that the beautiful Ningaloo marine area was not desecrated by a resort all those years ago. They have time and time again demonstrated their love for the marine environment, and once again they are saying to the Premier, 'Do not destroy our sharks.'


The letter that we got from the Minister for the Environment basically said that the Western Australia government had not broken the conditions on which the exemption was granted. It is quite plain that they did not assess the conditions at all before they granted the exemption—they just rubber-stamped the exemption and sent it through.


It is quite plain that the program is breaching those conditions because, for a start, the program is not minimising the impact on undersized sharks. The hooks they are using are indiscriminately catching various sized sharks. When we finally did get information tabled, in a letter from the Western Australian government relayed to the federal government, we found that 66 sharks had been taken. We know that 49 were undersized. This information is now nearly two weeks old and we know very well—from the tweets that come from Surf Life Saving WA when sharks are released—that many more sharks have been taken since then. The public of Western Australia do not know how many sharks have been taken. We do not know how many of those undersized sharks that have eventually been released—40 reported sharks—have survived. We do not know how many are dying.


We have to go to the anecdotal evidence, because there is no monitoring by independent observers of this flawed policy. The anecdotal evidence suggests that many of the sharks are dying because of the hooks that the federal government chose to agree to. Instead of going with the hooks that are really safe for sharks—the circular hooks—they went for the barbaric hooks that get caught and cause an enormous amount of damage to the sharks. It is unlikely that many of the sharks will survive the injuries that are inflicted by those hooks.


The government is clearly unwilling to look at those conditions, or to acknowledge that there have been environmental impacts from this policy. In fact, you would think that the government is acknowledging the environmental damage because—lo and behold!—today the federal Minister for the Environment has said that if the Western Australian government does apply to extend this policy beyond the current exemption of 30 April—it is a bit unclear whether they have yet applied for an extension of this barbaric policy—he will subject it to a full environmental assessment.


That is an acknowledgement that this program does and will have an environmental impact. The minister should never have agreed to allow this exemption. It is having an environmental impact—it always was going to have an environmental impact—on the species that he is supposed to be protecting: great white sharks. The information that he has tabled has noted that at least two mako sharks have been taken. Those mako sharks are covered by the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, because they are a migratory species. In a further response from the Minister for the Environment to the EDO solicitor in New South Wales, the minister tries to write off his obligation to protect the mako sharks by saying, essentially, that he does not have that many obligations under the Convention for Migratory Species, and that Australia has met its international obligations with regard to the mako sharks 'as it participated in negotiations for, and in 2011 become a signatory to, the Memorandum of Understanding on the conservation of migratory species, developed under the convention.' He says that therefore, by participating in those negotiations, he has very little responsibility for those mako sharks.


He is the Minister for the Environment. He is charged with protecting the marine environment.


Yesterday, we also had Prime Minister Abbott saying that he supports the cull and that, in fact, he wants to go and surf in Western Australia. That is an absolutely appalling approach to our marine environment. He is supporting a program that is killing sharks—a program that is breaching the conditions that his Minister for the Environment has signed off on. His minister said that the program was supposed to minimise the impact on the these sharks. I will repeat what the Minister for the Environment wrote to me in a letter. He said, 'Any breach of conditions will result in the exemption being terminated.' It appears that he never envisaged assessing those conditions. When I asked the Department of the Environment about that, they said that, no, they had no responsibility for assessing whether those conditions had been met. They do not even require the Western Australian government to regularly and properly report to them—other than in a few phone calls—what they are catching. For two weeks now, we have not had a report or an update on the sharks that have been taken: the number of sharks that have been killed; what number of undersized sharks have been taken; what species they are; and what the bycatch is.


Last week, an animal was taken on board one of the fisheries vessels and was covered with a tarpaulin. There have been a lot of suggestions that it was a juvenile dolphin that was caught on the drum lines and taken on board that fisheries vessels. Because there are no independent observers on those vessels, we do not know. Quite frankly, I do not now believe the government when they say, 'It's all okay here; there's nothing to show.' If that is the case, why did they bother covering it with a tarpaulin? Why did they hide it from the vessels with the activists, who are trying to do the public service of reporting back on what is being taken? Of course, the media was following as well. They could not tell what was under that tarpaulin. If there was nothing to hide, they should have shown us what was under the tarpaulin.


The contractor who is taking the sharks in south-west WA is not measuring the sharks that are taken. Thanks to the work of community activists, we have seen, unfortunately, the most distressing video coverage and photos which came out last week of how tiger sharks that were too damaged to release were treated—they were stabbed in the head. That is just appalling. It is having an impact on the marine environment. It is slaughtering sharks. (Time expired)

He made a mistake, of course, because he misread Western Australians' love for the marine environment and, in fact, their love for sharks.


When you get over 7,000 people on a beach in the middle of summer in Cottesloe showing the Premier just how much they think of sharks and how much they deplore his approach to killing sharks, maybe the Premier should rethink and look at his responsibility to protect our marine environment and listen to West Australians who say they love their marine environment. These are the West Australians who show unwavering support for marine protected areas and who, through their public pressure, managed to ensure that the beautiful Ningaloo marine area was not desecrated by a resort all those years ago. They have time and time again demonstrated their love for the marine environment, and once again they are saying to the Premier, 'Do not destroy our sharks.'


The letter that we got from the Minister for the Environment basically said that the Western Australia government had not broken the conditions on which the exemption was granted. It is quite plain that they did not assess the conditions at all before they granted the exemption—they just rubber-stamped the exemption and sent it through.


It is quite plain that the program is breaching those conditions because, for a start, the program is not minimising the impact on undersized sharks. The hooks they are using are indiscriminately catching various sized sharks. When we finally did get information tabled, in a letter from the Western Australian government relayed to the federal government, we found that 66 sharks had been taken. We know that 49 were undersized. This information is now nearly two weeks old and we know very well—from the tweets that come from Surf Life Saving WA when sharks are released—that many more sharks have been taken since then. The public of Western Australia do not know how many sharks have been taken. We do not know how many of those undersized sharks that have eventually been released—40 reported sharks—have survived. We do not know how many are dying.


We have to go to the anecdotal evidence, because there is no monitoring by independent observers of this flawed policy. The anecdotal evidence suggests that many of the sharks are dying because of the hooks that the federal government chose to agree to. Instead of going with the hooks that are really safe for sharks—the circular hooks—they went for the barbaric hooks that get caught and cause an enormous amount of damage to the sharks. It is unlikely that many of the sharks will survive the injuries that are inflicted by those hooks.


The government is clearly unwilling to look at those conditions, or to acknowledge that there have been environmental impacts from this policy. In fact, you would think that the government is acknowledging the environmental damage because—lo and behold!—today the federal Minister for the Environment has said that if the Western Australian government does apply to extend this policy beyond the current exemption of 30 April—it is a bit unclear whether they have yet applied for an extension of this barbaric policy—he will subject it to a full environmental assessment.


That is an acknowledgement that this program does and will have an environmental impact. The minister should never have agreed to allow this exemption. It is having an environmental impact—it always was going to have an environmental impact—on the species that he is supposed to be protecting: great white sharks. The information that he has tabled has noted that at least two mako sharks have been taken. Those mako sharks are covered by the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, because they are a migratory species. In a further response from the Minister for the Environment to the EDO solicitor in New South Wales, the minister tries to write off his obligation to protect the mako sharks by saying, essentially, that he does not have that many obligations under the Convention for Migratory Species, and that Australia has met its international obligations with regard to the mako sharks 'as it participated in negotiations for, and in 2011 become a signatory to, the Memorandum of Understanding on the conservation of migratory species, developed under the convention.' He says that therefore, by participating in those negotiations, he has very little responsibility for those mako sharks.


He is the Minister for the Environment. He is charged with protecting the marine environment.


Yesterday, we also had Prime Minister Abbott saying that he supports the cull and that, in fact, he wants to go and surf in Western Australia. That is an absolutely appalling approach to our marine environment. He is supporting a program that is killing sharks—a program that is breaching the conditions that his Minister for the Environment has signed off on. His minister said that the program was supposed to minimise the impact on the these sharks. I will repeat what the Minister for the Environment wrote to me in a letter. He said, 'Any breach of conditions will result in the exemption being terminated.' It appears that he never envisaged assessing those conditions. When I asked the Department of the Environment about that, they said that, no, they had no responsibility for assessing whether those conditions had been met. They do not even require the Western Australian government to regularly and properly report to them—other than in a few phone calls—what they are catching. For two weeks now, we have not had a report or an update on the sharks that have been taken: the number of sharks that have been killed; what number of undersized sharks have been taken; what species they are; and what the bycatch is.


Last week, an animal was taken on board one of the fisheries vessels and was covered with a tarpaulin. There have been a lot of suggestions that it was a juvenile dolphin that was caught on the drum lines and taken on board that fisheries vessels. Because there are no independent observers on those vessels, we do not know. Quite frankly, I do not now believe the government when they say, 'It's all okay here; there's nothing to show.' If that is the case, why did they bother covering it with a tarpaulin? Why did they hide it from the vessels with the activists, who are trying to do the public service of reporting back on what is being taken? Of course, the media was following as well. They could not tell what was under that tarpaulin. If there was nothing to hide, they should have shown us what was under the tarpaulin.


The contractor who is taking the sharks in south-west WA is not measuring the sharks that are taken. Thanks to the work of community activists, we have seen, unfortunately, the most distressing video coverage and photos which came out last week of how tiger sharks that were too damaged to release were treated—they were stabbed in the head. That is just appalling. It is having an impact on the marine environment. It is slaughtering sharks. (Time expired)

 (New South Wales—Assistant Treasurer) (18:38):  I move:


That these bills be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speeches incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speeches read as follows—



CUSTOMS TARIFF AMENDMENT (TOBACCO) BILL 2014


This Bill amends the CustomsTariffAct1995 to enact two tobacco excise equivalent customs duty measures that should help to reduce disease and premature death due to smoking by increasing the cost of consuming tobacco products.


This Bill imposes the same measures on imported goods, also known as excise equivalent goods, as the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2014 imposes on local goods. This ensures imported tobacco products are treated the same as local tobacco products.


Firstly, this Bill increases the rates of excise equivalent customs duty on tobacco and tobacco products through a series of four staged increases of 12.5 per cent, commencing on 1 December 2013 with subsequent increases on 1 September each year until the last of the staged increases in 1 September 2016. 


Secondly, this Bill also changes the basis of indexation of excise equivalent customs duty on tobacco and tobacco products from the consumer price index (CPI) to average weekly ordinary time earnings (AWOTE). The last CPI indexation occurred on 1 August 2013 and the first AWOTE indexation occurs on 1 March 2014. 


The tobacco measures in this Bill were previously tabled by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer as CustomsTariffProposal(No.2)2013 on 10 December 2013. Consistent with normal Parliamentary practice, the customs tariff proposal now requires incorporation in the Customs Tariff Act. 


Full details of the measures in this Bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum.


EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT (TOBACCO) BILL 2014


Smoking is a major cause of disease and premature death. 


The measures in this Bill will increase the cost of consuming tobacco products with consequential impact on demand for tobacco products. 


The Bill increases the rates of duty on tobacco and tobacco products through both a change to indexation and by staged increases to rates of duty. These measures will lift the price of a packet of cigarettes significantly.


These two tobacco measures are contained in the Excise Tariff Amendment (Tobacco) Bill 2014, which amends the Excise Tariff Act 1921 (Excise Tariff Act). 


The tobacco measures in the bill were previously tabled by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer as Excise Tariff Proposal (No. 1) 2013 on 10 December 2013. Consistent with normal Parliamentary practice, the excise tariff proposal now requires incorporation in the Excise Tariff Act. 


The Bill increases the rates of excise on tobacco and tobacco products through a series of four staged increases of 12.5 per cent, commencing on 1 December 2013 with subsequent increases on 1 September each year until the last of the staged increases on 1 September 2016. 


The Bill also changes the basis of indexation of excise duty on tobacco and tobacco products from the consumer price index (CPI) to average weekly ordinary time earnings (AWOTE). The last CPI indexation occurred on 1 August 2013 and the first AWOTE indexation occurs on 1 March 2014. 


The measures in the bill are in line with the National Tobacco Strategy (NTS) 2012-2018, which draws together a number of tobacco control initiatives and policies of both the Commonwealth and the States. 


The NTS 2012-2018 sets out nine priority areas for action on tobacco control in Australia, including priority area 6 'Continue to reduce the affordability of tobacco', under which priority action 6.3.2 is to 'Continue to implement regular staged increases in tobacco excise as appropriate, to reduce the demand for tobacco'.


The Bill increases the rates of tax on tobacco products as well as indexing tobacco excise to a broad measure of wages rather than the CPI, consistent with recommendations of Australia's Future Tax System Review. Indexing to such a measure would maintain policy effectiveness by preventing excise falling as a proportion of income. 


In 2003, Australia became a party to the World Health Organization (WHO) Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). This convention supports the use of price and tax measures to discourage tobacco consumption.


An increase in tobacco excise is consistent with Australia's obligations under this Convention, and represents a move towards international best practice in the pricing of tobacco products. 


In short, the tobacco measures in this bill are consistent with a broad range of Australian policies, strategies and obligations. The Bills implement changes to duty on tobacco products that were announced by the previous government but had not been enacted.


Greater detail is given in the explanatory memorandum for the Bill.


Changes to behaviour by smokers may be difficult but it will occur. Change will provide real health benefits and will be enhanced by the comprehensive set of tobacco control initiatives in place, including public education programs, the provision of assistance and advice through quit programs, and the increased availability of smoking cessation therapies and aids. The explanatory memorandum also details the evidence underlying the tobacco control strategies and policies.

Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (18:42):  I move:


That the Clean Energy Auction Revocation Determination 2014 made under section 113(1) of the Clean Energy Act 2011 be disallowed.


This is an incredibly important debate. We have in Australia an emissions trading scheme. It will be of interest to the community that we actually have a legislated emissions trading scheme in this country, which is currently operating under a fixed price period, and there is a determination that it will go to a flexible price in 2015. That was exactly as we determined it when it was legislated.


It has been the grossest lie of these last several years that what we have in Australia is a carbon tax. We do not have a carbon tax; we never have had a carbon tax. We have had an emissions trading scheme with a fixed price period going to flexible pricing. That is why it is disgraceful to see those people out there suggesting that, if we suddenly get rid of what we have, we will move to an emissions trading scheme—when we already have one. It is legislated; it is the law in this country. I noticed today the disgraceful behaviour of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Australian Industry Group, the Business Council of Australia and the Minerals Council of Australia, all calling on the Senate to swiftly repeal the carbon tax. They know as well as I know that there is no carbon tax in this country; it is an emissions trading scheme.


Under the emissions trading scheme, in order to prepare to go to flexible pricing, we set up a climate change authority which would recommend the target that be put in the legislation to form the cap when we went to flexible pricing. Under the scheme, auctions for the floating price period beginning on 1 July 2015 were required by law. The law established the schedule for the first set of auctions required. The first set of auctions was to be in the coming months. That is the point here. This was a regulation that gave effect to the law under our emissions trading scheme to allow for auctions. You would agree to this regulation being overturned and disappearing only if you did not think the emissions trading scheme would stay in place after 1 July this year. If you believed that it would stay in place, there is no way that you would abandon the auction schedule, because you would understand that polluters are required to buy permits and that they can buy them ahead by a couple of financial years before the floating price. That is why they were allowed to go into the auction this year, to buy ahead of the flexible price period in 2015. You would go along with a disallowance only if you thought the emissions trading scheme was going, and therefore that holding the auctions would not be necessary in the longer term.


It is completely ridiculous and dishonest for the former Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, to stand up and say that he was going to get rid of the carbon tax and move to an emissions trading scheme. It had nothing to do with a tax. All he was doing was attempting to bring forward by one year the flexible pricing period, the trade. He could not do that under existing legislation because we do not have an agreed target. The whole point was to get the Climate Change Authority to recommend the target to the parliament, and the target would then be determined and put in the legislation. If he was going to go to the flexible pricing period one year early, he got away with not telling the Australian people in the election campaign what the target was going to be. Why didn't he come out and say that he was going to have his five per cent target? If that is what he intended to do, why didn't he tell people? The only reason there was no pressure on him at the time was that they had sold the lie that we had a carbon tax, so people did not understand what was being proposed in trying to bring the flexible pricing period forward by one year.


Now we do have a recommendation from the Climate Change Authority of 15 plus 4—19 per cent—by 2020, with a 40 to 60 per cent trajectory by 2030. In my view it is not enough; it should be higher than that. The reality is that we should have had a 25 to 40 per cent target back in 2007. We are now in 2014, with only six years to go until 2020. The 2030 target is the one that is really critical. If you are serious about wanting to go to flexible pricing, you should be putting that 40 to 60 per cent target in the legislation. But I have not heard a peep out of the Labor Party. When they go to flexible pricing, as they want to do, on 1 July 2014, what is the target that they are going to internalise in that price? When they do not have the numbers in the House of Representatives, how are they going to get from where we are now, in March, to flexible pricing by 1 July this year? Everyone knows that the whole business of the ALP bringing forward this motion to implement flexible pricing by 1 July 2014 is doomed to failure.


 


Their excuse for now not disallowing this regulation is: 'It doesn't matter, because when we bring on our flexible pricing scheme on 1 July 2014 we will bring in the regulation that supports it.' Well, how will they? They are not the government; they do not have the numbers. What we have now is the law. We have the law on our side. It is the law that we have an emissions trading scheme. We have a regulation that says the auctions will proceed. Unlike other people in this parliament, I do not believe that we are going to lose the clean energy future package after 1 July. That is why the Western Australian election is so important, because if we win back one seat from the conservatives we save the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, we save the Climate Change Authority and we hold up a mirror to this sham review of the RET that the government has busily brought in. If we win one seat, we will run a very strong argument on retaining the emissions trading scheme.


Let us not have any more nonsense in this debate. What we have here is the government trying to get rid of an emissions trading scheme that is the law, and they are trying to dismantle the auction process because they have already prejudged that they are going to get rid of this legislation post July.

"Gallacher, Sen Alex",ALP,2014-03-05,"



Senator GALLACHER
 (South Australia) (18:50):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


I rise to take note of the Productivity Commission inquiry report No. 65, Mineral and energy resource exploration. The inquiry, commissioned by Assistant Treasurer Bradbury, was asked to examine the non-financial barriers to mineral and energy resource exploration in Australia. It was completed and the report was forwarded to the Treasurer, Mr Hockey.


This really is a bit of a mystery. In the ordinary course of business of the parliament, legislation on the Woomera Prohibited Area passed without contention in the House of Representatives, came into the Senate and was referred to a committee for inquiry. Subsequently, Senator Farrell introduced a private member's bill. That was deemed to be unacceptable, even though Senator Farrell indicated he would be amenable to any amendments that would get the job underway, so to speak. Now we find, in the words of one commentator, 'Woomera back on the launch pad', and I think the pun is intended. A newspaper report states:


MOVES to open up the Woomera Prohibited Area to explorers targeting a potential $35 billion in minerals has been sent back to the federal Parliament drawing board.


We are now looking at further inquiry, further delay and further indecision on an important issue for the whole of Australia, particularly South Australia. We now have a very unclear situation. No-one is really sure why this has been delayed, why it has been sent back to be dealt with in the autumn sittings, or why it has been necessary to redraft legislation which passed the House of Representatives without contention 


It has now been sent back to the launch pad. Clearly, a dissenting report by Labor senators on the committee said that they were disappointed there was no detail on the government's proposed alternative, and that the existing bill could well have been amended rather than throwing the whole process out.


The South Australian Chamber of Mines and Energy stated that the bill was sufficient in outlining the detail for a permitting system to rail operators. I will just highlight the contribution of Senator Johnston, the Minister for Defence, who threw in the furphy—in my view—that the population of the Northern Territory could well go without fruit, vegies and perishables because we would have to close the railway because we had not sorted out Defence. Well, Defence have been operating there for a very long time. And the railway has been there for a very long time. Before the continuous railway to Darwin, there has always been a rail to Alice. There was a trucking system that went from Alice up to around about Larrimah. That has been there for decades. There have not been any proven instances, other than those caused by weather, where people in the Northern Territory have run out of food. That was an extraordinary contribution.


What we really have here is that we need the jobs. We did not think that the non-financial barrier to mineral exploration and energy resources would be the Liberal government! No-one thought that. No-one thought that the Liberal government would be the non-financial barrier that we see presented here today, but that is the reality of it. They are presiding over job losses in the automotive industry and refusing to get on their bike, basically, and commit to getting $35 billion worth of mineral resource exploration underway—supported by Indigenous communities; supported by tremendous infrastructure investment in the surrounding region, in trade training centres and skilling people up to work in the mining industry. No-one ever thought that this government would be the non-financial barrier in the way of mineral exploration, but that is the absolute reality.


Woomera back on the launch pad; delayed until the autumn session of parliament. It is truly extraordinary that this government that tells us, 'We will get rid of red tape. Get out of the way, we are going to let business go.' is the non-financial barrier to $35 billion worth of exploration in a state that is already suffering from high youth unemployment. It is a situation where we need to be proactive, get on the front foot, open the place up, consult with the Indigenous owners, consult with the special interest groups, rejuvenate our regional economies and allow people to work. No-one would believe that the government is the non-financial barrier to this being successful.


I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Sterle, Sen Glenn",ALP,2014-03-05,"



Senator STERLE
 (Western Australia) (18:55):  I also rise to speak on the Productivity Commission's Inquiry Report No.65: Mineral and Energy Resource Exploration. As we know, briefly: the government that we now have were quick to go to the last election with three-word slogans, whether it was talking about boats, or grown-ups in control or—another one that has got under my skin—open for business. We know that the Productivity Commission report talks about regulatory processes that impose unnecessary burdens on resource explorers and that inhibit exploration around the mining industry. The government is very quick to say that they are the friends of the mining industry. They are very quick to say how they are going to save the nation from a mining tax that was originally being negotiated with industry because they had absolutely no problem with a profit-based tax. As we all know in this building, the industry did not have a problem with that. We in this building also know that the current structures for royalties do not work. We have seen that in the great state of Western Australia. We have seen some absolutely monumental stuff-ups, for want of a better phrase, from the state government over there in terms of how great they are going to be for the state of Western Australia, the people of Western Australia and the mining industry. Let me just talk about a couple of them. It is all very well for the federal Liberal government to be running around the country being friends, but let us look at some form from the state government.


Let us look at two of the most massive projects that have been announced in Western Australia. We were very lucky, until the global financial crisis—and even during the global financial crisis—to be blessed with many resources over there in terms of oil, gas and—in particular, but not limited to—iron ore. We had one project, where junior miners in the Mid West region, inland—for those not from WA—around Geraldton, where magnetite—the poorer cousin of haematite—which, although it is not a higher-quality ore, is the next big thing in Western Australia. I make no argument about that, especially when we talk about China and India's hunger for iron and steel. We had the Premier—who is the Premier still, Mr Colin Barnett—come out there and personally nail his colours to the mast in relation to building the Oakajee Port and Rail project. The Oakajee Port and Rail project was to build a deepwater port and rail in the Mid West region. He was out there announcing what a wonderful thing it was going to be, he went to an election with it, and he was going to be the driver of the project, and he was going to be the builder of all things great in Western Australia.


Around the same time, he was also talking about the Browse project, which is a Woodside project—Woodside is one of the proponents—to build an onshore gas facility at James Price Point north of Broome. I know my colleagues in the Greens will come out and scream about all the bad things about oil and gas, and how terrible it is to have an onshore gas facility, but there were a lot of benefits that were going to come with this project. One of the benefits was an Indigenous land use agreement to the value of $1.5 billion. But I have to tell you, Mr Acting Deputy President, I am coming from a selfish point of view: whatever will advance Indigenous peoples, particularly but not limited to the Kimberley, I am in. But I did have the good grace not to stick my nose into that business. That was a deal to be negotiated between our Indigenous owners and the proponents. And those in the environmental movement were all there, sticking up for the blackfella and looking after the poor blackfella who is going to be victimised by this gas plant and then, when that did not suit my blackfella mates, they turned on them and the rest is history; we know where that stands.


It suits certain parties to say 'the poor Aborigines were bullied'. Well, do you know what? They took a democratic vote. We know very well how democracy works—with 50 per cent plus one, you rule. When democracy goes your way, that is fine. But when it does not suit some people, the rest gets very murky. I do not want to take the pressure off Premier Barnett. He bulldozed his way in, pushed everyone aside and compulsorily acquired land at James Price Point. The Oakerjee deepwater port near Geraldton is a $6-billion project; James Price Point is a potential onshore gas project—both projects where he came and stuck his bib in. I will tell you what he did do. He managed to absolutely blow out of the water any chance to see that development on James Price Point. He blew out of the water any chance for Indigenous improvement—jobs, education, roads and infrastructure. He also managed to tip out the Oakerjee port.


One-word slogans are fantastic at elections when you are in opposition, but when you get into government you have to deliver. So far, the only thing this government has delivered is jobs offshore. They should be absolutely ashamed of themselves. The Australian people have the opportunity to be reminded of that, particularly in Western Australia in the next few weeks.

Senator RUSTON
 (South Australia) (19:02):  I am absolutely delighted to be able to stand here today and tell the Senate of a wonderful initiative that I had the pleasure of spending some time learning about last weekend. The Whyalla Wig Library is an initiative of the community of Whyalla. They have set up a wig library at their local hospital. It is for women in particular but also for men who are going through chemotherapy treatment. They can now borrow a wig, and all the things that go with it, so that during their treatment they do not have to go to the trouble and expense of going to Adelaide to buy themselves a wig. It might seem like a very small initiative, but it was having an extraordinary impact on the women I met last week—particularly those from lower socioeconomic groups—because they did not have to spend hundreds or thousands of dollars to buy a wig. This initiative enabled them to access a wig reasonably cheaply. Anybody who has been touched by knowing somebody who has had to go through this treatment would know of the additional trauma they go through in just walking down the street. People cannot help but look at somebody who is bald or has a scarf around their head. This initiative enables those people to shield behind a wig so that their condition is not so obvious and confronting.


I would like to acknowledge a few of the wonderful people I met who are involved in this. Kate Kroll is the McGrath Sellers breast care nurse for Whyalla. It was Kate's idea that led to this initiative. Kate, who is 38 weeks pregnant, was extremely proud to be there on the day when we saw the wig library launched. I think the people of Whyalla will be thanking Kate for her initiative for many years to come. Whyalla Pink Spirits are a group of breast cancer survivors. As soon as they heard about this initiative, they jumped on board to give it some support. I think the community of Whyalla would extend a very big thank you to Whyalla Pink Spirits President, Rae Williams, and Secretary/Treasurer, Elizabeth Antilla, for the support they gave to Kate in the early stages of getting this initiative up and running.


The young tradespeople and professionals of Whyalla held a charity ball and the people of Whyalla came together and raised, absolutely amazingly, over $12,000 in start-up funding for this particular initiative. Chairperson Kayleigh Bruce was the one who started this initiative, and it was also a really wonderful example of bipartisan support for a project in the community. As everybody here knows, there is soon going to be an election in Tasmania and an election in South Australia. Lyn Breuer, the outgoing ALP local member for the state electorate of Giles, which includes Whyalla, was instrumental in supporting this project, as was her Liberal Party counterpart, and candidate for the upcoming election, Bernadette Abraham. Bernadette and Lyn got together and both supported this wonderful initiative. When these sorts of things come up, it certainly transcends any political boundaries.


It was also a very interesting initiative in that the two big manufacturing businesses in Whyalla—OneSteel and Arrium—also got behind the project. What they did was quite clever. These companies said to their employees that, for every day their workplaces were accident- and injury-free, they would make a donation to this particular cause. In the 12 months between the idea of the wig library first being put on the table and its launch last week, Arrium and OneSteel put $5,000 towards it. When I talked to them about what it had achieved for them, they were really happy. The incentive to keep the workplace safe was a good thing and they were very pleased that they were able to assist this worthy project with $5,000. They also had a massive amount of support from the community and from other supporters, including Bonney Wigs. I mention Bonney Wigs particularly because they are an Adelaide-based company. They donated a huge number of wigs to this operation so that the project could have a start-up—because anybody who has ever tried to buy a wig would realise how terribly expensive they are.



Senator Ludwig interjecting—




Senator RUSTON:
  Senator Ludwig is shaking his head. Senator, we know that you do not have a wig! They have already managed to get 60 wigs either from the generosity of Bonney Wigs or through donations from people in the community, many of whom were previously cancer sufferers. They bought their own wigs, then realised just how important the experience that they had was, and have now donated their wigs, which they no longer need. The Whyalla Hospital and Health Services have provided them with a home, so the wig collection is contained within the health services at the new Whyalla hospital. It is easily accessed and right next to the chemotherapy unit. The Whyalla council has also added its support and has been very active in promoting and supporting the initiative.


In conclusion, this is an amazing initiative. It is so important to put on the record what a great initiative it is and, hopefully, to encourage other regional communities to do likewise. Until I started speaking to some of these cancer sufferers who are undergoing treatment, I do not think I realised just how much of a hassle it is and how hard it is for them when they have to keep going back to capital cities, either for their treatment or to see their oncologists. To go to Adelaide to buy a wig is just one more trip, one more expense and one more upheaval at a time when things are difficult enough for them. It really brought home to me the importance of decentralisation of health services to our country areas so that we can ensure, as much as we can, that people can have treatment at home, so that their lives are not disrupted and they are not put through any more trauma than necessary, and also to ensure that they can have ongoing access to their families. A tremendously important point needs to be made that people who live in the country are significantly disadvantaged when they have to undertake health care in the city. I would just put that on the record.


Another thing that is really obvious in Whyalla—and it is obvious in some of the other regional areas—is the difficulty of getting medical staff. The Whyalla community made the comment that they had had a level of difficulty in attracting relevant specialists. It is all well and good to build beautiful new buildings, as we have seen in many regional areas, but they are not much use unless you can get health services and allied services operating for the benefit of those communities.


I commend to this place the initiative of the group of people and the Whyalla community. I would also like to acknowledge the women and men of Australia who have gone through a tough time. One of the issues that we discussed in Whyalla was the fact that women are very good at supporting other women under these circumstances, but often men who undergo similar treatments are not necessarily so strong at supporting their fellow men. The women who put this initiative together are also seeking to ensure that this library is available to men. It is not just a place where you go to get a wig, scarf and the like; it is also a place where people who are suffering can get support from people who are suffering equally from this very unfortunate but, these days, largely curable, disease.


I would just like to put on the record my thanks to the people of Whyalla for doing this and for setting an example. Can I suggest to other communities around Australia that they get in touch with the Whyalla community and find out what they have done because the initiative, even though it is only a few weeks old, has already helped a number of people and allowed them just one less trauma in their treatment, as they fight to survive cancer.
