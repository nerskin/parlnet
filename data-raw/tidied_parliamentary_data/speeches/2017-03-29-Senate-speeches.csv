"PRESIDENT, The",,2017-03-29,"



The PRESIDENT
 (09:31):  Yesterday the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Wong, raised a point of order in relation to language used during question time. I indicated that I would reflect on the matter and report back to the Senate if required. I now report back on the matter and other matters that occurred during question time and later during the sittings yesterday.


Firstly, on the matter in relation to language used by Senator Brandis: the rules of debate in standing order 193(3) provide that 'all imputations of improper motives and all personal reflections' on senators or members are 'highly disorderly'. It is for the chair to determine what constitutes offensive words, imputations or improper motives and personal reflections under that standing order. In doing so, the chair has regard to the connotations of expressions and the context in which they are used. As I reminded the Senate on 1 September last year: 


… unparliamentary language does not cease to be unparliamentary merely because it is directed at a group of members or senators rather than to an individual.


Yesterday I was asked to reflect on the use of language directed at what I am taking to mean a political organisation or grouping. The terms used was 'machine'. This raises different considerations than language directed solely at a group of members or senators. Depending on its context, language directed at a political organisation may refer to senators and members, including members of other parliaments, to people who are not members of parliament or to both. To the extent that such language appears to be directed at any senator or member or any group of senators or members, it must comply with the standing orders. The difficulty for any chair is to determine instantly if that language does relate solely to senators or members. On this occasion, that was impossible to determine on the first expression of the phrase.


Where expressions are used which are open to an interpretation that makes them contrary to the standing orders, it is always open to the chair to ask the senator speaking to clarify their meaning and intention, and, if that meaning and intention is not contrary to the standing orders, to allow the senator to proceed on that basis without withdrawing the words in question.


President Reid ruled on that on 18 March 1997. Senator Brandis, speaking to the point of order raised by Senator Wong, clarified his reference, and I quote from the Hansard yesterday:


I am not suggesting that every member of the Labor Party or any individual member of the Labor Party is a liar. What I am suggesting is that the Labor Party as an organisation is a lying machine.


Irrespective of the fact that, by clarifying that point, Senator Brandis had not breached the standing orders on this occasion, I would ask all senators to consider very carefully the language that is used in questions and answers and, in particular, in debate.


Secondly, the matter of the use of the phrase 'secret commissions' was raised. Again, I undertook to reflect on the use of this term. Any remark which carries an imputation of corruption or criminality made in respect of any senator or member is contrary to the standing orders and, if made, ought be withdrawn. I do not consider, in the context in which the phrase was used yesterday, that it carried that imputation. You will recall that I required the Leader of the Government to withdraw other phrases which, in my view, did carry such imputations, and he withdrew them immediately. However, I personally find the use of such language, again, to be unpleasant at best. Whilst senators may sail very close to the wind in relation to standing orders, I would ask again that senators reflect carefully on the language that is used during debate and during question time.


Thirdly, Senator Wong raised a point of order asking about the content of a question. I note longstanding rulings of presidents, including one expressed by my predecessor Senator the Hon. John Hogg in the following terms on 7 Feb 2013:


You cannot ask a question about an opposition policy. You can ask about an alternative policy …


In fact, over 600 references can be found on that style of question being asked by senators from a variety of political backgrounds. In my view, the question was therefore in order.


Finally, a matter was referred to me by Senator Sterle in his capacity as a temporary chair. Later in the day an exchange between senators McKim and Abetz took place which the Temporary Chair of Committees, Senator Sterle, undertook to bring to my attention. Senator McKim was, quite properly, required to withdraw a remark that a senator had lied. He should have done so unconditionally. The phrase he substituted contains an improper imputation against a senator, contrary to standing order 193(3), and should be withdrawn. I do call on Senator McKim, if you would kindly do so now.




Senator McKim:
  Thank you, Mr President. I withdraw.



The PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator McKim. Again, in conclusion, Senators, could I ask that you are all very conscious of the language you use in parliamentary debate. You are seeking leave, Senator Bernardi?




Senator Bernardi:
  I am seeking leave, just to raise a point with you, if I may.



The PRESIDENT:  Is leave granted? Leave is granted.

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (09:36):  Mr President, you referred there to a question by Senator Wong about the appropriateness of a question, and you then went back to Odgers and previous rulings. In the last 24 hours I have written to you, because it seems to me that many of us as senators rely on the standing orders, yet the historical rulings attached to some of the standing orders seem to contradict the standing orders as they are now and appear for us. In the interests of clarification, I am going to suggest that you put together a working committee of senators to see whether we can bring the standing orders up to date and to be consistent with the practice of the Senate so that we can rely on them in trying to uphold the values and procedures of this place.



The PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Bernardi. I note those comments and I look forward to receiving your letter in relation to that.

Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (09:38):  I rise to make a contribution to the debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan) Bill 2016. Let us be clear: this is an incredibly consequential piece of legislation that we have before us. That is because what we are considering in the chamber today is, by the government's own admission, the centrepiece of their entire economic agenda. So it is worth asking: what is the agenda the government is seeking to implement with this bill? Well, while it has been cynically and misleadingly marketed to the Australian people by the Prime Minister and Treasurer as a tax cut for small business, in reality all that this government has to offer by way of an economic agenda is an enormous unfunded tax cut for foreign multinationals and the big banks. 


What a massive wasted opportunity this bill is for the government and, more importantly, for our country. That is because the opportunity cost of pursuing this so-called plan is that the Turnbull government is failing to actually address the very real economic challenges we must confront. It has been 10 months since the government proposed these tax cuts in the 2016 budget, yet they have only now just brought this legislation to the Senate for debate. This is typical for what passes for economic leadership from the Abbott-Turnbull government. They have presided over a total vacuum in economic leadership at the national level. They have embraced inertia over action and preferred slogans to substance. At a time when we as a nation are faced with economic challenges that demand our urgent attention, this government has been missing in action on all counts. Whether it is rising inequality, stagnant wage growth, worsening housing affordability, climate change, unemployment and underemployment, technological disruption and automation, the negative distortions in our tax system or the need to transition to a model of growth that is not driven by mining investment, there is simply no coherent plan or strategy from this government. 


I think it pays to place some of the challenges we are facing into historical perspective. Australian workers are currently experiencing the lowest wage growth in 30 years. Our rates of home ownership have plummeted to a 60-year low and inequality is at a staggering 75-year high. Another way to appreciate the challenge we are facing is to acknowledge that in the past generation the top one per cent of income earners have doubled their share of income, while at the other end of the spectrum one in eight Australians now say they cannot afford dental care. Yet, rather than advocating an economic plan that seeks to address these clearly pressing issues, the Turnbull government has made a perverse choice: to prioritise multinationals over Australian families and, in the process, recklessly narrow the revenue base of our tax system. This government's idea of tackling debt and deficit is to blow a $50 billion hole in the budget for a purported benefit in the future that could be mistaken for a rounding error. 


What does this mean in the real world for working and middle class Australians? Without sufficient revenue, we will be unable to provide services that communities right across Australia rely upon, nor will we be able to invest in our human and physical capital to ensure that most Australian of aspirations: a fair society with decent living standards for all. Make no mistake: in attempting to pass this bill, the Turnbull government is in essence proposing a $50 billion giveaway on the backs of ordinary taxpayers to big multinational businesses and their shareholders offshore. This is not only fiscally irresponsible on a grand scale; it is morally reprehensible as well. It is truly astonishing that a government whose members like to stand at the dispatch box of this parliament and lecture us on the intergenerational inequity of debt now seems blindly intent on adding $50 billion to it while ignoring the budget deficit. That is a deficit that the most recent MYEFO revealed to be $36.5 billion, delivered by a government that has managed to increase net government debt from $184 billion to $317 billion in less than four years. 


How can the government seriously claim to be addressing the budget deficit and government debt when this is their signature economic proposal? As Labor's shadow Treasurer, Chris Bowen, has made clear, Labor will not be party to this discredited Laffer curve, Reaganomics-style approach to deficit reduction. Make no mistake: that is the course the government, through this bill, seeks to embark us upon, based on magic pudding economics—that you can endlessly cut tax rates and still miraculously return to surplus. This approach is now widely acknowledged by academics and leading economic institutions as widening inequality and dampening precisely the kind of sustainable and inclusive economic growth needed to generate new high-skill, high-wage jobs that can deliver improved living standards. 


If this bill were to pass, it would fail dismally in its stated aim to deliver economic growth of any note, for reasons I will turn to a greater depth later. It would undoubtedly damage the fiscal position of the Commonwealth and jeopardise our AAA credit rating. Most critically—and the issue that motivates us on this side of the chamber—it will rob working and middle class Australians of desperately needed investment in skills, education, health care and infrastructure. These are the real drivers of long-term and inclusive economic growth. It is a sad indictment of this government that, more than three years since it was first elected, and on the eve of its fourth budget, it still has no credible plan to deliver economic prosperity for the Australian people. 


Looking back over its more than three years in office, this coalition government's economic record can regrettably be characterised by its misguided austerity for the most vulnerable in our community while sparing the big end of town. Boiling it down to its essential logic, or rather illogic, according to this government, providing a vulnerable young jobseeker with Newstart in their hour of need is unaffordable. It is symptomatic of unsustainable largesse that they described as a budget crisis. Yet, on the other hand, handing over billions upon billions of dollars in tax cuts to the largest companies operating in the country is not only affordable but their most pressing economic priority. 


Regrettably, that is what happens when you have a Prime Minister who is beholden to the hard right wing of his own party, and there appears to be little hope that a real economic reform agenda will spring forth from this government during this term of parliament. It is far more likely it will continue to be sidetracked, with the Prime Minister pandering to the whims of a mutinous backbench that's laughably out of touch with mainstream concerns. We saw examples of that just this week—a Prime Minister and a government focused on watering down hate speech laws, but with no time to defend the take-home pay of some of the lowest-paid workers in Australia who rely on penalty rates.


This bill was the government's economic rationale for re­election. That was confirmed last year by the finance minister in Senate estimates when he described it as the centrepiece of their economic agenda. But it is lazy policy, it's unimaginative, and ultimately exposes the government for its lack of vision.


Turning to the specifics of the proposal, this bill will be ineffective when measured against what the government claims it will achieve—jobs and growth. In fact, the key beneficiary, should this bill pass, would not be the Australian community but rather foreign shareholders of firms that operate in Australia.


It is worth taking some time to canvass the contemporary evidence on the connection between corporate taxes and economic growth. Despite being the perennial demand of certain industry groups and right-wing think tanks, is there really evidence to support the notion that cutting the corporate tax rate is the economic panacea they claim it to be? 


Some of the most recent analysis from a very broad range of institutions, which include the Treasury, the Grattan Institute, the Australia Institute, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have all seriously called into question the efficacy of corporate tax cuts when not coupled with other economic reform as an instrument to drive growth. Some of those same groups have raised further and compelling doubts about their usefulness, especially when considered in the Australian context, taking into account our current debt profile and the particular features of our tax system. In particular, they note that, given our unique system of dividend imputation and the fact we are competing with low- and no-tax jurisdictions, any supposed benefit tax cuts would deliver would be negligible at best.


Treasury's own modelling exposes the underwhelming case for the government's plan. In its analysis of the most recent budget entitled 'Economy­wide modelling for the 2016-17 Budget,' the Treasury has estimated the impact of the government's corporate tax giveaway on Australia's projected economic growth. The key take-out from this modelling is that over 20 years the proposed cut in company tax from 30 per cent to 25 percent for all businesses would increase GDP by only 1.2 per cent. 


I really think that deserves to be repeated: over 20 years—that is, six terms of the federal parliament—Treasury expects this bill will only boost our GDP by 1.2 per cent. And that is the headline growth rate. When you drill down into that figure, it reveals just how lacklustre that result is when you consider what it means for Australian households. As my colleague Andrew Leigh succinctly put it: 'Treasury's most likely scenario is that a company tax cut delivers an extra month of household income growth—in the 2030s.'


And we should not be surprised.


Recent analyses of Australia's growth performance with comparable nations that have lower corporate tax rates find little evidence to buttress the claims that economic growth is inevitably higher in countries that impose lower rates of corporate tax. And, fundamentally, this government's plan for dishing out tax cuts for big business rests on the notion that our current    corporate tax rate—currently 30 per cent for the largest businesses—is uncompetitive and impairs economic performance.


But even a cursory analysis proves we are very much in line with other developed countries, especially as Michael Pascoe notes in his excellent piece in the Fairfax papers entitled 'An inconvenient truth gets in the way of the company tax cut chants', when we weight that tax rate for the extra security, stability and opportunities Australia  offers investors.


The largest economy in the world, the United States, has a headline corporate tax rate of about 35 per cent. The economic powerhouse of Europe, Germany, has a rate of 29.65 per cent. Looking to our region and one of our largest trading partners, Japan, the fourth largest economy in the world, has a tax rate of 30.86 per cent. In fact, if you look at the world's 10 largest economies, the corporate tax rate currently averages around 29 per cent. It is simply a fallacy to say that having a tax rate above 25 per cent prohibits strong economic performance. But headline tax rates are just one element and looking at them in isolation is folly. I have no doubt, however, that you will hear plenty of facile repetition of headline tax rates without proper context from those opposite in their contributions to this debate.


That missing context is the impact of features of our tax system such as dividend imputation. The Grattan Institute's submission to the Senate Economics Committee's inquiry into this bill provides further compelling evidence that dramatically diminishes the case for big company tax cuts. Grattan's submission states:


Australia's unusual dividend imputation system means that domestic investors are largely unaffected by the company tax rate since any profits paid to them are taxed at their personal income tax rate.


Yet because foreign investors, by contrast, do not benefit from dividend imputation, a cut to the company tax rate provides bigger benefits to them.


For those foreign firms who have already made long-term investments in Australia, a reduction in the tax rate would simply be a windfall. Yet this marginal reduction in headline rate does not meaningfully incentivise new investment.


Treasury also acknowledges the substantial costs of the measure in the short term could see company tax cuts drag on national incomes for the next ten years. Even the most sympathetic analysis from the Treasury shows that any net benefit to Australians' incomes will be much smaller once profits flowing out of Australia are taken into account.


As the Grattan Institute also pointed out in its submission, it is a mistake to assume that any increase in economic activity will necessarily go toward making Australians better off. As the benefits of this bill will pass disproportionately to nonresidents, using the GDP as the principal measure of its success is flawed. Gross national income is a better yardstick to use when assessing this bill as it more accurately reflects whether the incomes of everyday Australians might rise. Treasury estimates that a reduction in the company tax rate to 25 per cent would only increase Australia's GNI by 0.6 per cent over 20 years.


The government's claim that these tax cuts will deliver jobs and wages growth simply does not stack up to real-world scrutiny. Let's be clear: a race to the bottom on corporate taxes would be futile for Australia to engage in. The OECD has recognised that profit shifting by large multinational companies to tax havens is widespread and has sought to combat it through the base erosion and profit shifting policy. As noted by the ACTU in its submission to the Senate inquiry into this bill, this is an acknowledgement of the fact that in many cases Australia is already competing against countries with low or negligible company tax rates. Any relatively minor reduction in our corporate tax will struggle to attract significant additional investment, when you consider we are competing against cynically designed tax havens that will always be more attractive. 


Put simply, this bill will not meaningfully grow the economy. It will not deliver meaningful wage growth; it will not improve our capacity to fund services, nor will it genuinely improve our competitiveness internationally. It simply does not stack up as an economic plan. It is just as important to consider the economic benefits of large cuts to the company tax rate against their budgetary and social costs, and that is what Labor has done. We recognise that the countries around the world that have a record of strong and inclusive economic growth do share something in common, and it is not a rock-bottom tax rate. It is that they build the necessary infrastructure to allow their people and firms to be more productive and compete in the global marketplace. They invest in research and development, which lead to innovative new products and businesses. They understand the value of funding an education system that will provide world-class skills through higher education and vocational training. In our current budgetary circumstance, this bill would severely curtail our ability to do all of those things. This tax cut is something that we simply cannot afford.


Labor is committed to a budget and a taxation system that link effort and reward in a fair way—especially for those who are trying to make a go for themselves in small businesses—while also taking responsible decisions that go to the sustainability of our public finances, so that we can make targeted investments that promote inclusive growth. That is what we took to the last election. We took measured and sensible reforms to negative gearing and capital gains tax that would improve the budget bottom line and help combat intergenerational inequity. We coupled a reduction in company taxation, which supports genuine small businesses, with responsible commitments to fund investments in health, infrastructure, education and research.


A Labor amendment to the bill    has been circulated in my name to give effect to our election commitments. Our amendments match our values. They defend our public finances and would deliver targeted tax relief to genuinely small businesses. They would do so by reducing the company tax rate to 27.5 per cent for businesses with a turnover of less than $2 million, the threshold that remains consistent with the ATO definition of a small business; increasing the unincorporated small business tax discount from five per cent to eight per cent for businesses with a turnover of less than $2 million; and by not proceeding with the increase to the small business entity threshold. Our considered amendments would help 96 per cent of all Australian small businesses—that is, defined as having less than a $2 million turnover. Costed by the PBO, they would save $4.4 billion over the forward estimates and $50 billion over the medium term compared to the government's reckless policy. Under Labor's policy around 811,000 companies and 2.19 million unincorporated businesses would benefit. That is more than three million businesses in total.


In conclusion, I simply ask that the government apply its previously stated rationale for abandoning tax reform in the last term. It may seem like an awfully long time ago, especially for the Prime Minister, but it is worth casting our minds back to those heady days of the early Turnbull government. At that time, and after many public thought bubbles on the subject, the Turnbull government decided to abandon the GST increase it had been prosecuting, stating on the public record that the modelling showed little to any economic benefit. Well, this legislation fails against the very same standard. We need tax and expenditure reform that is aimed at boosting income growth and increased worker participation, coupled with stronger investments in our educational, environmental and physical capital. This was the clarion call of the Henry Tax Review, because, as it noted, this balanced approach is what is needed to ensure a future that is fiscally and environmentally sustainable while honouring the commitment to Australian values of fairness and support for those who are disadvantaged. That is Labor's focus, and it should be the government's focus too. This bill does none of those things, and in its current form it is not worthy of the support of the parliament.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan) Bill 2016</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2017-03-29,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (09:57):  The Greens will not be supporting any tax cuts today, and I would like to spend the next 20 minutes to explain why. Firstly, we are very proud that we took a policy for small business to the 2013election, including a tax cut and a whole range of measures designed to help small business get ahead. We worked constructively with the government following the 2013 election, and we played a critical role in getting that small business package delivered and passed into legislation.


There are two key arguments the government use for supporting their Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan) Bill 2016. The first is that somehow this is going to deliver jobs and growth. Let's be very clear about this: this is the central, capstone policy of this 46th parliament for this Liberal-National government. This is the capstone policy to deliver us a future in this country over the next 10 years, and it relies on voodoo economics. It relies on the concept that, somehow, if we give companies more profits then those profits will trickle down into the economy, delivering wealth and jobs. This is based on the Laffer curve of the 1970s, a theory that has been thoroughly debunked; there is no empirical evidence whatsoever to support it—and I will discuss that more in a minute. The second reason the government use to support tax cuts for businesses, including big businesses, is that somehow we will suffer from a lack of foreign investment if we do not cut our tax rates. 


I want deal with comments made by the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, at Davos in January this year. She made a very interesting statement in light of what we are considering here today in the Australian parliament. Her statement also applies to foreign jurisdictions such as the US economy. She was asked a question about what she saw as being the black swan events for 2017 in the international economy. For those who are not aware, black swan events relate to generally unforeseen but high-risk events that can rock financial markets and economies. Christine Lagarde is possibly one of the most influential and important leaders in international economics and she had this to say: 


If the disruptions we are expecting for 2017 as a result of what has happened in 2016 prove to be all negative and we are to end up in a race to the bottom on the tax front, on the trade front and on the financial regulation front, then that for me would be a really big black swan that would have devastating effects for countries other than those that are likely to cause it. 


To repeat that: in direct reference to corporate tax cuts that Donald Trump, the US President, had been talking about, the head of the IMF, at the beginning of the year at the premier international conference, said that major cuts to taxes could have devastating effects—a 'race to the bottom'—on the global economy. 


So much for tax cuts having a positive effect on the economy, which no doubt speaker after speaker across the chamber in the Liberal-National Party are going to come in here and tell us. This is the head of the IMF saying to us that 'a race to the bottom'—and nobody wins in a race to the bottom—is going to be a significant economic risk to the global economy this year. This is a race that our Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, is about to fire the starting gun on today. Here we are in the Senate, lining up to get ready for that race—a race to the bottom. 


Interestingly, it is not just Christine Lagarde, the head of the IMF, who has been making comments. When I thought about the corporate tax cuts myself, I reflected on my experience working in finance. I spent 10 years at the University of Tasmania teaching international finance to MBA students and to undergraduates. I have a pretty good idea of how businesses make decisions, especially around direct foreign investment, and I was aware that tax was only one of many factors in consideration by corporations when they look at foreign investment. 


Let's have a look at whether a high tax rate in this country relative to other countries has affected our foreign investment. There is a very interesting report put out by the The Australia Institute that says that cutting company tax will not drive investment, and it outlined an analysis that finds that 97 per cent of applications to Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board come from countries already with lower tax rates than Australia and that by value 71 per cent of applications come from countries with lower rates. 


All this raises the question: if Australia is already successful at attracting foreign investment, why would we give tax cuts to foreigners? It goes on to say that history shows that, when Australia's tax rates were adjusted in the past, foreign investment did not go the way we expected. When the rate climbed to 49 per cent in the 1980s, there was a rise, not a drop, in foreign investment. I encourage all senators to read that report—I will actually quote it again in a minute. It has some very interesting empirical evidence and analysis. 


But let's get back to what corporations think about a tax cut. Canada's largest pension fund, with $300 billion under investment, called the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board, was asked this question in Australia last month. I put this question to Senator Cormann in estimates and to Mr John Fraser, the head of Treasury, as I did Christine Lagarde's comments which they batted off. They said they disagreed with the head of the IMF that a 'race to the bottom' in corporate tax cuts was a risk to the global economy. I asked them about the comments by the Canadian pension fund that stated:


As investors we frankly value the cash flows. What matters to us is predictability—it is not so much the level of tax paid. We look at the predictability of the system and we think Australia rates quite highly on that measure.


From a tax perspective, as long as we know going in what we are buying we are happy. We think Australia will maintain its competitiveness and the tax rate will not affect that. 


This is one of the biggest foreign investors in our country, especially in the area of infrastructure, batting away and rejecting commentary that Australia may lose its international competitiveness if we do not cut corporate tax rates and join in this race to the bottom with the US President, Donald Trump, and with Britain. 


When I put that question to Mr Fraser in estimates he did not agree with the Canadian pension fund, but he has had experience working with them in the past. But he has previously said that he does not necessarily believe that big businesses, which are going to get the bulk of the benefit of corporate tax cuts—have no doubt about that—necessarily put much emphasis on them either. He said, 'If anything, it is a second- or third- or fourth-rate consideration for them.' He did say—in all fairness—that a cutting of the corporate tax rate would be a good thing for small and medium business but for big business it was not necessarily the case. So he has made his views clear. I find it quite interesting that even the head of Treasury has previously been on record as saying that he does not believe that corporate tax cuts will necessarily impact foreign investment, especially for big businesses. 


David Gonski, another leader in the business community in Australia, has also said that tax cuts are not the best solution. He was quoted recently, in the last month, in the Australian media in relation to this debate declaring that cutting the corporate tax rate would make little difference to large Australian companies. This is putting him at loggerheads, interestingly, with the Business Council of Australia. He argued that other measures such as accelerated depreciation rates would make a much bigger difference to companies than cutting the corporate tax rate. He said, 'To take one part of the tax system and dwell on it is really not the way to do it.' This is one of the most respected businessmen in this country, who we are all very familiar with based on his work around the Gonski education reforms. 


Why are the Business Council of Australia, who represent the big end of town, so keen on seeing a cut to company tax? As you would probably guess, they stand to benefit from it the most, with billions of dollars in extra profits that will flow to their members. But what is really interesting when you look at the Business Council of Australia, who have been the key lobbyists for cutting the corporate tax rate from 30 to 25 per cent, in particular suggesting that it will affect foreign investment in this country if we do not, is that transparency reports that have now been lodged with the ATO show that the Business Council's members paid an effective tax rate in 2014-15 of just 24.3 per cent. An effective tax rate incorporates deductions against tax, which are perfectly legal and allowable deductions, by the way, but their effective tax rate—the real tax they pay—is already below the 25 per cent that they want us, in this Senate chamber, to cut the corporate tax rate to, which means that their effective tax rate, if we cut the headline rate to 25 per cent, will be around 20 per cent or less. So, if we look at this debate just on the headline rate, not think about the deductions and take a holistic approach to the issue, we see that it is also voodoo economics. May I say that we have heard different measures of what the Business Council of Australia's members pay, but, when it comes to multinational corporations themselves, a report last year found that 76 of Australia's largest multinationals pay an effective tax rate of just 16.2 per cent. That report was released by the Tax Justice Network. We have also seen reports by tax experts from the University of Technology Sydney, who have provided data for the top 100 companies, and they find that there are very low effective tax rates in this country.


It has not escaped my attention that recently there has also been work done by the Grattan Institute, who are often quoted in this place and the other place across the corridor because of the great work they do—and, by the way, the Greens do not always agree with what they put out, as you can imagine. Nevertheless, on this issue they went to great lengths to point out that a cut to corporate tax rates will benefit foreign investors more than domestic investors. Because the profits will be taken offshore, the impacts on the economy, especially in the first eight to nine years, of a cut in the company tax rate to 25 per cent will be very limited. There has also been a lot of criticism of the modelling that was used by the Treasury group that was commissioned to do the modelling. I do not have time to go into it today, but there is an enormous body of international work that thoroughly debunks the myth that, somehow, if we give corporations more profits, that will benefit us. In my observations and view of the world, it seems that it is trickle-up that has worked.


It would be a fascinating exercise to go to these corporations, who essentially we will be giving over $50 billion of taxpayer money to via these tax cuts, and ask them what kind of social contract we could put in place to guarantee that they will reinvest all that taxpayer money—and it is taxpayer money, because that is what we are currently collecting. In this social contract, will they invest that in jobs? Will they invest that in better conditions and pay for workers? Will they invest that in Australian communities? That is what our job is in government. It is to raise revenue and to invest that in our community across education, health care, national security or whatever it happens to be—that is our job, and that is the key cost. The modelling around the benefits in this trickle-down economics, this voodoo economics, of corporate tax cuts has been disputed and is very sparse on detail, but we do know what the costs are of these corporate tax cuts. They mean tens of billions of dollars in revenue forgone that could be better spent in other parts of the economy. I also recommend that senators examine the report by the Australia Institute on this, which actually goes into the detail of those opportunity costs.


So what could we do? If we do actually want to stimulate jobs in our economy and invest in the long-term future of our communities, what could we do as senators and in government? We have a lot of options ahead of us apart from cutting corporate tax rates and giving some of the biggest, wealthiest corporations in the world extra money in their pockets, taken directly out of our pockets. What else could we do? Just about every economist and every commentator in this country is talking about the need for the government now to significantly invest in long-term productive infrastructure in Australia. I chaired a select committee that went for nearly nine months that looked at this issue extensively. At every estimates I ask the Treasury secretary and others about why we are not doing more to invest in productive infrastructure. Right around this country, we have hundreds of billions, if not trillions, of dollars in underinvestment in our future. At record low interest rates, we have an opportunity to spend on capital. I am not referring to recurrent expenditure—I agree that carries significant risks—but why aren't we doing more now to invest in our future? The head of the Reserve Bank makes this point in every single public speech. I have heard evidence from Saul Eslake, John Hewson and so many economists that now is the time. I do not believe that at the moment we have the right structure around infrastructure spending in place through Infrastructure Australia. We need more transparency. We need proper cost-benefit analysis done. When need to depoliticise the process and reduce the risk so that we can actually get private investors involved in this issue.


The Greens took a policy to the last election—I know Labor had a slightly similar one—around a government owned infrastructure bank that would totally restructure Infrastructure Australia, make this investment process arm's length and look at how we can get the private sector to co-invest in infrastructure. I am not just talking about roads and public transport. I went around the country, including to smaller towns like Townsville, Wagga Wagga and other places, and heard about their infrastructure needs.


There are so many projects waiting for funding that would benefit communities and benefit productivity. Some of them can be monetised and some of them can even be securitised. Local government in my home state of Tasmania is crying out for just $2 billion to invest in 30-year sewerage infrastructure, because our infrastructure dates back, in some places, over 100 years. But it does not have the money, because the federal government is not making a pool of cheap finance available for long-term investment. If coalition senators actually want to stimulate jobs and growth, and they are serious about it, I ask them to consider why they are underinvesting in infrastructure in this country.


We can invest not only in jobs. We can invest in communities. We can invest in the environment. We can do a much better job by getting on and immediately stimulating our economy. We believe the government should play a very crucial leadership role on this issue. We are going down the wrong road in cutting corporate taxes. There is so much more that we could be doing. There is no evidence at all that corporate tax cuts work. This is the government's cheerleaders, the Business Council of Australia—no doubt many of those companies are donors to the Liberal-National Party.


We do not believe that this is the right way to go. Just to reiterate: the Greens will not be supporting any tax cuts today. We believe this is a race to the bottom that we do not want to be a part of. Nobody wins in a race to the bottom on corporate tax cuts.

"Watt, Sen Murray",ALP,2017-03-29,"



Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (10:16):  I do not intend to make a long contribution on this bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan) Bill 2016. I know we have a large amount of legislation to get through over the course of this week, but I want to put my position on the record over the course of this debate. Put simply, my position, not surprisingly, is that of the Labor Party's, which is that we support a company tax cut for small businesses with a turnover of up to $2 million per annum. We see absolutely no justification whatsoever for a company tax cut for larger businesses, particularly at this time and particularly with the Australian and world economies as they currently stand.


Really, this bill is just another example of how this government has the wrong priorities for dealing with the challenges that our country faces. Day after day we deal with bills put up by this government that seeks to make cuts to government expenditure and wages and conditions that the poorest in our community and low- and middle-income earners in our community depend upon. Even just in the last couple of weeks we have seen cuts made to family tax benefits, which only go to low- and middle-income families, and, increasingly, are targeted on the very low income earners within our community. We have seen cuts made to payments to single parents. We are still seeing the effects of cuts this government is making to public health funding and to public school funding. It has failed to invest in public transport infrastructure. The government is targeting and making cuts to anything that the average wage earner in Australia depends upon to get ahead in life. We know that the government supports penalty rate cuts as well.


If you are a low- or middle-income earner, if you are an average person in the Australian community, this government constantly comes after you through cuts to government expenditure. The justification that is always provided by the government is that we need to rein in the deficit, which—has it doubled or tripled under their watch?—has certainly increased substantially. But, at the very same time, the same government is willing to provide massive handouts to big business, whether it be in the form of subsidies or through this bill, through reductions in company tax.


The government failed to take any action in relation to the excessive concessions that are available to people through negative gearing, when they are seeking to negatively gear their third, fourth, fifth, 20th, 30th or 40th investment property. It seeks to give big company tax cuts, but, at the same time, it turns around and tell us that it cannot afford to provide government funding to provide decent health care, decent public schooling and decent income support to Australians who need it most.


As well as demonstrating that the government has the wrong priorities, this bill is an example of the government's driving a divide within the Australian community rather than taking action to bring us together. I spoke yesterday about the government's amendments to section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, which are going to open the door to more racist speech in our community and thereby facilitate greater division within our community. That is now being done on the economic front by this government as it seeks to provide a big company tax cut of $50 billion over 10 years to big businesses. This will only see the level of inequality in our community increase, where the rich get ahead and the poor are left behind, especially when this government is cutting a range of benefits as well.


Labor is very happy to support a company tax cut for smaller businesses—those with a turnover of up to $2 million a year. We understand that many of them are struggling at the moment, and a company tax cut to those smaller businesses will assist them to stay afloat and, in some instances, may generate some employment. But Labor does not see any justification at all for a company tax cut for the big end of town.


Australia is already one of the lowest taxed countries in the OECD. We are not a highly taxed country, despite the claims that are made to the contrary. We have a large and growing deficit, and yet this government wants to reduce the amount of revenue that it is collecting each year via a company tax cut. We are constantly told by the government that delivering this kind of company tax cut will generate jobs, will generate growth and will generate revenue for the government. It is classic 1980s Reaganomics. Anyone who has looked back on what occurred under President Reagan when he delivered these kinds of company tax cuts will know that the US government deficit ballooned and that there was no obvious economic pay-off to the United States in return for that ballooning deficit, which was largely generated by the excessive tax cuts provided by President Reagan. I fear that what is going to occur in Australia if the government gets this bill through. All it will do is increase the deficit further and increase inequality without any economic pay-off whatsoever.


The other thing worth pointing out about this bill is that it will not benefit regional Australia one little bit. There are not very many businesses in regional Queensland or regional Australia with an annual turnover in the tens of millions of dollars, so there is nothing that will benefit regional Australia by providing tax cuts to large businesses like that. Yet again, it will be another instance where regional Australia is left behind and the already large levels of inequality that we see in regional Australia will only be exacerbated by this bill.


If the argument is that other countries are cutting their company tax rates and therefore we should do the same, to me that is not a satisfactory argument. Just because someone is jumping over a bridge does not mean we have to do the same thing. In fact, what we should be doing is stepping up our efforts towards international harmonisation of tax rates and closing some of the tax evasion that is occurring by companies that are chasing the lowest company tax rate all around the world. Every country in the world has an interest in bringing in sufficient tax revenue, and if we continually chase each other by reducing company tax rates and income tax rates for high income earners then we will be left in a situation where not one country in the world has the revenue that is required to deliver the social services that their populations rightly expect.


In summary, with the Australian economy the way it is at the moment and the budget deficit the way it is at the moment, this is absolutely the wrong time to be cutting big business tax rates. It is the wrong time to do the wrong thing. This bill, if it gets through, will increase the level of inequality in our community. It will drive up the deficit and there will be no economic pay-off whatsoever. That is why I and the rest of the Labor Party will be voting against the company tax cuts for any businesses with a turnover above $2 million a year.

"Paterson, Sen James",LP,2017-03-29,"



Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (10:24):  Mr Acting Deputy President Whish-Wilson, I was lucky enough to make it into the chamber for the tail end of your contribution to this debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan) Bill 2016. While I certainly will not respond to everything you said in your speech, it would be remiss of me not to take the opportunity to address your comments about trickle-down economics. This is a personal bugbear of mine, I admit, but trickle-down economics is something that exists only in the minds of those who are opposed to it. There was actually a study done on this in recent years—I do not have it to hand, unfortunately—and there is no evidence throughout economic history that any advocate of supply-side economics, which is a better description of what I think you are referring to, has ever used the phrase 'trickle-down economics' in a persuasive way, in a way that they believe in when arguing for it. It is like neoliberalism: you will hear about neoliberalism a lot in universities and amongst the minds of those who are opposed to neoliberalism, but no-one in the history of economic thought has described themselves as a neoliberal. Anyway, that is not the substantive issue that we are here to debate today.


Let me also respond to Senator Watt's comments about Reaganomics. Unfortunately, he has got his history a little bit wrong, as is often the case in this area. The tax cuts that Ronald Regan presided over as President were primarily to personal income tax cuts, although there also were company tax cuts under his presidency. They were very substantial cuts to the rates of personal income tax in America, but to say that that caused the deficit in America under his presidency is curious on a number of grounds. One of those, and most importantly, is that the revenue collected from individuals after the tax rates were cut in fact increased rather than decreased. This is something that has been seen throughout economic history, but particularly throughout American history. It was the case under President JFK, as it was the case under President Reagan: cuts to individual tax rates in fact resulted in increased levels of revenue for the government, not decreased levels of revenue.


With those two historical side points aside, I now want to address the substance of the debate here today. I am very proud to be here to speak in favour of the government's Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan) Bill 2016, because I believe it will make Australia more competitive and more prosperous. It will encourage more investment, and, ultimately, that will lead to higher wages and better jobs for Australians. I am very proud to be here to support this policy today.


You need not take my word for it.




Senator Dastyari:
  We won't!




Senator PATERSON:
  I realise that Senator Dastyari and others may be sceptical about my views on this issue, and so I will not rely alone on my views on the facts and evidence that I will take you through here this morning. I will rely on the views of those that I know that Senator Dastyari respects greatly—that is, the views of his own Labor colleagues, who helpfully have been on the record extensively on this issue in recent years and who, I think, have made some very sensible observations. There was the comment made by the then Assistant  Treasurer, Bill Shorten, who is now our opposition leader. He said in 2011:


Cutting the company income tax rate increases domestic productivity and domestic investment. More capital means higher productivity and economic growth and leads to more jobs and higher wages.


I could not have put it better myself. Chris Bowen, in his 2013 book Hearts and Minds, said:


It's a Labor thing to have the ambition of reducing company tax, because it promotes investment, creates jobs and drives growth.


Hear, hear, Chris Bowen; absolutely spot on. Bill Shorten also said in 2011, again as Assistant Treasurer:


Any student of Australian business and economic history since the mid-80s knows that part of Australia's success was derived through the reduction in the company tax rate.


We need to be able to make life easier for Australian business, which employs two in every three Australians.


Hear, hear; I could not agree more.


Senator Watt said before that reducing our company tax rates because other countries have done so to ensure that we remain internationally competitive is like following someone who has jumped off a bridge. That was a particularly graphic metaphor that I encourage him, when he has an opportunity, to discuss with Bill Shorten, his leader, because it in fact repudiates Bill Shorten's previous view on this issue. Again as Assistant Treasurer, in 2011, he said:


The Government's tax reform agenda has a strong focus on ensuring that Australia remains an attractive place to invest.


…   …   …


Cutting the company tax rate is an important step along this road.


This recognises the benefits to investment and growth from lower company tax rates and a trend to lower rates across the OECD over the past 30 years.


Senator Watt here today is repudiating the very words and arguments made by his own leader not more than six years ago.


Chris Bowen, again in his book, in 2013, in the chapter 'Promoting growth through cutting company tax'—what a great title for a chapter on economic reform; I could not have written it better myself, Senator Dastyari—said:


… Keating knew that the corporate tax rate needed to be cut to make Australia competitive, that capital and investment would flow to tax-competitive nations and that this was an important job-creation move. Today capital is even more mobile than it was then and it is important that our corporate tax rate is more competitive.


I did not know that—in Senator Watt's words—Mr Bowen was an enthusiast for jumping off a bridge to follow others, but it seems that he is. I encourage Senator Watt to take that up with his now shadow Treasurer.


Of course the shadow Treasurer also said on Lateline in December 2014:


I'd like to see it—


'it' being the company tax rate—


lower over time. I think we've had 14 years of having the corporate tax rate stable. That's too long. Over time, I'd like to see it lowered.


Indeed. He went on to say:


As the alternative Treasurer, I'm telling you that … it would be a better thing if Australia's corporate tax rate was more competitive …


That is very hard to argue with. In 2013, he said:


I think we should have the ambition of lowering company tax. … it would be the approach that we would take that our ambition would be lower company tax rates over time because it does improve our international competitiveness.


Again, I think that is very eloquently responding to Senator Watt's arguments before.


I was very touched to hear Senator Watt's concern about the federal government deficit and the debt that has been accrued and continues to accrue under the federal government. I share his concern, and I am very pleased to see him speaking about it here, but I think that unfortunately, in this instance, he is being a little bit disingenuous, on a couple of grounds. First of all, as we know, the Labor Party's record in government in this area is not one to boast about. They inherited a very good set of books, and they left them in a parlous state. There is no need to go over the ancient history of details of that, but I think their record in this department is abundantly clear. Also abundantly clear are the extraordinary lengths they have gone to to attempt to prevent this government from fixing the mess that they created and to attempt to prevent this government from paying for the things that they spent on when they were in government.


But particularly disingenuous by Senator Watt was the fact that he believes that these company tax cuts are going to expand the deficit and expand the debt. It is disingenuous because, as Senator Watt I am sure would know, the Labor Party during the election campaign spent not just every single dollar that would be spent in this company tax cut plan but $16½ billion extra. So Senator Watt's concern about the deficit I think would be more fairly and better focused on his own party's policies. Even if the company tax cuts did not proceed, it would be worsened by at least $16½ billion, just taking their election policy into account and not even taking into account what they have proposed since.


And, of course, it is another thing which the shadow Treasurer, Chris Bowen, has refuted, and I think he is right. Again in Hearts & Minds, a great book which I am very pleased to be assisting in promoting today, he says:


… the United Kingdom, facing a much tougher fiscal situation than Australia's, cut its company tax rate to 23 per cent in April 2013, to be reduced further to 21 per cent in April 2014.


So here is Chris Bowen saying that, despite the deficit that the UK has, it has proceeded with company tax cuts, and that was the right thing to do. I entirely agree, but again I hate to point out that Senator Watt is out of step with his colleagues on this issue.


I thought, when I was contemplating my contribution to this debate this morning, that I should revisit the Henry tax review because it is the most recent and most comprehensive review of our taxation system. It was done under the former government, and it was done by a person that I do not think anyone in this chamber would suggest is a neoliberal or an advocate of trickle-down economics. I stand to be corrected, but somehow I doubt that. There are a number of interesting aspects of the Henry tax review on the issue of company tax, which I commend to all senators who are considering how they will vote on this bill later this week.


The first is that the Henry tax review very powerfully demonstrated how out of step Australia's company tax rate is with the rest of the world. They were doing so in May 2010. The data that they used—and this is on page 39 of the report—was from 2009. Things have moved on since 2009, and I will update the Senate on just how they have moved on. But, in 2009, these were the OECD countries that had a lower corporate tax rate than Australia: the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, New Zealand, Luxembourg, Norway, Mexico, Portugal, Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands, Greece, Denmark, Austria, Korea, Switzerland, Turkey, Hungary, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Poland, Iceland and Ireland. That was in 2009. The handful of countries in the OECD that had a higher corporate tax rate than Australia in those years was Germany, France, the United States and Japan.


Already, Ken Henry and his review were concerned that Australia was becoming out of step with the rest of the world on corporate tax. But what has happened since should give everyone in this chamber cause for much greater concern, because very many of those countries I just listed, including both those who already had a lower corporate tax rate than us and those who had a higher tax rate than us, have since further reduced their company tax rates. They have cut their company tax rates further. So Australia is becoming even more out of step with the OECD. Our company tax is becoming even less competitive.


It is likely that it will become less competitive still, particularly if President Donald Trump is successful in his plan to reduce the United States corporate tax rate down to 15 per cent, as he has promised to do, and if Germany follows suit, as it has promised to do if Trump is successful, and if the UK continues to cut its corporate tax rate as a way of ensuring that it remains competitive after its exit from the European Union, as Theresa May, the Prime Minister, has flagged it will do. Australia was already dangerously out of step in 2009, and we have become only more so since. Our international position and competitiveness have been eroded even further from what worried Ken Henry so much in 2009.


I will quote directly from the report now—and again I remind senators that this is Ken Henry's report, under a Labor government. He said:


Australia should respond to these developments by reducing the company income tax rate to 25 per cent over the short to medium term …


Presumably, the short to medium term from 2009 is right about now. He goes on to say:


This would ensure that Australia remains an attractive place to invest…


…   …   …


Reducing taxes on investment, particularly company income tax, would also encourage innovation and entrepreneurial activity. Such reforms would increase income for Australians by building a larger and more productive capital stock, and by generating technology and knowledge spillovers that boost the productivity of Australian businesses. A lower company income tax rate would also reduce incentives for foreign multinationals to shift profits out of Australia.


Again, that is in the words of Ken Henry.


One of the reasons why the government are proposing this reform is that we know that the benefits of a lower corporate tax rate will flow through to workers' wages and income. We know that reducing the company tax rate, which will increase investment in and the profitability of Australian companies, will ultimately and decisively benefit Australian workers. This is something which has been studied widely. The Tax Foundation in the United States, for example, found:


Wages rise $2.50 for every $1 reduction in state and local corporate income taxes.


Treasury modelling predicts that the enterprise tax plan will increase gross national income by up to 0.8 per cent and wages after tax by more than one per cent. One study estimated that a 10 percentage point increase in the corporate tax rate would decrease annual gross wages by seven per cent, with a similar impact on low- and high-skilled workers. 


Over time, the amount of capital investment in Australia is reduced by an uncompetitive business tax rate. This is particularly important as the tax rates of our competitors and our sources of foreign direct investment reduce. Our largest foreign direct investor, the United States, today has a company tax rate which is higher than ours, but, as I have said, it has a plan to reduce it. If they do, we may see a sharp reduction in the flow of investment from them, our largest source of foreign direct investment, and that would have very serious consequences for the wages of Australian workers. This is something that Andrew Leigh, the shadow Assistant Treasurer, has acknowledged, saying that there is a strong link between the company tax rate and wages. He has quoted studies which estimate that an increase in company tax by 10 percentage points would lead to a fall in wages by six to 10 per cent.


An important thing to bear in mind is that the benefits of reducing the company tax rate will be permanent and long lasting for the Australian economy. It is something which we will reap the benefits of, going forward. This is not just a one-off sugar hit, like the stimulus packages put in place by those opposite that we are still paying for today. This is a permanent improvement to Australia's competitiveness and productivity that will deliver dividends for decades to come.


Treasury modelling shows that a five per cent reduction in business tax will deliver a permanent boost to the economy of about one per cent over the long run, as I mentioned. Australian modelling predicts that reducing the company tax rate from 30 per cent to 25 per cent would result in a permanent increase in business investment of up to 2.9 per cent over a similar period, which is equivalent to about $6.5 billion in today's dollars. By comparison, the highly successful reforms—revered by all sides of politics and by economists—preceded by the Hilmer report in the 1990s delivered about a 2.5 per cent boost to the economy. So, when those opposite talk about the economic reform legacy of Keating, as they should and are entitled to do, and they talk about the benefits delivered by the competition reforms, which were very real and very positive, they should bear in mind that they delivered a smaller boost to the economy than this tax cut for businesses will.


In the United States, it has been estimated that a one per cent cut in local business taxes can increase the number of local establishments by about three to four per cent over a 10-year period. The OECD has found that corporate income taxes are the most harmful major tax when it comes to economic growth. UK modelling predicted that reducing the tax rate from 28 per cent to 20 per cent would result in a permanent increase in investment of up to 4.5 per cent over a 20-year period.


That reminds me of another key finding of the Henry tax review. This is on page 13 of the report, in the chapter entitled 'The need for reform', which I think is even more prescient today than it was in 2009. The Treasury ranked taxes by the marginal welfare loss generated by increasing those taxes, and this is a common method to determine which taxes have the least deadweight loss on the economy and which taxes therefore can raise revenue with the least negative impact on welfare. They ranked these from the greatest loss in welfare to the lowest loss in welfare. The first three taxes are state based taxes, which obviously we do not have direct control over. They were the royalties and crude oil excise, insurance taxes and payroll tax. They are the ones that have potentially the most negative effect on welfare. But the next, fourth most harmful tax from the point of view of the welfare of the Australian people—and it is by far the most damaging tax at the federal level—is corporate income tax.


It is no accident that Ken Henry was recommending primarily, among all the other recommendations he made, a reduction of the company income tax rate—because it is a tax under the direct control of the federal government and it is the tax that has the most damaging impact on our economy.


I spoke before about the fact that a cut to company tax rates will be permanent and long lasting, but the other important thing is that the impact will be immediate. It will have an immediate impact on our economy and give an immediate boost not just to small businesses—who, under our plan, will take advantage immediately of a reduction in tax rates, and that is a very important aspect of the plan—but also to medium and larger sized businesses, who, if this full package is legislated, will have confidence that the investments they make today, which have a long lead time and which may not return a profit for many years, will be returned in a favourable tax environment. That will encourage them to make those investments today. 


One of the most important things we can do is deliver certainty to those businesses that there will be a good economic return on their investment in the years to come. So, even if we cut their taxes today through legislation but the effect does not happen for many years, we can expect to see an immediate improvement in business investment. Today those companies are sitting around, watching what we are doing and deciding whether or not to invest, and there is no way that they are going to invest until they see action by this parliament to demonstrate that they should invest. 


So, if we are worried, as we all should be, about the declining rates, the low rates, of investment in Australia, and the impact that that has on the take-home pay of workers and on the returns for retirees in their retirement, then the best thing we can do is not just pass part of this package but pass every bit of this package today to deliver instant benefits to small business and long-term benefits to the country.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan) Bill 2016</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2017-03-29,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (10:44):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan) Bill 2016. We are debating a bill that I have no doubt the government will be running away from as fast as they can. We have always been very clear on this side of the chamber that Labor will not support, and will never support, cuts of tax to the big end of town and to big business. This bill gives effect to a series of 2016-17 budget measures that were aimed at reducing company tax for small, medium and large size businesses. The bill contains three measures: reducing the company tax to 25 per cent, increasing the unincorporated small business tax discount and increasing the small business entity threshold. As I said, Labor does not support tax cuts for big business. In line without position, prior to the last election we said we would support company tax for small businesses with turnovers of less than $2 million. We will be moving amendments in the committee stage to reflect our position on these cuts.


We believe very firmly that now is not the time to deliver tax relief for large businesses. Let us remember that Australia is at risk of losing its AAA rating, and this government—the one that is on the government bench—is responsible for that. The time to give tax cuts is quite clearly not now. The government is trying to deliver a $50 billion tax cut for the big end of town. That, to me, demonstrates how reckless this government is, how out of touch this government is and how this government has absolutely failed the Australian people. It has failed with its leadership, because there quite clearly has not been any proper leadership when it comes to the budget or the economy.


They trumpeted around the country during the 2016 federal election, and their big chant was 'jobs and growth'. For those that are listening in, those that have been in this chamber for some time, would remember that the former member for Bass used to have his staff every morning do a chant, 'jobs and growth, jobs and growth.' They have failed. They have failed to deliver on all of those things. No jobs have been created. We have seen a blow out in the deficit and in the net debt. We have seen growth beyond trend, wage growth at record lows and underemployment at record highs and now they want to hand out a $50 billion tax cut. After such a deplorable and embarrassing year that this government had last year, we were all hoping that they would kickstart 2017 with a few goals. But, no, they have not done that at all. I want to highlight and contrast how this side of the parliament want to spend taxpayers' money, because it is all very relevant to this bill.


In a desperate attempt to save Christopher Pyne's seat in South Australia, and to hold their seats against the trend that is across this country—that the Australian people have lost confidence in them—what they have done, and what they intend to do, is undermine an internationally recognised and nationally recognised institution that is based in Launceston: the Australian Maritime College. What they are planning to do is spend $25 million creating another institution in Adelaide. Why? It is a clear cut case of pork barrelling.


For the last 20 years or more—right back from when I worked in the state government—there has been bipartisan support for the Australian Maritime College. A lot of federal and state money has gone into making sure that it is an international leader. It is highly respected. That institution trains the world's best seafarers. They ensure that we are recognised internationally. We have international students. We have the Australian Defence Force sending their recruits and their engineers. The Navy is a great supporter of the Australian Maritime College. Only recently, in this place, the Liberal Senate team joined with us in unanimously passing a motion that we would spend more of the defence budget in Tasmania. What have we got now? We have a desperate, dysfunctional government that is putting at risk and undermining an international college, the Australian Maritime College. This is how dysfunctional this government is.


This government is hell-bent on punishing Tasmanians, because they threw out the three amigos at the last election. They lost the seat of Bass because of an arrogant, out-of-touch member. What they are doing now is trying to take revenge on the economy of northern Tasmania. I know, Mr Acting Deputy President Whish-Wilson, that you would share my concerns about the Australian Maritime College being undermined and what that would do not only to Tasmania but to the economy of northern Tasmania in particular.




Senator Fawcett:
  A point of order. I draw the chair's attention to the bill, which is the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan) Bill 2016. 




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Whish-Wilson
):  We give a fair bit of latitude in these debates as you are aware, Senator Fawcett. Is that your point of order?




Senator Fawcett:
  The member opposite is misleading the house in that the college that was established, or announced recently, is a technical college not a college—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Whish-Wilson
):  That is a debating point.




Senator POLLEY:
  You know you are hitting the mark when you start getting interjections from those opposite. I am really surprised that the good senator would want to defend Mr Pyne's assertions by undermining a Defence Force facility, being an ex-military person himself.


In this instance, what is so critical is that the $25 million would be better placed—better served to the Defence Force and the economy, particularly in northern Tasmania—and better invested in an already established college, such as the AMC, that is recognised not only nationally but also internationally. Why would you want to support a government that is undermining that? It really disappoints me.


When we go back to this debate about taxation let us be very clear and put the facts on the table. This government is hell-bent on giving big businesses more—at this time, when our AAA rating is under threat, when we have the highest underemployment rate and when there is low wage growth for ordinary workers, they are bringing in and supporting penalty rates cuts to the lowest paid workers in this country. 


We know that Mr Turnbull and his government do not believe in fairness. What they believe in is giving $50 billion to the big end of town; at the same time they are slashing family tax benefits and they are cutting health. We know they are underfunding our schools. They are attacking Medicare. And we know there are going to be 700,000 Australians who will be directly affected by this government's support for cutting penalty rates. 


Yesterday, we had those on the other side trying to defend their position on penalty rates cuts, saying, 'Well, we support the independent umpire'. Quite frankly, they know that that is not true. They know they did it for trucking companies; they interfered then. But it is in their DNA not to stand up and support everyday Australians. They do not support pensioners. They accuse new mothers of rorting the system and double-dipping. We know that they have underfunded the education system. We know that they have undermined child care in this country, particularly in rural and regional Australia—and remote Australia and our Aboriginal brothers and sisters. Attacking pensioners is all right for those on the other side, but they will be very quick to get up and support Mr Pyne's and Mr Turnbull's attempts to undermine the Australian Maritime College and to waste $25 million when that money should be spent in northern Tasmania—not in South Australia trying to save their own seats. 


I do not believe that this type of legislation will do anything at all. It does not matter what Mr Pyne tries to do to try and buy a seat—like Mr Turnbull tried to buy government. This legislation will not be supported, because we on this side—and there will be enough on the opposition side—know that this is bad policy. This is bad policy and bad timing. I urge everyone in this chamber to stand up against this government.

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2017-03-29,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (10:54):  I rise to speak in relation to the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan) Bill 2016. Following on from the comments of Senator Polley, I indicate our concern about this bill. I want to put on the record from the outset that Labor does believe in responsible management of the budget. Labor also believes that a reduction in the small business company tax rate is a way to support Australian jobs and contribute to national prosperity. But we do not believe in fiscal recklessness, and that is what is behind this particular measure. 


Before I talk about the measure in more detail, I want to talk about how we have come to this have this so-called centrepiece of the government's economic plan. I want to take a step back for a second and look at the shambolic decision making which has led to the announcement of this enterprise tax plan. I think the other factor here is that we need to look at the broken election commitment of the Abbott government of 2013. They promised to have a comprehensive look at our taxation system. 


We know that we had the Intergenerational report. We know there was supposed to be a process following the Intergenerational report—a tax white paper and a green paper. And we know that upon the taking of office of the Prime Minister, following the demise of Prime Minister Abbott, there was basically a canning of the whole process that was undertaken to have a comprehensive look at our taxation system. There were a number of submissions. I think about $5 million in costs were incurred by the public sector in receiving the hundreds of submissions examining those submissions, not to mention examining the work that was done by organisations in contributing to that promised comprehensive review. All of that came to nothing. It was just scrapped for the political objectives of Mr Turnbull. 


Then there was a series of thought bubbles that took place last year. Around 12 months ago, the Prime Minister was floating the idea of states assuming some taxation powers. We know that there was also a thought bubble in relation to the GST being increased. All of these things were ill-fated and all of these things were done in the absence of proper consultation. All of this illustrates the chaotic nature in which economic policy is being set by this government. So we did find that the government landed on this so-called enterprise tax plan. This, in our view, is fiscal recklessness. The government has sent a clear message that the AAA credit rating is under pressure. Now is not the time to put in place a structural adjustment that builds to $13 billion a year by the end of the next 10 years. 


These are the economic facts. The economy is growing below trend. The unemployment rate has increased and is now close to six per cent. Underemployment is at record highs. There are fewer full-time jobs than a year ago, and wages growth is at record lows. And not only is wages growth at record lows but we also have the threat of a penalty rates cut for low-income workers—700,000 workers around the country potentially. I know that the Treasurer has indicated that, in his opinion, low wage growth is the greatest single threat to our economy. If one looks at the impact of a dramatic cut to penalty rates, surely one can see that that has to be a greater problem for us in terms of economic growth. 


It was a Labor government in 2011 that saw for the first time all three ratings agencies award Australia the top sovereign credit rating of AAA. No Liberal government has ever been able to make such a claim. Since taking office the government has mismanaged the budget, tripling the deficit since the 2014 budget and blowing out net debt by $100 billion. So much for fiscal conservatism.


The government continues to receive warnings that the AAA credit rating is under threat. In July of last year Standard & Poor's put Australia's AAA credit rating on a negative outlook. S&P noted that debt could continue to rise unless more budget savings measures are legislated or there are improvements in the revenue outlook. The shadow Treasurer, Mr Bowen, has noted that Standard & Poor's is calling out the Liberal-National government for three years of fiscal failure and passing a vote of no confidence in this government's ability to deal with the budget situation. S&P also noted that, over the next six to 12 month, it would continue to monitor the success of the new government's ability to pass revenue and expenditure measures through both houses of parliament. Now is the time to work on fiscal repair, not to blow out the budget further.


Labor is serious about budget repair. We took a number of policies to the election, including a multinational tax package; abolishing the Emissions Reduction Fund; negative gearing and capital gains tax reform; and reversing the government's tax cut for millionaires. Labor has continued the work of fiscal repair, including changes to last year's omnibus bill that made the bill bigger, better and fairer, including abolishing the baby bonus and the abolition of the family tax benefit part A supplement for families with adjusted taxable incomes above $80,000. Labor is still willing to work with the government on additional savings in areas such as negative gearing and capital gains tax. Labor has a track record, both during the election and in the term of parliament, of delivering on budget repair in a way that is fair.


As the government has indicated, this bill is the centrepiece of its budget and election campaign. A responsible government would have immediately released figures of a long-term structural change over 10 years. But it was not until Labor put pressure on this issue during estimates last year that the Treasury Secretary, Mr Fraser, and not the Treasurer, fessed up on the $48.2 billion cost of this policy.


The government has form in this area, spruiking jobs and growth while doing all it can to hide the long-term impact of its centrepiece policy. We all remember the Prime Minister's train wreck of an interview with David Speers, where it was revealed that the government had no reasonable basis for withholding this valuable public information. The government knows that the release of this figure puts squarely in focus its contradiction of constantly talking about budget repair while wanting to blow a hole in the budget.


The Treasurer spruiks responsible budget management. He says:


Everything we look at in in the budget, every revenue measure we look at in the budget, expenditure and revenue, it must be fit for purpose, it must be sustainable, it must do its job and if it's not doing it, then you've got to change it.


However, when you measure this bill against the Treasurer's own words, a bill which is not sustainable and contains tax measures with questionable benefits, one can only come to the conclusion that it is seriously flawed. According to the Treasurer's own words it needs changing.


The Grattan Institute has commented that the alleged benefits of this bill have not been thought through properly. They state:


It is an article of faith in Australia's business community that corporate tax cuts are the big lever for increasing economic growth. Australia's corporate tax rate is high relative to most developed countries. OECD studies show that lower corporate tax rates tend to lead to higher investment and hence higher economic output. Many studies—including the 2012 Game Changers report for Grattan Institute—picked up this research and highlighted company tax cuts as one of the big opportunities for government to increase prosperity.


Yet ironically legislation to cut the company tax rate over 10 years has been introduced at the precise time that doubts are growing about the payback of corporate tax cuts, especially for countries such as Australia that have dividend imputation systems.


Australia's unusual dividend imputation system means that domestic investors are largely unaffected by the company tax rate since any profits paid to them are taxed at their personal income tax rate. Yet because foreign investors, by contrast, do not benefit from dividend imputation, a cut to the company tax rate provides bigger benefits to them. For those who have already made long-term investments in Australia, a reduction in the tax rate would be a windfall. Many of the international studies about the economic impacts of cutting corporate tax rates are therefore not readily applicable to Australia.


The Government maintains that the change will boost GDP by more than 1 per cent in the long-term, at a budgetary cost of $48.2 billion over the next 10 years. But the best analysis from the Commonwealth Treasury shows that the net benefits to Australians' incomes will be much smaller once profits flowing out of Australia are taken into account. Raising other taxes to compensate for the foregone company tax revenue will create their own economic costs. Because additional corporate investment will phase in slowly, the benefits of company tax cuts for Australian incomes will be a long time coming. And the substantial costs of the measure in the short term could see company tax cuts drag on national incomes for the next ten years. Weighing the balance, it is not clear that corporate tax cuts should be Australia's top priority.


It is very interesting that the Grattan Institute highlights this thinking which has emerged that company tax cuts are not the magic wand or panacea they might have been thought to be some years ago. Economic thinking has moved on but this government continues to grasp onto issues which, whilst they might make a nice headline, are not delivering for the Australian economy and the people of Australia.


The other point about this wonderful windfall for companies is that there is such a huge windfall for the major banks and overseas companies. We note that the benefits of wholesale corporate tax cuts potentially go to foreign investors. And, according to the Australia Institute, the cuts are a $7.4 billion windfall for the largest banks in Australia. We know that the behaviour of the banks has been quite deplorable over the last five to 10 years in particular. To reward that behaviour with a massive windfall in terms of a company tax cut sends a very strange message. It just illustrates the point that it is unusual for a government to be defending the banks from a royal commission at all costs yet at the same time handing out largesse to them at a time when, as we all know, they are making massive profits.


The Australia Institute in its report Company tax cuts: what the evidence shows states:


The BCA’s CEO Jennifer Westacott titled her recent opinion piece on the subject, ‘Start tax debate with right objective: Boosting growth’. The evidence presented here suggests that if there are any growth dividends of lowering the company tax rate they are so weak as to be outweighed by other factors. Neither cross-country comparison nor Australia’s own history lend any support to the ‘tax-cuts-are-good’ thesis. If the aim really is increased economic growth, then Australians would be better advised to ignore the business lobby’s call for lower company tax rates and look seriously at other policies. Australia’s golden age of economic growth, 1945 to the 1970s, was backed by full employment policies and investment in infrastructure, education, science and technology.


I believe that the case for a wholescale tax cut has not been thought through and that alternative measures, such as increased investment in infrastructure, health and education, have not been properly thought through and assessed. Indeed, the Australian Council of Social Service stated in its submission:


If Treasury's assumption that in the long term 45% of the budget cost of a 5% company tax cut is offset by higher growth and increases in revenue from other taxes, this suggests that a net $8 billion in foregone public revenue is being used to 'buy' an improvement in household welfare or spending power of much less than 0.7%. If the Treasury modelling is accurate, this is an underwhelming result.


…   …   …


More substantial economic benefits are likely from a range of other public policies beyond tax reform. These include taking advantage of historically low interest rates to increase public investment in projects vetted by a reputable oversight body; policies to strengthen workforce participation (especially among parents, mature age people and social security recipients); improved urban planning and investment (especially in affordable housing and public transport); and investment in quality early childhood and school education for children at risk of falling behind.


I believe that the government has not properly assessed whether this $50 billion tax cut is the best way to manage the budget when other alternatives, such as investment in infrastructure, education and health, are likely to deliver far greater returns. Given that borrowing costs are historically low and that the RBA has appealed to the government to increase infrastructure spending, infrastructure should be an area where the government can come to the table to work cooperatively with the opposition.


Small businesses make a huge contribution to national prosperity and supporting Australian jobs. Small businesses play a central role in the economy. Over two million sole traders, partnerships, trusts and small employers have helped underpin 25 years of economic growth. Labor stands by its election commitments and is prepared accept amendments to the bill that would, firstly, only reduce the company tax rate to 27.5 per cent for businesses with a turnover of less than $2 million—the threshold that remains consistent with the ATO definition of 'small business'; secondly, only increase the unincorporated small business tax discount from five per cent to eight per cent and only for businesses with a turnover of less than $2 million; and, thirdly, not proceed with the increase to the small business entity threshold. This position, costed by the Parliamentary Budget Office, would save $4.4 billion over the forward estimates and $50.1 billion over the medium term.


Labor also holds to the definition of 'small business' remaining less than $2 million in turnover, as there is not a strong economic justification for increasing that threshold above $2 million. The government's own Treasury modelling clearly states that the objective of reducing company tax is to attract more foreign investment. Delivering tax relief for companies with a turnover of between $2 million and $10 million would attract little, if any, additional foreign investment, as that tends to occur with much larger businesses.


In summary, even according to the standards that the Treasurer has set himself, this bill is not ready to be passed. The budget position has deteriorated under the coalition's watch: the deficit has tripled since 2014 and $100 billion has been added to net debt. The credit-rating agencies are taking a serious look at Australia's fiscal position and now is the time to engage in budget repair in a way that is fair and to make sound investments that promote inclusive growth. The centrepiece of the government's agenda ignores the concerns of the rating agencies and instead ram-raids a $50 billion hit over the medium term. A number of groups have stated that the benefits make take time to emerge. In light of this, more productive investment in infrastructure should be considered in line with the recent RBA comments. According to the Treasurer's own words, this bill is not sustainable and it is not fit for purpose and hence needs changing.


Labor is committed to budget repair in a way that is fair. Labor has recently followed through on its commitment with the recent passing of the omnibus bill. Labor remains prepared to deliver targeted, sustainable tax cuts for small businesses with a turnover of less than $2 million per year while preserving the budget position so that other investments, such as in infrastructure, health and education, can be considered. Labor is committed to responsible budget management and to protect Australia's AAA credit rating. Labor believes that the defending of the credit rating can be achieved at the same time as proper investment in schools, hospitals and infrastructure to achieve Labor's plans for economic growth.


Labor are committed to a budget and a taxation system that link effort and reward in a fair way. We are also committed to taking responsible decisions that improve the sustainability of our public finances, reduce the risk of a credit-rating downgrade and ensure that we can make targeted investments that promote inclusive economic growth. In light of Labor's values and the findings of the inquiry, Labor oppose this bill as is currently stands and call on the government to abandon fiscal recklessness and return to the work of budget repair in a way that is fair, not in a way that means workers will get a pay cut while big businesses and banks get a tax cut.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan) Bill 2016</title>,BILLS,3,1
"Duniam, Sen Jonathon",LP,2017-03-29,"



Senator DUNIAM
 (Tasmania) (11:14):  It is a delight to rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan) Bill 2016.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  I'm glad someone is delighted.




Senator DUNIAM:
  I am excited about what this bill can do for our country, Senator Whish-Wilson, so it is a delight to get up and speak on it. I will come back to Senator Ketter's contribution and the repeated mantra of 'budget repair that is fair', which, to my mind, seems odd when you are talking about spending more money. I am not sure how that repairs one's budget. I would have thought everyone in this place, everyone in this entire building, including the other place, would agree that all Australians want to see a more productive and a more prosperous Australia—a place where there are more jobs for hardworking Australians. The Turnbull government's enterprise tax plan, which we are debating at the moment, is one of the most significant reforms to Australia's business taxation framework in a generation, and I think it paves the way to those elements I just described. 


This country needs a tax system that supports enterprise by backing businesses to invest. Economic activity is generated in the business community, not here in the halls of Parliament House. It also must ensure that Australia continues to be an attractive place to do business—and I note Senator Whish-Wilson's comments in his contribution, which I will cover off a little later on—and that means not just for foreign investment but also for people choosing to invest either here or overseas. It has to be an attractive place to invest their money. We want people to invest in this country, to grow our economy and to create jobs. 


The 10-year program will secure our future and create jobs for hardworking Australians; it will create jobs that these people are crying out for in our regions and in our cities. It will help the 1.8 million Australians looking for extra work to boost their take-home pay, which I would have thought was something that the opposition would support, given the debate in recent days on the matter of penalty rates. When we are talking about ensuring that Australians have a decent take-home pay, those opposite are here talking about a way of preventing businesses from creating jobs. I do not know how the two match up. Improvement in Australia's living standards must be driven by a higher level of labour productivity and participation, which are in part driven by lower company income tax rates. As I have said, those hardworking Australians who want that boost in their take-home pay and who need those additional hours need that pay to cover the increased living costs we have in this country. I am sure many of us have constituents who front up to talk about the increased cost living—not to mention the cost of power, which, in the great state of South Australia, has gone through the roof, like it has in many other parts of the country. Higher health and education spending and a bigger welfare budget will not help hardworking Australians pick up extra work and extra pay to take home to pay those bills. I guess, in response, that goes to the point in Senator Ketter's contribution about budget repair that is fair by spending more on things like infrastructure, health and education, rather than, indeed, looking at how we spend that money and making sure the taxpayer—it is not our money; it is the taxpayer's money—is getting value for money. Rather than using savings to get the budget back into balance and paying huge amounts of money in interest on debts that have been accrued by those opposite, Labor wants Australians to pay more tax so that we can spend more. The real contrast here is the enterprise tax plan that this government, the Turnbull government, has rolled out, which will boost the Australian economy, create the activity we need to ensure that we have a stronger economy. This bill will provide the encouragement for employers, as I have already said, to invest and grow their businesses and provide greater job security, more employment opportunities and higher wages growth. 


The sad thing I have come to realise in the public debate on this issue and the contributions that have been made so far by the opposition is that Labor thinks that Canberra knows how to spend money better than people who run small businesses—the people who want to keep their businesses in the black so that they can keep paying their employees and keep paying their bills, the mortgage on their business or their business loan facility. Labor believe that they know how to create jobs better than business and that it is a better proposition for government to keep the hard-earned taxpayer dollars in our pockets here in Canberra than allowing businesses to do more with the money that they earn. Our plan aims to give businesses the certainty they need to plan and make long-term investments that are vital for growth and boosting our national economy and productivity. Compared to many other countries, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, Australia's corporate tax rate is high. I suppose that goes back to that point that Senator Whish-Wilson made that, indeed, if it is not the highest, it is certainly up there. When people are choosing to invest, that is something they take into account. We cannot ignore that fact. Corporate tax rates that are increasingly uncompetitive will make it harder for this country to attract investment, which is a key driver for labour productivity and growth. 


Fundamentally, a more competitive business tax environment would encourage higher levels of investment in Australia, which is what we need, given the falling levels of private investment as we move from the mining investment boom of the last decade. Again, fundamentally, more economic activity provides more tax income. When businesses are earning more, when people are earning more, they are paying more tax. When they are spending more, they are paying more tax. So, freeing up these dollars, putting them back into the economy, allowing businesses to invest, to spend and to buy new infrastructure and putting it back into the community generates that tax revenue. So I do not actually understand Labor's opposition to this and, indeed, that of many on the crossbenches. So it is vital that we give business every opportunity to invest, to innovate, to grow and to employ more hardworking Australians. 


As part of this plan, as it has been covered off in this debate by a number of speakers previously, and I am sure it will be again, we are going to back small business by reducing their tax rate to 27½ per cent, starting with small businesses with a turnover of less than $10 million, on 1 July this year. That oft used phrase that small businesses are the engine room of the Australian economy is absolutely right. In the small towns of Tasmania, where I am from, these small businesses are the source of employment for people. There are not major factories anymore. There are not the large manufacturing facilities. There are small businesses. And we need to back them. They are the home of Australian enterprise and opportunity. Indeed, they are where many big ideas are born, ideas we try and foster and we want to see more of, so we can create more jobs in our regions. This set of measures is one way of assisting us to do that.


Across the country, small businesses employ over three million people and in 2013-14 added around $340 billion to our economy. We need to reduce the tax burden on small business first and, as many—not companies—will extend the unincorporated small business tax discount from 2016-17, the discount will be available to businesses with annual turnover of less than $5 million, up from the current threshold of $2 million. It will be increased to eight per cent. The maximum discount available will remain at $1,000.


Over the next decade, the discount will be further expanded in phases to a final discount at 16 per cent. This means that every year around 2.3 million businesses will, potentially, have access to the unincorporated tax discount. Further support will be provided for small businesses to expand and create jobs. Access to a number of tax concessions will be provided by increasing the threshold for these concessions to $10 million, up from the current $2 million threshold. These changes will benefit over 90,000 businesses. 


Focusing on contributions of those opposite and the record of the opposition, it is important to reflect on some things that have been said and put on record by them. During the last election, last year, we saw much commentary on the government's tax plan, with Labor cherry picking what they would support and what they would not—which is, again, what they are doing here today—but what we, actually, saw was the Labor Party at odds with what their predecessors had been saying for decades.


There is no denying that the Labor Party cut company tax in the past, and they did it not once but twice. Between 1983 and 1996 the Hawke and Keating governments cut company tax from 49 to 33 per cent. At the time, these measures were sold as an immediate boost to business confidence and an incentive for increased corporate investment in Australia. It is amazing now how, when this government is attempting to do something that will stimulate economic growth and invest and job creation, they rail against it. One has to ask if it is simply political opportunism. To quote Labor's 1993 tax policy:


This measure will provide an immediate fillip to business confidence, as well as permanently increase both the incentive for companies to retain earnings and the relative attractiveness of corporate investment in Australia, with consequential beneficial effects on employment.


Funny, I've heard that before. I think it may have been in relation to our policy. So I wonder why they are now opposing it. It must be noted that this measure was implemented when the budget was in deficit, and had been since 1990-91, and would continue to be for the remainder of former Prime Minister Keating's time in office.


Turning to the Gillard government, they went to the 2010 election promising a cut to company tax from 30 to 29 per cent—again, to encourage investment and job creation across Australia. That is a quote from their policy. Labor's Creating jobs and skills in Australia policy stated:


We will cut the company tax rate to 29 per cent for all Australian companies to stimulate investment across the economy.


…   …   …


A lower company tax rate will increase investment, raise productivity, and increase the real wages of working Australians.


In March 2012 then Treasurer Wayne Swan made their position as clear as could be:


We intend to fight tooth and nail to get this general company tax cut through …


…   …   …


We want a general company tax cut.


But Prime Minister Gillard had to concede that despite how much Labor wanted to deliver the measure they could not, as they could not get the legislation through parliament.


On the current Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party of today, the Leader of the Opposition expressed enthusiasm for company tax cuts when it was Labor's policy. In November 2010, as the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, he told the Australian Services Union National Conference that Labor's plan to cut the company tax rate would 'keep all sectors of our economy competitive in their own global markets'. Again, I do not know why we have deviated from that position across the way, there, in the current debate.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Come on, fire up!




Senator DUNIAM:
  I will, thank you, Senator Whish-Wilson. I have a few points I want to make with reference to your contributions a little later on. 


We should never forget we are just one option for international investors and we have to make sure we offer the most compelling value. That is exactly right. What has changed? The world still has a global market, where people are choosing where they invest their money. Why has that changed, in Labor's opinion? I do not know. Why Senator Whish-Wilson does not believe that is the case, I do not know. Someone who has a stronger background in finance than me, I would think, would have accepted this.


At the same ACOSS conference in March 2011 that Bob Brown addressed, Mr Shorten argued against the Greens' proposal to spend the expected proceeds from the mining tax on a national dental care scheme or an increase to welfare payments rather than a company tax cut. Mr Shorten said: 


What this proposal, as well meaning as it might seem, what it fails to recognise is that we need to encourage employment participation, not greater welfare dependency.


Friends, corporate tax reform helps Australia's private sector grow and it creates jobs right up and down the income ladder.


Then, in August 2011, Mr Shorten told parliament: 


Cutting the company income tax rate increases domestic productivity and domestic investment. More capital means higher productivity and economic growth and leads to more jobs and higher wages.


That was a bit of a snapshot of where Labor have been on this issue over a number of years, and it is a real contrast to where they are today. It just begs the question: is this nothing more than political opportunism, opposition for opposition's sake? Australia deserves better than this.




Senator Dastyari:
  Shame!




Senator DUNIAM:
  It is shameful, absolutely, Senator Dastyari, that it is opposition for opposition's sake.


Going to a couple of the contributions my colleagues have made in the debate so far, I want to reiterate the points I made earlier with regard to Senator Whish-Wilson's contribution. Senator Ketter made the point that it is all about foreign investment. It is about foreign investment, but it is also about Australians being able to choose whether they invest here or abroad. If it is more competitive for an Australian, a business or an individual to invest in a market where it is more competitive then we need to compete against that to attract that investment back to Australian shores. I think there was also a claim, through one of the references that Senator Whish-Wilson read out, that at a time when there was an exceptionally high tax rate there was increased foreign investment. I am not sure whether Senator Whish-Wilson was indicating that we should increase the company tax rate to stimulate foreign investment.



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—




Senator DUNIAM:
  I find it amazing, Senator Whish-Wilson, that you believe increasing the company tax rate would stimulate foreign investment in this country. In fact, I find that unbelievable. Moving off Senator Whish-Wilson's contributions, I want to touch on something that Senator Polley raised at length in this debate, and it is relation to the Australian Maritime College in Tasmania. While it does not directly relate to the bill at hand, I think it is important to respond at least in part to what Senator Polley said. A lot of mistruths and misrepresentations were put onto the Hansard during Senator Polley's contribution. The one correct thing Senator Polley did say was that there is a bipartisan approach on the part of the Tasmanian Labor and Liberal representatives in the federal parliament when it comes to ensuring Tasmania gets its fair share of defence spending. I would be very interested to know why Senator Polley wants to try and conflate issues. What has been announced in Adelaide is a technical college that will train shipbuilders, people who design and build ships. But what we have in Tasmania is a facility that trains seafarers. These are two quite different propositions. This commitment demonstrates that the Tasmanian AMC is part of the broad jigsaw; we have a strength, and it is part of the broader framework of defence training and capability in Australia. It is disappointing that Senator Polley has misrepresented what has actually been announced, has tried to conflate issues and has then gone on with the character assassination of the former member for Bass.


I want to briefly touch on Senator Ketter's contribution as well. He made the point that the economy is slowing down and the government needs to act. I go back to the point that I have made on a number of occasions now: to stimulate the economy you need to look at things like tax reform and cuts to tax rates to encourage investment, to encourage spending and to create more jobs. That is how you stimulate the economy. You do not stimulate the economy by investing more in government spending as Senator Ketter said. That is not stimulating the economy. It is not sustainable to just rack up more debt, tax people more and drive down the strength of the private sector in this country. To stimulate the economy, which is where Senator Ketter was going with his contribution, you need to create an environment where the private sector can thrive and create the jobs we need. I would be interested to know how many of those who have made a contribution so far, including Senator Polley and Senator Ketter, have owned and operated a small business and been responsible for the payment of salaries.



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—





Senator DUNIAM:
  I acknowledge that Senator Whish-Wilson has been, and may still be, an employer—I am not sure. But that is right: you have to have an understanding of how business operates. When you have never been responsible for the payment of people's wages and ensuring businesses are paying bills so that the jobs can continue and the business remains afloat it is ridiculous to come in here and tell us that tax cuts are a bad thing. I call on the opposition and those on the crossbench who are not supporting the bill to jump on board and support this good legislation. This is once-in-a generation reform that will actually go a long way to drive our economy, create jobs and create the investment that we need, particularly in regional Australia. Thank you very much for the opportunity to contribute to this debate.

Senator GALLAGHER
 (Australian Capital Territory—Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate) (09:38):  I rise to make a contribution to the debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan) Bill 2016. Let us be clear: this is an incredibly consequential piece of legislation that we have before us. That is because what we are considering in the chamber today is, by the government's own admission, the centrepiece of their entire economic agenda. So it is worth asking: what is the agenda the government is seeking to implement with this bill? Well, while it has been cynically and misleadingly marketed to the Australian people by the Prime Minister and Treasurer as a tax cut for small business, in reality all that this government has to offer by way of an economic agenda is an enormous unfunded tax cut for foreign multinationals and the big banks. 


What a massive wasted opportunity this bill is for the government and, more importantly, for our country. That is because the opportunity cost of pursuing this so-called plan is that the Turnbull government is failing to actually address the very real economic challenges we must confront. It has been 10 months since the government proposed these tax cuts in the 2016 budget, yet they have only now just brought this legislation to the Senate for debate. This is typical for what passes for economic leadership from the Abbott-Turnbull government. They have presided over a total vacuum in economic leadership at the national level. They have embraced inertia over action and preferred slogans to substance. At a time when we as a nation are faced with economic challenges that demand our urgent attention, this government has been missing in action on all counts. Whether it is rising inequality, stagnant wage growth, worsening housing affordability, climate change, unemployment and underemployment, technological disruption and automation, the negative distortions in our tax system or the need to transition to a model of growth that is not driven by mining investment, there is simply no coherent plan or strategy from this government. 


I think it pays to place some of the challenges we are facing into historical perspective. Australian workers are currently experiencing the lowest wage growth in 30 years. Our rates of home ownership have plummeted to a 60-year low and inequality is at a staggering 75-year high. Another way to appreciate the challenge we are facing is to acknowledge that in the past generation the top one per cent of income earners have doubled their share of income, while at the other end of the spectrum one in eight Australians now say they cannot afford dental care. Yet, rather than advocating an economic plan that seeks to address these clearly pressing issues, the Turnbull government has made a perverse choice: to prioritise multinationals over Australian families and, in the process, recklessly narrow the revenue base of our tax system. This government's idea of tackling debt and deficit is to blow a $50 billion hole in the budget for a purported benefit in the future that could be mistaken for a rounding error. 


What does this mean in the real world for working and middle class Australians? Without sufficient revenue, we will be unable to provide services that communities right across Australia rely upon, nor will we be able to invest in our human and physical capital to ensure that most Australian of aspirations: a fair society with decent living standards for all. Make no mistake: in attempting to pass this bill, the Turnbull government is in essence proposing a $50 billion giveaway on the backs of ordinary taxpayers to big multinational businesses and their shareholders offshore. This is not only fiscally irresponsible on a grand scale; it is morally reprehensible as well. It is truly astonishing that a government whose members like to stand at the dispatch box of this parliament and lecture us on the intergenerational inequity of debt now seems blindly intent on adding $50 billion to it while ignoring the budget deficit. That is a deficit that the most recent MYEFO revealed to be $36.5 billion, delivered by a government that has managed to increase net government debt from $184 billion to $317 billion in less than four years. 


How can the government seriously claim to be addressing the budget deficit and government debt when this is their signature economic proposal? As Labor's shadow Treasurer, Chris Bowen, has made clear, Labor will not be party to this discredited Laffer curve, Reaganomics-style approach to deficit reduction. Make no mistake: that is the course the government, through this bill, seeks to embark us upon, based on magic pudding economics—that you can endlessly cut tax rates and still miraculously return to surplus. This approach is now widely acknowledged by academics and leading economic institutions as widening inequality and dampening precisely the kind of sustainable and inclusive economic growth needed to generate new high-skill, high-wage jobs that can deliver improved living standards. 


If this bill were to pass, it would fail dismally in its stated aim to deliver economic growth of any note, for reasons I will turn to a greater depth later. It would undoubtedly damage the fiscal position of the Commonwealth and jeopardise our AAA credit rating. Most critically—and the issue that motivates us on this side of the chamber—it will rob working and middle class Australians of desperately needed investment in skills, education, health care and infrastructure. These are the real drivers of long-term and inclusive economic growth. It is a sad indictment of this government that, more than three years since it was first elected, and on the eve of its fourth budget, it still has no credible plan to deliver economic prosperity for the Australian people. 


Looking back over its more than three years in office, this coalition government's economic record can regrettably be characterised by its misguided austerity for the most vulnerable in our community while sparing the big end of town. Boiling it down to its essential logic, or rather illogic, according to this government, providing a vulnerable young jobseeker with Newstart in their hour of need is unaffordable. It is symptomatic of unsustainable largesse that they described as a budget crisis. Yet, on the other hand, handing over billions upon billions of dollars in tax cuts to the largest companies operating in the country is not only affordable but their most pressing economic priority. 


Regrettably, that is what happens when you have a Prime Minister who is beholden to the hard right wing of his own party, and there appears to be little hope that a real economic reform agenda will spring forth from this government during this term of parliament. It is far more likely it will continue to be sidetracked, with the Prime Minister pandering to the whims of a mutinous backbench that's laughably out of touch with mainstream concerns. We saw examples of that just this week—a Prime Minister and a government focused on watering down hate speech laws, but with no time to defend the take-home pay of some of the lowest-paid workers in Australia who rely on penalty rates.


This bill was the government's economic rationale for re­election. That was confirmed last year by the finance minister in Senate estimates when he described it as the centrepiece of their economic agenda. But it is lazy policy, it's unimaginative, and ultimately exposes the government for its lack of vision.


Turning to the specifics of the proposal, this bill will be ineffective when measured against what the government claims it will achieve—jobs and growth. In fact, the key beneficiary, should this bill pass, would not be the Australian community but rather foreign shareholders of firms that operate in Australia.


It is worth taking some time to canvass the contemporary evidence on the connection between corporate taxes and economic growth. Despite being the perennial demand of certain industry groups and right-wing think tanks, is there really evidence to support the notion that cutting the corporate tax rate is the economic panacea they claim it to be? 


Some of the most recent analysis from a very broad range of institutions, which include the Treasury, the Grattan Institute, the Australia Institute, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have all seriously called into question the efficacy of corporate tax cuts when not coupled with other economic reform as an instrument to drive growth. Some of those same groups have raised further and compelling doubts about their usefulness, especially when considered in the Australian context, taking into account our current debt profile and the particular features of our tax system. In particular, they note that, given our unique system of dividend imputation and the fact we are competing with low- and no-tax jurisdictions, any supposed benefit tax cuts would deliver would be negligible at best.


Treasury's own modelling exposes the underwhelming case for the government's plan. In its analysis of the most recent budget entitled 'Economy­wide modelling for the 2016-17 Budget,' the Treasury has estimated the impact of the government's corporate tax giveaway on Australia's projected economic growth. The key take-out from this modelling is that over 20 years the proposed cut in company tax from 30 per cent to 25 percent for all businesses would increase GDP by only 1.2 per cent. 


I really think that deserves to be repeated: over 20 years—that is, six terms of the federal parliament—Treasury expects this bill will only boost our GDP by 1.2 per cent. And that is the headline growth rate. When you drill down into that figure, it reveals just how lacklustre that result is when you consider what it means for Australian households. As my colleague Andrew Leigh succinctly put it: 'Treasury's most likely scenario is that a company tax cut delivers an extra month of household income growth—in the 2030s.'


And we should not be surprised.


Recent analyses of Australia's growth performance with comparable nations that have lower corporate tax rates find little evidence to buttress the claims that economic growth is inevitably higher in countries that impose lower rates of corporate tax. And, fundamentally, this government's plan for dishing out tax cuts for big business rests on the notion that our current    corporate tax rate—currently 30 per cent for the largest businesses—is uncompetitive and impairs economic performance.


But even a cursory analysis proves we are very much in line with other developed countries, especially as Michael Pascoe notes in his excellent piece in the Fairfax papers entitled 'An inconvenient truth gets in the way of the company tax cut chants', when we weight that tax rate for the extra security, stability and opportunities Australia  offers investors.


The largest economy in the world, the United States, has a headline corporate tax rate of about 35 per cent. The economic powerhouse of Europe, Germany, has a rate of 29.65 per cent. Looking to our region and one of our largest trading partners, Japan, the fourth largest economy in the world, has a tax rate of 30.86 per cent. In fact, if you look at the world's 10 largest economies, the corporate tax rate currently averages around 29 per cent. It is simply a fallacy to say that having a tax rate above 25 per cent prohibits strong economic performance. But headline tax rates are just one element and looking at them in isolation is folly. I have no doubt, however, that you will hear plenty of facile repetition of headline tax rates without proper context from those opposite in their contributions to this debate.


That missing context is the impact of features of our tax system such as dividend imputation. The Grattan Institute's submission to the Senate Economics Committee's inquiry into this bill provides further compelling evidence that dramatically diminishes the case for big company tax cuts. Grattan's submission states:


Australia's unusual dividend imputation system means that domestic investors are largely unaffected by the company tax rate since any profits paid to them are taxed at their personal income tax rate.


Yet because foreign investors, by contrast, do not benefit from dividend imputation, a cut to the company tax rate provides bigger benefits to them.


For those foreign firms who have already made long-term investments in Australia, a reduction in the tax rate would simply be a windfall. Yet this marginal reduction in headline rate does not meaningfully incentivise new investment.


Treasury also acknowledges the substantial costs of the measure in the short term could see company tax cuts drag on national incomes for the next ten years. Even the most sympathetic analysis from the Treasury shows that any net benefit to Australians' incomes will be much smaller once profits flowing out of Australia are taken into account.


As the Grattan Institute also pointed out in its submission, it is a mistake to assume that any increase in economic activity will necessarily go toward making Australians better off. As the benefits of this bill will pass disproportionately to nonresidents, using the GDP as the principal measure of its success is flawed. Gross national income is a better yardstick to use when assessing this bill as it more accurately reflects whether the incomes of everyday Australians might rise. Treasury estimates that a reduction in the company tax rate to 25 per cent would only increase Australia's GNI by 0.6 per cent over 20 years.


The government's claim that these tax cuts will deliver jobs and wages growth simply does not stack up to real-world scrutiny. Let's be clear: a race to the bottom on corporate taxes would be futile for Australia to engage in. The OECD has recognised that profit shifting by large multinational companies to tax havens is widespread and has sought to combat it through the base erosion and profit shifting policy. As noted by the ACTU in its submission to the Senate inquiry into this bill, this is an acknowledgement of the fact that in many cases Australia is already competing against countries with low or negligible company tax rates. Any relatively minor reduction in our corporate tax will struggle to attract significant additional investment, when you consider we are competing against cynically designed tax havens that will always be more attractive. 


Put simply, this bill will not meaningfully grow the economy. It will not deliver meaningful wage growth; it will not improve our capacity to fund services, nor will it genuinely improve our competitiveness internationally. It simply does not stack up as an economic plan. It is just as important to consider the economic benefits of large cuts to the company tax rate against their budgetary and social costs, and that is what Labor has done. We recognise that the countries around the world that have a record of strong and inclusive economic growth do share something in common, and it is not a rock-bottom tax rate. It is that they build the necessary infrastructure to allow their people and firms to be more productive and compete in the global marketplace. They invest in research and development, which lead to innovative new products and businesses. They understand the value of funding an education system that will provide world-class skills through higher education and vocational training. In our current budgetary circumstance, this bill would severely curtail our ability to do all of those things. This tax cut is something that we simply cannot afford.


Labor is committed to a budget and a taxation system that link effort and reward in a fair way—especially for those who are trying to make a go for themselves in small businesses—while also taking responsible decisions that go to the sustainability of our public finances, so that we can make targeted investments that promote inclusive growth. That is what we took to the last election. We took measured and sensible reforms to negative gearing and capital gains tax that would improve the budget bottom line and help combat intergenerational inequity. We coupled a reduction in company taxation, which supports genuine small businesses, with responsible commitments to fund investments in health, infrastructure, education and research.


A Labor amendment to the bill    has been circulated in my name to give effect to our election commitments. Our amendments match our values. They defend our public finances and would deliver targeted tax relief to genuinely small businesses. They would do so by reducing the company tax rate to 27.5 per cent for businesses with a turnover of less than $2 million, the threshold that remains consistent with the ATO definition of a small business; increasing the unincorporated small business tax discount from five per cent to eight per cent for businesses with a turnover of less than $2 million; and by not proceeding with the increase to the small business entity threshold. Our considered amendments would help 96 per cent of all Australian small businesses—that is, defined as having less than a $2 million turnover. Costed by the PBO, they would save $4.4 billion over the forward estimates and $50 billion over the medium term compared to the government's reckless policy. Under Labor's policy around 811,000 companies and 2.19 million unincorporated businesses would benefit. That is more than three million businesses in total.


In conclusion, I simply ask that the government apply its previously stated rationale for abandoning tax reform in the last term. It may seem like an awfully long time ago, especially for the Prime Minister, but it is worth casting our minds back to those heady days of the early Turnbull government. At that time, and after many public thought bubbles on the subject, the Turnbull government decided to abandon the GST increase it had been prosecuting, stating on the public record that the modelling showed little to any economic benefit. Well, this legislation fails against the very same standard. We need tax and expenditure reform that is aimed at boosting income growth and increased worker participation, coupled with stronger investments in our educational, environmental and physical capital. This was the clarion call of the Henry Tax Review, because, as it noted, this balanced approach is what is needed to ensure a future that is fiscally and environmentally sustainable while honouring the commitment to Australian values of fairness and support for those who are disadvantaged. That is Labor's focus, and it should be the government's focus too. This bill does none of those things, and in its current form it is not worthy of the support of the parliament.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Whish-Wilson, Sen Peter",AG,2017-03-29,"



Senator WHISH-WILSON
 (Tasmania) (09:57):  The Greens will not be supporting any tax cuts today, and I would like to spend the next 20 minutes to explain why. Firstly, we are very proud that we took a policy for small business to the 2013election, including a tax cut and a whole range of measures designed to help small business get ahead. We worked constructively with the government following the 2013 election, and we played a critical role in getting that small business package delivered and passed into legislation.


There are two key arguments the government use for supporting their Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan) Bill 2016. The first is that somehow this is going to deliver jobs and growth. Let's be very clear about this: this is the central, capstone policy of this 46th parliament for this Liberal-National government. This is the capstone policy to deliver us a future in this country over the next 10 years, and it relies on voodoo economics. It relies on the concept that, somehow, if we give companies more profits then those profits will trickle down into the economy, delivering wealth and jobs. This is based on the Laffer curve of the 1970s, a theory that has been thoroughly debunked; there is no empirical evidence whatsoever to support it—and I will discuss that more in a minute. The second reason the government use to support tax cuts for businesses, including big businesses, is that somehow we will suffer from a lack of foreign investment if we do not cut our tax rates. 


I want deal with comments made by the head of the International Monetary Fund, Christine Lagarde, at Davos in January this year. She made a very interesting statement in light of what we are considering here today in the Australian parliament. Her statement also applies to foreign jurisdictions such as the US economy. She was asked a question about what she saw as being the black swan events for 2017 in the international economy. For those who are not aware, black swan events relate to generally unforeseen but high-risk events that can rock financial markets and economies. Christine Lagarde is possibly one of the most influential and important leaders in international economics and she had this to say: 


If the disruptions we are expecting for 2017 as a result of what has happened in 2016 prove to be all negative and we are to end up in a race to the bottom on the tax front, on the trade front and on the financial regulation front, then that for me would be a really big black swan that would have devastating effects for countries other than those that are likely to cause it. 


To repeat that: in direct reference to corporate tax cuts that Donald Trump, the US President, had been talking about, the head of the IMF, at the beginning of the year at the premier international conference, said that major cuts to taxes could have devastating effects—a 'race to the bottom'—on the global economy. 


So much for tax cuts having a positive effect on the economy, which no doubt speaker after speaker across the chamber in the Liberal-National Party are going to come in here and tell us. This is the head of the IMF saying to us that 'a race to the bottom'—and nobody wins in a race to the bottom—is going to be a significant economic risk to the global economy this year. This is a race that our Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, is about to fire the starting gun on today. Here we are in the Senate, lining up to get ready for that race—a race to the bottom. 


Interestingly, it is not just Christine Lagarde, the head of the IMF, who has been making comments. When I thought about the corporate tax cuts myself, I reflected on my experience working in finance. I spent 10 years at the University of Tasmania teaching international finance to MBA students and to undergraduates. I have a pretty good idea of how businesses make decisions, especially around direct foreign investment, and I was aware that tax was only one of many factors in consideration by corporations when they look at foreign investment. 


Let's have a look at whether a high tax rate in this country relative to other countries has affected our foreign investment. There is a very interesting report put out by the The Australia Institute that says that cutting company tax will not drive investment, and it outlined an analysis that finds that 97 per cent of applications to Australia's Foreign Investment Review Board come from countries already with lower tax rates than Australia and that by value 71 per cent of applications come from countries with lower rates. 


All this raises the question: if Australia is already successful at attracting foreign investment, why would we give tax cuts to foreigners? It goes on to say that history shows that, when Australia's tax rates were adjusted in the past, foreign investment did not go the way we expected. When the rate climbed to 49 per cent in the 1980s, there was a rise, not a drop, in foreign investment. I encourage all senators to read that report—I will actually quote it again in a minute. It has some very interesting empirical evidence and analysis. 


But let's get back to what corporations think about a tax cut. Canada's largest pension fund, with $300 billion under investment, called the Canadian Pension Plan Investment Board, was asked this question in Australia last month. I put this question to Senator Cormann in estimates and to Mr John Fraser, the head of Treasury, as I did Christine Lagarde's comments which they batted off. They said they disagreed with the head of the IMF that a 'race to the bottom' in corporate tax cuts was a risk to the global economy. I asked them about the comments by the Canadian pension fund that stated:


As investors we frankly value the cash flows. What matters to us is predictability—it is not so much the level of tax paid. We look at the predictability of the system and we think Australia rates quite highly on that measure.


From a tax perspective, as long as we know going in what we are buying we are happy. We think Australia will maintain its competitiveness and the tax rate will not affect that. 


This is one of the biggest foreign investors in our country, especially in the area of infrastructure, batting away and rejecting commentary that Australia may lose its international competitiveness if we do not cut corporate tax rates and join in this race to the bottom with the US President, Donald Trump, and with Britain. 


When I put that question to Mr Fraser in estimates he did not agree with the Canadian pension fund, but he has had experience working with them in the past. But he has previously said that he does not necessarily believe that big businesses, which are going to get the bulk of the benefit of corporate tax cuts—have no doubt about that—necessarily put much emphasis on them either. He said, 'If anything, it is a second- or third- or fourth-rate consideration for them.' He did say—in all fairness—that a cutting of the corporate tax rate would be a good thing for small and medium business but for big business it was not necessarily the case. So he has made his views clear. I find it quite interesting that even the head of Treasury has previously been on record as saying that he does not believe that corporate tax cuts will necessarily impact foreign investment, especially for big businesses. 


David Gonski, another leader in the business community in Australia, has also said that tax cuts are not the best solution. He was quoted recently, in the last month, in the Australian media in relation to this debate declaring that cutting the corporate tax rate would make little difference to large Australian companies. This is putting him at loggerheads, interestingly, with the Business Council of Australia. He argued that other measures such as accelerated depreciation rates would make a much bigger difference to companies than cutting the corporate tax rate. He said, 'To take one part of the tax system and dwell on it is really not the way to do it.' This is one of the most respected businessmen in this country, who we are all very familiar with based on his work around the Gonski education reforms. 


Why are the Business Council of Australia, who represent the big end of town, so keen on seeing a cut to company tax? As you would probably guess, they stand to benefit from it the most, with billions of dollars in extra profits that will flow to their members. But what is really interesting when you look at the Business Council of Australia, who have been the key lobbyists for cutting the corporate tax rate from 30 to 25 per cent, in particular suggesting that it will affect foreign investment in this country if we do not, is that transparency reports that have now been lodged with the ATO show that the Business Council's members paid an effective tax rate in 2014-15 of just 24.3 per cent. An effective tax rate incorporates deductions against tax, which are perfectly legal and allowable deductions, by the way, but their effective tax rate—the real tax they pay—is already below the 25 per cent that they want us, in this Senate chamber, to cut the corporate tax rate to, which means that their effective tax rate, if we cut the headline rate to 25 per cent, will be around 20 per cent or less. So, if we look at this debate just on the headline rate, not think about the deductions and take a holistic approach to the issue, we see that it is also voodoo economics. May I say that we have heard different measures of what the Business Council of Australia's members pay, but, when it comes to multinational corporations themselves, a report last year found that 76 of Australia's largest multinationals pay an effective tax rate of just 16.2 per cent. That report was released by the Tax Justice Network. We have also seen reports by tax experts from the University of Technology Sydney, who have provided data for the top 100 companies, and they find that there are very low effective tax rates in this country.


It has not escaped my attention that recently there has also been work done by the Grattan Institute, who are often quoted in this place and the other place across the corridor because of the great work they do—and, by the way, the Greens do not always agree with what they put out, as you can imagine. Nevertheless, on this issue they went to great lengths to point out that a cut to corporate tax rates will benefit foreign investors more than domestic investors. Because the profits will be taken offshore, the impacts on the economy, especially in the first eight to nine years, of a cut in the company tax rate to 25 per cent will be very limited. There has also been a lot of criticism of the modelling that was used by the Treasury group that was commissioned to do the modelling. I do not have time to go into it today, but there is an enormous body of international work that thoroughly debunks the myth that, somehow, if we give corporations more profits, that will benefit us. In my observations and view of the world, it seems that it is trickle-up that has worked.


It would be a fascinating exercise to go to these corporations, who essentially we will be giving over $50 billion of taxpayer money to via these tax cuts, and ask them what kind of social contract we could put in place to guarantee that they will reinvest all that taxpayer money—and it is taxpayer money, because that is what we are currently collecting. In this social contract, will they invest that in jobs? Will they invest that in better conditions and pay for workers? Will they invest that in Australian communities? That is what our job is in government. It is to raise revenue and to invest that in our community across education, health care, national security or whatever it happens to be—that is our job, and that is the key cost. The modelling around the benefits in this trickle-down economics, this voodoo economics, of corporate tax cuts has been disputed and is very sparse on detail, but we do know what the costs are of these corporate tax cuts. They mean tens of billions of dollars in revenue forgone that could be better spent in other parts of the economy. I also recommend that senators examine the report by the Australia Institute on this, which actually goes into the detail of those opportunity costs.


So what could we do? If we do actually want to stimulate jobs in our economy and invest in the long-term future of our communities, what could we do as senators and in government? We have a lot of options ahead of us apart from cutting corporate tax rates and giving some of the biggest, wealthiest corporations in the world extra money in their pockets, taken directly out of our pockets. What else could we do? Just about every economist and every commentator in this country is talking about the need for the government now to significantly invest in long-term productive infrastructure in Australia. I chaired a select committee that went for nearly nine months that looked at this issue extensively. At every estimates I ask the Treasury secretary and others about why we are not doing more to invest in productive infrastructure. Right around this country, we have hundreds of billions, if not trillions, of dollars in underinvestment in our future. At record low interest rates, we have an opportunity to spend on capital. I am not referring to recurrent expenditure—I agree that carries significant risks—but why aren't we doing more now to invest in our future? The head of the Reserve Bank makes this point in every single public speech. I have heard evidence from Saul Eslake, John Hewson and so many economists that now is the time. I do not believe that at the moment we have the right structure around infrastructure spending in place through Infrastructure Australia. We need more transparency. We need proper cost-benefit analysis done. When need to depoliticise the process and reduce the risk so that we can actually get private investors involved in this issue.


The Greens took a policy to the last election—I know Labor had a slightly similar one—around a government owned infrastructure bank that would totally restructure Infrastructure Australia, make this investment process arm's length and look at how we can get the private sector to co-invest in infrastructure. I am not just talking about roads and public transport. I went around the country, including to smaller towns like Townsville, Wagga Wagga and other places, and heard about their infrastructure needs.


There are so many projects waiting for funding that would benefit communities and benefit productivity. Some of them can be monetised and some of them can even be securitised. Local government in my home state of Tasmania is crying out for just $2 billion to invest in 30-year sewerage infrastructure, because our infrastructure dates back, in some places, over 100 years. But it does not have the money, because the federal government is not making a pool of cheap finance available for long-term investment. If coalition senators actually want to stimulate jobs and growth, and they are serious about it, I ask them to consider why they are underinvesting in infrastructure in this country.


We can invest not only in jobs. We can invest in communities. We can invest in the environment. We can do a much better job by getting on and immediately stimulating our economy. We believe the government should play a very crucial leadership role on this issue. We are going down the wrong road in cutting corporate taxes. There is so much more that we could be doing. There is no evidence at all that corporate tax cuts work. This is the government's cheerleaders, the Business Council of Australia—no doubt many of those companies are donors to the Liberal-National Party.


We do not believe that this is the right way to go. Just to reiterate: the Greens will not be supporting any tax cuts today. We believe this is a race to the bottom that we do not want to be a part of. Nobody wins in a race to the bottom on corporate tax cuts.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Watt, Sen Murray",ALP,2017-03-29,"



Senator WATT
 (Queensland) (10:16):  I do not intend to make a long contribution on this bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan) Bill 2016. I know we have a large amount of legislation to get through over the course of this week, but I want to put my position on the record over the course of this debate. Put simply, my position, not surprisingly, is that of the Labor Party's, which is that we support a company tax cut for small businesses with a turnover of up to $2 million per annum. We see absolutely no justification whatsoever for a company tax cut for larger businesses, particularly at this time and particularly with the Australian and world economies as they currently stand.


Really, this bill is just another example of how this government has the wrong priorities for dealing with the challenges that our country faces. Day after day we deal with bills put up by this government that seeks to make cuts to government expenditure and wages and conditions that the poorest in our community and low- and middle-income earners in our community depend upon. Even just in the last couple of weeks we have seen cuts made to family tax benefits, which only go to low- and middle-income families, and, increasingly, are targeted on the very low income earners within our community. We have seen cuts made to payments to single parents. We are still seeing the effects of cuts this government is making to public health funding and to public school funding. It has failed to invest in public transport infrastructure. The government is targeting and making cuts to anything that the average wage earner in Australia depends upon to get ahead in life. We know that the government supports penalty rate cuts as well.


If you are a low- or middle-income earner, if you are an average person in the Australian community, this government constantly comes after you through cuts to government expenditure. The justification that is always provided by the government is that we need to rein in the deficit, which—has it doubled or tripled under their watch?—has certainly increased substantially. But, at the very same time, the same government is willing to provide massive handouts to big business, whether it be in the form of subsidies or through this bill, through reductions in company tax.


The government failed to take any action in relation to the excessive concessions that are available to people through negative gearing, when they are seeking to negatively gear their third, fourth, fifth, 20th, 30th or 40th investment property. It seeks to give big company tax cuts, but, at the same time, it turns around and tell us that it cannot afford to provide government funding to provide decent health care, decent public schooling and decent income support to Australians who need it most.


As well as demonstrating that the government has the wrong priorities, this bill is an example of the government's driving a divide within the Australian community rather than taking action to bring us together. I spoke yesterday about the government's amendments to section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, which are going to open the door to more racist speech in our community and thereby facilitate greater division within our community. That is now being done on the economic front by this government as it seeks to provide a big company tax cut of $50 billion over 10 years to big businesses. This will only see the level of inequality in our community increase, where the rich get ahead and the poor are left behind, especially when this government is cutting a range of benefits as well.


Labor is very happy to support a company tax cut for smaller businesses—those with a turnover of up to $2 million a year. We understand that many of them are struggling at the moment, and a company tax cut to those smaller businesses will assist them to stay afloat and, in some instances, may generate some employment. But Labor does not see any justification at all for a company tax cut for the big end of town.


Australia is already one of the lowest taxed countries in the OECD. We are not a highly taxed country, despite the claims that are made to the contrary. We have a large and growing deficit, and yet this government wants to reduce the amount of revenue that it is collecting each year via a company tax cut. We are constantly told by the government that delivering this kind of company tax cut will generate jobs, will generate growth and will generate revenue for the government. It is classic 1980s Reaganomics. Anyone who has looked back on what occurred under President Reagan when he delivered these kinds of company tax cuts will know that the US government deficit ballooned and that there was no obvious economic pay-off to the United States in return for that ballooning deficit, which was largely generated by the excessive tax cuts provided by President Reagan. I fear that what is going to occur in Australia if the government gets this bill through. All it will do is increase the deficit further and increase inequality without any economic pay-off whatsoever.


The other thing worth pointing out about this bill is that it will not benefit regional Australia one little bit. There are not very many businesses in regional Queensland or regional Australia with an annual turnover in the tens of millions of dollars, so there is nothing that will benefit regional Australia by providing tax cuts to large businesses like that. Yet again, it will be another instance where regional Australia is left behind and the already large levels of inequality that we see in regional Australia will only be exacerbated by this bill.


If the argument is that other countries are cutting their company tax rates and therefore we should do the same, to me that is not a satisfactory argument. Just because someone is jumping over a bridge does not mean we have to do the same thing. In fact, what we should be doing is stepping up our efforts towards international harmonisation of tax rates and closing some of the tax evasion that is occurring by companies that are chasing the lowest company tax rate all around the world. Every country in the world has an interest in bringing in sufficient tax revenue, and if we continually chase each other by reducing company tax rates and income tax rates for high income earners then we will be left in a situation where not one country in the world has the revenue that is required to deliver the social services that their populations rightly expect.


In summary, with the Australian economy the way it is at the moment and the budget deficit the way it is at the moment, this is absolutely the wrong time to be cutting big business tax rates. It is the wrong time to do the wrong thing. This bill, if it gets through, will increase the level of inequality in our community. It will drive up the deficit and there will be no economic pay-off whatsoever. That is why I and the rest of the Labor Party will be voting against the company tax cuts for any businesses with a turnover above $2 million a year.

"Paterson, Sen James",LP,2017-03-29,"



Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (10:24):  Mr Acting Deputy President Whish-Wilson, I was lucky enough to make it into the chamber for the tail end of your contribution to this debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan) Bill 2016. While I certainly will not respond to everything you said in your speech, it would be remiss of me not to take the opportunity to address your comments about trickle-down economics. This is a personal bugbear of mine, I admit, but trickle-down economics is something that exists only in the minds of those who are opposed to it. There was actually a study done on this in recent years—I do not have it to hand, unfortunately—and there is no evidence throughout economic history that any advocate of supply-side economics, which is a better description of what I think you are referring to, has ever used the phrase 'trickle-down economics' in a persuasive way, in a way that they believe in when arguing for it. It is like neoliberalism: you will hear about neoliberalism a lot in universities and amongst the minds of those who are opposed to neoliberalism, but no-one in the history of economic thought has described themselves as a neoliberal. Anyway, that is not the substantive issue that we are here to debate today.


Let me also respond to Senator Watt's comments about Reaganomics. Unfortunately, he has got his history a little bit wrong, as is often the case in this area. The tax cuts that Ronald Regan presided over as President were primarily to personal income tax cuts, although there also were company tax cuts under his presidency. They were very substantial cuts to the rates of personal income tax in America, but to say that that caused the deficit in America under his presidency is curious on a number of grounds. One of those, and most importantly, is that the revenue collected from individuals after the tax rates were cut in fact increased rather than decreased. This is something that has been seen throughout economic history, but particularly throughout American history. It was the case under President JFK, as it was the case under President Reagan: cuts to individual tax rates in fact resulted in increased levels of revenue for the government, not decreased levels of revenue.


With those two historical side points aside, I now want to address the substance of the debate here today. I am very proud to be here to speak in favour of the government's Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan) Bill 2016, because I believe it will make Australia more competitive and more prosperous. It will encourage more investment, and, ultimately, that will lead to higher wages and better jobs for Australians. I am very proud to be here to support this policy today.


You need not take my word for it.




Senator Dastyari:
  We won't!




Senator PATERSON:
  I realise that Senator Dastyari and others may be sceptical about my views on this issue, and so I will not rely alone on my views on the facts and evidence that I will take you through here this morning. I will rely on the views of those that I know that Senator Dastyari respects greatly—that is, the views of his own Labor colleagues, who helpfully have been on the record extensively on this issue in recent years and who, I think, have made some very sensible observations. There was the comment made by the then Assistant  Treasurer, Bill Shorten, who is now our opposition leader. He said in 2011:


Cutting the company income tax rate increases domestic productivity and domestic investment. More capital means higher productivity and economic growth and leads to more jobs and higher wages.


I could not have put it better myself. Chris Bowen, in his 2013 book Hearts and Minds, said:


It's a Labor thing to have the ambition of reducing company tax, because it promotes investment, creates jobs and drives growth.


Hear, hear, Chris Bowen; absolutely spot on. Bill Shorten also said in 2011, again as Assistant Treasurer:


Any student of Australian business and economic history since the mid-80s knows that part of Australia's success was derived through the reduction in the company tax rate.


We need to be able to make life easier for Australian business, which employs two in every three Australians.


Hear, hear; I could not agree more.


Senator Watt said before that reducing our company tax rates because other countries have done so to ensure that we remain internationally competitive is like following someone who has jumped off a bridge. That was a particularly graphic metaphor that I encourage him, when he has an opportunity, to discuss with Bill Shorten, his leader, because it in fact repudiates Bill Shorten's previous view on this issue. Again as Assistant Treasurer, in 2011, he said:


The Government's tax reform agenda has a strong focus on ensuring that Australia remains an attractive place to invest.


…   …   …


Cutting the company tax rate is an important step along this road.


This recognises the benefits to investment and growth from lower company tax rates and a trend to lower rates across the OECD over the past 30 years.


Senator Watt here today is repudiating the very words and arguments made by his own leader not more than six years ago.


Chris Bowen, again in his book, in 2013, in the chapter 'Promoting growth through cutting company tax'—what a great title for a chapter on economic reform; I could not have written it better myself, Senator Dastyari—said:


… Keating knew that the corporate tax rate needed to be cut to make Australia competitive, that capital and investment would flow to tax-competitive nations and that this was an important job-creation move. Today capital is even more mobile than it was then and it is important that our corporate tax rate is more competitive.


I did not know that—in Senator Watt's words—Mr Bowen was an enthusiast for jumping off a bridge to follow others, but it seems that he is. I encourage Senator Watt to take that up with his now shadow Treasurer.


Of course the shadow Treasurer also said on Lateline in December 2014:


I'd like to see it—


'it' being the company tax rate—


lower over time. I think we've had 14 years of having the corporate tax rate stable. That's too long. Over time, I'd like to see it lowered.


Indeed. He went on to say:


As the alternative Treasurer, I'm telling you that … it would be a better thing if Australia's corporate tax rate was more competitive …


That is very hard to argue with. In 2013, he said:


I think we should have the ambition of lowering company tax. … it would be the approach that we would take that our ambition would be lower company tax rates over time because it does improve our international competitiveness.


Again, I think that is very eloquently responding to Senator Watt's arguments before.


I was very touched to hear Senator Watt's concern about the federal government deficit and the debt that has been accrued and continues to accrue under the federal government. I share his concern, and I am very pleased to see him speaking about it here, but I think that unfortunately, in this instance, he is being a little bit disingenuous, on a couple of grounds. First of all, as we know, the Labor Party's record in government in this area is not one to boast about. They inherited a very good set of books, and they left them in a parlous state. There is no need to go over the ancient history of details of that, but I think their record in this department is abundantly clear. Also abundantly clear are the extraordinary lengths they have gone to to attempt to prevent this government from fixing the mess that they created and to attempt to prevent this government from paying for the things that they spent on when they were in government.


But particularly disingenuous by Senator Watt was the fact that he believes that these company tax cuts are going to expand the deficit and expand the debt. It is disingenuous because, as Senator Watt I am sure would know, the Labor Party during the election campaign spent not just every single dollar that would be spent in this company tax cut plan but $16½ billion extra. So Senator Watt's concern about the deficit I think would be more fairly and better focused on his own party's policies. Even if the company tax cuts did not proceed, it would be worsened by at least $16½ billion, just taking their election policy into account and not even taking into account what they have proposed since.


And, of course, it is another thing which the shadow Treasurer, Chris Bowen, has refuted, and I think he is right. Again in Hearts & Minds, a great book which I am very pleased to be assisting in promoting today, he says:


… the United Kingdom, facing a much tougher fiscal situation than Australia's, cut its company tax rate to 23 per cent in April 2013, to be reduced further to 21 per cent in April 2014.


So here is Chris Bowen saying that, despite the deficit that the UK has, it has proceeded with company tax cuts, and that was the right thing to do. I entirely agree, but again I hate to point out that Senator Watt is out of step with his colleagues on this issue.


I thought, when I was contemplating my contribution to this debate this morning, that I should revisit the Henry tax review because it is the most recent and most comprehensive review of our taxation system. It was done under the former government, and it was done by a person that I do not think anyone in this chamber would suggest is a neoliberal or an advocate of trickle-down economics. I stand to be corrected, but somehow I doubt that. There are a number of interesting aspects of the Henry tax review on the issue of company tax, which I commend to all senators who are considering how they will vote on this bill later this week.


The first is that the Henry tax review very powerfully demonstrated how out of step Australia's company tax rate is with the rest of the world. They were doing so in May 2010. The data that they used—and this is on page 39 of the report—was from 2009. Things have moved on since 2009, and I will update the Senate on just how they have moved on. But, in 2009, these were the OECD countries that had a lower corporate tax rate than Australia: the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, New Zealand, Luxembourg, Norway, Mexico, Portugal, Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands, Greece, Denmark, Austria, Korea, Switzerland, Turkey, Hungary, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Poland, Iceland and Ireland. That was in 2009. The handful of countries in the OECD that had a higher corporate tax rate than Australia in those years was Germany, France, the United States and Japan.


Already, Ken Henry and his review were concerned that Australia was becoming out of step with the rest of the world on corporate tax. But what has happened since should give everyone in this chamber cause for much greater concern, because very many of those countries I just listed, including both those who already had a lower corporate tax rate than us and those who had a higher tax rate than us, have since further reduced their company tax rates. They have cut their company tax rates further. So Australia is becoming even more out of step with the OECD. Our company tax is becoming even less competitive.


It is likely that it will become less competitive still, particularly if President Donald Trump is successful in his plan to reduce the United States corporate tax rate down to 15 per cent, as he has promised to do, and if Germany follows suit, as it has promised to do if Trump is successful, and if the UK continues to cut its corporate tax rate as a way of ensuring that it remains competitive after its exit from the European Union, as Theresa May, the Prime Minister, has flagged it will do. Australia was already dangerously out of step in 2009, and we have become only more so since. Our international position and competitiveness have been eroded even further from what worried Ken Henry so much in 2009.


I will quote directly from the report now—and again I remind senators that this is Ken Henry's report, under a Labor government. He said:


Australia should respond to these developments by reducing the company income tax rate to 25 per cent over the short to medium term …


Presumably, the short to medium term from 2009 is right about now. He goes on to say:


This would ensure that Australia remains an attractive place to invest…


…   …   …


Reducing taxes on investment, particularly company income tax, would also encourage innovation and entrepreneurial activity. Such reforms would increase income for Australians by building a larger and more productive capital stock, and by generating technology and knowledge spillovers that boost the productivity of Australian businesses. A lower company income tax rate would also reduce incentives for foreign multinationals to shift profits out of Australia.


Again, that is in the words of Ken Henry.


One of the reasons why the government are proposing this reform is that we know that the benefits of a lower corporate tax rate will flow through to workers' wages and income. We know that reducing the company tax rate, which will increase investment in and the profitability of Australian companies, will ultimately and decisively benefit Australian workers. This is something which has been studied widely. The Tax Foundation in the United States, for example, found:


Wages rise $2.50 for every $1 reduction in state and local corporate income taxes.


Treasury modelling predicts that the enterprise tax plan will increase gross national income by up to 0.8 per cent and wages after tax by more than one per cent. One study estimated that a 10 percentage point increase in the corporate tax rate would decrease annual gross wages by seven per cent, with a similar impact on low- and high-skilled workers. 


Over time, the amount of capital investment in Australia is reduced by an uncompetitive business tax rate. This is particularly important as the tax rates of our competitors and our sources of foreign direct investment reduce. Our largest foreign direct investor, the United States, today has a company tax rate which is higher than ours, but, as I have said, it has a plan to reduce it. If they do, we may see a sharp reduction in the flow of investment from them, our largest source of foreign direct investment, and that would have very serious consequences for the wages of Australian workers. This is something that Andrew Leigh, the shadow Assistant Treasurer, has acknowledged, saying that there is a strong link between the company tax rate and wages. He has quoted studies which estimate that an increase in company tax by 10 percentage points would lead to a fall in wages by six to 10 per cent.


An important thing to bear in mind is that the benefits of reducing the company tax rate will be permanent and long lasting for the Australian economy. It is something which we will reap the benefits of, going forward. This is not just a one-off sugar hit, like the stimulus packages put in place by those opposite that we are still paying for today. This is a permanent improvement to Australia's competitiveness and productivity that will deliver dividends for decades to come.


Treasury modelling shows that a five per cent reduction in business tax will deliver a permanent boost to the economy of about one per cent over the long run, as I mentioned. Australian modelling predicts that reducing the company tax rate from 30 per cent to 25 per cent would result in a permanent increase in business investment of up to 2.9 per cent over a similar period, which is equivalent to about $6.5 billion in today's dollars. By comparison, the highly successful reforms—revered by all sides of politics and by economists—preceded by the Hilmer report in the 1990s delivered about a 2.5 per cent boost to the economy. So, when those opposite talk about the economic reform legacy of Keating, as they should and are entitled to do, and they talk about the benefits delivered by the competition reforms, which were very real and very positive, they should bear in mind that they delivered a smaller boost to the economy than this tax cut for businesses will.


In the United States, it has been estimated that a one per cent cut in local business taxes can increase the number of local establishments by about three to four per cent over a 10-year period. The OECD has found that corporate income taxes are the most harmful major tax when it comes to economic growth. UK modelling predicted that reducing the tax rate from 28 per cent to 20 per cent would result in a permanent increase in investment of up to 4.5 per cent over a 20-year period.


That reminds me of another key finding of the Henry tax review. This is on page 13 of the report, in the chapter entitled 'The need for reform', which I think is even more prescient today than it was in 2009. The Treasury ranked taxes by the marginal welfare loss generated by increasing those taxes, and this is a common method to determine which taxes have the least deadweight loss on the economy and which taxes therefore can raise revenue with the least negative impact on welfare. They ranked these from the greatest loss in welfare to the lowest loss in welfare. The first three taxes are state based taxes, which obviously we do not have direct control over. They were the royalties and crude oil excise, insurance taxes and payroll tax. They are the ones that have potentially the most negative effect on welfare. But the next, fourth most harmful tax from the point of view of the welfare of the Australian people—and it is by far the most damaging tax at the federal level—is corporate income tax.


It is no accident that Ken Henry was recommending primarily, among all the other recommendations he made, a reduction of the company income tax rate—because it is a tax under the direct control of the federal government and it is the tax that has the most damaging impact on our economy.


I spoke before about the fact that a cut to company tax rates will be permanent and long lasting, but the other important thing is that the impact will be immediate. It will have an immediate impact on our economy and give an immediate boost not just to small businesses—who, under our plan, will take advantage immediately of a reduction in tax rates, and that is a very important aspect of the plan—but also to medium and larger sized businesses, who, if this full package is legislated, will have confidence that the investments they make today, which have a long lead time and which may not return a profit for many years, will be returned in a favourable tax environment. That will encourage them to make those investments today. 


One of the most important things we can do is deliver certainty to those businesses that there will be a good economic return on their investment in the years to come. So, even if we cut their taxes today through legislation but the effect does not happen for many years, we can expect to see an immediate improvement in business investment. Today those companies are sitting around, watching what we are doing and deciding whether or not to invest, and there is no way that they are going to invest until they see action by this parliament to demonstrate that they should invest. 


So, if we are worried, as we all should be, about the declining rates, the low rates, of investment in Australia, and the impact that that has on the take-home pay of workers and on the returns for retirees in their retirement, then the best thing we can do is not just pass part of this package but pass every bit of this package today to deliver instant benefits to small business and long-term benefits to the country.

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2017-03-29,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (10:44):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan) Bill 2016. We are debating a bill that I have no doubt the government will be running away from as fast as they can. We have always been very clear on this side of the chamber that Labor will not support, and will never support, cuts of tax to the big end of town and to big business. This bill gives effect to a series of 2016-17 budget measures that were aimed at reducing company tax for small, medium and large size businesses. The bill contains three measures: reducing the company tax to 25 per cent, increasing the unincorporated small business tax discount and increasing the small business entity threshold. As I said, Labor does not support tax cuts for big business. In line without position, prior to the last election we said we would support company tax for small businesses with turnovers of less than $2 million. We will be moving amendments in the committee stage to reflect our position on these cuts.


We believe very firmly that now is not the time to deliver tax relief for large businesses. Let us remember that Australia is at risk of losing its AAA rating, and this government—the one that is on the government bench—is responsible for that. The time to give tax cuts is quite clearly not now. The government is trying to deliver a $50 billion tax cut for the big end of town. That, to me, demonstrates how reckless this government is, how out of touch this government is and how this government has absolutely failed the Australian people. It has failed with its leadership, because there quite clearly has not been any proper leadership when it comes to the budget or the economy.


They trumpeted around the country during the 2016 federal election, and their big chant was 'jobs and growth'. For those that are listening in, those that have been in this chamber for some time, would remember that the former member for Bass used to have his staff every morning do a chant, 'jobs and growth, jobs and growth.' They have failed. They have failed to deliver on all of those things. No jobs have been created. We have seen a blow out in the deficit and in the net debt. We have seen growth beyond trend, wage growth at record lows and underemployment at record highs and now they want to hand out a $50 billion tax cut. After such a deplorable and embarrassing year that this government had last year, we were all hoping that they would kickstart 2017 with a few goals. But, no, they have not done that at all. I want to highlight and contrast how this side of the parliament want to spend taxpayers' money, because it is all very relevant to this bill.


In a desperate attempt to save Christopher Pyne's seat in South Australia, and to hold their seats against the trend that is across this country—that the Australian people have lost confidence in them—what they have done, and what they intend to do, is undermine an internationally recognised and nationally recognised institution that is based in Launceston: the Australian Maritime College. What they are planning to do is spend $25 million creating another institution in Adelaide. Why? It is a clear cut case of pork barrelling.


For the last 20 years or more—right back from when I worked in the state government—there has been bipartisan support for the Australian Maritime College. A lot of federal and state money has gone into making sure that it is an international leader. It is highly respected. That institution trains the world's best seafarers. They ensure that we are recognised internationally. We have international students. We have the Australian Defence Force sending their recruits and their engineers. The Navy is a great supporter of the Australian Maritime College. Only recently, in this place, the Liberal Senate team joined with us in unanimously passing a motion that we would spend more of the defence budget in Tasmania. What have we got now? We have a desperate, dysfunctional government that is putting at risk and undermining an international college, the Australian Maritime College. This is how dysfunctional this government is.


This government is hell-bent on punishing Tasmanians, because they threw out the three amigos at the last election. They lost the seat of Bass because of an arrogant, out-of-touch member. What they are doing now is trying to take revenge on the economy of northern Tasmania. I know, Mr Acting Deputy President Whish-Wilson, that you would share my concerns about the Australian Maritime College being undermined and what that would do not only to Tasmania but to the economy of northern Tasmania in particular.




Senator Fawcett:
  A point of order. I draw the chair's attention to the bill, which is the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan) Bill 2016. 




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Whish-Wilson
):  We give a fair bit of latitude in these debates as you are aware, Senator Fawcett. Is that your point of order?




Senator Fawcett:
  The member opposite is misleading the house in that the college that was established, or announced recently, is a technical college not a college—




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Whish-Wilson
):  That is a debating point.




Senator POLLEY:
  You know you are hitting the mark when you start getting interjections from those opposite. I am really surprised that the good senator would want to defend Mr Pyne's assertions by undermining a Defence Force facility, being an ex-military person himself.


In this instance, what is so critical is that the $25 million would be better placed—better served to the Defence Force and the economy, particularly in northern Tasmania—and better invested in an already established college, such as the AMC, that is recognised not only nationally but also internationally. Why would you want to support a government that is undermining that? It really disappoints me.


When we go back to this debate about taxation let us be very clear and put the facts on the table. This government is hell-bent on giving big businesses more—at this time, when our AAA rating is under threat, when we have the highest underemployment rate and when there is low wage growth for ordinary workers, they are bringing in and supporting penalty rates cuts to the lowest paid workers in this country. 


We know that Mr Turnbull and his government do not believe in fairness. What they believe in is giving $50 billion to the big end of town; at the same time they are slashing family tax benefits and they are cutting health. We know they are underfunding our schools. They are attacking Medicare. And we know there are going to be 700,000 Australians who will be directly affected by this government's support for cutting penalty rates. 


Yesterday, we had those on the other side trying to defend their position on penalty rates cuts, saying, 'Well, we support the independent umpire'. Quite frankly, they know that that is not true. They know they did it for trucking companies; they interfered then. But it is in their DNA not to stand up and support everyday Australians. They do not support pensioners. They accuse new mothers of rorting the system and double-dipping. We know that they have underfunded the education system. We know that they have undermined child care in this country, particularly in rural and regional Australia—and remote Australia and our Aboriginal brothers and sisters. Attacking pensioners is all right for those on the other side, but they will be very quick to get up and support Mr Pyne's and Mr Turnbull's attempts to undermine the Australian Maritime College and to waste $25 million when that money should be spent in northern Tasmania—not in South Australia trying to save their own seats. 


I do not believe that this type of legislation will do anything at all. It does not matter what Mr Pyne tries to do to try and buy a seat—like Mr Turnbull tried to buy government. This legislation will not be supported, because we on this side—and there will be enough on the opposition side—know that this is bad policy. This is bad policy and bad timing. I urge everyone in this chamber to stand up against this government.

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2017-03-29,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (10:54):  I rise to speak in relation to the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan) Bill 2016. Following on from the comments of Senator Polley, I indicate our concern about this bill. I want to put on the record from the outset that Labor does believe in responsible management of the budget. Labor also believes that a reduction in the small business company tax rate is a way to support Australian jobs and contribute to national prosperity. But we do not believe in fiscal recklessness, and that is what is behind this particular measure. 


Before I talk about the measure in more detail, I want to talk about how we have come to this have this so-called centrepiece of the government's economic plan. I want to take a step back for a second and look at the shambolic decision making which has led to the announcement of this enterprise tax plan. I think the other factor here is that we need to look at the broken election commitment of the Abbott government of 2013. They promised to have a comprehensive look at our taxation system. 


We know that we had the Intergenerational report. We know there was supposed to be a process following the Intergenerational report—a tax white paper and a green paper. And we know that upon the taking of office of the Prime Minister, following the demise of Prime Minister Abbott, there was basically a canning of the whole process that was undertaken to have a comprehensive look at our taxation system. There were a number of submissions. I think about $5 million in costs were incurred by the public sector in receiving the hundreds of submissions examining those submissions, not to mention examining the work that was done by organisations in contributing to that promised comprehensive review. All of that came to nothing. It was just scrapped for the political objectives of Mr Turnbull. 


Then there was a series of thought bubbles that took place last year. Around 12 months ago, the Prime Minister was floating the idea of states assuming some taxation powers. We know that there was also a thought bubble in relation to the GST being increased. All of these things were ill-fated and all of these things were done in the absence of proper consultation. All of this illustrates the chaotic nature in which economic policy is being set by this government. So we did find that the government landed on this so-called enterprise tax plan. This, in our view, is fiscal recklessness. The government has sent a clear message that the AAA credit rating is under pressure. Now is not the time to put in place a structural adjustment that builds to $13 billion a year by the end of the next 10 years. 


These are the economic facts. The economy is growing below trend. The unemployment rate has increased and is now close to six per cent. Underemployment is at record highs. There are fewer full-time jobs than a year ago, and wages growth is at record lows. And not only is wages growth at record lows but we also have the threat of a penalty rates cut for low-income workers—700,000 workers around the country potentially. I know that the Treasurer has indicated that, in his opinion, low wage growth is the greatest single threat to our economy. If one looks at the impact of a dramatic cut to penalty rates, surely one can see that that has to be a greater problem for us in terms of economic growth. 


It was a Labor government in 2011 that saw for the first time all three ratings agencies award Australia the top sovereign credit rating of AAA. No Liberal government has ever been able to make such a claim. Since taking office the government has mismanaged the budget, tripling the deficit since the 2014 budget and blowing out net debt by $100 billion. So much for fiscal conservatism.


The government continues to receive warnings that the AAA credit rating is under threat. In July of last year Standard & Poor's put Australia's AAA credit rating on a negative outlook. S&P noted that debt could continue to rise unless more budget savings measures are legislated or there are improvements in the revenue outlook. The shadow Treasurer, Mr Bowen, has noted that Standard & Poor's is calling out the Liberal-National government for three years of fiscal failure and passing a vote of no confidence in this government's ability to deal with the budget situation. S&P also noted that, over the next six to 12 month, it would continue to monitor the success of the new government's ability to pass revenue and expenditure measures through both houses of parliament. Now is the time to work on fiscal repair, not to blow out the budget further.


Labor is serious about budget repair. We took a number of policies to the election, including a multinational tax package; abolishing the Emissions Reduction Fund; negative gearing and capital gains tax reform; and reversing the government's tax cut for millionaires. Labor has continued the work of fiscal repair, including changes to last year's omnibus bill that made the bill bigger, better and fairer, including abolishing the baby bonus and the abolition of the family tax benefit part A supplement for families with adjusted taxable incomes above $80,000. Labor is still willing to work with the government on additional savings in areas such as negative gearing and capital gains tax. Labor has a track record, both during the election and in the term of parliament, of delivering on budget repair in a way that is fair.


As the government has indicated, this bill is the centrepiece of its budget and election campaign. A responsible government would have immediately released figures of a long-term structural change over 10 years. But it was not until Labor put pressure on this issue during estimates last year that the Treasury Secretary, Mr Fraser, and not the Treasurer, fessed up on the $48.2 billion cost of this policy.


The government has form in this area, spruiking jobs and growth while doing all it can to hide the long-term impact of its centrepiece policy. We all remember the Prime Minister's train wreck of an interview with David Speers, where it was revealed that the government had no reasonable basis for withholding this valuable public information. The government knows that the release of this figure puts squarely in focus its contradiction of constantly talking about budget repair while wanting to blow a hole in the budget.


The Treasurer spruiks responsible budget management. He says:


Everything we look at in in the budget, every revenue measure we look at in the budget, expenditure and revenue, it must be fit for purpose, it must be sustainable, it must do its job and if it's not doing it, then you've got to change it.


However, when you measure this bill against the Treasurer's own words, a bill which is not sustainable and contains tax measures with questionable benefits, one can only come to the conclusion that it is seriously flawed. According to the Treasurer's own words it needs changing.


The Grattan Institute has commented that the alleged benefits of this bill have not been thought through properly. They state:


It is an article of faith in Australia's business community that corporate tax cuts are the big lever for increasing economic growth. Australia's corporate tax rate is high relative to most developed countries. OECD studies show that lower corporate tax rates tend to lead to higher investment and hence higher economic output. Many studies—including the 2012 Game Changers report for Grattan Institute—picked up this research and highlighted company tax cuts as one of the big opportunities for government to increase prosperity.


Yet ironically legislation to cut the company tax rate over 10 years has been introduced at the precise time that doubts are growing about the payback of corporate tax cuts, especially for countries such as Australia that have dividend imputation systems.


Australia's unusual dividend imputation system means that domestic investors are largely unaffected by the company tax rate since any profits paid to them are taxed at their personal income tax rate. Yet because foreign investors, by contrast, do not benefit from dividend imputation, a cut to the company tax rate provides bigger benefits to them. For those who have already made long-term investments in Australia, a reduction in the tax rate would be a windfall. Many of the international studies about the economic impacts of cutting corporate tax rates are therefore not readily applicable to Australia.


The Government maintains that the change will boost GDP by more than 1 per cent in the long-term, at a budgetary cost of $48.2 billion over the next 10 years. But the best analysis from the Commonwealth Treasury shows that the net benefits to Australians' incomes will be much smaller once profits flowing out of Australia are taken into account. Raising other taxes to compensate for the foregone company tax revenue will create their own economic costs. Because additional corporate investment will phase in slowly, the benefits of company tax cuts for Australian incomes will be a long time coming. And the substantial costs of the measure in the short term could see company tax cuts drag on national incomes for the next ten years. Weighing the balance, it is not clear that corporate tax cuts should be Australia's top priority.


It is very interesting that the Grattan Institute highlights this thinking which has emerged that company tax cuts are not the magic wand or panacea they might have been thought to be some years ago. Economic thinking has moved on but this government continues to grasp onto issues which, whilst they might make a nice headline, are not delivering for the Australian economy and the people of Australia.


The other point about this wonderful windfall for companies is that there is such a huge windfall for the major banks and overseas companies. We note that the benefits of wholesale corporate tax cuts potentially go to foreign investors. And, according to the Australia Institute, the cuts are a $7.4 billion windfall for the largest banks in Australia. We know that the behaviour of the banks has been quite deplorable over the last five to 10 years in particular. To reward that behaviour with a massive windfall in terms of a company tax cut sends a very strange message. It just illustrates the point that it is unusual for a government to be defending the banks from a royal commission at all costs yet at the same time handing out largesse to them at a time when, as we all know, they are making massive profits.


The Australia Institute in its report Company tax cuts: what the evidence shows states:


The BCA’s CEO Jennifer Westacott titled her recent opinion piece on the subject, ‘Start tax debate with right objective: Boosting growth’. The evidence presented here suggests that if there are any growth dividends of lowering the company tax rate they are so weak as to be outweighed by other factors. Neither cross-country comparison nor Australia’s own history lend any support to the ‘tax-cuts-are-good’ thesis. If the aim really is increased economic growth, then Australians would be better advised to ignore the business lobby’s call for lower company tax rates and look seriously at other policies. Australia’s golden age of economic growth, 1945 to the 1970s, was backed by full employment policies and investment in infrastructure, education, science and technology.


I believe that the case for a wholescale tax cut has not been thought through and that alternative measures, such as increased investment in infrastructure, health and education, have not been properly thought through and assessed. Indeed, the Australian Council of Social Service stated in its submission:


If Treasury's assumption that in the long term 45% of the budget cost of a 5% company tax cut is offset by higher growth and increases in revenue from other taxes, this suggests that a net $8 billion in foregone public revenue is being used to 'buy' an improvement in household welfare or spending power of much less than 0.7%. If the Treasury modelling is accurate, this is an underwhelming result.


…   …   …


More substantial economic benefits are likely from a range of other public policies beyond tax reform. These include taking advantage of historically low interest rates to increase public investment in projects vetted by a reputable oversight body; policies to strengthen workforce participation (especially among parents, mature age people and social security recipients); improved urban planning and investment (especially in affordable housing and public transport); and investment in quality early childhood and school education for children at risk of falling behind.


I believe that the government has not properly assessed whether this $50 billion tax cut is the best way to manage the budget when other alternatives, such as investment in infrastructure, education and health, are likely to deliver far greater returns. Given that borrowing costs are historically low and that the RBA has appealed to the government to increase infrastructure spending, infrastructure should be an area where the government can come to the table to work cooperatively with the opposition.


Small businesses make a huge contribution to national prosperity and supporting Australian jobs. Small businesses play a central role in the economy. Over two million sole traders, partnerships, trusts and small employers have helped underpin 25 years of economic growth. Labor stands by its election commitments and is prepared accept amendments to the bill that would, firstly, only reduce the company tax rate to 27.5 per cent for businesses with a turnover of less than $2 million—the threshold that remains consistent with the ATO definition of 'small business'; secondly, only increase the unincorporated small business tax discount from five per cent to eight per cent and only for businesses with a turnover of less than $2 million; and, thirdly, not proceed with the increase to the small business entity threshold. This position, costed by the Parliamentary Budget Office, would save $4.4 billion over the forward estimates and $50.1 billion over the medium term.


Labor also holds to the definition of 'small business' remaining less than $2 million in turnover, as there is not a strong economic justification for increasing that threshold above $2 million. The government's own Treasury modelling clearly states that the objective of reducing company tax is to attract more foreign investment. Delivering tax relief for companies with a turnover of between $2 million and $10 million would attract little, if any, additional foreign investment, as that tends to occur with much larger businesses.


In summary, even according to the standards that the Treasurer has set himself, this bill is not ready to be passed. The budget position has deteriorated under the coalition's watch: the deficit has tripled since 2014 and $100 billion has been added to net debt. The credit-rating agencies are taking a serious look at Australia's fiscal position and now is the time to engage in budget repair in a way that is fair and to make sound investments that promote inclusive growth. The centrepiece of the government's agenda ignores the concerns of the rating agencies and instead ram-raids a $50 billion hit over the medium term. A number of groups have stated that the benefits make take time to emerge. In light of this, more productive investment in infrastructure should be considered in line with the recent RBA comments. According to the Treasurer's own words, this bill is not sustainable and it is not fit for purpose and hence needs changing.


Labor is committed to budget repair in a way that is fair. Labor has recently followed through on its commitment with the recent passing of the omnibus bill. Labor remains prepared to deliver targeted, sustainable tax cuts for small businesses with a turnover of less than $2 million per year while preserving the budget position so that other investments, such as in infrastructure, health and education, can be considered. Labor is committed to responsible budget management and to protect Australia's AAA credit rating. Labor believes that the defending of the credit rating can be achieved at the same time as proper investment in schools, hospitals and infrastructure to achieve Labor's plans for economic growth.


Labor are committed to a budget and a taxation system that link effort and reward in a fair way. We are also committed to taking responsible decisions that improve the sustainability of our public finances, reduce the risk of a credit-rating downgrade and ensure that we can make targeted investments that promote inclusive economic growth. In light of Labor's values and the findings of the inquiry, Labor oppose this bill as is currently stands and call on the government to abandon fiscal recklessness and return to the work of budget repair in a way that is fair, not in a way that means workers will get a pay cut while big businesses and banks get a tax cut.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,3,2
"Duniam, Sen Jonathon",LP,2017-03-29,"



Senator DUNIAM
 (Tasmania) (11:14):  It is a delight to rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enterprise Tax Plan) Bill 2016.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  I'm glad someone is delighted.




Senator DUNIAM:
  I am excited about what this bill can do for our country, Senator Whish-Wilson, so it is a delight to get up and speak on it. I will come back to Senator Ketter's contribution and the repeated mantra of 'budget repair that is fair', which, to my mind, seems odd when you are talking about spending more money. I am not sure how that repairs one's budget. I would have thought everyone in this place, everyone in this entire building, including the other place, would agree that all Australians want to see a more productive and a more prosperous Australia—a place where there are more jobs for hardworking Australians. The Turnbull government's enterprise tax plan, which we are debating at the moment, is one of the most significant reforms to Australia's business taxation framework in a generation, and I think it paves the way to those elements I just described. 


This country needs a tax system that supports enterprise by backing businesses to invest. Economic activity is generated in the business community, not here in the halls of Parliament House. It also must ensure that Australia continues to be an attractive place to do business—and I note Senator Whish-Wilson's comments in his contribution, which I will cover off a little later on—and that means not just for foreign investment but also for people choosing to invest either here or overseas. It has to be an attractive place to invest their money. We want people to invest in this country, to grow our economy and to create jobs. 


The 10-year program will secure our future and create jobs for hardworking Australians; it will create jobs that these people are crying out for in our regions and in our cities. It will help the 1.8 million Australians looking for extra work to boost their take-home pay, which I would have thought was something that the opposition would support, given the debate in recent days on the matter of penalty rates. When we are talking about ensuring that Australians have a decent take-home pay, those opposite are here talking about a way of preventing businesses from creating jobs. I do not know how the two match up. Improvement in Australia's living standards must be driven by a higher level of labour productivity and participation, which are in part driven by lower company income tax rates. As I have said, those hardworking Australians who want that boost in their take-home pay and who need those additional hours need that pay to cover the increased living costs we have in this country. I am sure many of us have constituents who front up to talk about the increased cost living—not to mention the cost of power, which, in the great state of South Australia, has gone through the roof, like it has in many other parts of the country. Higher health and education spending and a bigger welfare budget will not help hardworking Australians pick up extra work and extra pay to take home to pay those bills. I guess, in response, that goes to the point in Senator Ketter's contribution about budget repair that is fair by spending more on things like infrastructure, health and education, rather than, indeed, looking at how we spend that money and making sure the taxpayer—it is not our money; it is the taxpayer's money—is getting value for money. Rather than using savings to get the budget back into balance and paying huge amounts of money in interest on debts that have been accrued by those opposite, Labor wants Australians to pay more tax so that we can spend more. The real contrast here is the enterprise tax plan that this government, the Turnbull government, has rolled out, which will boost the Australian economy, create the activity we need to ensure that we have a stronger economy. This bill will provide the encouragement for employers, as I have already said, to invest and grow their businesses and provide greater job security, more employment opportunities and higher wages growth. 


The sad thing I have come to realise in the public debate on this issue and the contributions that have been made so far by the opposition is that Labor thinks that Canberra knows how to spend money better than people who run small businesses—the people who want to keep their businesses in the black so that they can keep paying their employees and keep paying their bills, the mortgage on their business or their business loan facility. Labor believe that they know how to create jobs better than business and that it is a better proposition for government to keep the hard-earned taxpayer dollars in our pockets here in Canberra than allowing businesses to do more with the money that they earn. Our plan aims to give businesses the certainty they need to plan and make long-term investments that are vital for growth and boosting our national economy and productivity. Compared to many other countries, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region, Australia's corporate tax rate is high. I suppose that goes back to that point that Senator Whish-Wilson made that, indeed, if it is not the highest, it is certainly up there. When people are choosing to invest, that is something they take into account. We cannot ignore that fact. Corporate tax rates that are increasingly uncompetitive will make it harder for this country to attract investment, which is a key driver for labour productivity and growth. 


Fundamentally, a more competitive business tax environment would encourage higher levels of investment in Australia, which is what we need, given the falling levels of private investment as we move from the mining investment boom of the last decade. Again, fundamentally, more economic activity provides more tax income. When businesses are earning more, when people are earning more, they are paying more tax. When they are spending more, they are paying more tax. So, freeing up these dollars, putting them back into the economy, allowing businesses to invest, to spend and to buy new infrastructure and putting it back into the community generates that tax revenue. So I do not actually understand Labor's opposition to this and, indeed, that of many on the crossbenches. So it is vital that we give business every opportunity to invest, to innovate, to grow and to employ more hardworking Australians. 


As part of this plan, as it has been covered off in this debate by a number of speakers previously, and I am sure it will be again, we are going to back small business by reducing their tax rate to 27½ per cent, starting with small businesses with a turnover of less than $10 million, on 1 July this year. That oft used phrase that small businesses are the engine room of the Australian economy is absolutely right. In the small towns of Tasmania, where I am from, these small businesses are the source of employment for people. There are not major factories anymore. There are not the large manufacturing facilities. There are small businesses. And we need to back them. They are the home of Australian enterprise and opportunity. Indeed, they are where many big ideas are born, ideas we try and foster and we want to see more of, so we can create more jobs in our regions. This set of measures is one way of assisting us to do that.


Across the country, small businesses employ over three million people and in 2013-14 added around $340 billion to our economy. We need to reduce the tax burden on small business first and, as many—not companies—will extend the unincorporated small business tax discount from 2016-17, the discount will be available to businesses with annual turnover of less than $5 million, up from the current threshold of $2 million. It will be increased to eight per cent. The maximum discount available will remain at $1,000.


Over the next decade, the discount will be further expanded in phases to a final discount at 16 per cent. This means that every year around 2.3 million businesses will, potentially, have access to the unincorporated tax discount. Further support will be provided for small businesses to expand and create jobs. Access to a number of tax concessions will be provided by increasing the threshold for these concessions to $10 million, up from the current $2 million threshold. These changes will benefit over 90,000 businesses. 


Focusing on contributions of those opposite and the record of the opposition, it is important to reflect on some things that have been said and put on record by them. During the last election, last year, we saw much commentary on the government's tax plan, with Labor cherry picking what they would support and what they would not—which is, again, what they are doing here today—but what we, actually, saw was the Labor Party at odds with what their predecessors had been saying for decades.


There is no denying that the Labor Party cut company tax in the past, and they did it not once but twice. Between 1983 and 1996 the Hawke and Keating governments cut company tax from 49 to 33 per cent. At the time, these measures were sold as an immediate boost to business confidence and an incentive for increased corporate investment in Australia. It is amazing now how, when this government is attempting to do something that will stimulate economic growth and invest and job creation, they rail against it. One has to ask if it is simply political opportunism. To quote Labor's 1993 tax policy:


This measure will provide an immediate fillip to business confidence, as well as permanently increase both the incentive for companies to retain earnings and the relative attractiveness of corporate investment in Australia, with consequential beneficial effects on employment.


Funny, I've heard that before. I think it may have been in relation to our policy. So I wonder why they are now opposing it. It must be noted that this measure was implemented when the budget was in deficit, and had been since 1990-91, and would continue to be for the remainder of former Prime Minister Keating's time in office.


Turning to the Gillard government, they went to the 2010 election promising a cut to company tax from 30 to 29 per cent—again, to encourage investment and job creation across Australia. That is a quote from their policy. Labor's Creating jobs and skills in Australia policy stated:


We will cut the company tax rate to 29 per cent for all Australian companies to stimulate investment across the economy.


…   …   …


A lower company tax rate will increase investment, raise productivity, and increase the real wages of working Australians.


In March 2012 then Treasurer Wayne Swan made their position as clear as could be:


We intend to fight tooth and nail to get this general company tax cut through …


…   …   …


We want a general company tax cut.


But Prime Minister Gillard had to concede that despite how much Labor wanted to deliver the measure they could not, as they could not get the legislation through parliament.


On the current Leader of the Opposition and the Labor Party of today, the Leader of the Opposition expressed enthusiasm for company tax cuts when it was Labor's policy. In November 2010, as the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, he told the Australian Services Union National Conference that Labor's plan to cut the company tax rate would 'keep all sectors of our economy competitive in their own global markets'. Again, I do not know why we have deviated from that position across the way, there, in the current debate.




Senator Whish-Wilson:
  Come on, fire up!




Senator DUNIAM:
  I will, thank you, Senator Whish-Wilson. I have a few points I want to make with reference to your contributions a little later on. 


We should never forget we are just one option for international investors and we have to make sure we offer the most compelling value. That is exactly right. What has changed? The world still has a global market, where people are choosing where they invest their money. Why has that changed, in Labor's opinion? I do not know. Why Senator Whish-Wilson does not believe that is the case, I do not know. Someone who has a stronger background in finance than me, I would think, would have accepted this.


At the same ACOSS conference in March 2011 that Bob Brown addressed, Mr Shorten argued against the Greens' proposal to spend the expected proceeds from the mining tax on a national dental care scheme or an increase to welfare payments rather than a company tax cut. Mr Shorten said: 


What this proposal, as well meaning as it might seem, what it fails to recognise is that we need to encourage employment participation, not greater welfare dependency.


Friends, corporate tax reform helps Australia's private sector grow and it creates jobs right up and down the income ladder.


Then, in August 2011, Mr Shorten told parliament: 


Cutting the company income tax rate increases domestic productivity and domestic investment. More capital means higher productivity and economic growth and leads to more jobs and higher wages.


That was a bit of a snapshot of where Labor have been on this issue over a number of years, and it is a real contrast to where they are today. It just begs the question: is this nothing more than political opportunism, opposition for opposition's sake? Australia deserves better than this.




Senator Dastyari:
  Shame!




Senator DUNIAM:
  It is shameful, absolutely, Senator Dastyari, that it is opposition for opposition's sake.


Going to a couple of the contributions my colleagues have made in the debate so far, I want to reiterate the points I made earlier with regard to Senator Whish-Wilson's contribution. Senator Ketter made the point that it is all about foreign investment. It is about foreign investment, but it is also about Australians being able to choose whether they invest here or abroad. If it is more competitive for an Australian, a business or an individual to invest in a market where it is more competitive then we need to compete against that to attract that investment back to Australian shores. I think there was also a claim, through one of the references that Senator Whish-Wilson read out, that at a time when there was an exceptionally high tax rate there was increased foreign investment. I am not sure whether Senator Whish-Wilson was indicating that we should increase the company tax rate to stimulate foreign investment.



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—




Senator DUNIAM:
  I find it amazing, Senator Whish-Wilson, that you believe increasing the company tax rate would stimulate foreign investment in this country. In fact, I find that unbelievable. Moving off Senator Whish-Wilson's contributions, I want to touch on something that Senator Polley raised at length in this debate, and it is relation to the Australian Maritime College in Tasmania. While it does not directly relate to the bill at hand, I think it is important to respond at least in part to what Senator Polley said. A lot of mistruths and misrepresentations were put onto the Hansard during Senator Polley's contribution. The one correct thing Senator Polley did say was that there is a bipartisan approach on the part of the Tasmanian Labor and Liberal representatives in the federal parliament when it comes to ensuring Tasmania gets its fair share of defence spending. I would be very interested to know why Senator Polley wants to try and conflate issues. What has been announced in Adelaide is a technical college that will train shipbuilders, people who design and build ships. But what we have in Tasmania is a facility that trains seafarers. These are two quite different propositions. This commitment demonstrates that the Tasmanian AMC is part of the broad jigsaw; we have a strength, and it is part of the broader framework of defence training and capability in Australia. It is disappointing that Senator Polley has misrepresented what has actually been announced, has tried to conflate issues and has then gone on with the character assassination of the former member for Bass.


I want to briefly touch on Senator Ketter's contribution as well. He made the point that the economy is slowing down and the government needs to act. I go back to the point that I have made on a number of occasions now: to stimulate the economy you need to look at things like tax reform and cuts to tax rates to encourage investment, to encourage spending and to create more jobs. That is how you stimulate the economy. You do not stimulate the economy by investing more in government spending as Senator Ketter said. That is not stimulating the economy. It is not sustainable to just rack up more debt, tax people more and drive down the strength of the private sector in this country. To stimulate the economy, which is where Senator Ketter was going with his contribution, you need to create an environment where the private sector can thrive and create the jobs we need. I would be interested to know how many of those who have made a contribution so far, including Senator Polley and Senator Ketter, have owned and operated a small business and been responsible for the payment of salaries.



Senator Whish-Wilson interjecting—





Senator DUNIAM:
  I acknowledge that Senator Whish-Wilson has been, and may still be, an employer—I am not sure. But that is right: you have to have an understanding of how business operates. When you have never been responsible for the payment of people's wages and ensuring businesses are paying bills so that the jobs can continue and the business remains afloat it is ridiculous to come in here and tell us that tax cuts are a bad thing. I call on the opposition and those on the crossbench who are not supporting the bill to jump on board and support this good legislation. This is once-in-a generation reform that will actually go a long way to drive our economy, create jobs and create the investment that we need, particularly in regional Australia. Thank you very much for the opportunity to contribute to this debate.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:48):  While I am in the chamber speaking on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017,  I will give a shout out to the delegation of New Zealand parliamentarians that is in my office right now.


Yesterday, I was reminding people about what ANTaR had written in their submission to the inquiry by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights. They said:


Far from being a theoretical discussion, racial discrimination has a very real impact on mental health and wellbeing for First Peoples.


They said in their necessarily quick submission to the inquiry held last Friday:


Racism and discrimination contribute to poor mental health, increased self-harm and suicide, decreased school attendance and lower workplace productivity, and participation in society more broadly.


When releasing their reconciliation barometer earlier this year, which they do every two years—so this is using 2016 data—ANTaR said that the government needs to start looking at first people's lived experience of racism and leave the RDA protections untouched.


The national reconciliation barometer showed an increase of racism experienced by our first peoples. They found that racism towards first peoples has increased from 39 per cent to 46 per cent since the last barometer, in 2014. I remind people that the latest data was collected in 2016. That is a significant increase in racism towards our first peoples. They found that one in three Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people had experienced verbal racial abuse in the six months before the survey. The anecdotal feedback from a number of Aboriginal people I have spoken to is that it certainly has not gotten any better since then. In fact, it may have gotten even worse. Given the negative impact on health and wellbeing of racism, if we are going to close the gap it is absolutely vital that we maintain protections against racial discrimination. In other words, racial discrimination has a direct impact on people's wellbeing, and we need to address that if we are ever going to close the gap by our agreed target dates.


To say the community's support for retaining the current wording of section 18C is overwhelming is an understatement. We know that racial discrimination and vilification remains a major challenge in Australia, and the barometer pointed that out. If anything, that challenge is growing. The Scanlon Foundation's most recent report found that the proportion of Australians who have experienced racism in the past 12 months has grown to 20 per cent. That is one in five Australians.


We only have to observe the general tenor of comments online, under news reports, on social media and in forums, to see that a significant number of people in this country currently feel very free to unleash racist, bigoted, Islamophobic and anti-Semitic diatribes in public. We only need to read one of the countless experiences recounted in submissions to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights inquiry into section 18C to know that racism remains an ever-present problem. We must be especially vigilant now that a significant proportion of our community has been energised by the election of Donald Trump. People have responded by feeling much freer to be racist in that environment.


If you have never experienced racial discrimination or abuse, you only need to listen to those Australians who have. They know how utterly destructive to a person's sense of self it is. If you listen to people, listen to their experiences, you know it is having a significant impact on that person's sense of self. To be so often attacked about something as arbitrary as the colour of your skin or the clothes that you wear or the country of one's birth is just utter nonsense. So it is in this environment of rampant xenophobia, of racist trolls, of growing experiences of racial abuse and discrimination—you only had to listen to Senator McKim reading out those tweets under #freedomofspeech last week to know of the dozens and dozens and dozens of experiences that people were reporting of abuse. We only have to look at those experiences to ask the question: what does the government seek to achieve by these changes? Why are they trying to make it easier for people to be racist? Why are they sending this signal to the community that it is okay to launch racist diatribes at people?


These zombie measures should not succeed. We should finally put them to bed—in fact kill them off. Why does the other side of this chamber, the government, continue to pretend this is about freedom of speech? I really do not understand just how it is that people like the Attorney-General, like Senator Abetz, like Senator Paterson want to be able to say what they already say. Let us take their argument at face value and assume that they are all currently being muzzled by swathes of politically correct red tape that prevents them from truly expressing themselves. I am not aware of any principle of libertarianism that seriously proposes that freedom of speech is or should be an absolute or unfettered freedom. We have always accepted legitimate restrictions on our freedom to say exactly what we would like to say. We all seem to accept laws that protect us against reputational damage—libel or slander—or that protect us from violent threats. The basic principle of libertarianism is that we should all be free to do or say whatever we want to the point that our expression of freedoms cause genuine and unjustified harm to others, such as, for example, what I described about the impact on our First People's mental health and wellbeing.


I do not think anybody seriously accepts that racism does not cause genuine harm. As I have outlined, it clearly does. That is the whole basis of the Racial Discrimination Act itself, which is our acquittal of our international legal duty under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. It is genuinely difficult to decipher the argument of the small number of right-wingers in their own little echo chamber that want these changes. We hear them froth and rant about the words 'insult' and 'offend' and declare that there is no right to not be offended, that causing offence is central to the principle of freedom of speech. But they ignore the fact that the words 'insult' and 'offend' have been applied very strictly in the courts. It seems to me they just want to be able to make unfettered racial comments and to abuse people.


Australia is the most successful multicultural nation on the planet. Multiculturalism is what we do better than anywhere else in the world. It is our great advantage; it underpins so much of our ongoing peace and prosperity. It is a large part of why so many people want to visit here and why so many people in fact want to come here to live, to migrate here. We have just started a Senate committee inquiry into how we can strengthen Australia's multiculturalism even further. We know, even before it starts, that multiculturalism is an asset for all of us.


In technical terms, sections 18C and 18D of the Racial Discrimination Act established the legal case to be applied by the Australian Human Rights Commission and the courts when assessing complaints about racial hate speech. But section 18C is also highly symbolic. It represents our continued commitment to multicultural harmony. It sets the absolute minimum conditions for public engagement in our overwhelmingly successful multicultural society. I just do not see why this small group of hard Right, Dad's Army opponents of 18C want so badly to attack it. Hundreds of people have spoken to us in the last few weeks and months about racial hate speech, and about the continued need to protect Australians against it. I am sure every senator in this place has in fact had many phone calls and emails about that, and other personal communications and meetings.


There are some people in our country who are genuinely afraid of the tenor of some of our public debate and where it might lead in the future—and, again, I have had multiple conversations exactly along those lines. There are many, many Australians who have experienced just what can happen when racial hate speech gets out of control. Rightly, Australia is seen as an oasis of peace away from the hatreds that have been allowed by the political leaders to bubble up in other places. Our Racial Discrimination Act underpins that peace. For very good reason it had bipartisan and then tripartisan support until very recently, when this small group of people who do not represent broader Australia and their opinion, as has been evidenced by many, sprung up, with the support of some media outlets, to run their campaign to undermine our Racial Discrimination Act.


But we Greens will not support it. We will stand in opposition to their moves to undermine the act and undermine section 18C. We will stand firm with millions of Australians who live and work and breathe our wonderful, multicultural reality every day. We will continue to work with them to strengthen our community, not divide our community. We say no to racism, and we say no to the changes that in fact will undermine our multicultural society.

"Paterson, Sen James",LP,2017-03-29,"



Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (12:00):  I have had the privilege of contributing to this debate on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017 a number of times in this chamber, so I will not go over too much old ground today. I will not go over the arguments about the importance of freedom of speech. I will not go over the evidence that the administration of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 by the Human Rights Commission has been incredibly flawed. I will not go over the recent cases that show the harmful impact that this law has had on journalists, cartoonists and students.


There are two things I want to do today. The first is to respond to an argument made by Senator Siewert which has become a bit of a catchcry of those who are opposed to changes to 18C. They like to ask, 'What is it that you would like to say that you cannot say under this law but you would be able to say if the law changes?' It is a question they ask often. It is a question that they assert is not answered and has not been answered, but the only way they could have that view is if they have not been actually listening to those who have a different view in this debate, if they have not been following the work of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights on this issue and if they have not been following the debate closely, because this question has been answered, and I am happy to answer it today.


It is a question that Senator McKim asked at the human rights committee hearings, which we very much enjoyed participating in together around Australia. He asked it at every hearing that I attended except one. That was the Brisbane hearing. Senator McKim was not able to be in Brisbane for the Brisbane hearing, and that was a shame because there was a witness at the Brisbane hearing who had a very good answer to that question. His name is Alex Wood. He is a former student at the Queensland University of Technology, and he was one of the respondents in the QUT case. Alex had heard this question was being asked, including in the hearings, so he came prepared to answer it. Unfortunately, he was not asked it by Senator McKim, because he was not able to be there, but he was asked it and he did answer it. He said that the thing that he would like to say that he is not able to say under the current law is that his university, QUT, is 'stopping segregation with segregation'. That is in fact what Alex Wood did say on Facebook on the day that he was kicked out of an unsigned Indigenous computer lab at his university.


It took Alex 3½ years and a torturous legal process, which has disrupted his life, had a severe financial impact on him and his family and the other people involved in this case and potentially damaged his career, to finally establish—after this torturous 3½-year process—that in fact he could legally say that, but not without going through that process. If there are those that argue that we should not be able to say that, fair enough, but I think it is very difficult to argue that it is fair or necessary that someone like Alex Wood should have to go through that process to establish that he should be able to say that.


The main purpose for my contribution to the debate today on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017 is to address one issue that I have not specifically addressed in detail in this debate so far, and that is the argument that those in favour of changing 18C, such as me, fit certain demographic attributes. It has been pointed out that some of us who are advocates of change to 18C are white. It has also been pointed out that some of us are men. And it has also been pointed out that we are men of a certain age. I think I may fail to qualify on that final category, but I certainly qualify on the former two categories. It is said that, because we are white men of a certain age, we have not experienced discrimination, and therefore we should be much more careful in advocating this change.


It is something I have considered carefully, and I have two ways in which I would like to respond to that. The first is that freedom of speech is a right of every Australian, and every Australian has an equal right to participate in the debate about free speech and to advocate sincerely for their point of view on free speech. Your gender, your race and your age have no bearing on your right as an Australian citizen to participate freely in public debate.


The second thing I would say, though, is that a corollary of this argument is the statement that is often made that ethnic communities are united in opposition to changing this law. It is certainly true, and we heard during the committee process, that many of the peak bodies that represent ethnic communities are opposed to and are concerned about changes to this law. But I believe it is incredibly patronising and condescending to not realise that there is active debate within many ethnic communities, as there is in every community on every public policy issue, and that there is a great diversity of opinion within ethnic communities on the desirability of change to 18C. I believe that those who are saying that ethnic communities are united and monolithic in opposition to this either have not been paying attention and have not been listening to the ethnic voices who are in favour of change or have decided to ignore those voices because they are inconvenient for their arguments. Either way, I think that is wrong and does not do these advocates of change justice.


That is one thing I would like to correct today by taking the opportunity to read into the Hansard the words of some of those people who have experienced discrimination in their lives, have been on the receiving end of racism, but nevertheless strongly and passionately support freedom of speech and strongly support the case for change in this law. The first is a gentleman by the name of Gideon Rozner. In the interests of full disclosure: he is an employee of my former employer, the Institute of Public Affairs, and a friend. He is also a Jewish man. He wrote in the Herald Sun in December 2016:


… many Jewish Australians, myself included, share the same concerns about 18C as an increasing number of people in the wider community. Specifically, that banning forms of expression merely because they are ""insulting"" or ""offensive"" is inherently incompatible with the right to free speech.


He goes on to say:


… the open and free society that we enjoy is as fragile as it is precious. It relies on fundamental civil and political rights, not least of all the freedom of speech.


Robert Magid, the publisher of The Australian Jewish News, wrote on 15 September 2016 in his publication:


The point about free speech, for which, over centuries, many have died, is the right to disagree. As Bob Dylan sings: 'You're right from your side and I'm right from mine.'


One man's bigot is another man's courageous defender of what many decent people think and feel. It is in the nature of satirists, comedians and cartoonists to exaggerate and very often offend. Inevitably they end up being called bigots as in the recent case of Bill Leak, one of the least bigoted people I know. Should these critics of society be looking over their shoulder to see whether the sheriff is about to take them on a perp walk?


To them it is Section 18C which is intimidating. It is not only the legal definition that is in question, but the public perception that criticising behaviour of another people in a way that might insult and offend can lead to litigation.


Dr David Adler was a powerful witness before the human rights committee. He is a member of the Sydney Jewish community, and he believes that Jewish communal organisations have not reflected well the diversity of opinion in his community. He cited, in support of his evidence, other prominent Jews who feel same way as he does, such as lawyer Geoffrey Bloch; former judge Jim Spigelman; and the New South Wales Rabbinical Council, which has been concerned about this law and is in favour of changing it. He wrote in The Spectator Australiaon 11 March this year:


What 18C does is to unreasonably constrain free speech in a manner inconsistent with Jewish theology, academic development and values. There is no evidence that 18C is an effective tool in changing a trend of anti-Semitism (there are much more effective tools) and such a law risks serious adverse consequences.


There have also been a number of prominent Indigenous advocates for change, such as Warren Mundine, Anthony Dillon and Wesley Aird. I want to quote two advocates for change who I think have contributed very powerfully to this debate. Kerryn Pholi, who is an Indigenous woman, also writing in The Spectator Australia on 26 April 2014, said:


I hereby demand freedom from protection from this thing we call 'racial vilification'. I do not wish to be protected from the opinions of others. I demand the right to hear the views that other people may wish to express about me. I want this because I do not see how forcing others to shield their true opinion is of any benefit to me. Rather, it infantilises me by suggesting that I cannot handle the ugliness of life. Silencing or concealing the ugliness also exposes me to unnecessary risk, since if all others were free to express their views openly, I could at least make more informed choices about whom to associate with and whom to avoid. 


Jacinta Price, a councillor on the Alice Springs Town Council, wrote in The Australian on2 February this year:


The Racial Discrimination Act's 18C treats us Aboriginal Australians as infants who can't speak or stand up for ourselves. It treats non-Aboriginal people as if they have no right to hold an opinion about anything that relates to us, especially the problems of our own making that are killing us.


…   …   …


The way to beat racism is through debate, not the closing down of debate.


Another advocate for change is Irene Moss. She is a significant advocate for change for a number of reasons. Yes, she is a woman with Chinese heritage, but she is also a former Race Discrimination Commissioner, and it was her inquiry in 1991 that in part led to the adoption of section 18C and is often cited as a justification for the adoption of section 18C. But Irene Moss does not agree. She believes that 18C is in need of reform. In an interview with Chris Merritt from The Australianon 6 March this year, she said, of the law adopted in 1994:


It had 'ignored the inquiry’s warnings that an offence which was drafted too broadly could lead to trivial complaints and confusion'. 'The current controversy with respect to section 18C was predictable,' she said.


She is in favour of reform which removes 'offend', 'insult' and 'humiliate' from the law, which is strikingly similar to what the government has proposed. She said:


'In 1991, the report of the national inquiry into racist violence recommended that the legislation should not be about hurt feelings or injured sensibilities but should focus on incitement to racial hostility …


'I continue to believe that that … was essentially correct.'


Opponents of the bill might feel it is easy to dismiss my view or the views of Senator Smith or other colleagues in this place who do not meet the right demographic criteria, according to them, in order to have the right to participate in this debate. They may disagree with people like Irene Moss, Warren Mundine, Anthony Dillon, Wesley Aird, Jacinta Price, Kerryn Pholi, Gideon Rozner, Robert Magid, David Adler, Geoffrey Bloch and Jim Spigelman, and they are entitled to. But they should at least have the decency to recognise the great diversity of thought and opinion within our ethnic communities. 


I would encourage them to consider that, around the world, limitations on free speech generally have been aimed at minority groups, not at benefiting them, and have come at their great cost many times throughout history. Freedom of speech—the ability to freely debate ideas and stand up for the things we believe in—has always been the best guarantor of a tolerant and harmonious liberal society. It is what has helped Australia be as tolerant, harmonious and prosperous as it is today. It is what helps other countries around the world which share our values reflect that same tolerance and harmony.


I believe that the government's bill strikes the right balance in ensuring that we do have free speech—that people, whatever their background, have the right to stand up and say what they believe and argue sincerely in favour of it, and that it remains unlawful to abuse someone on the basis of their race, as it should be.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2017-03-29,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (12:13):  I rise to speak on the government's Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017. However, I do find it somewhat ironic that its title is 'human rights legislation'. Labor made its choice long ago, and that choice was to stand with multicultural Australia and stand against bigotry. It was Labor that introduced both section 18C and section 18D, and we will always stand firm in protecting them.


Sadly, our Prime Minister seems to have made another decision. He has chosen to fundamentally undermine the provisions of sections 18C and 18D, despite his promises not to. All this will do is make it easier for people to insult or humiliate others on the basis of their race. It is galling to me that the government chose Harmony Day last week to outline their plans to weaken protections against racism in our country.


Sections 18C and 18D were introduced by the Keating government in response to a number of reports on racial violence, including the national inquiry into racist violence by former race discrimination commissioner Irene Moss and the great Australian lawyer Ron Castan QC. It was also in response to royal commissions and other inquiries into our international obligations. 


These provisions are designed to capture not only harassment but also broader campaigns and factions of racial humiliation offence and abuse. Sections 18C and 18D have been established for all the right reasons, and 18C has embodied Australia's condemnation of racial vilification and protected our society from the poisonous effects of hate speech, so they should be protected. At the same time, 18D has operated to protect free speech by providing exemptions for artistic works, scientific debate and fair comment on matters of public interest, providing they are said or done reasonably and in good faith.


It is notable to me that, as Professor Triggs highlighted to our Senate committee last week, with the Bill Leak cartoon that has been so much of the motivating force that has brought us into this debate today an 18D application was never made. It is clear that the government in putting this legislation forward has not been listening to people who have experienced racism.


The idea of moving to a definition of 'harassment' seems to have been put forward by, as far as I can tell, only one member of the joint committee that inquired into this matter. The fact we have this legislation before us at all is a testament to the fact that the coalition has been held captive to a right-wing agenda that is completely out of touch with the lived experience of Australians who have experienced racism and, for that matter, with the priorities of the broader Australian population, who would prefer their politicians to be thinking about creating jobs, quality public services, education and training, and more. Section 18C has been an ideological obsession of the right wing of the Liberal-National Party, which sadly our Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, is too weak to do anything about. Let us not forget that Tony Abbott also tried to introduce these laws when he was Prime Minister.


Labor, on the other hand, I am proud to say is steadfast in its position. Section 18C is good law. It has functioned well for two decades and it has protected our multicultural society. I remember growing up in the 1980s, when the word 'boong' was commonly directed at my Indigenous school peers. It is little wonder to me that they did not stay at school. I remember racist slurs against my Asian friends on the bus: 'gook, chink' were, again, all too common. I remain ashamed that I did not have the courage at the time to stand up for them. I have certainly witnessed how recently xenophobia and Islamophobia, some of it emanating from this very place, are driving racist sentiment and with it racist actions towards other Australians.


We have as much need as ever for the protections of 18C. We are all innately equal as people—however, this law undermines the principle of our universal equality as people in a couple of really problematic ways. The idea that 'harassment' is better than or even, frankly, equal to 'offend, insult and humiliate' as a legal test is ill founded. As the many Indigenous people and people of multicultural background have said, 'What is it you would like to be able to say that you're currently prohibited from saying?'


While the government may be able to draw on some high-profile individuals, as Senator Paterson highlighted, of diverse ethnic and racial backgrounds who are supporting changes in the law, I can highlight to the Senate today that that is not the case when it comes to mainstream ethnic and Indigenous Australia. Dr Soutphommasane said to estimates last week:


There will no doubt be a variety of opinion within many communities on this issue, as there would be on any other issue of public policy, but it is my considered assessment that, of representative community organisations covering multicultural, ethnic and Indigenous communities, an overwhelming number of them, if not uniformly the case, would not be comfortable with any weakening of the Racial Discrimination Act.


Currently, section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act reads:


(1) It is unlawful for a person to do an act, otherwise than in private, if


(a) the act is reasonably likely, in all the circumstances, to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate another person or a group of people; and


(b) the act is done because of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of the other person or of some or all of the people in the group.


The changing in the wording in the legislation before us reduces the protections that are afforded to victims of racial discrimination and racial hate speech by narrowing the scope of behaviour that may constitute offending conduct. The Federal Court has recognised the difficulties with 18C applying to 'offensive, insulting and humiliating acts' by interpreting it so that it only applies to 'profound and serious effects, not to be likened to mere slights.'


I remain equally confused as to why the government might choose try to remove the word 'humiliate' when controversy around this matter has generally only focused on the words 'offend and insult'. It is also unclear why the word 'harass' has been chosen instead of other options. We have had no opportunity to canvass these issues through the Senate committee. Legal practitioners and organisations have expressed their concern about how the word 'harass' will be defined. The Law Council made a plea to our committee raising concerns that it could denote proximity between two people and would not cover situations where racial hate speech is, for example, used in a media article. The changes would also result in a period of uncertainty about the scope of the new provision, which, I feel, is an irresponsible move by government.


In the new so-called objective test in 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, we see the introduction of a 'reasonable member of the Australian community' as the objective standard for determining a breach of 18C, instead of the test that the court currently applies of 'whether an act is reasonably likely in all of the circumstances' to have the relevant effect. Changing the test defining whether someone ought reasonably feel harassed by someone's actions from the target group at whom the insult or offensive action was directed at to a so-called 'ordinary person' who is not part of the group at whom the offence was directed is an extraordinary thing to do. 


On that note, I think it is worth highlighting that it is all too commonplace in our Australian society that racist talk does take place. I note specifically that it takes place often while the group that is targeted by such talk is not in the room. If no-one feels offended or takes offence on behalf of those who were the target of the offence, does that represent the new 'ordinary person' test? The court should, I feel, be able to take into account the relevant context—namely, the fact that racial vilification is directed towards people of a particular race. They need to be able to take this into account when assessing whether it is reasonably likely that a group would be offended, insulted, humiliated or intimidated. So the changes to 18C combined with the change in this objective test are a very insidious combination. 


I want to highlight some of the other changes in this bill—namely, the complaints-handling processes of the Australian Human Rights Commission as set out in the Australian Human Rights Commission Act. These changes have not been subject to proper consultation. The bill was introduced last Wednesday and it was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, of which I am a member. We tried to extend the time that we would have as a committee to look at these changes, but we were deprived of that opportunity. Our capacity within the Senate committees to look at these issues has been fundamentally undermined. 


No Indigenous Australian representative bodies were invited to appear before our committee. I did ask Senator Macdonald on Thursday evening—and I gave him forewarning that I wanted Indigenous organisations to be able to appear. However, the government majority deprived them of being able to give their evidence. This is a disgraceful example of arrogance on the part of this out-of-touch government. I note that both the Human Rights Law Centre and FECCA gave evidence at the hearing. Both groups talked about the importance of 18C and 18D. They gave a range of insightful evidence to the committee, including evidence relating to increased levels of racism, vilification and verbal abuse that has been occurring in the community—frankly, talk about 18C is giving licence to racist hate speech in the community. 


The public hearings also drew our attention to evidence from the Human Rights Commission about the flaws in the procedural changes. I note that the government has committed to amending schedule 2. I am not yet at liberty to see what changes the government is making. This is, again, a real demonstration of what is a fundamentally flawed and rushed process. In evidence before the committee, I saw an exchange between Senator Brandis and Professor Triggs, where essentially they were working out whether they would have time to sit down and look at further amendments to the bill. That kind of process, where discussion between the Human Rights Commission and the government itself was still taking place, has deprived members of the Senate of being able to consider what amendments they are putting forward. I do not know yet whether agreement has even be reached. 


The commission highlighted how a number of recommendations would result in additional red tape and would likely cause additional delay and added costs to parties to complaints, as well as impeding access to justice in relation to meritorious complaints. I know Labor has put forward amendments. We are yet to see if the Human Rights Commission's concerns will be addressed by the government and how our amendments may marry into the amendments put forward by the government. Again, it is another example of a flawed process. What I note here is that these changes will impact on thousands of complainants and respondents who use the commission's complaint-handling processes. Here again we have had a tiny bit of consultation around 18C. The previous inquiry that took place—I did not see consultation with disability groups, LGBTI organisations or women's organisations, who will all be affected. The universal changes to this legislation will change the nature of the way these things are managed for everybody, across all grounds. There has been no consultation with people about those matters. 


These issues need to be resolved, otherwise the government should withdraw them. I look forward to advice to the chamber about where these issues are up to. I can only hope that, after this legislation is dealt with, the folly of those on the other side in relation to this matter will be laid to rest. It is a sad fact that, while those on the other side of the chamber keep the door open on this debate, we are also opening the door to people's self-proclaimed—as Senator Brandis would put it—right to be a bigot. The effectiveness of our Racial Discrimination Act is founded on the fact that there is no such right. As a result of there being no such right, racist actions and racist language in our community is curtailed. The idea that racists have anything legitimate to say that deserves to be heard must be done away with once and for all. There can never and never should be a right in this country to be a bigot. I do not want my son to grow up in a country where people have the right to offend, insult or humiliate another person based on their race or frankly any other attribute.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2017-03-29,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (12:30):  Listening to the comments today on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017, I, like a lot of Australians, thought to myself: why are we taking up so much precious time in this parliament debating this issue? It is because political correctness over the years has shut us down from having an opinion or a say. The thought police have intervened. The lefties are out there shutting us down from having an opinion on most things, and this is where section 18C has come into play.


All I hear in this chamber are the words 'racist comments'. Let us define what 'racist' means. It means that you believe your race to be superior to another. Making a comment on an issue does not necessarily mean you are racist. They use that word because it is supposed to shut down debate. They have used it against me so many times over the years that it has become boring, and they do it without really debating the issue or what I am trying to say.


A lot of people think that because you are a white Australian you do not have racist comments directed at you. You might be surprised, but I have had racist comments said to me. But I let it go over the top of my head; it is water off a duck's back. It happened in 1996, when I went out to have a meeting with some Aboriginal elders. The media turned up, even though I had said the media were not to be there. I wanted to sit down and talk with these Aboriginal people. But it was set up and the media turned up. When I approached the elders, they called me 'white trash' and 'a pig in mud'. I was abused. I just turned and walked away. But next day The Courier Mail wrote up the story with 'white trash' and the 7.30 Report reported the story. It was filmed. I approached them and said, 'What do you think about this?'—not at the time, because I did not worry about it, but in a conversation later. They said 'So what?' There was no issue about it and they could not care less.


I think what has happened over time is that there is reverse racism in Australia. Australians are feeling the brunt of this and are fed up. That is why they are talking on talkback radio and amongst themselves. They are fed up with where the lefties have this debate going. Yes, there have been issues from the new migrants that came to Australia, especially after the Second World War. I have heard the terms that the Italians were called, such as eyeties or wogs. Those references were made. I actually mixed with Greeks and Italians at the fish markets. They were great mates of mine. We had talks and discussions. The older generation just chuckled and laughed it off. They got on and worked in with the Australians. Now it has gotten to the point in this country where you cannot even look sideways at anyone. We are all from different cultural backgrounds and races, but this is pushing us into segregation. That is how I see it. We have to start working together and stop being so precious that we cannot say anything to anyone.


Section 18C has the words 'offend', 'insult' and 'humiliate'. The other side says, 'What do you want to say that you can't say now?' But that is missing the whole point. It is not about what you want to say; it is about the right to have an opinion. I can look at someone of another culture and say, 'I don't particularly like your cultural dance,' or, 'I don't particularly like your cultural dress.' That might be a personal opinion that I have and they may be offended by it. Am I therefore, because of my personal opinion, supposed to be dragged before the Human Rights Commission under the Racial Discrimination Act? We have to get real here and stop putting these ideas into people's heads.


I go back to the students from the University of Queensland. Three students turned up to use a room which had a sign saying 'Aboriginals only'. That is racial discrimination in the first place. Why didn't those students go and report the head of the university, or whoever put that sign up, for racial discrimination in the first place? They did not. But they were accused. That is segregation. That is division. That is what is happening in our country. Australians have had at gutful and are sick and tired of it. This needs to change. Treat everyone on an individual basis, not on the basis of their race or the colour of their skin, and we will have a much more harmonious country.


A case was laid against me in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission by the Aboriginals. I will fill you in on why this happened. I stood for election in 1996. I was elected after being thrown out of the Liberal Party. Next day The Australianrang me up to for an interview. I did the interview and called for equality for all Australians. I made reference to the Greeks, the Italians and everyone. The Australian printed a headline the next day saying that Hanson refused to represent the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. For 18 months I was accused of this. It was a headline on the front page. It came up many times in interviews.


That was not the case. I was taken before the court and Sir Ronald Wilson, after listening to the full tape, came down with the finding that I never said anything racist whatsoever and that I was calling for equality for all Australians. A lot of people would not even think this to be the case, but I have worked with Aboriginal people over the years. I have had many come to my office asking for assistance. I work with these groups. I will work for, fight for and defend anyone, regardless of their cultural background. That is my job as a member of this parliament and a representative of the people of Queensland, and I have always been of that opinion. In light of that, I am also a very proud Australian. I am proud of my culture and my heritage. I welcome people who come to this country. I always have done. That is the way my parents brought me up. I respect people based not on their race or who they are but on how I find them and how they treat me.


I go back to these university students. The claim was that the woman or the teacher wanted $250,000. After the stressful time that the students went through and the cost to them of legal representation, she asked for $250,000. What was that going to do? How was that going to appease it? I see this as a process of monetary gain. That is what it is and that is what a lot of people using this are all about. It is for monetary gain, no other reason.


I had Gillian Triggs, the President of the Australian Human Rights Commission, in my office. She said to me: 'Section 18C needs to change. It needs to go.' She deals with this. She admits it. I think about section 18C. Sheikh Shady has said that AIDS is divine punishment and that women would be hung by their breasts in hell. What about those comments? Do I hear people from the Left screaming about these comments? I remember hearing one time that, with the way women dress in this country, it is nothing but a meat market and they deserve to be raped. Where is the Left, where are the greenies and where are the others screaming that this should not be said? 


What about signs of people speaking out against us the Australian people? Those on the other side of this house and on the crossbench are screaming for the rights of migrants and everyone else who comes to this country but they do not stand up for the Australian people. I do not want to see division in this country. I want to see everyone treated equally, on the same basis, and on a needs basis. That is what a lot of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders want as well. The laws that have been brought in here over the years are causing segregation and separatism. That is what we do not want. They do not want it. They do not want to be treated any differently. If we continue to make laws with that division, it is not going to be right or good for us. We are all Australians together.


I will go back to the wording in the bill. The wording is 'offend, insult, humiliate'. As I said earlier, anyone can take offence. Everyone has a different opinion on what may offend them. A lot of people get offended very easily, so then they are going to make their complaints. It says 'insult' and 'humiliate'. I support changing the words to 'harass' and 'intimidate'. We do not want that happening in our country. Some people do need that protection. I think the words 'offend, insult, humiliate' are too broad and it is up to the individual about how they feel about it.


This all comes down to the pub test: how does the average Aussie feel about this? That is what it is all about. I may raise issues that many Australians talk about in their kitchens and around their barbecues. They talk about them but do not come out openly and say anything. These are the people who voted for One Nation in the last election. That is why there are now four One Nation senators on the crossbench. If I were saying things that were offensive to the Australian people, we would not be here. They would not have voted for us. I represent a good majority of the Australian people. To have gotten three seats in the upper house in Western Australia just a couple of weeks ago is a clear indication that people want representation from One Nation.


We are here with an open mind, not to shut down the people but to give everyone from whatever race the right to have a say and an opinion and be part of this country, to join in, to be Australians. That is what we stand for. Shutting us down is not the answer. You call us racists and bigots. As I said, the word 'racist' means to believe your race to be superior to another. I have never, ever said that. I challenge anyone to show me anything I have said that has been racist. You use the word 'bigot'. There are many people—and I am sure everyone in this chamber—who are a bigot in their own way, because you can be intolerant of another person's culture or religious beliefs. That is the human race. That is who we are because we are proud of our cultural background. It is about having respect.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017</title>,BILLS,5,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2017-03-29,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:48):  While I am in the chamber speaking on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017,  I will give a shout out to the delegation of New Zealand parliamentarians that is in my office right now.


Yesterday, I was reminding people about what ANTaR had written in their submission to the inquiry by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights. They said:


Far from being a theoretical discussion, racial discrimination has a very real impact on mental health and wellbeing for First Peoples.


They said in their necessarily quick submission to the inquiry held last Friday:


Racism and discrimination contribute to poor mental health, increased self-harm and suicide, decreased school attendance and lower workplace productivity, and participation in society more broadly.


When releasing their reconciliation barometer earlier this year, which they do every two years—so this is using 2016 data—ANTaR said that the government needs to start looking at first people's lived experience of racism and leave the RDA protections untouched.


The national reconciliation barometer showed an increase of racism experienced by our first peoples. They found that racism towards first peoples has increased from 39 per cent to 46 per cent since the last barometer, in 2014. I remind people that the latest data was collected in 2016. That is a significant increase in racism towards our first peoples. They found that one in three Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people had experienced verbal racial abuse in the six months before the survey. The anecdotal feedback from a number of Aboriginal people I have spoken to is that it certainly has not gotten any better since then. In fact, it may have gotten even worse. Given the negative impact on health and wellbeing of racism, if we are going to close the gap it is absolutely vital that we maintain protections against racial discrimination. In other words, racial discrimination has a direct impact on people's wellbeing, and we need to address that if we are ever going to close the gap by our agreed target dates.


To say the community's support for retaining the current wording of section 18C is overwhelming is an understatement. We know that racial discrimination and vilification remains a major challenge in Australia, and the barometer pointed that out. If anything, that challenge is growing. The Scanlon Foundation's most recent report found that the proportion of Australians who have experienced racism in the past 12 months has grown to 20 per cent. That is one in five Australians.


We only have to observe the general tenor of comments online, under news reports, on social media and in forums, to see that a significant number of people in this country currently feel very free to unleash racist, bigoted, Islamophobic and anti-Semitic diatribes in public. We only need to read one of the countless experiences recounted in submissions to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights inquiry into section 18C to know that racism remains an ever-present problem. We must be especially vigilant now that a significant proportion of our community has been energised by the election of Donald Trump. People have responded by feeling much freer to be racist in that environment.


If you have never experienced racial discrimination or abuse, you only need to listen to those Australians who have. They know how utterly destructive to a person's sense of self it is. If you listen to people, listen to their experiences, you know it is having a significant impact on that person's sense of self. To be so often attacked about something as arbitrary as the colour of your skin or the clothes that you wear or the country of one's birth is just utter nonsense. So it is in this environment of rampant xenophobia, of racist trolls, of growing experiences of racial abuse and discrimination—you only had to listen to Senator McKim reading out those tweets under #freedomofspeech last week to know of the dozens and dozens and dozens of experiences that people were reporting of abuse. We only have to look at those experiences to ask the question: what does the government seek to achieve by these changes? Why are they trying to make it easier for people to be racist? Why are they sending this signal to the community that it is okay to launch racist diatribes at people?


These zombie measures should not succeed. We should finally put them to bed—in fact kill them off. Why does the other side of this chamber, the government, continue to pretend this is about freedom of speech? I really do not understand just how it is that people like the Attorney-General, like Senator Abetz, like Senator Paterson want to be able to say what they already say. Let us take their argument at face value and assume that they are all currently being muzzled by swathes of politically correct red tape that prevents them from truly expressing themselves. I am not aware of any principle of libertarianism that seriously proposes that freedom of speech is or should be an absolute or unfettered freedom. We have always accepted legitimate restrictions on our freedom to say exactly what we would like to say. We all seem to accept laws that protect us against reputational damage—libel or slander—or that protect us from violent threats. The basic principle of libertarianism is that we should all be free to do or say whatever we want to the point that our expression of freedoms cause genuine and unjustified harm to others, such as, for example, what I described about the impact on our First People's mental health and wellbeing.


I do not think anybody seriously accepts that racism does not cause genuine harm. As I have outlined, it clearly does. That is the whole basis of the Racial Discrimination Act itself, which is our acquittal of our international legal duty under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. It is genuinely difficult to decipher the argument of the small number of right-wingers in their own little echo chamber that want these changes. We hear them froth and rant about the words 'insult' and 'offend' and declare that there is no right to not be offended, that causing offence is central to the principle of freedom of speech. But they ignore the fact that the words 'insult' and 'offend' have been applied very strictly in the courts. It seems to me they just want to be able to make unfettered racial comments and to abuse people.


Australia is the most successful multicultural nation on the planet. Multiculturalism is what we do better than anywhere else in the world. It is our great advantage; it underpins so much of our ongoing peace and prosperity. It is a large part of why so many people want to visit here and why so many people in fact want to come here to live, to migrate here. We have just started a Senate committee inquiry into how we can strengthen Australia's multiculturalism even further. We know, even before it starts, that multiculturalism is an asset for all of us.


In technical terms, sections 18C and 18D of the Racial Discrimination Act established the legal case to be applied by the Australian Human Rights Commission and the courts when assessing complaints about racial hate speech. But section 18C is also highly symbolic. It represents our continued commitment to multicultural harmony. It sets the absolute minimum conditions for public engagement in our overwhelmingly successful multicultural society. I just do not see why this small group of hard Right, Dad's Army opponents of 18C want so badly to attack it. Hundreds of people have spoken to us in the last few weeks and months about racial hate speech, and about the continued need to protect Australians against it. I am sure every senator in this place has in fact had many phone calls and emails about that, and other personal communications and meetings.


There are some people in our country who are genuinely afraid of the tenor of some of our public debate and where it might lead in the future—and, again, I have had multiple conversations exactly along those lines. There are many, many Australians who have experienced just what can happen when racial hate speech gets out of control. Rightly, Australia is seen as an oasis of peace away from the hatreds that have been allowed by the political leaders to bubble up in other places. Our Racial Discrimination Act underpins that peace. For very good reason it had bipartisan and then tripartisan support until very recently, when this small group of people who do not represent broader Australia and their opinion, as has been evidenced by many, sprung up, with the support of some media outlets, to run their campaign to undermine our Racial Discrimination Act.


But we Greens will not support it. We will stand in opposition to their moves to undermine the act and undermine section 18C. We will stand firm with millions of Australians who live and work and breathe our wonderful, multicultural reality every day. We will continue to work with them to strengthen our community, not divide our community. We say no to racism, and we say no to the changes that in fact will undermine our multicultural society.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,5,2
"Paterson, Sen James",LP,2017-03-29,"



Senator PATERSON
 (Victoria) (12:00):  I have had the privilege of contributing to this debate on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017 a number of times in this chamber, so I will not go over too much old ground today. I will not go over the arguments about the importance of freedom of speech. I will not go over the evidence that the administration of section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975 by the Human Rights Commission has been incredibly flawed. I will not go over the recent cases that show the harmful impact that this law has had on journalists, cartoonists and students.


There are two things I want to do today. The first is to respond to an argument made by Senator Siewert which has become a bit of a catchcry of those who are opposed to changes to 18C. They like to ask, 'What is it that you would like to say that you cannot say under this law but you would be able to say if the law changes?' It is a question they ask often. It is a question that they assert is not answered and has not been answered, but the only way they could have that view is if they have not been actually listening to those who have a different view in this debate, if they have not been following the work of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights on this issue and if they have not been following the debate closely, because this question has been answered, and I am happy to answer it today.


It is a question that Senator McKim asked at the human rights committee hearings, which we very much enjoyed participating in together around Australia. He asked it at every hearing that I attended except one. That was the Brisbane hearing. Senator McKim was not able to be in Brisbane for the Brisbane hearing, and that was a shame because there was a witness at the Brisbane hearing who had a very good answer to that question. His name is Alex Wood. He is a former student at the Queensland University of Technology, and he was one of the respondents in the QUT case. Alex had heard this question was being asked, including in the hearings, so he came prepared to answer it. Unfortunately, he was not asked it by Senator McKim, because he was not able to be there, but he was asked it and he did answer it. He said that the thing that he would like to say that he is not able to say under the current law is that his university, QUT, is 'stopping segregation with segregation'. That is in fact what Alex Wood did say on Facebook on the day that he was kicked out of an unsigned Indigenous computer lab at his university.


It took Alex 3½ years and a torturous legal process, which has disrupted his life, had a severe financial impact on him and his family and the other people involved in this case and potentially damaged his career, to finally establish—after this torturous 3½-year process—that in fact he could legally say that, but not without going through that process. If there are those that argue that we should not be able to say that, fair enough, but I think it is very difficult to argue that it is fair or necessary that someone like Alex Wood should have to go through that process to establish that he should be able to say that.


The main purpose for my contribution to the debate today on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017 is to address one issue that I have not specifically addressed in detail in this debate so far, and that is the argument that those in favour of changing 18C, such as me, fit certain demographic attributes. It has been pointed out that some of us who are advocates of change to 18C are white. It has also been pointed out that some of us are men. And it has also been pointed out that we are men of a certain age. I think I may fail to qualify on that final category, but I certainly qualify on the former two categories. It is said that, because we are white men of a certain age, we have not experienced discrimination, and therefore we should be much more careful in advocating this change.


It is something I have considered carefully, and I have two ways in which I would like to respond to that. The first is that freedom of speech is a right of every Australian, and every Australian has an equal right to participate in the debate about free speech and to advocate sincerely for their point of view on free speech. Your gender, your race and your age have no bearing on your right as an Australian citizen to participate freely in public debate.


The second thing I would say, though, is that a corollary of this argument is the statement that is often made that ethnic communities are united in opposition to changing this law. It is certainly true, and we heard during the committee process, that many of the peak bodies that represent ethnic communities are opposed to and are concerned about changes to this law. But I believe it is incredibly patronising and condescending to not realise that there is active debate within many ethnic communities, as there is in every community on every public policy issue, and that there is a great diversity of opinion within ethnic communities on the desirability of change to 18C. I believe that those who are saying that ethnic communities are united and monolithic in opposition to this either have not been paying attention and have not been listening to the ethnic voices who are in favour of change or have decided to ignore those voices because they are inconvenient for their arguments. Either way, I think that is wrong and does not do these advocates of change justice.


That is one thing I would like to correct today by taking the opportunity to read into the Hansard the words of some of those people who have experienced discrimination in their lives, have been on the receiving end of racism, but nevertheless strongly and passionately support freedom of speech and strongly support the case for change in this law. The first is a gentleman by the name of Gideon Rozner. In the interests of full disclosure: he is an employee of my former employer, the Institute of Public Affairs, and a friend. He is also a Jewish man. He wrote in the Herald Sun in December 2016:


… many Jewish Australians, myself included, share the same concerns about 18C as an increasing number of people in the wider community. Specifically, that banning forms of expression merely because they are ""insulting"" or ""offensive"" is inherently incompatible with the right to free speech.


He goes on to say:


… the open and free society that we enjoy is as fragile as it is precious. It relies on fundamental civil and political rights, not least of all the freedom of speech.


Robert Magid, the publisher of The Australian Jewish News, wrote on 15 September 2016 in his publication:


The point about free speech, for which, over centuries, many have died, is the right to disagree. As Bob Dylan sings: 'You're right from your side and I'm right from mine.'


One man's bigot is another man's courageous defender of what many decent people think and feel. It is in the nature of satirists, comedians and cartoonists to exaggerate and very often offend. Inevitably they end up being called bigots as in the recent case of Bill Leak, one of the least bigoted people I know. Should these critics of society be looking over their shoulder to see whether the sheriff is about to take them on a perp walk?


To them it is Section 18C which is intimidating. It is not only the legal definition that is in question, but the public perception that criticising behaviour of another people in a way that might insult and offend can lead to litigation.


Dr David Adler was a powerful witness before the human rights committee. He is a member of the Sydney Jewish community, and he believes that Jewish communal organisations have not reflected well the diversity of opinion in his community. He cited, in support of his evidence, other prominent Jews who feel same way as he does, such as lawyer Geoffrey Bloch; former judge Jim Spigelman; and the New South Wales Rabbinical Council, which has been concerned about this law and is in favour of changing it. He wrote in The Spectator Australiaon 11 March this year:


What 18C does is to unreasonably constrain free speech in a manner inconsistent with Jewish theology, academic development and values. There is no evidence that 18C is an effective tool in changing a trend of anti-Semitism (there are much more effective tools) and such a law risks serious adverse consequences.


There have also been a number of prominent Indigenous advocates for change, such as Warren Mundine, Anthony Dillon and Wesley Aird. I want to quote two advocates for change who I think have contributed very powerfully to this debate. Kerryn Pholi, who is an Indigenous woman, also writing in The Spectator Australia on 26 April 2014, said:


I hereby demand freedom from protection from this thing we call 'racial vilification'. I do not wish to be protected from the opinions of others. I demand the right to hear the views that other people may wish to express about me. I want this because I do not see how forcing others to shield their true opinion is of any benefit to me. Rather, it infantilises me by suggesting that I cannot handle the ugliness of life. Silencing or concealing the ugliness also exposes me to unnecessary risk, since if all others were free to express their views openly, I could at least make more informed choices about whom to associate with and whom to avoid. 


Jacinta Price, a councillor on the Alice Springs Town Council, wrote in The Australian on2 February this year:


The Racial Discrimination Act's 18C treats us Aboriginal Australians as infants who can't speak or stand up for ourselves. It treats non-Aboriginal people as if they have no right to hold an opinion about anything that relates to us, especially the problems of our own making that are killing us.


…   …   …


The way to beat racism is through debate, not the closing down of debate.


Another advocate for change is Irene Moss. She is a significant advocate for change for a number of reasons. Yes, she is a woman with Chinese heritage, but she is also a former Race Discrimination Commissioner, and it was her inquiry in 1991 that in part led to the adoption of section 18C and is often cited as a justification for the adoption of section 18C. But Irene Moss does not agree. She believes that 18C is in need of reform. In an interview with Chris Merritt from The Australianon 6 March this year, she said, of the law adopted in 1994:


It had 'ignored the inquiry’s warnings that an offence which was drafted too broadly could lead to trivial complaints and confusion'. 'The current controversy with respect to section 18C was predictable,' she said.


She is in favour of reform which removes 'offend', 'insult' and 'humiliate' from the law, which is strikingly similar to what the government has proposed. She said:


'In 1991, the report of the national inquiry into racist violence recommended that the legislation should not be about hurt feelings or injured sensibilities but should focus on incitement to racial hostility …


'I continue to believe that that … was essentially correct.'


Opponents of the bill might feel it is easy to dismiss my view or the views of Senator Smith or other colleagues in this place who do not meet the right demographic criteria, according to them, in order to have the right to participate in this debate. They may disagree with people like Irene Moss, Warren Mundine, Anthony Dillon, Wesley Aird, Jacinta Price, Kerryn Pholi, Gideon Rozner, Robert Magid, David Adler, Geoffrey Bloch and Jim Spigelman, and they are entitled to. But they should at least have the decency to recognise the great diversity of thought and opinion within our ethnic communities. 


I would encourage them to consider that, around the world, limitations on free speech generally have been aimed at minority groups, not at benefiting them, and have come at their great cost many times throughout history. Freedom of speech—the ability to freely debate ideas and stand up for the things we believe in—has always been the best guarantor of a tolerant and harmonious liberal society. It is what has helped Australia be as tolerant, harmonious and prosperous as it is today. It is what helps other countries around the world which share our values reflect that same tolerance and harmony.


I believe that the government's bill strikes the right balance in ensuring that we do have free speech—that people, whatever their background, have the right to stand up and say what they believe and argue sincerely in favour of it, and that it remains unlawful to abuse someone on the basis of their race, as it should be.

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,5,2
"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2017-03-29,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (12:13):  I rise to speak on the government's Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017. However, I do find it somewhat ironic that its title is 'human rights legislation'. Labor made its choice long ago, and that choice was to stand with multicultural Australia and stand against bigotry. It was Labor that introduced both section 18C and section 18D, and we will always stand firm in protecting them.


Sadly, our Prime Minister seems to have made another decision. He has chosen to fundamentally undermine the provisions of sections 18C and 18D, despite his promises not to. All this will do is make it easier for people to insult or humiliate others on the basis of their race. It is galling to me that the government chose Harmony Day last week to outline their plans to weaken protections against racism in our country.


Sections 18C and 18D were introduced by the Keating government in response to a number of reports on racial violence, including the national inquiry into racist violence by former race discrimination commissioner Irene Moss and the great Australian lawyer Ron Castan QC. It was also in response to royal commissions and other inquiries into our international obligations. 


These provisions are designed to capture not only harassment but also broader campaigns and factions of racial humiliation offence and abuse. Sections 18C and 18D have been established for all the right reasons, and 18C has embodied Australia's condemnation of racial vilification and protected our society from the poisonous effects of hate speech, so they should be protected. At the same time, 18D has operated to protect free speech by providing exemptions for artistic works, scientific debate and fair comment on matters of public interest, providing they are said or done reasonably and in good faith.


It is notable to me that, as Professor Triggs highlighted to our Senate committee last week, with the Bill Leak cartoon that has been so much of the motivating force that has brought us into this debate today an 18D application was never made. It is clear that the government in putting this legislation forward has not been listening to people who have experienced racism.


The idea of moving to a definition of 'harassment' seems to have been put forward by, as far as I can tell, only one member of the joint committee that inquired into this matter. The fact we have this legislation before us at all is a testament to the fact that the coalition has been held captive to a right-wing agenda that is completely out of touch with the lived experience of Australians who have experienced racism and, for that matter, with the priorities of the broader Australian population, who would prefer their politicians to be thinking about creating jobs, quality public services, education and training, and more. Section 18C has been an ideological obsession of the right wing of the Liberal-National Party, which sadly our Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, is too weak to do anything about. Let us not forget that Tony Abbott also tried to introduce these laws when he was Prime Minister.


Labor, on the other hand, I am proud to say is steadfast in its position. Section 18C is good law. It has functioned well for two decades and it has protected our multicultural society. I remember growing up in the 1980s, when the word 'boong' was commonly directed at my Indigenous school peers. It is little wonder to me that they did not stay at school. I remember racist slurs against my Asian friends on the bus: 'gook, chink' were, again, all too common. I remain ashamed that I did not have the courage at the time to stand up for them. I have certainly witnessed how recently xenophobia and Islamophobia, some of it emanating from this very place, are driving racist sentiment and with it racist actions towards other Australians.


We have as much need as ever for the protections of 18C. We are all innately equal as people—however, this law undermines the principle of our universal equality as people in a couple of really problematic ways. The idea that 'harassment' is better than or even, frankly, equal to 'offend, insult and humiliate' as a legal test is ill founded. As the many Indigenous people and people of multicultural background have said, 'What is it you would like to be able to say that you're currently prohibited from saying?'


While the government may be able to draw on some high-profile individuals, as Senator Paterson highlighted, of diverse ethnic and racial backgrounds who are supporting changes in the law, I can highlight to the Senate today that that is not the case when it comes to mainstream ethnic and Indigenous Australia. Dr Soutphommasane said to estimates last week:


There will no doubt be a variety of opinion within many communities on this issue, as there would be on any other issue of public policy, but it is my considered assessment that, of representative community organisations covering multicultural, ethnic and Indigenous communities, an overwhelming number of them, if not uniformly the case, would not be comfortable with any weakening of the Racial Discrimination Act.


Currently, section 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act reads:


(1) It is unlawful for a person to do an act, otherwise than in private, if


(a) the act is reasonably likely, in all the circumstances, to offend, insult, humiliate or intimidate another person or a group of people; and


(b) the act is done because of the race, colour or national or ethnic origin of the other person or of some or all of the people in the group.


The changing in the wording in the legislation before us reduces the protections that are afforded to victims of racial discrimination and racial hate speech by narrowing the scope of behaviour that may constitute offending conduct. The Federal Court has recognised the difficulties with 18C applying to 'offensive, insulting and humiliating acts' by interpreting it so that it only applies to 'profound and serious effects, not to be likened to mere slights.'


I remain equally confused as to why the government might choose try to remove the word 'humiliate' when controversy around this matter has generally only focused on the words 'offend and insult'. It is also unclear why the word 'harass' has been chosen instead of other options. We have had no opportunity to canvass these issues through the Senate committee. Legal practitioners and organisations have expressed their concern about how the word 'harass' will be defined. The Law Council made a plea to our committee raising concerns that it could denote proximity between two people and would not cover situations where racial hate speech is, for example, used in a media article. The changes would also result in a period of uncertainty about the scope of the new provision, which, I feel, is an irresponsible move by government.


In the new so-called objective test in 18C of the Racial Discrimination Act, we see the introduction of a 'reasonable member of the Australian community' as the objective standard for determining a breach of 18C, instead of the test that the court currently applies of 'whether an act is reasonably likely in all of the circumstances' to have the relevant effect. Changing the test defining whether someone ought reasonably feel harassed by someone's actions from the target group at whom the insult or offensive action was directed at to a so-called 'ordinary person' who is not part of the group at whom the offence was directed is an extraordinary thing to do. 


On that note, I think it is worth highlighting that it is all too commonplace in our Australian society that racist talk does take place. I note specifically that it takes place often while the group that is targeted by such talk is not in the room. If no-one feels offended or takes offence on behalf of those who were the target of the offence, does that represent the new 'ordinary person' test? The court should, I feel, be able to take into account the relevant context—namely, the fact that racial vilification is directed towards people of a particular race. They need to be able to take this into account when assessing whether it is reasonably likely that a group would be offended, insulted, humiliated or intimidated. So the changes to 18C combined with the change in this objective test are a very insidious combination. 


I want to highlight some of the other changes in this bill—namely, the complaints-handling processes of the Australian Human Rights Commission as set out in the Australian Human Rights Commission Act. These changes have not been subject to proper consultation. The bill was introduced last Wednesday and it was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, of which I am a member. We tried to extend the time that we would have as a committee to look at these changes, but we were deprived of that opportunity. Our capacity within the Senate committees to look at these issues has been fundamentally undermined. 


No Indigenous Australian representative bodies were invited to appear before our committee. I did ask Senator Macdonald on Thursday evening—and I gave him forewarning that I wanted Indigenous organisations to be able to appear. However, the government majority deprived them of being able to give their evidence. This is a disgraceful example of arrogance on the part of this out-of-touch government. I note that both the Human Rights Law Centre and FECCA gave evidence at the hearing. Both groups talked about the importance of 18C and 18D. They gave a range of insightful evidence to the committee, including evidence relating to increased levels of racism, vilification and verbal abuse that has been occurring in the community—frankly, talk about 18C is giving licence to racist hate speech in the community. 


The public hearings also drew our attention to evidence from the Human Rights Commission about the flaws in the procedural changes. I note that the government has committed to amending schedule 2. I am not yet at liberty to see what changes the government is making. This is, again, a real demonstration of what is a fundamentally flawed and rushed process. In evidence before the committee, I saw an exchange between Senator Brandis and Professor Triggs, where essentially they were working out whether they would have time to sit down and look at further amendments to the bill. That kind of process, where discussion between the Human Rights Commission and the government itself was still taking place, has deprived members of the Senate of being able to consider what amendments they are putting forward. I do not know yet whether agreement has even be reached. 


The commission highlighted how a number of recommendations would result in additional red tape and would likely cause additional delay and added costs to parties to complaints, as well as impeding access to justice in relation to meritorious complaints. I know Labor has put forward amendments. We are yet to see if the Human Rights Commission's concerns will be addressed by the government and how our amendments may marry into the amendments put forward by the government. Again, it is another example of a flawed process. What I note here is that these changes will impact on thousands of complainants and respondents who use the commission's complaint-handling processes. Here again we have had a tiny bit of consultation around 18C. The previous inquiry that took place—I did not see consultation with disability groups, LGBTI organisations or women's organisations, who will all be affected. The universal changes to this legislation will change the nature of the way these things are managed for everybody, across all grounds. There has been no consultation with people about those matters. 


These issues need to be resolved, otherwise the government should withdraw them. I look forward to advice to the chamber about where these issues are up to. I can only hope that, after this legislation is dealt with, the folly of those on the other side in relation to this matter will be laid to rest. It is a sad fact that, while those on the other side of the chamber keep the door open on this debate, we are also opening the door to people's self-proclaimed—as Senator Brandis would put it—right to be a bigot. The effectiveness of our Racial Discrimination Act is founded on the fact that there is no such right. As a result of there being no such right, racist actions and racist language in our community is curtailed. The idea that racists have anything legitimate to say that deserves to be heard must be done away with once and for all. There can never and never should be a right in this country to be a bigot. I do not want my son to grow up in a country where people have the right to offend, insult or humiliate another person based on their race or frankly any other attribute.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2017-03-29,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (12:30):  Listening to the comments today on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 2017, I, like a lot of Australians, thought to myself: why are we taking up so much precious time in this parliament debating this issue? It is because political correctness over the years has shut us down from having an opinion or a say. The thought police have intervened. The lefties are out there shutting us down from having an opinion on most things, and this is where section 18C has come into play.


All I hear in this chamber are the words 'racist comments'. Let us define what 'racist' means. It means that you believe your race to be superior to another. Making a comment on an issue does not necessarily mean you are racist. They use that word because it is supposed to shut down debate. They have used it against me so many times over the years that it has become boring, and they do it without really debating the issue or what I am trying to say.


A lot of people think that because you are a white Australian you do not have racist comments directed at you. You might be surprised, but I have had racist comments said to me. But I let it go over the top of my head; it is water off a duck's back. It happened in 1996, when I went out to have a meeting with some Aboriginal elders. The media turned up, even though I had said the media were not to be there. I wanted to sit down and talk with these Aboriginal people. But it was set up and the media turned up. When I approached the elders, they called me 'white trash' and 'a pig in mud'. I was abused. I just turned and walked away. But next day The Courier Mail wrote up the story with 'white trash' and the 7.30 Report reported the story. It was filmed. I approached them and said, 'What do you think about this?'—not at the time, because I did not worry about it, but in a conversation later. They said 'So what?' There was no issue about it and they could not care less.


I think what has happened over time is that there is reverse racism in Australia. Australians are feeling the brunt of this and are fed up. That is why they are talking on talkback radio and amongst themselves. They are fed up with where the lefties have this debate going. Yes, there have been issues from the new migrants that came to Australia, especially after the Second World War. I have heard the terms that the Italians were called, such as eyeties or wogs. Those references were made. I actually mixed with Greeks and Italians at the fish markets. They were great mates of mine. We had talks and discussions. The older generation just chuckled and laughed it off. They got on and worked in with the Australians. Now it has gotten to the point in this country where you cannot even look sideways at anyone. We are all from different cultural backgrounds and races, but this is pushing us into segregation. That is how I see it. We have to start working together and stop being so precious that we cannot say anything to anyone.


Section 18C has the words 'offend', 'insult' and 'humiliate'. The other side says, 'What do you want to say that you can't say now?' But that is missing the whole point. It is not about what you want to say; it is about the right to have an opinion. I can look at someone of another culture and say, 'I don't particularly like your cultural dance,' or, 'I don't particularly like your cultural dress.' That might be a personal opinion that I have and they may be offended by it. Am I therefore, because of my personal opinion, supposed to be dragged before the Human Rights Commission under the Racial Discrimination Act? We have to get real here and stop putting these ideas into people's heads.


I go back to the students from the University of Queensland. Three students turned up to use a room which had a sign saying 'Aboriginals only'. That is racial discrimination in the first place. Why didn't those students go and report the head of the university, or whoever put that sign up, for racial discrimination in the first place? They did not. But they were accused. That is segregation. That is division. That is what is happening in our country. Australians have had at gutful and are sick and tired of it. This needs to change. Treat everyone on an individual basis, not on the basis of their race or the colour of their skin, and we will have a much more harmonious country.


A case was laid against me in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission by the Aboriginals. I will fill you in on why this happened. I stood for election in 1996. I was elected after being thrown out of the Liberal Party. Next day The Australianrang me up to for an interview. I did the interview and called for equality for all Australians. I made reference to the Greeks, the Italians and everyone. The Australian printed a headline the next day saying that Hanson refused to represent the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. For 18 months I was accused of this. It was a headline on the front page. It came up many times in interviews.


That was not the case. I was taken before the court and Sir Ronald Wilson, after listening to the full tape, came down with the finding that I never said anything racist whatsoever and that I was calling for equality for all Australians. A lot of people would not even think this to be the case, but I have worked with Aboriginal people over the years. I have had many come to my office asking for assistance. I work with these groups. I will work for, fight for and defend anyone, regardless of their cultural background. That is my job as a member of this parliament and a representative of the people of Queensland, and I have always been of that opinion. In light of that, I am also a very proud Australian. I am proud of my culture and my heritage. I welcome people who come to this country. I always have done. That is the way my parents brought me up. I respect people based not on their race or who they are but on how I find them and how they treat me.


I go back to these university students. The claim was that the woman or the teacher wanted $250,000. After the stressful time that the students went through and the cost to them of legal representation, she asked for $250,000. What was that going to do? How was that going to appease it? I see this as a process of monetary gain. That is what it is and that is what a lot of people using this are all about. It is for monetary gain, no other reason.


I had Gillian Triggs, the President of the Australian Human Rights Commission, in my office. She said to me: 'Section 18C needs to change. It needs to go.' She deals with this. She admits it. I think about section 18C. Sheikh Shady has said that AIDS is divine punishment and that women would be hung by their breasts in hell. What about those comments? Do I hear people from the Left screaming about these comments? I remember hearing one time that, with the way women dress in this country, it is nothing but a meat market and they deserve to be raped. Where is the Left, where are the greenies and where are the others screaming that this should not be said? 


What about signs of people speaking out against us the Australian people? Those on the other side of this house and on the crossbench are screaming for the rights of migrants and everyone else who comes to this country but they do not stand up for the Australian people. I do not want to see division in this country. I want to see everyone treated equally, on the same basis, and on a needs basis. That is what a lot of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders want as well. The laws that have been brought in here over the years are causing segregation and separatism. That is what we do not want. They do not want it. They do not want to be treated any differently. If we continue to make laws with that division, it is not going to be right or good for us. We are all Australians together.


I will go back to the wording in the bill. The wording is 'offend, insult, humiliate'. As I said earlier, anyone can take offence. Everyone has a different opinion on what may offend them. A lot of people get offended very easily, so then they are going to make their complaints. It says 'insult' and 'humiliate'. I support changing the words to 'harass' and 'intimidate'. We do not want that happening in our country. Some people do need that protection. I think the words 'offend, insult, humiliate' are too broad and it is up to the individual about how they feel about it.


This all comes down to the pub test: how does the average Aussie feel about this? That is what it is all about. I may raise issues that many Australians talk about in their kitchens and around their barbecues. They talk about them but do not come out openly and say anything. These are the people who voted for One Nation in the last election. That is why there are now four One Nation senators on the crossbench. If I were saying things that were offensive to the Australian people, we would not be here. They would not have voted for us. I represent a good majority of the Australian people. To have gotten three seats in the upper house in Western Australia just a couple of weeks ago is a clear indication that people want representation from One Nation.


We are here with an open mind, not to shut down the people but to give everyone from whatever race the right to have a say and an opinion and be part of this country, to join in, to be Australians. That is what we stand for. Shutting us down is not the answer. You call us racists and bigots. As I said, the word 'racist' means to believe your race to be superior to another. I have never, ever said that. I challenge anyone to show me anything I have said that has been racist. You use the word 'bigot'. There are many people—and I am sure everyone in this chamber—who are a bigot in their own way, because you can be intolerant of another person's culture or religious beliefs. That is the human race. That is who we are because we are proud of our cultural background. It is about having respect.

"Back, Sen Chris",LP,2017-03-29,"



Senator BACK
 (Western Australia) (12:45):  I rise to reflect today on the value of the resources sector in this country historically, in the present day and going forward. Historically, we often forget the importance of the resources sector in each of our then colonies and now states, such as your own then colony of Victoria, Mr Acting Deputy President Marshall. There was an influx of people in the 1840s and 1850s into Bendigo and Ballarat, chasing gold. They came from all around the world—China, America, Ireland and England et cetera. When you look at Queensland, for example, there is the Maranoa, with its rich gas fields; the Surat Basin; the Bowen Basin; and the Galilee Basin, which is soon to be opened up. Tasmania's economy was for a long time dependent on mining on the west coast. Savage River in the north of that area is a very rich iron ore deposit. In South Australia, Olympic Dam is underpinning the economy of that state, with its mining activities. In the home state of Senators Cash, Smith and me, again, historically, when gold reduced on the Victorian fields, many Victorians came across to Coolgardie, Kalgoorlie and Norseman. Indeed, it is a fact that Western Australia would not have joined the Federation had it not been for the overwhelming number of Victorians who said, 'If you don't support Federation, we'll form our own state.' It was that that caused Winthrop Hackett of The Western Australian newspaper and Sir John Forrest to urge that we did join the Federation, and that is why Western Australia is not named in the early words of the Constitution. The goldfields continue. The Golden Mile is still one of the biggest gold producers; indeed, it has one of the largest open cut goldmines in the world. More recently, over the last 30 to 40 years, there has been the opening up of the Pilbara, Mount Newman and, on the coast, oil and gas activities. 


I had the privilege last evening of attending the Minerals Council of Australia 50th anniversary function and the launch by Professor Ian Harper of the Deloitte Access Economic review into mining and into what they call the METS—the mining, equipment, technology and services sector in this country. I commend this report because of its importance, not historically now but in the present day and going forward. I think these figures are remarkable. I will quote them from the Deloitte Access Economics report:


The total economic contribution of Australia’s mining and METS sector in 2015-16 was $236.8 billion, representing around 15% of the Australian economy. This economic activity supported a total of 1,139,768 FTE jobs across Australia, which represents around 10% of total FTE employment.


That was for the last full financial year. It goes on to say that, in the Pilbara of WA, total economic activity of mining and METS was just under $38 billion, representing 88 per cent of its activity. In the Surat-Bowen basin in Queensland, it was $18.6 billion, representing 63 per cent of regional economic activity. In the Hunter region of New South Wales, the total economic contribution from mining and METS was $15.2 billion, representing a third of economic activity. Let me repeat that figure because I think it is remarkable: in 2015-16, the contribution of the mining and METS sector was $237 billion, representing 15 per cent of the economy and 1.4 million FTE jobs across the country. 


Another point being made in the Deloitte Access Economics report is that, whilst productivity is phenomenal, we must ceaselessly move to increase productivity. Again, I made the point only recently in this place that BHP Billiton and Rio Tinto are the two biggest taxpayers in this nation. When royalties and resource rent taxes were taken into account two years ago, BHP Billiton paid more than US$8.7 billion to the Australian government and state governments, particularly our own, representing a tax rate of 47 per cent. Their tax rate is 47 per cent. In 2015, Rio Tinto  paid in excess of $1.5 billion in tax and another $1.4 billion in royalties to either the federal or the state governments. It is critically important that we in Australia understand the importance of the resources sector and, indeed, the fact that it underpins regional activity in Australia. The report goes on to say that in the Hunter Valley, there were 94,000 jobs in 2015-16 from the resources sector. In Queensland, in the Bowen-Surat basin, there were 100,000 jobs alone. In the Pilbara, there were 93,800 jobs from that sector. If we are to see continuing value to the Australian economy, continuing value for employment, particularly high-value employment, we must extend the productive life of mines. We must get better yields. We must continue to drive occupational health and safety and wellbeing and, of course, we must continue to apply the knowledge of research.


For those who have had the opportunity of going to both BHP and Rio's facilities in Perth to watch the management of mine sites, the loading of trains, the conduct and transport of freight, the actual loading onto ships, all done automatically from Perth—from St Georges Terrace, in the case of BHP—and the Perth airport, it just shows the level to which Australian resource technology is at the forefront.


We know this when we speak about other countries in which mining activities are undertaken. We know that most of the mining activity in Africa is managed from within one kilometre of the Premier's office in West Perth. In Panama, it is not known, the world's largest copper mine is being built by Western Australian expertise through First Quantum. Our opportunities in Mexico, particularly for mining drilling and equipment, are absolutely legendary. For young Australians, for high-value employment and export, the opportunities in that sector are enormous.


In the few minutes left available to me, I will reflect on the comments of the head of Chevron, Mr Nigel Hearne, made on 21 March and the US$100 billion Gorgon and Wheatstone projects. I like to compare that US$100 billion to the total value of the Snowy Mountains scheme if it were built today: it would be A$9 billion—less than 10 per cent of Gorgon and Wheatstone. What will these two projects, alone, deliver to the Australian economy over the 30-year life of Gorgon and Wheatstone? They will deliver more than US$1 trillion to Australia's GDP. That is 150,000 full-time equivalent high-paying jobs over that 30-year lifetime and about $340 billion to the federal revenues of this country. You can double that figure when you look at other LNG projects either underway or planned.


In this country we must have good laws. We must have a fair taxation scheme. We must have a capacity to compete with the rest of the world, because it is a highly competitive world in which we live. In conclusion, I do recommend, to those listening who may have an interest, Deloitte Access Economics' review launched last night into the value of the resources sector in this country. It is new information that all thinking Australians should have.

I stated that congress was staying in their own premises, and my answers were quite correct in the short term. However, I can add that the congress is also in negotiations to settle their new premises in Canberra, and I have supported those negotiations through the Indigenous Business Australia and the Indigenous Land Corporation. These negotiations are progressing well. Congress is pleased with the progress and has been out inspecting the outstanding amenity they will soon move into.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,2017-03-29,"



Senator KIM CARR
 (Victoria) (15:02):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Attorney General (Senator Brandis) to a question without notice asked by Senator Carr today relating to the report of the Standing Committee of Privileges, Search warrants and the Senate. 


The exercise of the search warrants, which was the subject of the Privileges Committee report that was tabled yesterday found that the AFP raids into the office of former Senator Conroy and a staff member's home during last year's election campaign were an improper interference in the work of the parliament.  The report also found that Senator Conroy had rightly claimed that photographs seized during the raids were in fact privileged, and the committee accepts that the documents may have been responsible for two NBN employees being sacked. 


Now this is a circumstance where, during an election campaign and following the advice of the NBN to the minister responsible—who claims, of course, that he never spoke to the Prime Minister about this matter—the Prime Minister, we will all recall, on the night of the election said how outraged he was that the Labor Party had launched a campaign and that he was going to refer the matter to the police. Do you recall that on election night? The Prime Minister was seeking to involve the police in the political events of that election campaign where, during that election campaign, there were in fact raids undertaken against the Labor Party because of the exposure of the activities of this government with regard to the operations of the NBN. 


We had a circumstance where the NBN itself acknowledged that at least one of two people who were subsequently removed from the NBN were not the subject of inquiry until that raid had actually occurred. That person confirmed to the committee that they had not previously been under investigation. 


Of course the committee found that the AFP's actions were not a contempt of the parliament, because there is an extremely high bar set. You have to demonstrate in these circumstances that a person, who is accused of contempt, has the intention to actually undertake that contempt. That does not diminish the gravity of these issues. It does not for a moment diminish just how serious this question is.      


We have heard today from the Attorney-General, the first law officer of the land, that this government intends to do nothing about this question; it has done nothing whatsoever about the question. It does not let the NBN off the hook in any way. It is extraordinary that, on the ABC this morning when we woke up, we heard broadcast that the NBN intended to prosecute their case against the whistleblowers despite the findings of the Privileges Committee report. What does the government have to say on this matter? Nothing. It does not see it as its responsibility to protect the privileges of this parliament. It sees it as nothing to do with it whatsoever. 


What we do know is that the Prime Minister has his concerns about the opposition's attitude when his actions taken as Minister for Communications exposed a failure of this government. But that does not excuse the NBN Co's behaviour and, in particular, the chairman of the NBN, Dr Ziggy Switkowski. He is a man I have worked with closely and for whom I have a high regard. The very fact that he has had such a distinguished public service career—not only as the chair of the NBN Co but as chancellor of the RMIT, as head of ANSTO and a whole series of other responsibilities—demonstrates to me that he actually does know better. What he did during the election campaign was publish an article actually arguing in defence of these raids, which the secretary of the PM&C department subsequently said was a clear and unequivocal breach of the caretaker conventions of this country. It was a breach that was also undertaken by the department of communications, which had a draft of that article given to it by Dr Switkowski. It did nothing about that either.


We have a circumstance where staff members of Senator Conroy, as he then was, were read their rights and told that they were suspects—in the normal course of their work as staff members of a member of parliament. It is quite an extraordinary proposition that we have a circumstance where this government seeks, by their negligence, to allow this behaviour to go on. (Time expired)

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2017-03-29,"



Senator BRANDIS
 (Queensland—Attorney-General, Vice-President of the Executive Council and Leader of the Government in the Senate) (15:08):  That is one of the most foolish and irresponsible speeches I have ever heard in all the years I have sat in this chamber, because what Senator Carr, a former minister of the Crown who ought to know better, has done is attacked the integrity of the Australian Federal Police. 



Senator O'Neill interjecting—




Senator BRANDIS:
  I will come to the others whose integrity he has attacked in a moment. But, first and foremost, Senator Kim Carr has attacked the integrity of the Australian Federal Police. As the minister with responsibility for the Australian Federal Police, may I say to you, Madam Deputy President, and to anyone who may be listening to this broadcast, that there is absolutely no question whatsoever about the integrity of the Australian Federal Police, and for Senator Carr to attack their integrity is despicable.




Senator Kim Carr:
  Madam Deputy President, on a point of order: I claim to be misrepresented. The allegation I make is against this government, not the Federal Police, and the Attorney-General knows it.



The DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Thank you, Senator Carr. That is a debating point. Senator Brandis, please resume.




Senator BRANDIS:
  Senator Carr, you protest too much. But, in fact, the allegation you make is against the Australian Federal Police, because what you are alleging, Senator Carr—do not scurry out of the chamber like a coward—is that the Australian Federal Police improperly executed a search warrant. 


When the Australian Federal Police decide to execute a search warrant they only do so on the basis that they are satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to do so—on the basis, usually, of a complaint made to them. To suggest that the AFP have done something improper or inappropriate, as Senator Carr does, is to say that they made a decision on the basis of a misapplication of the grounds or the test for the issuance of a search warrant, and to say that is disgraceful.


Senator Carr also attacked NBN Co. As he also knows, NBN Co is an independent statutory corporation. These events occurred, incidentally, during the caretaker period of an election campaign. There is no capacity whatsoever, in particular during an election campaign, for a minister to interfere in a decision by the appropriate executives of NBN Co to make a complaint to the police that a crime may have been committed. So the attack on the integrity of NBN Co is equally specious.


Senator Carr also implied, not in the contribution we have just heard but in the question he asked of me, that the Prime Minister may have had some role in these events, to which I can tell you—and this has already been put on the public record by the Minister for Communications, Senator Fifield, the portfolio minister responsible for NBN Co—that, categorically, that is not the truth, and any suggestion or innuendo that it is the case is a lie.


Lastly, Senator Carr referred to the caretaker conventions. Might I remind you, Madam Deputy President, that when Senator Carr was last a minister in a government, the government of which he was a member—the second Rudd government—had such scant respect for the caretaker conventions that the then Attorney General, who was also, as I recall, the Special Minister of State and the Minister for the Public Service and Integrity, of all things, said that the caretaker conventions were 'a matter of political practice'. That was the regard that the then Attorney General and the government of which Senator Carr was a member had for the caretaker conventions—that they regarded them as merely 'a matter of political practice'. What Senator Carr has said, as I said a moment ago, is a despicable smear on the Australian Federal Police and on other innocent Australians.

"O'Neill, Sen Deb",ALP,2017-03-29,"



Senator O'NEILL
 (New South Wales) (15:13):  I have to state at the outset my absolute contempt for the contribution we just had from the leading law officer of the land, the Attorney-General. There is absolutely no doubt that Senator Carr made no representation at all about the AFP, so the outrage—this fake outrage—that we have seen from Senator Brandis is completely misplaced and completely misaligned. There was no criticism of the AFP. I want to make that point as I commence my remarks, trying to figure out how we got to this point.


How did we get to the point where the Privileges Committee of the Senate yesterday delivered a report entitled Search warrants and the Senate and found improper interference with documentation about the NBN held by a senator and his staff? 


That is what occurred and that is what that report indicated yesterday. We got here because of the disastrous management of all things NBN related since Malcolm Turnbull got his hands on it as the Minister for Communications. Everything to do with the NBN has been one stuff up after another. Mr Turnbull, as Prime Minister, has continued the problem, and I will say more about that as time permits. 


But let's have a bit of a look at what was revealed about the NBN company's involvement in the appalling raid at the office of former Senator Conroy and one of his staff members. The Senate Standing Committee of Privileges report yesterday made it clear that there was indeed improper interference. Let me make it clear once again—in case somebody on the other side wants to get up and misrepresent Labor's position—I make no criticism of the Australia Federal Police in relation to this raid, but I do absolutely put on record my disgust with the way in which the NBN Co, with Mr Ziggy Switkowski as chairman, involved themselves in the raid and used documentation to take disciplinary action against two of their own employees. Now, they said different things in their submission to the inquiry. They said that they already had suspicions about one person in their organisation delivering information to Senator Conroy and others, but there was another one that they had no idea about. NBN took action against two of their employees, and one of them was only because of the material they were able to get from Senator Conroy's staffer's home.


And remember when this happened? It was in the second week of the election period last year—a highly political time. NBN Co and the government had to be held to account on many occasions in the lead-up to that election for the NBN failure in the blowout of costs, failures in delays, failures in mismanagement and failures in misrepresentation to the Australian public about what was going on. This was done primarily by Senator Conroy, who, it is fair to say, was an absolute champion for people in Australia who want and deserve a real NBN and not the lemon that is being delivered at the behest of Mr Turnbull both as the minister and now as the PM. People are disgusted, and rightly so, at the failure of Mr Turnbull and his multitechnology mix. People from all over the country—good Australians like those two employees from the NBN—wanted the truth out. They wanted Australians to know what was going on and they provided the evidence. They gave information to people who could make a difference. Australians all over the country are sending in material to us, as senators and MPs, about the NBN's failure. The Australian people actually own the NBN. The minister who sits over there runs the NBN on our behalf and he is doing a very, very bad job following in the footsteps of the now Prime Minister, Mr Turnbull. 


The government did not like the scrutiny that they were being held account to. When that raid occurred in the second week of the election campaign, well, I will just leave it to decent, hardworking, thoughtful Australians to join the dots. What was truly breathtaking though was that when the AFP raid happened at the home of Senator Conroy's staffer there was an NBN employee there who with his digital camera took photographs. That is where the real improper interference happened. In the report there is significant detail. I would draw attention to page 16, where the discussion occurs about the NBN Co using that information: 


We had previously been identified as having access to one of the stolen documents but had not yet commenced an active investigation against one of their own employees. 


The NBN Co is a disaster. They tried to cover it up and this report proves how malicious that cover-up can be. (Time expired)

"Reynolds, Sen Linda",LP,2017-03-29,"



Senator REYNOLDS
 (Western Australia) (15:18):  I too rise to take note of the minister's answer on this issue. Listening to the two speakers opposite, I concur with the Attorney-General that this is probably one of the most disgraceful issues under attack here. No matter how much fancy footing and words that Senator Cameron and Senator O'Neill use, this is clearly an attack on the integrity of the AFP. The investigation is still ongoing, as they well know. Again, despite the verbal contortions, there is no other conclusion that any of us in this place can draw than that they are attacking the integrity of the AFP. In fact, Senator O'Neill just went through a list of issues in relation to AFP procedures— 




Senator O'Neill:
  I did not. I went through the procedures of the NBN. 




Senator REYNOLDS:
  in relation to the raid as part their inquiries as well. I would like to remind those opposite of the danger of playing politics with the AFP, who must always be beyond reproach. In May last year, the shadow Attorney-General, Mark Dreyfus, said: 


… at all times, we need to make sure that the Australian Federal Police and all our agencies are absolutely independent of political interference.


…   …   …


… we also need to be concerned about the appearance of police work. We need to be concerned about building confidence in our police and our agencies …


Such is the behaviour from those opposite on this question this afternoon. He went on to say: 


It does undermine confidence in the independence of the police.


If you want to attack the government, attack the government, but don't be so cowardly and so wrong to actually use the AFP to try and shield your attack because it is just disgraceful. 


Let's have a look at some of the facts here that those opposite have conveniently ignored in this whole process. Despite the fact that this is still a matter under AFP investigation, which those opposite know we cannot go into any detail, I was chair of the committee when this incident occurred and I have quite a different recollection. I know the Hansard record would have quite a different recollection of events from those opposite. What they have not told the Australian people is that the NBN operates critical national infrastructure and like any company it is completely within its rights to refer suspected threats of criminal activities or matters to the Federal Police. Similarly, they are also able to pursue potential code of conduct breaches internally. The government and the Attorney General have already acknowledged the work of the privileges committee and has also noted that the final report did find former Senator Conroy's claim of privilege of material seized by the AFP should be upheld. But, significantly, the Privileges Committee did not recommend that a content be found in respect of these matters.


It is utterly appalling that Labor continues to question integrity of the Australian Federal Police and the NBN. The AFP does act independently of this government. They determine what is within their jurisdiction to investigate and carry out their duties according to the law of this land. When those opposite suggest otherwise, despite their protestations that they are not, there is simply no conclusion any of us in this place can reach, considering the comments of those opposite and the nature of the question, other than that they are querying the integrity of the Australian Federal Police. There is no basis to their claim that the government in any way directed or attempted to influence the AFP on their investigation into this matter. They do act independently.


Additionally, in relation to Labor's comments about potential whistleblowers, these are also completely unfounded. So, before rushing to make wild allegations, those opposite should note that the NBN does have a well-established process for responding to information from whistleblowers, with a notification process managed by an independent third party. I understand that the NBN has advised that those protocols have never been accessed. The protocols do fully comply with the Public Interest Disclosure Act, which seeks to protect public officials.



Senator O'Neill interjecting—




Senator REYNOLDS:
  On the opposition's baseless claims that the NBN is behind schedule and over budget, Senator O'Neill sits in on these estimates hearings almost as much as I do, as does Senator Dastyari, and they both know, from the clear evidence provided time and time again to the committee, that those claims are simply untrue. Just asserting them over and over again does not make them true, and neither does suggesting that this government is in any way interfering with the AFP inquiry. (Time expired)

"McAllister, Sen Jenny",ALP,2017-03-29,"



Senator McALLISTER
 (New South Wales—Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate) (15:23):  Yesterday, the privileges committee did hand down a report that found that there was improper interference in the functions of this parliament, and there is no way that anyone in this chamber can get around those conclusions, which ought to raise very serious concerns for senators in this place and, indeed, for members in the other place. It is worth observing also that the report that was handed down yesterday was adopted in this chamber without opposition and that it makes a series of very acute observations about the issues that arise in relation to the raids that took place during the last election campaign.


Let us recall the gravity of that decision to execute a search warrant during an election period. What we saw was that, at the direction and request of a wholly-owned government business enterprise, a search was undertaken to seize documents from a sitting parliamentarian—from a senator, Senator Conroy, who had been tenacious and assiduous in chasing down the absolutely grotesque failures associated with the NBN project in the period since Mr Turnbull, the Prime Minister, assumed responsibility for that project.


Before I move on to considering the nature of those failures, I want to put on record again, because it appears to be difficult for senators on the other side of the chamber to understand this, that we have no criticism of the AFP. We make no criticism of the AFP because, as is observed in the report that was adopted here yesterday, the officers who executed that warrant did so in good faith and in the belief that they were pursuing a legitimate complaint. My concern is about the nature of the complaint and the reason that that complaint was brought forward, because it is hard not to observe the correlation between the grotesque failures and enormous shortcomings in the NBN project in the period since Mr Turnbull had responsibility for it and the desire to uncover whistleblowers who had blown the whistle on these shortcomings. What has happened since Mr Turnbull took over this project? He promised a great deal about providing an NBN that would be cheaper and more effective than the one—




Senator O'Neill:
  Faster.




Senator McALLISTER:
  Faster and sooner. But what actually happened? The cost of the NBN, on the watch of Mr Turnbull, blew out to $50 billion, more than twice what had been promised by Mr Turnbull during his campaign. We had a promise from Mr Turnbull that every Australian household would have access to the NBN by 2016, and where are we now? At this point in time, more than seven million Australian households are still waiting for that service. Are people satisfied with the service that they are receiving from the NBN? No, they are not at all, and the number of complaints about the NBN has blown out by about 150 per cent in the last year alone. Who is responsible for this failure, you ask? There is no escaping it because one person and one person alone has claimed responsibility for this project, and that person is Mr Turnbull. That person is the Prime Minister. It is hard not to see a relationship between this failure, the Prime Minister's responsibility for this failure and the extraordinary decision undertaken by the NBN Co during an election to pursue a complaint that resulted in a raid on the offices of a sitting member of parliament who had been pursuing that failure.


It is time for the government to come clean about their role in this process, and I am afraid I have no confidence in the assurances provided here today, because, time and time again, instead of direct answers, we see obfuscation and deferral on issues of great significance in relation to the integrity of processes by this government. The Senate has applied itself to examining this issue and the legal issues. It is time for the government to do the same.

  Private health insurance is important and valuable. Private health insurance reduces pressure on waiting times at hospitals; offers Australians greater choice of treatment; provides coverage of services, such as dental and optical; and gives patients their choice of doctor. The Turnbull government realises cost-of-living pressures are a major concern for Australian families. The government is determined that more can be done to get better value for families. The government has established the Private Health Ministerial Advisory Committee, led by Dr Jeff Harmer AO, which is already looking at ways to provide better value for money. Through this group, Minister Hunt will work with insurers over the next year to find ways insurers can deliver more value for customers without compromising on the quality of cover. As such, the government does not support using the Senate's limited resources for an additional inquiry.

"Rhiannon, Sen Lee",AG,2017-03-29,"



Senator RHIANNON
 (New South Wales) (15:41):  I move:


That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to table an explanatory memorandum relating to the bill.


Leave granted.




Senator RHIANNON:
  I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



The attack on the wages of our lowest paid people in this country is relentless.


The people who collect our trolleys at Coles and Woolworths, and those who flip our burgers at Hungry Jack's or McDonald's or who fry the chicken at KFC are getting paid less than the legal minimum. They certainly have been for a number of years, and this needs to be fixed.


There is a loophole in the Fair Work Act 2009 that says if you are on an enterprise agreement you cannot be paid less than the legal minimum in the award, but that provision only applies to your nine-to-five working hours on Monday to Friday. The protection does not apply to people who work on weekends or at nights and, as a result, hundreds of thousands of workers—mostly young workers—are getting paid very low wages and have been underpaid by these very large corporations over many years because of substandard deals that have been approved by the Fair Work Commission. On one estimate today these young people are being underpaid one million dollars a day. One million dollars a day is going to corporations such as Coles, Woolworths, Hungry Jack's, KFC and McDonald's instead of being paid to those people who are working late at nights and during weekends. This Bill will fix this, because every 18- or 19-year-old who is out there doing a job in a fast-food restaurant or supermarket should be paid the legal minimum. They know that without being paid the legal minimum it is hard to make ends meet, and I think that every parent who has a child working at one of these institutions would be horrified to know that they are not getting paid the minimum award rate.


Now, with the aftermath of the Fair Work Commission's decision to cut penalty rates for people working in retail, hospitality, pharmaceuticals and fast-food industries, we need to take further legislative action. Before the last election the Greens were the only party that committed to legislating to protect weekend rates of pay. We did so because weekend rates are an integral part of people's rights at work, with hundreds of thousands of Australians depending on weekend rates to make ends meet. Young people in particular depend on weekend rates to support themselves while they study. Young people are already facing unaffordable housing, insecure work and low levels of student assistance, so cutting weekend rates will place them under immense pressure.


It is time that people have certainty about the future of their weekend rates. It is time to ensure that the law protects people's weekend rates. And that is what the Australian Greens are doing with the introduction by Mr Bandt in the other place of the Fair Work Amendment (Protecting Weekend Pay and Penalty Rates) Bill 2017 which will override the recent decision of the Fair Work Commission to cut weekend rates.


Australia is not America, and that is a good thing, because in Australia we believe that people who spend their time working deserve a minimum wage, and minimum rights and conditions. We believe that having a job should not come at any cost—that there is a limit to what can be traded away. And we believe that, no matter where in you live in Australia, you deserve the same minimum wage, rights and conditions at work.


That is why we have national employment standards set out and protected by national legislation. Here in Australia we have a proud history of a strong labour union movement that exists to protect people's rights at work. The labour movement has fought to secure the weekend and an eight-hour working day, and they have ensured those working outside of these hours are fairly compensated through higher pay rates. We have unions who, time after time, have rallied together and fought the conservatives' attempts to cut the conditions that Australian workers deserve, and that step up when conservative governments try to tip the balance against ordinary working people.


I am proud to be part of a party that always puts people's rights at work ahead of big business interests. The Greens always have and always will protect people's rights at work. But what is clear is that our system has failed some of our lowest-paid workers in Australia. In our fast food companies and supermarket giants, workplace agreements have been struck that leave workers, some of our lowest-paid workers, worse off.


Thanks to a small number of dedicated individuals, it has been revealed that at some of Australia's largest businesses—Coles and Woolworths, Domino's, McDonald's, Hungry Jack's and KFC—workers have been underpaid hundreds of millions of dollars a year. The deal struck with Coles saw the company paying night and weekend penalty rates lower than the award, leaving many workers out of pocket overall, with estimates that the underpayment is worth between $70 million to $100 million a year.


Woolworths, Australia's largest employer, has an almost identical agreement to Coles, suggesting many of its workers have also been underpaid. McDonald's workers are even worse off. It is likely that hundreds of thousands of workers have been underpaid at McDonald's. In 2013, McDonald's negotiated an agreement with the Shop, Distributive and Allied (SDA) Employees' Association under which some McDonald's employees are paid nearly one-third less than the award. McDonald's workers seem to be out of pocket by at least $50 million a year, including some young workers who earn just shy of $10 an hour.


Fairfax Media estimates that Woolworths, Hungry Jack's and KFC together have short-changed workers by about a billion dollars over five years. As part of its investigation, Fairfax Media spoke to a young woman, Brigid Forrester, who until recently, worked up to four shifts a week at a McDonald's store in Perth, including Sunday evenings from 4 pm to 10 pm, and she was not paid penalty rates. One 19-year-old in South Australia was paid $19,000 for their year's work at McDonald's when they should have received $25,000 under the award.


A separate investigation by Fairfax discovered that, despite rising profits, widespread underpayments in wages were occurring at Domino's who struck an enterprise bargaining agreement allowing them not to pay penalty rates for years.


These are not corporations that are short of a quid. Last year, Woolworths had $58 billion in sales and Coles food and liquor sales alone brought in $32.6 billion. In 2013, McDonald's was estimated to have a turnover of $4 billion. At a very minimum these companies can afford to pay the basic legal minimum wage set out in the award to people working late at night or on weekends.


I think that most people in this country would be shocked to know that the people sitting behind the counter at these large corporations, which are meant to be regulated by federal law and where there are meant to be people looking after their interests, can be paid less than the award.


The Government side of politics has taken donations from these corporations. So have the Labor Party. But I am hoping that in this Parliament, instead of saying that it is okay for 18- or 19-year-olds to get less than the award, that this will be a wake-up call for this Parliament—that this Bill can get consensus across the Parliament to close this loophole. As I said, we have a provision in the Act that says agreements cannot go below the award for the ordinary 38 hours. Let's extend that to cover night-time work and weekend work as well.


I want to acknowledge a number of people who have uncovered this scandal which is going on in some of our biggest employers. Josh Cullinan, in his spare time, has personally investigated and compiled evidence of this gross underpayment of employees. His work should be acknowledged. As should the reporters Ben Schneiders, Royce Millar, Nick Toscano, Adele Ferguson, Mario Christodoulou and other members of the Fairfax Media team for their incredible work in further investigating and exposing these underpayments. I also want to acknowledge the workers who are working for these companies Duncan Hart, Penny Vickers and Michael Johnstone, who have taken it upon themselves to fight for their rights at work, and the rights of tens of thousands of their colleagues. And there is Siobhan Kelly, a lawyer who successfully ran the appeal case against Coles with Duncan and Josh, against teams of lawyers.


When this Parliament sees wrongdoing by unscrupulous employers, we should stand up to it. When this Parliament sees young workers working around the clock and getting paid less than the legal minimum set out in our legislation we should do something about. The Greens will. We have brought a Bill to this parliament. When Fairfax Media, Four Corners and Michael Fraser revealed the rampant worker exploitation at 7-Eleven, we brought that to Parliament too. When the Fair Work Commission decided to cut penalty rates, we brought that to Parliament as well. We had those cases heard in front of a Senate inquiry and we have legislation in front of Parliament to fix that.


It comes down to a fundamental point, one that I think everyone here should be able to agree with: an 18 year-old working nights at McDonald's should not be getting paid less than the legal minimum wage set out in the award. Otherwise, what are awards for? Why do we have federal legislation setting out minimum wages and conditions if someone is able to undercut it? They should not be able to undercut it. That is what a legal minimum is. If the law allows deals to be done that underpay our lowest-paid workers, then the law needs to be fixed.


This Bill will close that loophole in our national employment laws that unscrupulous big business employers have exploited to strike deals with organisations like the SDA that result in some of our low-paid workers being drastically underpaid. It provides a simple yet important reform. It extends protections for employees covered by an enterprise agreement to require employers to pay a base rate of pay, full rate of pay and any casual loading that is no less than the relevant award or national minimum wage order. This amendment will apply to existing agreements and to those that are yet to come into effect.


I would ask everyone here in this place—every member of parliament—to ask themselves this: if their 17-, 18- or 19-year-old daughter went off to work at one of these large institutions, would they like them to be paid less than the minimum award rate of pay? Do they think it is fair that their son or daughter could be paid less than the minimum award? If they do not think that is fair then it is not fair for everyone else who relies on these awards to make ends meet. We should fix it, we have the capacity to fix it and that is why I commend this Bill to the Senate.


I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

Senator McGRATH:
  The government notes the important role the craft brewing sector plays in our communities. Not only do Australians and tourists enjoy their products, but many craft breweries are also small businesses employing Australians. Many would enjoy the benefits which would flow to them from the government's enterprise tax plan. When it comes to the taxation arrangements of the craft brewing sector, there has been a breweries excise refund scheme in place since 1 July 2000. The brewery excise refund is now $30,000 with no minimum production volume. Breweries are eligible for the refund only if they are legally and economically independent from other entities that operate breweries. Any changes to taxation arrangements are always considered as part of the usual budget process.

   (iii) in 2016, only 37 cases of polio were recorded in three countries – Pakistan, Afghanistan and Nigeria – two of which are priorities for Australian development assistance, and


   (iv) a funding gap of $US 1.3 billion for implementing the GPEI's current strategic plan needs to be filled to complete the task of polio eradication within the next three years;


(b) acknowledges that:


   (i) investment in completing polio eradication will benefit future generations of children who will be free of this devastating disease, and other health programs and initiatives will benefit from the knowledge and experience gained through polio eradication,


   (ii) completing eradication of polio would be the first concrete success of the Sustainable Development Goals, providing a basis for reaching children with life-saving interventions in the most remote, vulnerable and socially-excluded communities,


   (iii) Commonwealth leaders, including Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, agreed at the latest Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in November 2015 to accelerate action and renew financial support to eradicate polio, and


   (iv) the current Parliaments of Australia and other countries have the opportunity to be the elected representatives who ended polio completely; and


(c) calls on the Australian Government to maintain its annual contribution to GPEI at $15 million in the next two financial years, to follow through on this renewed commitment and assist in making the end of polio a reality.

 (Queensland—Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister) (15:44):  I seek leave to make a short statement.



The PRESIDENT:  You have been granted leave for one minute.




Senator McGRATH:
  The Australian government is committed to polio eradication, and it has provided $80 million since 2011 to the Global Polio Eradication Initiative to date. Our current four-year polio and routine immunisation commitment includes $36 million to the initiative and $36 million to the World Bank to strengthen immunisation systems in our region to avert the risk of polio re-emerging. The government is not in a position to support paragraph (c) of the motion as it exceeds current commitments. For this reason, we would oppose the motion.

  The government will not waiver in our commitment to secure Australia's borders. Regional processing is a key component of our border protection framework. Australians have not forgotten what happened when Labor and the Greens lost control of our borders: 1,200 people drowned at sea, 8,000 children were placed into detention and 50,000 people arrived on more than 800 boats. Labor and the Greens have learned nothing and will do it all again if given the chance. The government's border protection policies will not change. No-one in regional processing centres will be resettled in Australia.

"Ketter, Sen Christopher",ALP,2017-03-29,"



Senator KETTER
 (Queensland) (16:28):  I rise to speak on the matter of public importance requested by Senator Gallagher today—that low- and middle-income Australians are continuing to lose out under the Turnbull government—but before I turn to those comments, with the indulgence of the Senate I want to place on record my thoughts and prayers for North Queenslanders, particularly those in Bowen, Airlie Beach and Proserpine who at the moment find themselves with roads cut. I want to express our solidarity with those people. I also note with some gratitude that the last time I checked there had been no reports of injury so far from the Whitsunday Islands. I also note the prospect of major flooding of the major rivers north of Ayr to the New South Wales border. I reiterate the very good advice that the state authorities provide: if it is flooded, forget it.


It is quite disappointing that, in a week in which we are discussing and looking at the issue of penalty rate cuts and the inaction of this government in relation to those penalty cuts, we also a see a government demonstrating its twisted priorities by continuing to pursue as its central economic piece of work the enterprise tax plan, which at its heart is a $50 billion tax cut for big businesses and, as part of that, a $7.4 billion tax cut for the major banks and also a very generous windfall for multinational companies. This displays the treatment that this government is meting out to low- and middle-income Australians. We see this every day: a government that fails to act, fails to lead and fails to secure a prosperous future for everyday Australians. A strong middle class is a source of growth, not just a consequence of it. 


The Prime Minister's trickle-down rhetoric of tax cuts for the rich, big business and big banks is an impediment to the growth that we need. The living standards in middle Australia have supported our economy in a period when run-away inequality and wealth concentration has destabilised both the economies and the politics of the US and much of Europe. However, we are not immune to such effects. Under the failed leadership of both Prime Ministers Malcolm Turnbull and Tony Abbott, growth, particularly in the middle class, has shrunk significantly. These are the alarming economic facts facing middle Australia: the economy is growing below trend; the unemployment rate has increased and is now close to six per cent; and underemployment is at record highs. There are fewer full-time jobs than there were a year ago and wages growth is at record lows. What is the government's response to these issues? Backing in penalty rate cuts that impact those on low and middle incomes. 


I have already said in this chamber today that I agree with the assessment of the Treasurer that low wages growth is one of the greatest threats to our economy. If one accepts that as a premise then the attacks on the take-home pay of 700,000 low-income workers would have to be a disaster for economic growth for the future, as well as being a disaster for the people affected by those cuts. The 2011 ABS census confirms that workers in the affected industries are amongst the lowest paid in Australia. These cuts to wages severely impact those who are struggling most to make ends meet, particularly students and others who rely sometimes solely on weekend penalty rates. I note that the state Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations in Queensland has issued some figures as to the number of employees in parts of Queensland who are award-reliant retail and hospitality workers who work on a Sunday. We can see that in Cairns there are something like 2,300 workers; in Townsville, 2,000 workers; in Mackay, 2,000 workers; in Fitzroy, 2,100; in the outback of Queensland, 787; in Wide Bay, 2,500; in the Darling Downs-Maranoa, 1,270; in Toowoomba, around 1,200; on the Gold Coast, 7,400; and on the Sunshine Coast 4,230. These are the people who are behind the statistics on the impact of these penalty rate cuts. 


In April 2015, the McKell Institute conducted a study as to the economic impact of penalty rate cuts in Australia's retail and hospitality industries. The findings of that report were not surprising and predicted the harmful effects of the Fair Work Commission's decision. They found that the cuts to penalty rates in these industries would:


… result in a commensurate reduction in the disposable income of those workers, leaving less money available for spending on local goods and services.


The McKell Institute conducted studies following the decision and found that the lowest income earners who rely heavily on penalty rates would be most adversely affected. In their February 2017 report, the institute found full-time and part-time employees in the retail industry not covered by an enterprise agreement would lose at least $72.90 per eight-hour Sunday shift. Casual retail workers would face losing a minimum of $45.56 per Sunday shift. In 2016, a report entitled Choosing opportunity identified one of the many challenges associated with being a low-income worker, such as owning a home and being able to afford basic services and amenities in the near stagnant wage growth of recent years. The Prime Minister suggested that penalty rates could be offset by normal wage increases over time. The Australia Institute calculates that, at current wage growth rates, it would take 17 years until higher wages for retail workers would offset the damaging consequences of this decision. 


Another issue where the Turnbull government has failed low- and middle-income workers is in relation to housing affordability, which is a key factor when it comes to inequality. But before I touch on that point, I would also like to quote from a recent article that goes behind the statistics to talk about the people who are affected by these penalty rate cuts. I note a recent news.com.au article, which states:


A Brisbane woman, who did not want to be named, is “stressed” knowing her pay packet is dwindling.


“I work for a fine dining restaurant in the Brisbane CBD (and) it’s stressful knowing that you’re going to be doing the same amount of work, but taking home less pay,” she said.


There are also other workers mentioned in that article. These workers are entitled to feel that this government has forgotten all about them, that they are collateral damage when it comes to this government's twisted priorities. 


With respect to housing affordability, while finance to housing investors has rocketed up by more than 27 per cent over the last 12 months, low- and middle-income Australians are increasingly being locked out of the Australian dream of owning their own home. First home buyers in the market are still at near record lows. While the government continues to talk about housing affordability, there has been little or no real action over the last 12 months. All the while, house price growth in Sydney has been running at 19.2 per cent and in Melbourne at 14.2 per cent. Demographia's 13th annual International Housing Affordability Survey also showed that Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane and Perth are in the top 20 least affordable housing markets.


While ordinary Australians are being locked out, the government seems to be using this issue as a way to wage factional wars, with one side considering capital gains tax reform and the other being ideologically opposed to tax increases. One side embraces the silly idea of accessing superannuation to make a deposit and the other side, wisely, tries to rule it out. It is hard to know what the government's housing affordability policy actually is, as it seems to change with every passing day.


The Turnbull government has turned a blind eye to the issues of inequality facing our nation. Whether it is cuts to penalty rates or housing affordability, the Turnbull government has failed low- and middle-income Australians.

"O'Sullivan, Sen Barry",Nats,2017-03-29,"



Senator O'SULLIVAN
 (Queensland) (16:38):  I rise to speak on the matter of public importance. It is always good to come in here and clear the sinuses, to get a lecture from the Australian Labor Party on how to manage the economy of this country. These are people, almost to the last person—these shop stewards and trade union delegates—who made their way into this place not on merit, not on demonstrating their knowledge of how to run a business or how to make a contribution to an economy but, rather, they were just like marbles with numbers on them coming out the end of a garden hose. 'Who's next?' they say when a vacancy comes up. 


Honestly, if you put your hand in your pocket and found a 10-pound note you would have someone else's pants on because you have devoted your life, you have created a skills base, where you wait for real people to develop economies and businesses. You stand there, almost at the gate of the factory, waiting to prey upon them. You do not want the employers to have any advantage. You represent a trade union movement that, quite corruptly, goes and gets commissions, most of it for the benefit of the trade union.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Reynolds
):  Senator O'Neill, on a point of order.




Senator O'Neill:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, I am not sure whether the senator was referring to you. I doubt he would have been referring to any particular person sitting on this side; nonetheless, he should refer his remarks through the chair.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator O'Sullivan, I would remind you to make all your comments through the chair.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Let me clear it up for the senator. It is a very communistic approach. My remarks can be shared, equally, amongst you all. If one of you wants to take a bigger load than the others you just put your hand up and let me know. The fact of the matter is, it offends me when I come in here and hear members of the Australian Labor Party talk about the economy. 


If only the arrow were black and went up instead of red and going down. You would be heroes. You took a balanced budget left by Prime Minister Howard that had $60 billion in reserve and zero debt. That is a statement you will never hear again in your lifetime, Senator Katter—through you, Madam Acting Deputy President—even if you live to be 115. You left a debt of $300 billion behind. You borrowed three hundred thousand million dollars and frittered it away. You want to talk about middle-income Australians losing out, but all they got out of your government—some of them, not all of them—was some pink batts up in the ceiling. They got nothing else whatsoever. 


For you to come in here and tell us how to run an economy—you wouldn't have a clue! None of you have ever employed anyone, except when you got the payroll out of some consolidated revenue of someone else's money, like a trade union movement. That is the only time you have ever employed anyone. You have never lain awake—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator O'Neill, do you have a point of order?




Senator O'Neill:
  Yes. The honourable senator continues to ignore the reality that he should be making his comments to the chair. I would like to make it a debating point but I will not.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I thank you for that, Senator O'Neill. Senator O'Sullivan, I would remind you to make your remarks through the chair.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, you know when you're on the money when every minute or so one of them bobs up with some nonsense sort of an interjection to stop you getting your flow on. Through you, Madam Acting Deputy President, there is not one of these people here who has ever lain at home at night worrying about their business mortgage, worrying about how they are going to employ someone. This is reflected in their economic management skills. 


They have not even had the basic experience of small business to know things like tax cuts. Those tax cuts that will go to these businesses—I think it is under $10 million—are going to be reinvested. Every cent of that will be reinvested by employing more people or giving better employment services to those who are already employed, giving them confidence that their jobs are going to continue because their bosses are productive. The only way governments can create revenue is to borrow more money, increase taxes and charges or reduce services. There is no other pathway. The only way out of this Labor quagmire that you left us, this $300 billion debt, is for business men and women out there to hit their straps and generate incomes, creating good profits on which to pay their fair share of taxation. That is the only way out of this quagmire—creating businesses that will employ more people.


Let me talk about some of the imposts on businesses. Let me tell you about the impact the Labor Party still has today. They send out these gorillas, knuckles dragging on the floor, to corruptly stand over businesses to take money. Some of them spend it on prostitutes and boats for themselves, others put extensions on their own homes. These are trade union delegates, these are the mates of the Australian Labor Party, these are the people who fund this political franchise, over here, of nearly $200 million. You know that, don't you, Senator Williams? You only mentioned it a bit earlier. It was $198 million, I think. You were a student of it. 


You have taken $198 million off these corrupt individuals in this organised crime unit so that you can continue to come here and protect them—not only to protect them but to create an environment where they can continue to attack—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator O'Neill, do you have another point of order?




Senator O'Neill:
  It will not surprise you, Madam Acting Deputy President, that I need to make the same point of order. I do draw your attention to the rather outrageous claims that the senator is now making and attributing to people here.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  There are two issues there. The second issue is a debating point. I have been listening very carefully to Senator O'Sullivan. You were a bit slow to your feet, and I did let it go, because I took it as a rhetorical question to another senator, rather than a direct issue. So there is no point of order.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Let me be more specific. The CFMEU, which I think is accepted by everybody to be an organised criminal outfit, with 114 of them before the courts for serious criminal offences in relation to—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator O'Neill, another point of order?




Senator O'Neill:
  That is an outrageous accusation to make to an entire organisation. It is one thing to correctly describe people who have broken the law and are before the law, but that is just way too far.



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  I will take that again as a debating point.




Senator O'Neill:
  The senator should take care with—



The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT:  Senator O'Sullivan, I will just remind you to take care with your language, but that was a debating point, not a point of order.




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  I compliment Senator O'Neill. She is definitely earning her donations from the trade union movement today. Where does that money come from? You have to understand that a large part of that, as disclosed by the commission, has come from industry. It has come from businesses. It has been corruptly obtained. We have heard of these secret commissions. This is money that would otherwise be spent by that company in the operation of its enterprise, in the employment of people and in the provision of services. But no. So what happens? Do you on the other side understand what trickle-down economics is? I doubt that you do, but here is what happens. Those are cost outlays that those companies have to meet, despite the fact that it is a corrupt payment. Where does it go? You want to talk about housing affordability? I will tell you what it does. It trickles down onto the job site. It trickles all the way down onto the job site, because these enterprises still want to make a profit for themselves. They still want to remain viable. 


So you have got this trade union movement up one end, ripping the heart out of industry—some estimates suggest that the productivity losses are in double digits, that the additional costs, particularly in commercial construction, are in double digits. That is money that would remain in the cycle. When you make a profit in business—and fortunately I know a thing or two about that—you reinvest it in yourself. You start off with five employees. When you are more profitable, you grow your business. Most people, at least, grow their business; they are ambitious to grow their business. You employ 10 people. You employ 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100 people. Every cost that you have impacts on the viability of your business and impacts on your ability to employ people. So every red cent stolen or corruptly taken by the trade union movement, particularly in the construction industry, particularly the CFMEU—one of your biggest donors and a donor of our friends over there; they are sitting quietly but perhaps that might knock them out of their slumber and they might have something to say—is money that comes directly out of industry and commerce in this country. That is why, to the extent that there is any impact on low- and middle-income Australians, it is because it has been ripped out by these inefficiencies created by the trade union movement.




Senator Ketter:
  What a joke!




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  No. Through you, Madam Acting Deputy President: I saw you get up, Senator Ketter, trying to name places. You did not even pronounce some of them properly, because—let us get down to the facts now—every Labor senator in Queensland is based in Brisbane or the Gold Coast. That is where they are. They have never seen a kangaroo. They have never dodged a kangaroo. They are nowhere to be seen in the bush. There is a reason for that: there are no votes for them up in the bush. I can tell you that now. What we have got is—



Senator McAllister interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  No. These are the impacts. What you are trying to do is impact on businesses—in my case, out in provincial Queensland, in the bush. We saw you last week. I have got to tell you I found it incredible to sit over here and look at the Australian Labor Party sit over there and vote with their coalition partner, the Greens, to try and bring jobs in the black coal industry to an end. These are your workers. These are the people that you built the Australian Labor Party on—coalminers. There are 14,000 jobs already gone in Central Queensland, in the Bowen and Surat basins, and you sat over there to bring that to an end. There are thousands of businesses, Senator Ketter, that will not remember you for your kind words today as you talked about the impacts in those communities and tried to blame them on the government. They will remember you for your vote a week ago, when you voted to get rid of their remaining jobs in the black coal industry. That is what they will remember you for. And, just in case they nod off and forget, I will be there to remind them at every single opportunity. The Australian Labor Party as we currently know it is no longer the Labor Party of the sixties and the seventies or indeed before that, since their formation. You are no longer the party of the workers. To come in here and talk about the economy in the form that you have demonstrates to them that you are ignorant of economic issues. You made this problem. You created this problem that we have in the current environment.


My story is the NDIS. I think that all governments should be ashamed of themselves for not having introduced a national disability insurance scheme 40, 50 or 60 years ago. It should have been enshrined in the Constitution almost. And I give full credit to the Australian Labor Party for leading the way in relation to the introduction of that. That is something that you can be very proud of. But you know what? You forgot to leave any money in the piggy bank. You forgot to leave one cent in there to fund it in the forward estimates, and you have done that before. Keating did that. He took us to 19 per cent. Gough Whitlam spent like a drunken sailor. This is your history. This is your legacy on the question of the economy. 


So, if I seem a bit testy, it is because for you to get up and start to lecture us on what low- and middle-income Australians have, because of some economic decision of this government, is a little bit rich. These people have been better off under coalition governments forever. They rely on us to come in and fix the debt. Well, we are having to struggle this time, because you did not just leave a debt. You left the piggy banks, and, when we lined them up and gave them a rattle, what did we hear, Senator Williams? We heard nothing, because they were empty. I got excited at first; I thought they might have been full of banknotes and so not make any noise. But no. We pulled the plug out, put the old looking glass up there under the belly of the pig, and it was fully empty—just like your ability to conduct and manage an economy. You are an empty vessel. I will not be lectured by you in this place. I will not be lectured by you about what we need to do to the economy. I will not have you tell us that low- and middle-income Australians are worse off under this government, after you left a massive, massive Bankcard debt that we cannot crawl over.



Senator McAllister interjecting—




Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  No, it is good to see you come alive. I will bet you this: in every contribution that the Labor Party makes today, I bet they will not acknowledge the fact that they left a $300 billion debt, Senator Williams. I will bet you a carton of anything you drink, and there will be a carton for you too if you get up and tell the truth—through you, Madam Acting Deputy President—and let Australians know what they already know: what a terrible state you left the financial affairs of this country in. I will give you a carton of beer, or a carton of something else; you might be a soft drinker.

Senator O'SULLIVAN:
  Sorry?




Senator Williams:
  Mine is Guinness.

  There we go—Guinness. We will get you some Guinness.


I want to close simply by saying it is a bit rich and hypocritical. You people: if you have a couple of minutes, pop round to my office, and I will give you some 101 on economic management.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2017-03-29,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (16:53):  Well, God help those on low and middle incomes in Australia if they are relying on the coalition to look after them. That is all I can say, Senator O'Sullivan—through you, Madam Acting Deputy President—because there is absolutely no doubt that low- and middle-income Australians are continuing to lose out under the Turnbull government.


Let's look at the social security amendment legislation that went through this place last week, where they froze indexation on family tax benefit payment. Low- and middle-income families will clearly lose out on payments. Let's look at the freezing of the income-free area on Newstart, which means low-income Australians will have less money in their pockets over the next couple of years as that freeze starts to take effect. Let's look at what the government has been doing with the Centrelink autodebt process, where low- and middle-income Australians, but particularly low-income Australians, have been hit so hard with this incorrect, flawed process. The government could care less, quite frankly, about the impact of the incorrect debt notices that have been going out so heartlessly to Australians—20,000 Australians at a time through that process. What does the government say? 'It's working. We're going to pursue this.' Very wealthy Australians get to negotiate their million-dollar debts with the tax office. What do the government do to low- and middle-income Australians? They send around the debt collectors. In some instances, when it first started, the first thing some people knew about it was when they had the debt collectors knock at the door, because apparently the government could not find their address to send them the debt notices.


Then, of course, we go back to when the coalition first came in, to that horror budget. Who can forget Tony Abbott's first horror budget, where they clearly purposely, cruelly, unfairly targeted low-income Australians? Who can forget that cruel attempt to kick young people off income support for six months? Then they clearly saw that Australians did not support that and overwhelmingly rejected it. But so intent are they on still trying to save money on young people that they are now still attempting to do so, because there is still a bill on the books to kick young people off income support for an extra four weeks—in other words, kicking them off for five weeks. This ignores all the evidence that shows that living in poverty is a barrier to finding employment but, more importantly, that the jobs just are not there.


They keep having a bash. They keep trying to demonise those on Newstart or income support, saying they cannot find employment. They cannot find employment because the jobs are not there, but the value of Newstart is going down when we know that the value of youth allowance is going down, and we will make young people live on thin air for four weeks. But do not worry. They actually know that that is going to have an impact, because they are going to put a little bit of extra money, $8 million, into emergency relief. So people have to then go to emergency relief and ask for enough money to be able to eat that night. That is not good for low- and middle-income Australians, and it is not a good start for young people trying to find jobs. What do you think it does to their mental health and their self-esteem, let alone their physical health?


Inequality in this country is rising—wealth inequality and income inequality. The government clearly, in every budget, tries every time to take money off the most vulnerable members of our community. Let's look at the omnibus bill. That still has some horror measures in it. The government will still keep pursuing those cuts, we are told.


Then, of course, there are issues around penalty rates. Who do you think that is going to hit? Young people, the same people that they are telling to go and get a job. Once they get a job, we are actually going to make sure you have less money in your pocket, because we are going to cut penalty rates. That is, of course, assuming that people have been able to find housing and are not homeless. This government fails low- and middle-income Australians.

"Pratt, Sen Louise",ALP,2017-03-29,"



Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (16:58):  In rising to speak to Senator Gallagher's matter of public importance, I certainly agree with the matter of public importance that is before us. The way the government is attacking low- and middle-income Australians is a disgrace, and it is especially being felt in my home state of WA, which now has the highest rate of unemployment in the nation. What that means is that there are more people being forced to survive on the government's measly Newstart payments and many more young people struggling under the waiting periods that Senator Siewert, for example, outlined.


We have now seen for a long time this government, and its previous iteration under Tony Abbott, sell out low- and middle-income Australians. We have seen the government taking away the rights of workers, cutting education funding, trying to undermine Medicare and cutting family assistance payments. We have seen this systematic attack. Time and time again, we have seen the government sell out the people who need their support the most—not the big end of town. They still have $50 billion worth of tax cuts on the table. This is a government that does not care about low- and middle-income workers, that does not care about the ordinary mums and dads across the country who are trying to make ends meet. Those on the other side are fighting for the interests of their friends in big business by promising them big tax cuts and supporting pay cuts for the lowest paid workers in our nation.


I implore those on the other side and on the crossbench to support Labor's legislation to protect penalty rates from being cut by the Fair Work Commission. However, those opposite have said they support the Fair Work Commission's decision. That can mean only one thing: they are directly supporting the pay cuts for retail and hospitality workers. This decision will mean not only that low- and middle-income Australians will lose out but also that women will disproportionately lose out too. Women are already the most affected by marginal work arrangements, shiftwork and multiple employers. That is the working arrangement of many women in Australia, and attacks on penalty rates will affect them disproportionately.


A good example is a woman named Tanya, who, in the Save our penalty rates campaign, said: 'If my pay is cut I'll struggle to survive, even eat. I won't be able to buy clothes, shoes, toothpaste and hair spray. I won't be able to treat the grandkids on birthdays or at Christmas. If something happens to the car, I won't be able to afford it.' What we have is a government that is standing by and letting it happen. It means there are more and more workers at risk of similar decisions in other industries. Other workers, not just retail and hospitality workers, are now at risk of having their rates cut with this dangerous precedent.


Last year we saw the government pass its notorious ABCC legislation. That legislation is a part of this government's ongoing agenda to attack the union movement to undermine the capacity of ordinary working Australians to protect their pay and conditions. That legislation sought to create criminal penalties for actions that are not criminal—a direct attack on working people in this country and their right to defend their wages and conditions.


We saw that just last week for vulnerable children, with the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Jobs for Families Child Care Package) Bill, which disproportionately impacts lower income earners, who are losing out under the government's package. That package made low-income families have limited access to early childhood education. It is an absolute disgrace, and, I think, immoral to turn our focus away from the children who we need to stand up for and fight for the most. It is just more evidence for the families that Malcom Turnbull is leaving behind. A good way of illustrating this is that the government's new 12-hour safety net for single-income families is not equal to the two days support and care that the minister claimed. That is an attack on our nation's most vulnerable children. We saw within that legislation a complicated activity test that removes the entitlement of all children to that two days care. That, in my view, is appalling. The legislation, as a whole, demonstrates how little regard the coalition has for the sector and for the vulnerable families that are affected by these cuts.


I want to comment briefly on the other cuts that the government has made recently to 204,000 Australians on the lowest incomes with cuts to Newstart and parenting payment. We have seen waiting periods for access to parenting payment introduced, which is an appalling thing to do to a family in crisis. We have seen cuts to the family tax benefit parts A and B. These cuts are to people who are already on very low incomes. Freezing the threshold makes their incomes completely unsustainable in terms of keeping up with the rest of the economy. It is already very difficult to survive on these very low incomes.


We have also seen an attack on Medicare. We have seen low- and middle-income families deal with higher medical costs through the six-year Medicare fees. It is forcing bulk-billing to disappear and forcing up the healthcare costs of Australians. In the period July to September, bulk-billing rates for non-referred GP attendances tumbled by some 0.2 per cent in my home state of WA and by up to 2.4 per cent nationally. This is burdensome for Australian families. Zero point two per cent might seem small, but that is the equivalent of 6,000 GP visits in the state of WA that were not bulk-billed last quarter that would have been previously bulk-billed and 167,000 GP visits nationally.


We have seen a government that does not want to reveal that if low- and middle- income families go to visit the GP they will get a nasty surprise. This is coming from a Prime Minister who promised that no Australian would pay more to visit the doctor. That was utterly false. With the robo-debt we have also seen a farce, with false debt notices going out to people who have done all their due diligence in telling Centrelink their income over time. False debt notices have gone out to people who have declared every bit of their income to Centrelink and were absolutely entitled to that money, but have been put through the wringer by the government's robo-debt process. It really reeks, to my mind, of the government systematically trying to rip money out of the poorest households in our country.


One thing I do know for sure is that Australians will see through the government's attacks. Less than three weeks ago, voters in my home state of WA voted out a Liberal government that was arrogant and out of touch, that was not in touch with the needs of low- and middle-income Western Australians. They voted for jobs, for solutions to unemployment, for investment in better public health, for investment in schools and transport and for policies that focus on the needs of real people. The government of this nation must stand up and do what is right for ordinary Australians but, sadly, I do not think it will. I can tell you, though, the Australian Labor Party certainly will.

",Senate,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Turnbull Government</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,27,1
"Smith, Sen Dean",LP,2017-03-29,"



Senator SMITH
 (Western Australia—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (17:07):  I am also pleased to make a contribution to this matter of public importance debate this afternoon in the Senate. What Labor senators, and I suspect Australian Greens senators, are trying to do is to: undermine the public and community confidence in the government's plan for families, whether they be low- or middle-income families; undermine the community's confidence in the government's commitment to budget repair; undermine the community's confidence in the government's very, very clear plan to put the country on a more sustainable footing, not just over the next few months but also into future years.


It has to be recognised that there is a very real tension in our country at the moment, and that tension exists fundamentally around the issue of budget repair. There can be no denying that in this country the issue of budget repair has to be our most important priority. If it is not our priority then we are doing a disservice not just to ourselves and not just to the next generation, we are doing a disservice to all future generations of Australians. Tardy budget management, budgets that deliver debt and deficit do not just diminish the capacity of this generation, they also diminish the capacity of every future generation. You cannot have a discussion about the future of Australian children without also having a discussion about the importance of budget repair.


Of course the tension arises because in order to fix the budget there are two very clear choices for governments. One of those choices is to increase taxes. For some people in the Senate, indeed, for some people in the broader community, the idea of taxing people more has huge attractions. But I would argue that addressing budget repair by increasing taxes undermines the opportunity for low- and middle-income families to get ahead. Increasing taxes will slow economic growth and it will make job opportunities diminish in the economy. That cannot be a good outcome for any family, whether they be a low-income family, a middle-income family or, indeed, a wealthier Australian family.


The other option, and I happily put myself on the austerity side of the ledger, is to tackle the issue of government spending. The simple fact of the matter for me, and I am sure for other coalition senators, and I hope for others on this side of the chamber, is that the government cannot continue to spend at the rate it is spending. That brings us to the issue of the social services budget. It accounts for such a large part of our budget outlay, and, importantly, many of those measures—I think the figure might be in excess of 80 per cent—are legislated, which means that the parliament must cast a judgement over the suitability of those social service arrangements.


In recent days, indeed over the recent week, much of that tension has focused itself on two issues: the issue of penalty rates reform—I have supported and I continue to support penalty rate reform—and the issue of childcare reform. I will come to those two issues in a brief moment. Of course what we know about inequality in the Australian community, inequality between Australian families, is that at its heart it is joblessness that drives that inequality. That is why the government's focus is clearly on the issue of job creation and economic growth. So to suggest that we are not doing anything around the issue of supporting low- and middle-income families is blatantly wrong. We have a clear commitment to addressing inequality in our community, because we believe that at the heart of inequality is the issue of joblessness. So when you look at what is the government doing, how is the government attempting to tackle the issue of joblessness, then the record is strong and it is clear. The government is seeking to support higher wages and the creation of new jobs by lowering the tax rate for all businesses over the next 10 years, starting with small business.


The government's childcare packages, happily passed by this Senate last week, will support around one million families who rely on child care to go out and work, providing the highest rate of subsidy to those with the lowest incomes. It is interesting that in the childcare debate, which I will come to in a moment, a key point that has been missing is what it does for female participation in the workforce. In order to drive greater economic growth, higher levels of productivity in the Australian economy, the government, the community, must address the issue of female workplace participation. That is an important element, and often an element much neglected in the government's childcare package.


Further than that, the government is investing almost $840 million in a youth employment package that would deliberately seek to increase the employment of vulnerable young people under 25 years of age. None of us in this place would find the level of youth unemployment in our country acceptable. The government is investing in education, providing $73.6 billion over the next four years, hoping to set our children up for future prosperity. In addition, the government is committed to ensuring that we get taxpayer support to those who need it most, and encouraging those who can work to work, and to use their own means to support themselves where possible.


I will come briefly to the issue of the childcare package, and then move to the issue of the penalty rate debate. It is important to recognise that the childcare reforms that were passed by this Senate do a number of things. They put downward pressure on incessant childcare fee increases through an hourly rate cap. They abolish the $7½ thousand childcare rebate cap to ensure that low- and middle-income families are not limited by a cap on the amount of child care they can access. Importantly, they introduce new compliance powers to further strengthen the government's efforts to clamp down on fraud, and they provide a billion-dollar childcare safety net for the most vulnerable children and slash red tape so that services can be more flexible in the hours that they are available to families. Importantly—to those senators who represent states with large rural and regional communities—the package provides rural, regional and remote childcare services with the support of funding streams like the childcare subsidy, the additional childcare subsidy and the community childcare fund. Together, these have the potential to provide much more funding for important childcare services across rural and regional communities.


It is important to see the government's reform efforts, whether they be penalty rate reform or in the area of childcare reform, as supporting increased participation in the workforce by allowing people and giving people the opportunity to find jobs, because it is in finding jobs that people can have the best way of addressing inequality in our community but also the best opportunity to support their own families. Let me just demonstrate how important the childcare reforms are by drawing out a number of cameos that the Minister for Education and Training, in this case the minister responsible for the childcare package, Simon Birmingham, talked about in his contribution to the Senate last week. I will use three cameos. I will use a cameo of a family on $50,000, a cameo of a family on $80,000 and finally a cameo of a family on $94,000.


In the case of a family on $50,000 with both parents working, with two children under the age of six in long day care for two days a week at $100 a day, that family will be $2,197 better off as a result of the government's childcare package. There is no way you can argue that the government is hurting low- and middle-income families when a family on $50,000 will have a benefit of $2,197 as a result of the government's childcare package.


Look at another modest family income of $80,000 with both parents working, with two children under the age of six, again, in long day care for three days a week at $100 a day. They will be $3,424 better off. Again, you just cannot argue with a straight face that the government's childcare reforms are not benefiting low- and middle-income families.


Finally, before I move to the issue of penalty rate reform, a family on $94,000 with both parents working, with two children under the age of six in long day care for three days a week at $100 a day, will be $2,657 better off a year. So it does not withstand scrutiny that the government's efforts to support female participation in the workforce and to support Australian families with its childcare reforms are somehow dudding low-income and middle-income families in our country.


I just want to turn to the issue of penalty rate reform. This, I think, is a classic example of where the rhetoric and the sound and fury of the Labor Party and some other senators on this issue just do not stack up to reason. What we have in our country without penalty rate reform, what we have in our country without the decision of a few weeks ago of the independent Fair Work Commission, is a very unlevel playing field between small businesses and big business. We know small businesses are run predominantly by families, and we know that many women are managing those small businesses and taking those small businesses' risks. We have an unlevel playing field between that group in the community and big business.


One of the things that motivated me to join the Liberal Party over 30 years ago—30 years ago last month—was the realisation when I watched the Western Australian Labor Party in the 1980s that, for some people, having big unions and big business in bed with big government is how they want to run our country. I reject the idea that big unions in bed with big business in bed with big government help ordinary families. I saw it for myself. I saw my own family not being looked after by the interests of the organised labour movement. In fact, they were dudding low-income families like our own and not supporting middle-income families but supporting the big end of town, and that is shameful.


The comparison between what is available to big business at the expense of small business in the absence of penalty rate reform is illuminating. I will give you a couple of examples. For example, a permanent full-time or part-time staff member working on Sundays at a bed-and-breakfast must be paid $10 an hour more than at a five-star hotel. A family chicken shop must pay $8 an hour more than KFC. A family-owned takeaway must pay $8 an hour more than McDonald's. A family greengrocer must pay $5 an hour more than Woolworths.

President Trump on Tuesday signed a far-reaching executive order that dismantles many of the pillars—

Senator ROBERTS:
  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. Your perceptiveness is admired and appreciated. You have it correct. President Trump said that he is:


… ending the theft of American prosperity, and rebuilding our beloved country.


We actually agree with the Labor Party that low- and middle-income Australians are continuing to lose out under the Turnbull government. The Turnbull government is pushing a 28 per cent renewable energy target, and that has helped destroy South Australia. The Labor Party is pushing a 50 per cent renewable energy target countrywide, and that will destroy Australia. But the Greens, the people who think that money comes out of the sky, want a 90 per cent renewable energy target, and that is going to cost every low- and middle-income earner amazing amounts of money. It will destroy this country and destroy jobs. What is more, energy prices are rising, and rising rapidly, and energy is now important in every family's life. Every family's cost of living is affected directly and indirectly as rising energy costs cascade through the economy. It is a highly regressive tax on low- and middle-income earners. 


Labor actually wants to apply a carbon dioxide tax, an emissions trading scheme, which is yet another highly regressive impost on low- and middle-income earners. What is more, it is an open-ended, upward-ratcheting tax that is designed to give money to the United Nations. We have a double taxation agreement that was signed by the Liberal Party in 1953. I calculate that we have had—three, 13, six—22 years of Labor government since then, and not one of those Labor governments has even mentioned the double taxation agreement that is ripping off Australians. Only our party have done that, and we are making moves to end that double taxation— (Time expired)

"Polley, Sen Helen",ALP,2017-03-29,"



Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania) (17:23):  I rise to speak about all the ways that this government has undermined low- and middle-income Australians. This government only looks after the big end of town. We heard it from Senator Smith in his contribution. He does not like big unions, big business and big government being in bed with one another. But it is all right for those on that side to give big business $50 billion worth of tax cuts. That is all right!


Let me put on the record just a few facts about what the Turnbull government have done to Australian families. They have been slicing and dicing household budgets with cuts to family payments, Medicare, health and education. They have supported cutting the take-home pay of hundreds of thousands of hardworking Australians who already live from pay cheque to pay cheque. That is the reality. When people who work in hospitality and retail come to you, if they ring your office or they talk to you in the street, they are in tears because they do not know how they are going to be able to support their children at school to give them the same opportunities as their classmates. But that is all right, according to those on the other side—because that is what they believe in. We know that they have consistently undermined and cut the education system in this country. 


We had another contribution from Senator Smith, who actually surprised me when he talked about the new childcare package, because one in three families are going to be worse off. I also would have thought that as a Western Australian senator he might have had a bit of interest in what is happening to people who live in regional Australia. Because Western Australia is so vast, there are regional and rural areas, and there are also remote areas. The cuts the government have made in regional Australia have been to services that were there providing early education for the children of our Aboriginal brothers and sisters. But, no, that is all right! As long as no-one else is in bed with the big end of town, then that is all right!


Senator Smith also touched on penalty rates. Now, we know that the cut to penalty rates is going to have an enormous impact on those who depend on penalty rates to make their budget stretch as far as it can. They do not use their penalty rates for luxury items; that is just not the way real people live. People depend on those penalty rates. We know that families rely on them to pay their electricity bill and take care of the kids' excursions so they can go with their classmates. All of these things that this government has done have been about one thing, and that is making sure that people who are low-income workers, people who rely on benefits, are kept down where they belong, because that is in their DNA. That is how reckless this government is. Imagine if you suddenly got a pay cut and you knew it would take you 17 years to get back to your current wage. How would you feel? Well, 700,000 Australians, 40,000 of them from my home state of Tasmania, are facing those very cuts to penalty rates. 


That is without the extension that we know is going to incorporate other sectors—and what are they? They are predominantly industries in which low-paid women are working. And why are they doing that? They are working to try and get ahead to give their kids opportunities and to support their families so that they can make a contribution to the economy. And what they do because they have such low wages? They expend all their money. They do not have huge bank accounts. They do not have investment properties. They do not have shares. What they have is some self-respect. They have self-respect because they can send their children on school excursions and they are able to meet their bills. They do not go away on holiday. They do not go out to luxurious restaurants. They do not go on overseas trips. All they are trying to do is get by, each and every day. That is the reality. 


If you have never, ever been in those circumstances, then it is very hard to understand—and I give you that. So I can understand why the Prime Minister does not have any empathy for these people. It is because he has never had to do it. But when you have to do it day in, day out, it is really hard, and it is very hard as a parent to say to your children, 'No, you cannot go to the cinema, because I just cannot afford it,' or, 'No, we cannot go to the Gold Coast, because we cannot afford it.' That is very difficult for parents. It is very, very difficult. (Time expired)

Senator LEYONHJELM
 (New South Wales) (17:28):  It takes a lot of gall for Labor to propose this debate about low- and middle-income Australians continuing to lose out under the Turnbull government, because last Thursday Labor voted against reducing childcare subsidies for family with incomes between $200,000 and $350,000. Labor was even reluctant to support the removal of childcare subsidies for families with incomes over $350,000. It was Senator Hinch and me who backed the Turnbull government into a corner to support the removal of high-income subsidies.


While Labor says it cares about low- and middle-income Australians, on Thursday it demonstrated that it cares more about high-income Australians continuing to get subsidies funded by low- and middle-income Australians. By fighting for minimum wages and mandatory penalty rates, Labor is keeping our unemployment queues long and the very poorest Australians poor. That the foremost expert in Australia on the job destroying effects of minimum wages is none other than the shadow Assistant Treasurer, Professor Andrew Leigh, does not seem to dissuade Labor one iota.


Finally, Labor is the defender in chief of the renewable energy target and wants to make 50 per cent of our energy renewable. This results in the poorest Australians being asked to decide whether they want air conditioning in summer, heating in winter or food. They will never be able to afford all three. While Labor pretends to care about everyday Australians, it continually panders to those high-income voters who pretend to be middle class. The light on the hill is out.

In accordance with the committee's legislative mandate under section 7(a) of the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011 the committee examines the compatibility of recent bills and legislative instruments with Australia's obligations under international human rights law.

 (Tasmania) (17:33):  I present the report of the Senate Environment and Communications References Committee on closures of electricity generators, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.


Ordered that the report be printed.




Senator WHISH-WILSON:
  I move:


That the Senate take note of the report.



This references committee and the inquiry has been going for some time. We had an interim report going into the double dissolution mid last year. We finally concluded what has been a very long series of travelling around the country and a series of meetings on a very important subject.


This committee has made a series of strong recommendations. I have yet to see the details of dissenting reports by the government and by Labor, but I will generally express that I am disappointed that the committee was unable to have a strong recommendation and have cross-party support to that recommendation, because this issue is incredibly important. This is not just about how we transition to a clean energy future and meet our COP 21, our global, targets under Paris. This is also about how we as a country provide certainty for coal communities—communities around coal fired power stations and communities around coal mines.


Chairing this committee in its final stages, there was very clear evidence to me both in New South Wales and in Western Australia—and I reviewed the Hansard transcripts from other inquiries—from stakeholders, including people living in the community. For example, we heard from community organisers in Collie in Western Australia, unions who represent workers and local government who rely on the businesses in their area. There was a unanimous call for politicians to work together to provide a plan, to provide certainty and to provide leadership for their communities. That is what they wanted. We asked them the questions directly. Even when they answered them, the government senators, who clearly did not want a transition plan, continued to ask the same questions just to be sure: 'Are you sure you want to plan for transition? Are you sure you do not want your coal mines and coal fired power stations to continue into the future?' The evidence I heard was very clear. These stakeholders said, 'We accept it's inevitable, under climate change and a world that is moving to reduce emissions, that the writing is on the wall for coal fired power stations in this country. We need to move to other forms of base load power.'


In the final stages of the committee hearings, the government introduced the concept of clean coal into the inquiry. A number of questions were asked of expert witnesses, including engineers who have worked on coal fired power stations, and I believe the committee heard very clear evidence that it was not viable. It was not commercially viable and it was not viable from a productivity point of view. We spoke to the finance experts, and there was no-one out there lining up to finance a coal fired power station in this country—except, as we learnt at Senate estimates a couple of weeks ago, Mr Clive Palmer, who put in a rogue bid to the Clean Energy Finance Corporation to finance a clean-coal power station. 


I want to reiterate the point that the communities who presented to this inquiry, who came to meet with the senators, presented the very clear evidence that they wanted politicians to work together and actually have a plan. That is what they asked for. They will look at this report and they will look at the three dissenting reports from three political parties, and they will be gutted that we could not do our job and come together as a polity in this place and provide a plan for transition out of coal fired power stations, a plan that gives workers and the communities that rely on them the certainty that they need. What we have seen instead is short-term political populism and opportunism.


It was clear as daylight to me during the hearings that the strategy of the Liberal-National Party coalition was to talk up clean coal and to talk up a viable future for these coal fired power stations. The strategy was designed to put pressure on One Nation in marginal seats where these coalminers and coal fired power stations are located. For the government, this is a short-term political strategy to head off One Nation at the pass. But what it is going to do is set us back years on going down the road of a just transition around coal fired power in this country—let alone on going down the path of meeting our global targets and the impact of emissions. And of course, very sadly, there is the impact on our environment. 


We have seen the new data coming through in recent weeks about the Great Barrier Reef. It is just horrifying to imagine that the biggest living organism in the world is dying. You can say whatever you want about bleeding hearts; it is absolutely appalling that this has happened on our watch. The recommendations in the report of the committee, which I chaired, are very strong. They are very strong on providing certainty for the communities that rely on coal fired power stations now, and they are very certain about how to get us to a point where we can invest more heavily in renewables. 


I am going to briefly run through some of the key recommendations. The first recommendation is:


… that the Australian Government adopt a comprehensive energy transition plan, including reform of the National Electricity Market rules.


I think just about everyone we heard from was unambiguously asking for that. 


Recommendation 2 is:


The committee recommends that the Australian Government, in consultation with industry, community, union and other stakeholders, develop a mechanism for the orderly retirement of coal fired power stations to be presented to the COAG Energy Council.


Once again, go back and check the Hansard. It is what we were asked to do by the community.


Recommendation 3 is:


The committee recommends that the Australian Government, through representation on the COAG Energy Council, put in place a pollution reduction objective consistent with Australia's obligations under the Paris Agreement in the National Electricity Objectives.


Recommendation 4 is:


The committee recommends that the Australian Government establish an energy transition authority—


That was also in the interim recommendations going into the double-dissolution—


with sufficient powers and resources to plan and coordinate the transition in the energy sector, including a Just Transition for workers and communities.


That was also a key recommendation from nearly every stakeholder that we met with. 


Recommendation 5 covers air pollution and the evidence that the committee heard around existing coal fired power stations and the health impacts of those. This includes setting up a national pollution inventory. We also heard about the limitations of state environmental protection authorities that monitor these things. 


Recommendation 6 is:


The committee recommends that the Commonwealth and state energy ministers should undertake a national audit of likely rehabilitation costs …


We heard about the massive blow-out in expected costs in rehabilitating the Hazelwood power station. Recommendation 6 continues:


The committee recommends that the Commonwealth and state energy ministers should also work to develop a common approach to setting rehabilitation bonds to ensure that rehabilitation costs are properly provisioned for.


We heard evidence that if coal companies properly set out those liabilities a lot of them would probably be broke, because those liabilities are so significant under a transition plan. So, once again, for industry and for investors, we need a plan that provides certainty around these kinds of things. 


Recommendation 7 covers the commitment to expanded renewable energy investment in this country, to provide base load power, including battery powered storage and changes to the grid. 


Recommendation 8 is:


The committee recommends that the Australian Government commit to not provide any direct funding, subsidies or other support for the construction of new coal fired power stations in Australia.


That is absolutely critical if we are going to get on and tackle global warming. 


Recommendation 9, the last recommendation, is:


The committee recommends that the Australian Government reverse its ideological opposition to the introduction of a scheme for managing the transition in the electricity sector such as an Emissions Intensity Scheme or the setting of pollution intensity standards and commit to considering fairly all policy options presented by the forthcoming final report of the Finkel Review.


The Finkel review of course is going to be very important as an overarching review in relation to this committee report. 


Let me finish by saying this. This was a very important inquiry, which Labor and the Greens initiated. It took a long time to get to this point. We have a series of very important recommendations from the committee. I look forward to reading Labor's dissenting report. But let me say this: if Labor are not going down the road of providing a just transition plan and giving certainty to workers and communities, and of course meeting global emissions targets, I will be bitterly disappointed, and not just as a senator. I think communities in this country who expect politicians to stand up and work together and get this done will be bitterly disappointed. Let's be totally frank about this: we will have let these people down if we cannot get a plan to transition out of coal fired power stations. (Time expired)

That this bill be now read a second time.


I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



BIOSECURITY AMENDMENT (BALLAST WATER AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2017


The Biosecurity Amendment (Ballast Water and Other Measures) Bill 2017 will help in our fight to manage biosecurity risks and further strengthen Australia's biosecurity system.


A strong biosecurity system contributes to a strong economy. Our agricultural industries are forecast to earn $60 billion in 2016-17. 


Today threats to our biosecurity can emerge faster than ever before. The recent global outbreak of Zika virus, spread by mosquitoes, has shown us how important control of disease-carrying pests is.


This Bill will provide additional powers to control exotic mosquitoes and other disease carriers at Australia's airports and seaports, including on incoming aircraft and vessels. 


This includes spraying insecticide to kill mosquitoes capable of carrying Zika virus as well as other disease-carrying vectors so they don't establish populations in Australia.


The Bill gives us the ability to direct airports and seaports to control such incursions.


The Bill will strengthen Australia's ability to manage ballast water in ships. It will provide additional protection for fisheries and coastal environments from the risk of marine pest incursions by fostering new, more effective, ballast water treatment technologies, and phasing out ballast water exchange.


The Bill will position us to ratify the International Convention for the Control and Management of Ships' Ballast Water and Sediment. 


This Convention was adopted in 2004 and signed by the Howard Government in 2005. It is a key international measure for protecting marine environments. It aims to stop the global spread of potentially invasive and harmful aquatic organisms that can cause havoc to marine ecosystems. These organisms can be transported in the ballast water of ships travelling around the world and can effect biodiversity and lead to substantial economic loss to our maritime industries.


The Convention is an important global initiative involving over fifty countries. It will come into force internationally on 8 September 2017 and we hope to ratify it this year.


For Australians more broadly, these amendments mean there is much less risk of infection with viruses such as Zika. It also means we can continue to enjoy the sea and all the joy that it brings us.


Strengthening Australia's biosecurity system through these legislative amendments means we can continue to enjoy our unique environment, and way of life. 


Debate adjourned.


Ordered that the resumption of the debate be made an order of the day for a later hour.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (18:20):  I move:


That the Social Security (Administration) (Trial Area) Amendment Determination 2017, made under the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999, be disallowed [F2017L00210]. 


This is about disallowing the extension of the trials into the cashless welfare card. These trials, as I am sure people are aware, are in Ceduna in South Australia and the East Kimberley in Western Australia. In the East Kimberley, the trial has basically focused on the towns of Kununurra and Wyndham. Despite the failure of the Northern Territory intervention and income management, which is clearly articulated in the final evaluation of the report which I have spoken about many times in this place, the government decided to proceed with a trial of the cashless welfare card, the cashless debit card, which quarantined 80 per cent of a person's income support. Not satisfied with trying to quarantine 50 per cent of a person's income support in the Northern Territory, they are now trying to quarantine 80 per cent. Recipients were told the trial would be for a year. They were not consulted about the trial going ahead in Ceduna or in the East Kimberley. As a slight sop to Senator Xenophon, a so-called public meeting was called in Ceduna after the event of the legislation going through, but recipients were not adequately consulted, and the government hand-picked people they called leaders in the community to give the okay to the trial.


Recipients were told that the trial would be for a year. On the day it was supposed to finish in Ceduna, the government announced that they would be extending the trial in Ceduna and in the Kimberley. They released an evaluation report, but up to that time people that were existing on the card in Ceduna had no idea of what their future was: were they going to be stuck on the card or were they coming off? I must say that, given that the government had not been talking about any transition approach, I was extremely suspicious that in fact the government was going to find some way of trying to extend the card, and of course we now have this regulation before us which I am seeking to disallow. The government, as I said, announced only on the day the trial was due to end in Ceduna that they would be extending it, and I have to say it was distressing news for many recipients who are trapped on the card and have expressed that concern to me.


The cashless welfare card restricts anyone on a working age income support payment to just 20 per cent cash and 80 per cent on the card. That is supposedly to stop spending on alcohol, drugs or gambling. As anticipated, the yearlong trial, supported by both the government and the opposition, has turned out to be a rubber stamp, spruiked with premature evidence, anecdotes and ideology for the entire year of the trial. Last year, journalists were sent bits and pieces from a so-called interim confidential report. When you followed it up straightaway, you could not get the report—strange, that! It was some sort of secret report. But, when I questioned the Department of Social Services in estimates, they were very clear at the time that no such report existed. I was fairly persistent about this. As people that know of my long-term engagement in this issue will know, I am persistently asking questions about income management and the cashless welfare card in estimates. No report existed.


Miraculously, a week and a half later, a report appeared that had very clearly been thrown together and that sought to justify the minister's and the government's claims that the trial was going really well. Unfortunately, there was not a proper analysis of the raw datasets that were thrown into the report. Those were not questioned. The sweeping statements and anecdotal feedback were treated by the government as if they were gospel. It was very clear that it was nothing more than a set of anecdotal comments that the minister and some departmental staff had been talking about.


The government is now justifying the trial continuation on the basis of the wave 1 interim evaluation report, which was done by Orima. It is the first part of the evaluation of the sites. Surprise, surprise! The government is saying how successful the trial is and extending the trial beyond the initial period. I have to say I am really not surprised, because that is what we thought would happen all the time. That is what we warned the opposition about, and that is exactly what has come to pass.


The government are claiming this is proof of concept. It is so far from it that it is unbelievable, but they are still claiming it is proof of concept and that it justifies them extending the trial when half—I should be correct here: 49 per cent, or half, basically—of the participants on the card are saying they are worse off on the card. The KPIs that the Orima report talks about are not even the same as the aims of the legislation. So we are measuring these KPIs, and they are not actually about the aims that are contained in the legislation and that the government said they are aiming for. But just look at a couple of them; I am not going to reel off the whole of the report. Look at 'Output KPIs—performance rated fully effective/KPI target achieved'. Tell me how anybody that is actually reading this without rose-tinted glasses on could take that from this. It says:


The Wave 1 survey—


I will come back to the dubious survey process in a minute—


found that (on average across the two Trial sites)—


so here we are averaging the information—


25% of CDCT—


cashless debit card trial—


participants and 13% of their family members reported drinking alcohol less frequently since the Trial commenced …


Twenty-five per cent—oh, good! I can see that KPI is met! They are saying 25 per cent is successful when half of the participants are saying they are worse off. They ignore that but say 25 per cent say they have drunk less.


Let's come to the survey. The survey is basically push-polling. We saw this in some of the dubious evaluations that were carried out on the Northern Territory intervention, where they did the same sort of thing. They asked participants, 'Are you gambling less?' Well, of course they are going to say they are gambling less if they are going to try to get off the BasicsCard up there. 'Are you looking after your children?' They know it is a government backed survey. Will they say, 'Oh, no, I'm not looking my children and I'm not feeding them'? They will say, 'Of course I'm feeding them better.' That is not a proper evaluation of the success or otherwise of the card.


The report goes on about other particular issues. It says:


The Wave 1 survey found that (on average across the two Trial sites), around a quarter of CDCT participants who reported using illegal drugs before the Trial commenced indicated that they had been using illegal drugs less often …


Again, wouldn't you expect people to be saying, 'Yes, we're using drugs less often?' Only a quarter of those, by the way, said they were using drugs less often, yet this trial is supposedly a proof of concept and an outstanding success. No, it is not.


Then let's look at an example of the outstanding qualitative evidence they are supposed to have.


The following positive impacts of the CDCT on drug use were identified by the qualitative research:


A couple of stakeholders had directly spoken with CDCT participants who had reduced and/or stopped their drug use as a result of the CDCT, including:


o   A CDCT participant who had previously been addicted to methamphetamines (ice) but had stopped using ice due to limited access to cash …


That's a great evidence base, isn't it?


o   A family who was now consuming less marijuana due which had allowed them to spend more money on clothes and food …


o   A few stakeholders felt—


they just felt—


that the frequency of marijuana usage had reduced due to limited access to cash.


They felt it? Come on, what sensible, thinking person who actually looks at scientific rigorous evaluation thinks this is an adequate evaluation and proof of concept? You are push-polling people who are, of course, going to say they are drinking less alcohol, when they are asked by a survey mob they know is reporting to government. Of course you are going to get a biased sample saying, 'Yes, we drink less. Yes, we're looking after our kids better. Yes, we're not gambling so much.'


The evaluation report, in fact, reports against just one of the government's supposed four aims of the trial, specifically the aim to reduce the amount of certain restricted payments available to be spent on alcoholic beverages, gambling and illegal drugs. This aim is not proved. I have just read out to you that only 25 per cent of the participants say that.


First, they are connecting the two trials, which means you cannot get an effective clear picture of East Kimberley and Ceduna independent of each other. Second, alcohol restrictions make it virtually impossible to make any clear analysis of the impact of the card. The report largely ignores the alcohol restrictions in Kununurra—in fact, a report has just come out on that. I know the community up there is very concerned, because I have had contact from them that the report is ignoring the work that has been happening around alcohol restrictions. It needs to look at that. They cannot draw the conclusion that it has been successful in relation to alcohol, because they simply do not have the proper data. Third, there is poor analysis of how recipients are getting around the card. The police still think there is a problem with alcohol. The report says that it is not reporting on how people get around the cards. I will come back to that in a minute.


Aim 2, to determine whether there was a reduction or decrease in violence or harm in the trial area, was not properly examined. The increase in domestic violence is, strategically, not reported—neither are the rates of suicide, self-harm, anxiety or depression. As well as this, the key up-to-date statistics from the South Australian and WA police have been left out of the report. In the South Australian trial site and the areas surrounding that, they have seen a large jump in robbery and related offences, up 111 per cent. Aggravated robbery is up 120 per cent, non-aggravated robbery is up 400 per cent and serious crime trespass is up 20 per cent. Where is that in the evaluation report? How is that proof of concept?


Aim 3, to determine whether such arrangements are more effective when community bodies are involved, is not examined. In this regard, the failure of the panel and the collective community action against the card has been omitted from the report. There has been no assessment of the involvement of the leadership groups and the panel process. People do not know who are on the community panels—they do not know their faces. The department admitted that in estimates. The department said, 'We are not releasing the names of the panel.' These people are being judged by their neighbours and by their peers, but they do not know who is judging them when they try and get either an exemption or a reduction from, say, 80 per cent to 50 per cent of their money quarantined.


Similarly, there has been a lot of concern expressed, and that is why community groups, individuals and participants are concerned about the card. You have to question the amount of money that is being given out—and I will come to that quickly on Ceduna—in relation to this trial and how it has impacted on community groups. You have to wonder whether they are more supportive of the card because they think that they will not get the additional funding that has been going into communities. The fact that the communities do not know who is judging them is deeply concerning. Lastly, aim 4 is to encourage socially responsible behaviour. That aim is not examined either.


People are getting around the card, for example, by shopping. I have visited the Kununurra trial site and I have spoken to people who have supported the card, to people who have opposed the card, to participants and to some of the leaders up there. It is fair to say that the community is very divided over the card. You do not have to be up there long to find out some of the ways they are getting around the card. One of those is through shopping. One of the things that the proponents of the card and people who were supportive in the community—non-participants—were saying about the card was, 'Oh, you see a lot more Aboriginal people in the supermarket.' Do you know what is happening? Card holders are going to people that have cash, are doing their shopping for them and are then keeping the cash while putting the shopping on their card. One person said to me, 'They're walking around the supermarket with a list.' That is because they are buying food for somebody else. That is just one way that they are getting around the card.


For the reasons outlined above, it has simply not been demonstrated, and there is simply no clear evidence to show, that the trials meet the four aims or provide proof of concept. Other concerns raised with me include the extremely poor research in the report and the inclusion of views of non-participants in the report. The difference is very clear when you look at participants and non-participants. Non-participants have a higher rate of thinking that the card has been successful and people's lives are better. People are looking at other people and saying, 'Your life's better because you are on the card.' Whereas, the people on the card are saying, 'No, it's not.'


As I said, it has divided the community. There was a complete lack of consultation. Claiming that there has been any improvement as a result of the card—just the card, not the services—is ridiculous, particularly when you look at the extent and the breadth of the funding that has gone into the services in Ceduna. I am not for one minute arguing against the fact that we should be putting money into these communities to improve services. I strongly argue that we should be, and that communities are disadvantaged to the extent that they are because these resources have not been going in. Why is there no adequate discussion of this in the report? They write it off by saying, 'A lot of people didn't know about the services, so they obviously haven't used them, so they obviously haven't had an impact.' I do not think that is a fair conclusion to draw.


There is no mention in the report of cost; no attempt has been made to calculate the net benefit. Given the government's ongoing narrative about budget stress and the need for budget savings, wouldn't you think they would be looking at it if this is in fact a cost-effective way of addressing disadvantage? I argue very strongly that this needs to be addressed. I do not disagree with the government on that point at all.


Eva Cox has been doing some analysis of the report, and has done a paper on that. She says: 'The lack of serious scrutiny of the data on outcomes of the trial to date is deeply concerning. This program is flaunted as being aimed at fixing the supposed problems of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and is also a wider experiment in income support reform. The inadequate scrutiny of the program could well be linked to racialised assumptions that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are somehow less capable of managing their money and should have their affairs controlled, regardless of whether they drink or have other behavioural issues. Some assumptions are then extended to others receiving working age payments and eventually may extend even further. In the report, recipients are in fact blamed for the majority of cases where the card was declined at stores, in fact I spoke to a number of people who were in the situation where their card was declined, and I would suggest the people I spoke to would make valiant attempts to use the card.'


It goes on to say, 'There should be more education to assist participants to be more confident'—in other words, putting the blame back on the participant. The minister's claim that the report provided him with 'strong, independent evaluation results' is disturbing, and is in fact a myth. There is no clear proof of concept, because there is no independent data confirming validity of any of the claims or anecdotal evidence put forward in the preliminary report.


This is flawed research and flawed evaluation for the government, but when you think about it the government always wanted to extend this trial. We have already had numerous people out there saying they want to extend it to young people, they want to extend it nationally or to the regions. This trial is based on the government's ideology, not on evidence. We know that from the Northern Territory intervention. That is indisputable. This approach should be abandoned. The trial should finish and the government should invest the money that they are spending on this on better services and better ways of achieving outcomes we all so desperately want. I urge the chamber to support the disallowance.

"Kakoschke-Moore, Sen Skye",NXT,2017-03-29,"



Senator KAKOSCHKE-MOORE
 (South Australia) (18:40):  The Nick Xenophon Team will not be supporting this disallowance. The cashless debit card trials in Ceduna and the East Kimberley have attracted their fair share of critics. However, what is frequently overlooked is the level of support for these trials, especially from Indigenous leaders in these communities.


The independent Wave 1 interim evaluation report produced by ORIMA Research concluded that overall the cashless debit card trial has been effective to date in terms of its performance against the key performance indicators established in the evaluation framework. The report says:


In particular, the Trial has been effective in reducing alcohol consumption, illegal drug use and gambling – establishing a clear 'proof-of-concept' and meeting the necessary preconditions for the planned medium-term outcomes in relation to reduced levels of harm related to these behaviours.


The report claims that the findings:


… indicate that the reductions in these behaviours have been largely driven by the impact of the debit card quarantining mechanism and not by the additional services provided via the CDCT package or factors external to—


the debit card. The report acknowledges:


At this interim stage there is only limited evidence of early impacts on crime, violence, injuries and perceptions of safety … these medium-term outcomes were not expected to be seen in this timeframe and will be the focus of Wave 2 of the evaluation.


I will briefly speak to these conclusions.


Firstly though, I want to note that while the evaluation appears to be comprehensive in terms of consideration of KPIs and did include a survey of the local population in the trial communities, there is no substitute for direct engagement with community members and leaders and on-the-ground experience. I have visited Ceduna twice since I was elected, for a total period of three days, meeting a number of organisations and services and chatting to residents on the street. That is because it was important to me to hear directly from the local community about their experiences, rather than forming an opinion based on what I thought residents might think or what was being reported in the media. To anyone in this place who has views about the card, especially strong views about this card, I encourage you to visit these communities. I encourage you to speak with those who are living the experience. To not hear directly from those who are participating in the trial and those who are living around them is, in my view, an abrogation of our duties as parliamentarians.


If I had to summarise the views of the individuals, businesses, community groups, health workers and NGOs I have spoken to I would say this: the trial seems to be working, but it is still too early to tell. When I first went over at the end of September last year, the general feeling was that the card was working, but there was a lack of data and information in the community to support that perception. But it was also noted that the services that essentially support the trial were vital to any change. For example, the Mobile Assistance Patrol, which provides transport for individuals affected by alcohol or other drugs who are at risk of harm to themselves or others. The bus also results in an increase of admissions to other health services, such as the sobering up unit, by providing transport to this facility instead of those people spending their night on the streets. This highlights the difficulty in interpreting data without the full picture.


Issues that were raised with the card usage were being resolved relatively quickly with services such as the Ceduna Aboriginal Corporation helping cardholders with financial management and issues such as lost cards. The inability to obtain a balance at an ATM had been a common complaint, which was also worked through. Some services noted they could operate better if the positions which were created under the CDC package were able to be filled by qualified staff before the CDC trial started and if there was better retention of staff in general—a challenge faced by many services in rural and remote communities.


I spoke with some local Indigenous people who were walking by me on the street: one said the card was not working because he did not have 'enough cash for booze'; a young woman shrugged in response and said she thought it was ok. The people I spoke to who opposed the card seemed to do so because they fundamentally believed it was wrong to impose the card on welfare recipients, but many of these people were not on the card themselves.


I could go on and on about the feedback I have received, but I will now quickly turn to the data. The findings which were released last year by DSS and the latest by ORIMA can be difficult to interpret because, for example, with respect to crime statistics for Ceduna, the entire local service area is covered, which is a significant portion of the west coast of South Australia. Poker machine use also covers other towns, not just Ceduna. Alcohol stats in the ORIMA report are based on self-reporting. The local supermarket in Ceduna has apparently had a significant increase in trade, particularly of fruit and vegetables. The data shows that the purchases at the supermarket using the card have increased, but there are no stats for before the card was implemented.


As for findings in the ORIMA report, the survey found that on average in the two trial sites 25 per cent of trial participants reported drinking less frequently. Indicators relating to illegal drug use showed some improvement, with participants reporting less usage of illegal drugs since becoming CDCT participants. Gambling had reduced overall, and in Ceduna poker machine revenue was 12 per cent lower compared to January 2016. The report acknowledges that there remain issues such as the lack of awareness or understanding about card usage, and other criticisms such as community panels not being established in a timely manner.


Other issues have been faced by the community, such as grog running—on which I have engaged with the South Australian government, calling for legislative reform—and predatory payday lenders signing up debit card holders. Again, that is an issue that I have taken up with the federal government.


But, as I said earlier, at this time it is too early to draw definitive conclusions. Although feedback on whether the card is in fact working or not is mixed, in my experience the strongest and most desperate views came from the community leaders advocating for it to continue. Simply pulling the plug on the trial is not an option. The consequences of flooding an almost cashless community with cash would be dire. Multiple groups told me that, when money came into the community during the trial by way of inheritances, tax refunds or insurance payouts, alcohol consumption, violence and gambling spiked, and this is also reflected in the data.


If, in the future, community leaders decide that they no longer wish for the debit card to apply to their community, then a withdrawal plan would need to be in place. But it is the Nick Xenophon Team's position that, having engaged with the Ceduna community in particular and considering positive statistics in the independent evaluation with respect to gambling and alcohol consumption in particular as well, we should listen to the community leaders who have asked for the trial to continue.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2017-03-29,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (18:47):  Labor opposes the disallowance of the Social Security (Administration) (Trial Area) Amendment Determination 2017. We do not believe in a blanket approach to income quarantining. That is not an option for Labor to even consider. We do not believe it should be rolled out nationally. Senator Siewert has strong views on this, and the Greens have strong views, but people that we have engaged with have equally strong views, and people in the communities have equally strong views. Their views are in opposition to the views that the Greens have put here today.


This is an extremely tough issue. This is an issue about future generations as well as the generations that we have trying to deal with the problem now. We understand that the vast majority of people on income support are more than capable of managing their own finances, but the level of alcohol abuse in some communities just cannot be ignored. Labor supports community-driven initiatives designed to tackle alcohol abuse.


When I was listening to Senator Siewert, I had a look at the NACCHO Aboriginal health site, and there was a quote there. I will just read that quote. It is from the Wunan Foundation's Ian Trust, Desmond Hill and Gelganyem Trust chairman Ted Hall. They said:


It is our view that continuing to deliver the same programs we have delivered for the past 40 years will do nothing for our people and, besides wasting more time and money, will condemn our children and future generations to a life of poverty and despair,


Our children will continue to be removed from their families because their families are not safe, many of our children will be born with FASD (fetal alcohol spectrum disorder) and never be able to receive a good education, and a large percentage of our people will go to prison and, in some cases, commit suicide. We believe that this trial could be the catalyst for breaking the cycle of poverty and despair in the East Kimberley.


That is an equally strong opposite view from local community leaders in the Kimberley.


Senator Siewert talks about anecdotes and ideology. I do not think it should be about anecdotes. Labor does not say it should be about anecdotes. We do not believe it should be about ideology. We believe it should be about what the community wants, what the communities need and how we resolve these intergenerational problems. We support, as I have said, community-driven initiatives to tackle alcohol abuse.


We offered our support to the Cashless Debit Card Trial in both Ceduna and Kununurra. We did that because we consulted with local Indigenous communities, and the feedback we got was similar to the quote I gave. It was that people needed help; they needed support; and there was a huge problem that had to be dealt with. So we listened to the people in Ceduna and Kununurra and heard that they are desperate for action to tackle these issues in their communities. Community leaders in both locations offered their support for the Cashless Debit Card Trial. These communities wanted the trials to take place, and we will continue to listen to them in coming months.


The interim evaluation of the trials has also been made publicly available. The evaluation has found that overall the trial has been effective, in particular in reducing alcohol consumption, illegal drug use and gambling. The final evaluation is due to be completed in June this year. We will scrutinise the report and listen to people in both Ceduna and Kununurra about the trials. We will not simply rely on anecdotes or ideology that might underpin any of the arguments or issues; we will listen to the people of Ceduna and Kununurra about the trials.


We know that these problems cannot be ignored—and they will not be solved by income quarantining alone. We are not saying income quarantining will fix these problems. But there is a desperation amongst many of the community leaders and many in the community about trying to deal with these issues. That is why we gained a commitment from the government to provide additional supports for participating communities, including an initial $1 million for community services in Ceduna and an additional $1.3 million to support families in Kununurra. You cannot just put in a debit card and say that will solve the problem. There needs to be wraparound support. There needs to be mental health support. There needs to be health support. There needs to be drug and alcohol support. These are the issues that wrap around the debit card or that should be the fundamental issues that are dealt with in the community. 


These are complex, multidimensional problems; they are intergenerational problems; and they are social problems of great significance. The current approach to substance abuse in some areas of Australia is not working, and we must give proper consideration to new ways of addressing the tragic devastation of drug and alcohol abuse.


And it is not just Indigenous communities that are faced with drug and alcohol problems. I have not drunk for I think it is now 40 years. I know I cannot drink, so I do not drink, but I had lots of support to deal with that problem. Not many in Indigenous communities have the support that I had when I knew that I had an alcohol problem. This is an issue that has to be dealt with not just in Indigenous communities but also everywhere else. When I was listening to the debate earlier about taxation on alcohol, I kept thinking back not to the debates about how efficient the alcohol tax should be; I kept thinking back to what my life would have been like if I had not been able to get off alcohol. It would have been devastating. Look at the health problems many families have and the financial problems many families have. The family violence that comes from alcohol and drug abuse is huge, absolutely huge. So I do not find it intellectually substantial for people to come in and argue a point of view when they do not understand these other issues—that it is simply about a card. It is not about a card. It is about far more than a card. People are crying out for help, so there needs to be more help, and it is not just a card that will address the issue. So we have got to find other ways of addressing drug and alcohol abuse.


We do not support introducing a cashless debit card to all young people on social security under the age of 18. There is no formal proposal by the government to do that at this stage. We do not think that welfare quarantining can be useful unless it is well targeted. It has to be well targeted. And we do not believe it should be rolled out nationally. We do not believe in a blanket rollout. We certainly do believe that this is a trial that was requested and sought by community leaders and many in the communities, and we will have a look at the outcome of the second report. We will not simply look at the report, read the report and come to a conclusion.




Senator Siewert:
  Like you did with this one, then?




Senator CAMERON:
  Senator Siewert, you can interrupt all you like. You can yell all you like. I know how passionate you are about this, but you should put some of your passion aside and be a bit dispassionate about the issues that the Aboriginal communities and all communities in these areas are facing. We should look at what wraparound services need to be put in place and how we put finance into those areas that allow people to get out of the intergenerational social problems that are there.


So we take the view that the community has asked for this and we will look at it, but we will go back and talk to the communities. We will consult with the communities. We will make an assessment separate from a report as to how this is working out. We will talk to Indigenous leaders, we will talk to the Indigenous community and we will try and make the best decisions we can in relation to this. We will not have just an ideological, blanket view. We will not engage in assertions that this is wrong. We will not engage in assertions that this is not helping the community. We will have a look at it and we will analyse it, because alcohol and drugs in the community are a big problem. 


I have heard it said that alcohol is part of Australian culture. Well, for many, it is a bad part of Australian culture; it is not a good part of Australian culture. I am not a wowser. I do not say people cannot drink. I just recognise that as an alcoholic I cannot drink. I have actually talked to Indigenous people who did not have the support that I had to deal with that terrible disease of alcoholism. People need help. They need support. This card is seen as one way to do that. But there are many more things we will have to do in relation to this. So I stand by Labor's position that we will have a look at the report, engage with the community, talk to Indigenous leaders and other community leaders, and make a decision about this. But we will not support—we will certainly not support—a blanket rollout of this card across the country. 


I think the alcohol industry should be doing a bit more to put funding into these communities to support them. As part of any trial, I would call on the alcohol industry to look at what they can do in a positive way in these communities, instead of just taking profits out of these communities, putting more people into poverty and creating bigger problems. There is not just a need for the Greens, Labor, crossbenchers, the Liberals and the Nationals to debate these issues here; there has to be an approach, I think, where the industry that is making a profit out of people's misery actually does something constructive.


For some time we have called for an alcohol summit in this country. I believe that there should be an alcohol summit, and that could go hand-in-hand with a drug summit. We need to talk about these issues. We need to deal with them in a dispassionate manner. We need to look at the devastation that has been wrought on our communities in relation to these issues. On that basis, we say this trial has still not been finalised.


We do not support a disallowance. We will look at this in a strategic manner. We will analyse the report. We will talk to the community. My view is we should also be talking to the alcohol industry. They have a contribution that they should be making in these communities as well.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2017-03-29,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (19:00):  One Nation will not be supporting Senator Siewert's motion to disallow the Social Security (Administration) (Trial Area) Amendment Determination 2017. I was fortunate enough to be invited, by Andrew Forrest, to a meeting with Aboriginals from Ceduna and Kununurra. That was the reason to sit down and talk to them with regard to this card. At that meeting, over a lengthy period of time, they explained to me about the card and what it meant to their communities. They said that it had improved their communities. They saw less domestic violence, they saw less drinking and they saw more children start to attend school. They thought it was far better in their communities. They were praising the card, and they expressed to me their opinion on that.


We talk about pouring more money in to deal with the Aboriginal issues. Yes, there is a drinking problem. Yes, there are drugs. There are problems, such as domestic violence, that are not only in their communities. We see domestic violence throughout Australia. In dealing with the problems there over the years, I have seen billions of dollars being thrown at this whole thing to deal with the Aboriginals. Years ago I called it an Aboriginal industry. It was costing Australian taxpayers billions of dollars. If anyone spoke out about it, complained or questioned where the money went they were called 'racist'—you could not talk about it. I think it needs to be talked about openly and honestly.


I have been informed that we spend approximately $5.6 billion a year to deal with Aboriginal issues. Senator Siewert mentioned that we should put more money into services. I have just been over to Western Australia, and I visited Kalgoorlie. They are having a huge problem with the Aboriginal people there that are coming to town. They are accessing alcohol. They are sleeping on the streets. The councillors are saying, 'We don't know how to deal with this whole issue.' They informed me that there are about 170 different agencies, and yet they have this problem. The agencies do not work together. They do not communicate with each other. There is no cross-referencing of anything. We have this ongoing problem. The agencies only work from nine to five, and nothing happens after that period of time. The police have their hands tied. They do not know how to deal with this issue.


Having the card, as we have seen and as they have told me, restricts them from spending money on alcohol and on drugs. There is another issue. With the Aboriginal community usually if someone has something they must share it with the rest of the community. If a family comes along then they share what they have, whether it be money, alcohol or whatever they have. That is their culture. That card cannot be transferred to anyone else. When they know that they cannot get money from that card to gamble, to buy alcohol, to buy cigarettes or to buy drugs then the money is used wisely—to feed the kids, to buy decent food and to pay the bills. That is important. That is what this is all about.


If we really care about these people and want to do something about it we have to have an opinion and work together to help them. Regardless of whether they are Aboriginal, whatever people they are, if anyone needs this assistance in a community then we should look at it. We should look into what the community wants. Clearly, in my discussions with them, this is what the community wants. It works for them.


For too long I have heard too many bleeding hearts saying their opinions without truly looking at the whole issue that is happening here. It is the same as when I went up to Palm Island years ago. I saw what was happening up there; I walked around the place. I had three men—one was as young as about 15, and he was drunk at around about two o'clock in the afternoon—say 'Pauline, we want to work.' That is what they want to do, but no-one wants to get involved or say anything. I was accused of going up there, and I was called a racist. This is what is happening. They want someone to stand up and speak up for them, because they have real problems and real issues.


We need to start making the tough decisions and start really investigating what is happening. There is an Aboriginal industry out there. There are people who are abusing the system and ripping off taxpayers' dollars. It is not going where it is supposed to be going. Everyone shuts down, because it is taboo—you cannot talk about it. I believe in having an honest discussion about this. We should talk about it, because I know these people are.


I went to a meeting in 1998. I had all the media there. I had about 12 Aboriginal women and children who were in the room. They held up my hand and said, 'We have been hoping and praying for someone like Pauline Hanson to come along, because our women are being bashed and raped, and our kids are glue sniffing.' Nothing was reported, because they could not possibly do that. All these years I have been ridiculed about it, and what needs to be done is just openness and honesty. We need to talk about these issues that are happening, because they are crying out for it. 


When I went up to Port Hedland recently, two Aboriginal women came up to me and said: 'We need a royal commission into Aboriginal spending, about where the money goes. Where do our royalties go? Where does our money go?' They are questioning the whole system as well, because it is not going where it is supposed to go. They want to see improvements. They want to see their kids educated. They want to see law and order in their towns. They want decent housing. And it is not because the Australian taxpayer has not paid billions of dollars into this industry; they have. The Australian people have paid for this. But there are people who are not being accountable to taxpayers—and not to their own people. I have seen this over the years. 


I do support this, and I think we need to listen to the communities, and that is exactly what I have done. They do want this. And as regards those under 18 years of age getting this, I do support that. That is another thing that we must look at. As I have travelled Australia—and in rural and regional areas, and not only there but every place, we have a drug problem. There is a huge ice problem in this country. These kids are getting on the ice, because they cannot get jobs, because there is no future for them and because they are depressed, and so they get caught up in taking drugs. If the have cash in their pockets, of course they are going to buy the drugs. If having this cashless card means these kids cannot get cash to give to the drug dealers out there—these parasites that are feeding off them—then this may be the way to stop it, so that these kids can have a chance.


Forget about feeling soft and bleeding-heart over everything. Start making some touch decisions and ask the parents out there how they feel about it. Would the parents encourage this? Ask the Australian people if they want to see a cashless society for these kids that are under 18 years of age. Will it benefit them? Because a lot of these parents that I have spoken to would dearly love to have the right answers, and clean up the mess that this country is in. If we do not start dealing with the ice problem and the drugs, heaven help us and our future generations. Thank you.

Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (19:09):  I will not be supporting this either. As a matter of fact I have spent four or five days in Ceduna on a couple of different trips. I have heard all the positives. I have looked at all the help that Minister Tudge has put in there to make sure that the card makes it easy for people, so the help is sitting there. It was all aligned; it was all done well. I watched him, and, as soon as something came up, within 48 hours he fixed it. Everything has been thrown at this. 


When I was over there, it was nice to see—I walked up and down the streets for two days. I walked into most shops. I talked to—did not matter what colour skin they were—if they were outside the courts or they were inside the courts, I went and spoke to them. I went out to the communities. They want this card. First of all they are finding that their kids are taking lunch to school. They are getting breakfast. The elders are not getting bashed because the younger people in the community are not trying to get money out of them because they do not have any. That is a good result in itself. 


I can tell you that I feel really proud of myself as a taxpayer that I was feeding my son's ice habit, because that is where his social security benefit was going—to him and his mates! It makes me feel really proud that I was really a part of that! Every Australian is a part of that, because that is our tax and that is our money. I am not investing that money into the future of our kids, because that does not give our kids a future. That does not work. I watch my girlfriends that I grew up in public housing with, and their kids are not getting what they need and it is not just because they do not get much on welfare because their money is going elsewhere. I watch what comes into their households—and, I tell you what, organised crime is a very bad thing. The only people that are winning out of our taxpayers' money right now are those organised crime gangs out there. 


You cannot tell me that somebody who is on welfare—that 20 per cent cash that goes into their proper bank account—has any more cash left over than 20 per cent. If you have, then you probably do not need to be on welfare. By the time you pay your rent with the little bit of welfare you get—there is your rent; you put food on the table for your kids; you are paying your electricity bill—then you should not have any more money than 20 per cent left over. You are getting 20 per cent of that in cash. You cannot tell me in 10 years time there will actually be cash around. Everybody will be on cards. That is where we are heading. 


By feeding taxpayers' money into these people who already have issues what we are doing is feeding their habits, whether it is alcohol or drugs. It is absolutely disgusting. Fifty per cent of those on disability support pensions in Tasmania are on that because of drug and alcohol problems. And we are not doing anything about that. I absolutely commend Twiggy Forrest for what he has done. I have seen his 27 recommendations for creating parity, and I too—through the chair—like you, Senator Hanson, want that damn card rolled out to those kids under 18. I want it rolled out. I have seen kids out there. It was brought up in an ice committee last Friday—10 years of age and I said this and I have said it before: they are on ice pipes. What are mum and dad doing—that are on welfare? Where is the money coming from? You cannot tell me that kids that are under 18 years old should be spending that money on alcohol. They should not even be buying it. There is something terribly wrong.


We are not giving it to them as a gift. Welfare was never meant to be like that. Welfare is meant to help you when you are down and out. It is not meant to feed your habit. That is not on. And the sooner we get this card rolled out right across Australia for that first group, the better off we will be. That is the first generation we are going to start breaking. We are going to start breaking the cycle. Do you know how much heartache that is going to save families? Do you know how much money that is going to save the economy? Do you know how much that is going to lessen the impact on our public hospitals? 


That is what it will do. But let me tell you what: I do not want to take responsibility for my taxpayers' money feeding somebody else's son's ice habit. That is not on. That is why I will not be supporting this.


It is time to change, and sitting here and talking about it, taking years to do it, is only making it worse. Like I said, the people who are really benefiting from this are the organised crime gangs out there, and they are having a nice time taking advantage of our kids. For goodness sake, the trials are working and are doing well. But I do not need to see a trial, because I spent long enough on a disability support pension, on welfare. I saw it when I lived in public housing; I grew up in the damn thing. I could already sniff and see what this card would do before it was even given out for trial. I thought: 'Beauty! This is something that's finally going to work; we just have to iron out the creases as we go.'


A trial was a good idea. But those trials are nearly over, so let's get on the front foot and keep the momentum going. Let's get it out for those kids who are 17 years and under, because they should not be buying drugs or spending taxpayers' money on alcohol. It is not on. They get 20 per cent in cash and they do not need any more than that. The other 80 per cent should be helping them out with buying clothes or whatever. Twenty per cent is more than enough, and I do not want the momentum stopped. The Greens like to talk about social justice, but social justice is not taking taxpayers' money and making the situation worse by giving it to people to go and buy their ice or drugs or alcohol with.


It is rampant out there. I live in Tasmania, one of the most disadvantaged places in Australia. It makes me cry every time I walk outside my office, which is right near Kmart and outside a taxi rank. Do you know what the taxi people say?. They feed in to me. I know it is getting worse. They know who the dealers are. They are taking people to pick them up. This is what is going on out there. This is an absolutely chronic issue, and we now need to take it on lock, stock and barrel. Twenty per cent is enough, and that is why I will not be supporting this.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (19:17):  It looks like the government does not want to make a comment. In summing up and addressing this I want to make a few comments. I am passionate about this because I have looked at the evidence. I have looked at the Northern Territory intervention and the final evaluation, and I urge anybody looking at this debate to read that report. It did not meet any of its projected outcomes. It failed.


I want to explore this issue of people 'feeling' that things do better, because that evaluation showed that people there felt that things were improving. But, when the evaluators compared the evidence of what was changing on the ground with another community outside of the NT, there was no difference. People felt it was better. In fact, it was not better. That is why I am so passionate about where the report says 'people felt this'. It is all very well to feel it. The psychology suggests that, because people saw money being spent and a trial being done, they thought things were better. But the evidence is not there. Senator Cameron said he will look very carefully at the second report—well, please look very carefully at the interim report. Please look very carefully at this, because I spent quite a lot of time going through this report and showing that the evidence is not there.


I want to make a comment to those who are worried about 'the cash that will go back into these communities if we go off this trial'. That comment horrifies me, because what you are saying is that we always knew that this trial was inevitable and it was going to be entrenched because putting cash back into the community was in fact going to have a devastating impact. I know there are problems in these communities, and I am desperate to solve them, but this is not the way to do it.


With that, I urge you to support this. In the future you will look back, like people have done with the NT, and say it does not work. Even though the government is continuing with the NT intervention, the evidence shows that it has not been working. Please disallow this, and let us look at what really works. I am as passionate as anybody else in this chamber about trying to find out what really works.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (18:20):  I move:


That the Social Security (Administration) (Trial Area) Amendment Determination 2017, made under the Social Security (Administration) Act 1999, be disallowed [F2017L00210]. 


This is about disallowing the extension of the trials into the cashless welfare card. These trials, as I am sure people are aware, are in Ceduna in South Australia and the East Kimberley in Western Australia. In the East Kimberley, the trial has basically focused on the towns of Kununurra and Wyndham. Despite the failure of the Northern Territory intervention and income management, which is clearly articulated in the final evaluation of the report which I have spoken about many times in this place, the government decided to proceed with a trial of the cashless welfare card, the cashless debit card, which quarantined 80 per cent of a person's income support. Not satisfied with trying to quarantine 50 per cent of a person's income support in the Northern Territory, they are now trying to quarantine 80 per cent. Recipients were told the trial would be for a year. They were not consulted about the trial going ahead in Ceduna or in the East Kimberley. As a slight sop to Senator Xenophon, a so-called public meeting was called in Ceduna after the event of the legislation going through, but recipients were not adequately consulted, and the government hand-picked people they called leaders in the community to give the okay to the trial.


Recipients were told that the trial would be for a year. On the day it was supposed to finish in Ceduna, the government announced that they would be extending the trial in Ceduna and in the Kimberley. They released an evaluation report, but up to that time people that were existing on the card in Ceduna had no idea of what their future was: were they going to be stuck on the card or were they coming off? I must say that, given that the government had not been talking about any transition approach, I was extremely suspicious that in fact the government was going to find some way of trying to extend the card, and of course we now have this regulation before us which I am seeking to disallow. The government, as I said, announced only on the day the trial was due to end in Ceduna that they would be extending it, and I have to say it was distressing news for many recipients who are trapped on the card and have expressed that concern to me.


The cashless welfare card restricts anyone on a working age income support payment to just 20 per cent cash and 80 per cent on the card. That is supposedly to stop spending on alcohol, drugs or gambling. As anticipated, the yearlong trial, supported by both the government and the opposition, has turned out to be a rubber stamp, spruiked with premature evidence, anecdotes and ideology for the entire year of the trial. Last year, journalists were sent bits and pieces from a so-called interim confidential report. When you followed it up straightaway, you could not get the report—strange, that! It was some sort of secret report. But, when I questioned the Department of Social Services in estimates, they were very clear at the time that no such report existed. I was fairly persistent about this. As people that know of my long-term engagement in this issue will know, I am persistently asking questions about income management and the cashless welfare card in estimates. No report existed.


Miraculously, a week and a half later, a report appeared that had very clearly been thrown together and that sought to justify the minister's and the government's claims that the trial was going really well. Unfortunately, there was not a proper analysis of the raw datasets that were thrown into the report. Those were not questioned. The sweeping statements and anecdotal feedback were treated by the government as if they were gospel. It was very clear that it was nothing more than a set of anecdotal comments that the minister and some departmental staff had been talking about.


The government is now justifying the trial continuation on the basis of the wave 1 interim evaluation report, which was done by Orima. It is the first part of the evaluation of the sites. Surprise, surprise! The government is saying how successful the trial is and extending the trial beyond the initial period. I have to say I am really not surprised, because that is what we thought would happen all the time. That is what we warned the opposition about, and that is exactly what has come to pass.


The government are claiming this is proof of concept. It is so far from it that it is unbelievable, but they are still claiming it is proof of concept and that it justifies them extending the trial when half—I should be correct here: 49 per cent, or half, basically—of the participants on the card are saying they are worse off on the card. The KPIs that the Orima report talks about are not even the same as the aims of the legislation. So we are measuring these KPIs, and they are not actually about the aims that are contained in the legislation and that the government said they are aiming for. But just look at a couple of them; I am not going to reel off the whole of the report. Look at 'Output KPIs—performance rated fully effective/KPI target achieved'. Tell me how anybody that is actually reading this without rose-tinted glasses on could take that from this. It says:


The Wave 1 survey—


I will come back to the dubious survey process in a minute—


found that (on average across the two Trial sites)—


so here we are averaging the information—


25% of CDCT—


cashless debit card trial—


participants and 13% of their family members reported drinking alcohol less frequently since the Trial commenced …


Twenty-five per cent—oh, good! I can see that KPI is met! They are saying 25 per cent is successful when half of the participants are saying they are worse off. They ignore that but say 25 per cent say they have drunk less.


Let's come to the survey. The survey is basically push-polling. We saw this in some of the dubious evaluations that were carried out on the Northern Territory intervention, where they did the same sort of thing. They asked participants, 'Are you gambling less?' Well, of course they are going to say they are gambling less if they are going to try to get off the BasicsCard up there. 'Are you looking after your children?' They know it is a government backed survey. Will they say, 'Oh, no, I'm not looking my children and I'm not feeding them'? They will say, 'Of course I'm feeding them better.' That is not a proper evaluation of the success or otherwise of the card.


The report goes on about other particular issues. It says:


The Wave 1 survey found that (on average across the two Trial sites), around a quarter of CDCT participants who reported using illegal drugs before the Trial commenced indicated that they had been using illegal drugs less often …


Again, wouldn't you expect people to be saying, 'Yes, we're using drugs less often?' Only a quarter of those, by the way, said they were using drugs less often, yet this trial is supposedly a proof of concept and an outstanding success. No, it is not.


Then let's look at an example of the outstanding qualitative evidence they are supposed to have.


The following positive impacts of the CDCT on drug use were identified by the qualitative research:


A couple of stakeholders had directly spoken with CDCT participants who had reduced and/or stopped their drug use as a result of the CDCT, including:


o   A CDCT participant who had previously been addicted to methamphetamines (ice) but had stopped using ice due to limited access to cash …


That's a great evidence base, isn't it?


o   A family who was now consuming less marijuana due which had allowed them to spend more money on clothes and food …


o   A few stakeholders felt—


they just felt—


that the frequency of marijuana usage had reduced due to limited access to cash.


They felt it? Come on, what sensible, thinking person who actually looks at scientific rigorous evaluation thinks this is an adequate evaluation and proof of concept? You are push-polling people who are, of course, going to say they are drinking less alcohol, when they are asked by a survey mob they know is reporting to government. Of course you are going to get a biased sample saying, 'Yes, we drink less. Yes, we're looking after our kids better. Yes, we're not gambling so much.'


The evaluation report, in fact, reports against just one of the government's supposed four aims of the trial, specifically the aim to reduce the amount of certain restricted payments available to be spent on alcoholic beverages, gambling and illegal drugs. This aim is not proved. I have just read out to you that only 25 per cent of the participants say that.


First, they are connecting the two trials, which means you cannot get an effective clear picture of East Kimberley and Ceduna independent of each other. Second, alcohol restrictions make it virtually impossible to make any clear analysis of the impact of the card. The report largely ignores the alcohol restrictions in Kununurra—in fact, a report has just come out on that. I know the community up there is very concerned, because I have had contact from them that the report is ignoring the work that has been happening around alcohol restrictions. It needs to look at that. They cannot draw the conclusion that it has been successful in relation to alcohol, because they simply do not have the proper data. Third, there is poor analysis of how recipients are getting around the card. The police still think there is a problem with alcohol. The report says that it is not reporting on how people get around the cards. I will come back to that in a minute.


Aim 2, to determine whether there was a reduction or decrease in violence or harm in the trial area, was not properly examined. The increase in domestic violence is, strategically, not reported—neither are the rates of suicide, self-harm, anxiety or depression. As well as this, the key up-to-date statistics from the South Australian and WA police have been left out of the report. In the South Australian trial site and the areas surrounding that, they have seen a large jump in robbery and related offences, up 111 per cent. Aggravated robbery is up 120 per cent, non-aggravated robbery is up 400 per cent and serious crime trespass is up 20 per cent. Where is that in the evaluation report? How is that proof of concept?


Aim 3, to determine whether such arrangements are more effective when community bodies are involved, is not examined. In this regard, the failure of the panel and the collective community action against the card has been omitted from the report. There has been no assessment of the involvement of the leadership groups and the panel process. People do not know who are on the community panels—they do not know their faces. The department admitted that in estimates. The department said, 'We are not releasing the names of the panel.' These people are being judged by their neighbours and by their peers, but they do not know who is judging them when they try and get either an exemption or a reduction from, say, 80 per cent to 50 per cent of their money quarantined.


Similarly, there has been a lot of concern expressed, and that is why community groups, individuals and participants are concerned about the card. You have to question the amount of money that is being given out—and I will come to that quickly on Ceduna—in relation to this trial and how it has impacted on community groups. You have to wonder whether they are more supportive of the card because they think that they will not get the additional funding that has been going into communities. The fact that the communities do not know who is judging them is deeply concerning. Lastly, aim 4 is to encourage socially responsible behaviour. That aim is not examined either.


People are getting around the card, for example, by shopping. I have visited the Kununurra trial site and I have spoken to people who have supported the card, to people who have opposed the card, to participants and to some of the leaders up there. It is fair to say that the community is very divided over the card. You do not have to be up there long to find out some of the ways they are getting around the card. One of those is through shopping. One of the things that the proponents of the card and people who were supportive in the community—non-participants—were saying about the card was, 'Oh, you see a lot more Aboriginal people in the supermarket.' Do you know what is happening? Card holders are going to people that have cash, are doing their shopping for them and are then keeping the cash while putting the shopping on their card. One person said to me, 'They're walking around the supermarket with a list.' That is because they are buying food for somebody else. That is just one way that they are getting around the card.


For the reasons outlined above, it has simply not been demonstrated, and there is simply no clear evidence to show, that the trials meet the four aims or provide proof of concept. Other concerns raised with me include the extremely poor research in the report and the inclusion of views of non-participants in the report. The difference is very clear when you look at participants and non-participants. Non-participants have a higher rate of thinking that the card has been successful and people's lives are better. People are looking at other people and saying, 'Your life's better because you are on the card.' Whereas, the people on the card are saying, 'No, it's not.'


As I said, it has divided the community. There was a complete lack of consultation. Claiming that there has been any improvement as a result of the card—just the card, not the services—is ridiculous, particularly when you look at the extent and the breadth of the funding that has gone into the services in Ceduna. I am not for one minute arguing against the fact that we should be putting money into these communities to improve services. I strongly argue that we should be, and that communities are disadvantaged to the extent that they are because these resources have not been going in. Why is there no adequate discussion of this in the report? They write it off by saying, 'A lot of people didn't know about the services, so they obviously haven't used them, so they obviously haven't had an impact.' I do not think that is a fair conclusion to draw.


There is no mention in the report of cost; no attempt has been made to calculate the net benefit. Given the government's ongoing narrative about budget stress and the need for budget savings, wouldn't you think they would be looking at it if this is in fact a cost-effective way of addressing disadvantage? I argue very strongly that this needs to be addressed. I do not disagree with the government on that point at all.


Eva Cox has been doing some analysis of the report, and has done a paper on that. She says: 'The lack of serious scrutiny of the data on outcomes of the trial to date is deeply concerning. This program is flaunted as being aimed at fixing the supposed problems of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, and is also a wider experiment in income support reform. The inadequate scrutiny of the program could well be linked to racialised assumptions that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are somehow less capable of managing their money and should have their affairs controlled, regardless of whether they drink or have other behavioural issues. Some assumptions are then extended to others receiving working age payments and eventually may extend even further. In the report, recipients are in fact blamed for the majority of cases where the card was declined at stores, in fact I spoke to a number of people who were in the situation where their card was declined, and I would suggest the people I spoke to would make valiant attempts to use the card.'


It goes on to say, 'There should be more education to assist participants to be more confident'—in other words, putting the blame back on the participant. The minister's claim that the report provided him with 'strong, independent evaluation results' is disturbing, and is in fact a myth. There is no clear proof of concept, because there is no independent data confirming validity of any of the claims or anecdotal evidence put forward in the preliminary report.


This is flawed research and flawed evaluation for the government, but when you think about it the government always wanted to extend this trial. We have already had numerous people out there saying they want to extend it to young people, they want to extend it nationally or to the regions. This trial is based on the government's ideology, not on evidence. We know that from the Northern Territory intervention. That is indisputable. This approach should be abandoned. The trial should finish and the government should invest the money that they are spending on this on better services and better ways of achieving outcomes we all so desperately want. I urge the chamber to support the disallowance.

"Kakoschke-Moore, Sen Skye",NXT,2017-03-29,"



Senator KAKOSCHKE-MOORE
 (South Australia) (18:40):  The Nick Xenophon Team will not be supporting this disallowance. The cashless debit card trials in Ceduna and the East Kimberley have attracted their fair share of critics. However, what is frequently overlooked is the level of support for these trials, especially from Indigenous leaders in these communities.


The independent Wave 1 interim evaluation report produced by ORIMA Research concluded that overall the cashless debit card trial has been effective to date in terms of its performance against the key performance indicators established in the evaluation framework. The report says:


In particular, the Trial has been effective in reducing alcohol consumption, illegal drug use and gambling – establishing a clear 'proof-of-concept' and meeting the necessary preconditions for the planned medium-term outcomes in relation to reduced levels of harm related to these behaviours.


The report claims that the findings:


… indicate that the reductions in these behaviours have been largely driven by the impact of the debit card quarantining mechanism and not by the additional services provided via the CDCT package or factors external to—


the debit card. The report acknowledges:


At this interim stage there is only limited evidence of early impacts on crime, violence, injuries and perceptions of safety … these medium-term outcomes were not expected to be seen in this timeframe and will be the focus of Wave 2 of the evaluation.


I will briefly speak to these conclusions.


Firstly though, I want to note that while the evaluation appears to be comprehensive in terms of consideration of KPIs and did include a survey of the local population in the trial communities, there is no substitute for direct engagement with community members and leaders and on-the-ground experience. I have visited Ceduna twice since I was elected, for a total period of three days, meeting a number of organisations and services and chatting to residents on the street. That is because it was important to me to hear directly from the local community about their experiences, rather than forming an opinion based on what I thought residents might think or what was being reported in the media. To anyone in this place who has views about the card, especially strong views about this card, I encourage you to visit these communities. I encourage you to speak with those who are living the experience. To not hear directly from those who are participating in the trial and those who are living around them is, in my view, an abrogation of our duties as parliamentarians.


If I had to summarise the views of the individuals, businesses, community groups, health workers and NGOs I have spoken to I would say this: the trial seems to be working, but it is still too early to tell. When I first went over at the end of September last year, the general feeling was that the card was working, but there was a lack of data and information in the community to support that perception. But it was also noted that the services that essentially support the trial were vital to any change. For example, the Mobile Assistance Patrol, which provides transport for individuals affected by alcohol or other drugs who are at risk of harm to themselves or others. The bus also results in an increase of admissions to other health services, such as the sobering up unit, by providing transport to this facility instead of those people spending their night on the streets. This highlights the difficulty in interpreting data without the full picture.


Issues that were raised with the card usage were being resolved relatively quickly with services such as the Ceduna Aboriginal Corporation helping cardholders with financial management and issues such as lost cards. The inability to obtain a balance at an ATM had been a common complaint, which was also worked through. Some services noted they could operate better if the positions which were created under the CDC package were able to be filled by qualified staff before the CDC trial started and if there was better retention of staff in general—a challenge faced by many services in rural and remote communities.


I spoke with some local Indigenous people who were walking by me on the street: one said the card was not working because he did not have 'enough cash for booze'; a young woman shrugged in response and said she thought it was ok. The people I spoke to who opposed the card seemed to do so because they fundamentally believed it was wrong to impose the card on welfare recipients, but many of these people were not on the card themselves.


I could go on and on about the feedback I have received, but I will now quickly turn to the data. The findings which were released last year by DSS and the latest by ORIMA can be difficult to interpret because, for example, with respect to crime statistics for Ceduna, the entire local service area is covered, which is a significant portion of the west coast of South Australia. Poker machine use also covers other towns, not just Ceduna. Alcohol stats in the ORIMA report are based on self-reporting. The local supermarket in Ceduna has apparently had a significant increase in trade, particularly of fruit and vegetables. The data shows that the purchases at the supermarket using the card have increased, but there are no stats for before the card was implemented.


As for findings in the ORIMA report, the survey found that on average in the two trial sites 25 per cent of trial participants reported drinking less frequently. Indicators relating to illegal drug use showed some improvement, with participants reporting less usage of illegal drugs since becoming CDCT participants. Gambling had reduced overall, and in Ceduna poker machine revenue was 12 per cent lower compared to January 2016. The report acknowledges that there remain issues such as the lack of awareness or understanding about card usage, and other criticisms such as community panels not being established in a timely manner.


Other issues have been faced by the community, such as grog running—on which I have engaged with the South Australian government, calling for legislative reform—and predatory payday lenders signing up debit card holders. Again, that is an issue that I have taken up with the federal government.


But, as I said earlier, at this time it is too early to draw definitive conclusions. Although feedback on whether the card is in fact working or not is mixed, in my experience the strongest and most desperate views came from the community leaders advocating for it to continue. Simply pulling the plug on the trial is not an option. The consequences of flooding an almost cashless community with cash would be dire. Multiple groups told me that, when money came into the community during the trial by way of inheritances, tax refunds or insurance payouts, alcohol consumption, violence and gambling spiked, and this is also reflected in the data.


If, in the future, community leaders decide that they no longer wish for the debit card to apply to their community, then a withdrawal plan would need to be in place. But it is the Nick Xenophon Team's position that, having engaged with the Ceduna community in particular and considering positive statistics in the independent evaluation with respect to gambling and alcohol consumption in particular as well, we should listen to the community leaders who have asked for the trial to continue.

"Cameron, Sen Doug",ALP,2017-03-29,"



Senator CAMERON
 (New South Wales) (18:47):  Labor opposes the disallowance of the Social Security (Administration) (Trial Area) Amendment Determination 2017. We do not believe in a blanket approach to income quarantining. That is not an option for Labor to even consider. We do not believe it should be rolled out nationally. Senator Siewert has strong views on this, and the Greens have strong views, but people that we have engaged with have equally strong views, and people in the communities have equally strong views. Their views are in opposition to the views that the Greens have put here today.


This is an extremely tough issue. This is an issue about future generations as well as the generations that we have trying to deal with the problem now. We understand that the vast majority of people on income support are more than capable of managing their own finances, but the level of alcohol abuse in some communities just cannot be ignored. Labor supports community-driven initiatives designed to tackle alcohol abuse.


When I was listening to Senator Siewert, I had a look at the NACCHO Aboriginal health site, and there was a quote there. I will just read that quote. It is from the Wunan Foundation's Ian Trust, Desmond Hill and Gelganyem Trust chairman Ted Hall. They said:


It is our view that continuing to deliver the same programs we have delivered for the past 40 years will do nothing for our people and, besides wasting more time and money, will condemn our children and future generations to a life of poverty and despair,


Our children will continue to be removed from their families because their families are not safe, many of our children will be born with FASD (fetal alcohol spectrum disorder) and never be able to receive a good education, and a large percentage of our people will go to prison and, in some cases, commit suicide. We believe that this trial could be the catalyst for breaking the cycle of poverty and despair in the East Kimberley.


That is an equally strong opposite view from local community leaders in the Kimberley.


Senator Siewert talks about anecdotes and ideology. I do not think it should be about anecdotes. Labor does not say it should be about anecdotes. We do not believe it should be about ideology. We believe it should be about what the community wants, what the communities need and how we resolve these intergenerational problems. We support, as I have said, community-driven initiatives to tackle alcohol abuse.


We offered our support to the Cashless Debit Card Trial in both Ceduna and Kununurra. We did that because we consulted with local Indigenous communities, and the feedback we got was similar to the quote I gave. It was that people needed help; they needed support; and there was a huge problem that had to be dealt with. So we listened to the people in Ceduna and Kununurra and heard that they are desperate for action to tackle these issues in their communities. Community leaders in both locations offered their support for the Cashless Debit Card Trial. These communities wanted the trials to take place, and we will continue to listen to them in coming months.


The interim evaluation of the trials has also been made publicly available. The evaluation has found that overall the trial has been effective, in particular in reducing alcohol consumption, illegal drug use and gambling. The final evaluation is due to be completed in June this year. We will scrutinise the report and listen to people in both Ceduna and Kununurra about the trials. We will not simply rely on anecdotes or ideology that might underpin any of the arguments or issues; we will listen to the people of Ceduna and Kununurra about the trials.


We know that these problems cannot be ignored—and they will not be solved by income quarantining alone. We are not saying income quarantining will fix these problems. But there is a desperation amongst many of the community leaders and many in the community about trying to deal with these issues. That is why we gained a commitment from the government to provide additional supports for participating communities, including an initial $1 million for community services in Ceduna and an additional $1.3 million to support families in Kununurra. You cannot just put in a debit card and say that will solve the problem. There needs to be wraparound support. There needs to be mental health support. There needs to be health support. There needs to be drug and alcohol support. These are the issues that wrap around the debit card or that should be the fundamental issues that are dealt with in the community. 


These are complex, multidimensional problems; they are intergenerational problems; and they are social problems of great significance. The current approach to substance abuse in some areas of Australia is not working, and we must give proper consideration to new ways of addressing the tragic devastation of drug and alcohol abuse.


And it is not just Indigenous communities that are faced with drug and alcohol problems. I have not drunk for I think it is now 40 years. I know I cannot drink, so I do not drink, but I had lots of support to deal with that problem. Not many in Indigenous communities have the support that I had when I knew that I had an alcohol problem. This is an issue that has to be dealt with not just in Indigenous communities but also everywhere else. When I was listening to the debate earlier about taxation on alcohol, I kept thinking back not to the debates about how efficient the alcohol tax should be; I kept thinking back to what my life would have been like if I had not been able to get off alcohol. It would have been devastating. Look at the health problems many families have and the financial problems many families have. The family violence that comes from alcohol and drug abuse is huge, absolutely huge. So I do not find it intellectually substantial for people to come in and argue a point of view when they do not understand these other issues—that it is simply about a card. It is not about a card. It is about far more than a card. People are crying out for help, so there needs to be more help, and it is not just a card that will address the issue. So we have got to find other ways of addressing drug and alcohol abuse.


We do not support introducing a cashless debit card to all young people on social security under the age of 18. There is no formal proposal by the government to do that at this stage. We do not think that welfare quarantining can be useful unless it is well targeted. It has to be well targeted. And we do not believe it should be rolled out nationally. We do not believe in a blanket rollout. We certainly do believe that this is a trial that was requested and sought by community leaders and many in the communities, and we will have a look at the outcome of the second report. We will not simply look at the report, read the report and come to a conclusion.




Senator Siewert:
  Like you did with this one, then?




Senator CAMERON:
  Senator Siewert, you can interrupt all you like. You can yell all you like. I know how passionate you are about this, but you should put some of your passion aside and be a bit dispassionate about the issues that the Aboriginal communities and all communities in these areas are facing. We should look at what wraparound services need to be put in place and how we put finance into those areas that allow people to get out of the intergenerational social problems that are there.


So we take the view that the community has asked for this and we will look at it, but we will go back and talk to the communities. We will consult with the communities. We will make an assessment separate from a report as to how this is working out. We will talk to Indigenous leaders, we will talk to the Indigenous community and we will try and make the best decisions we can in relation to this. We will not have just an ideological, blanket view. We will not engage in assertions that this is wrong. We will not engage in assertions that this is not helping the community. We will have a look at it and we will analyse it, because alcohol and drugs in the community are a big problem. 


I have heard it said that alcohol is part of Australian culture. Well, for many, it is a bad part of Australian culture; it is not a good part of Australian culture. I am not a wowser. I do not say people cannot drink. I just recognise that as an alcoholic I cannot drink. I have actually talked to Indigenous people who did not have the support that I had to deal with that terrible disease of alcoholism. People need help. They need support. This card is seen as one way to do that. But there are many more things we will have to do in relation to this. So I stand by Labor's position that we will have a look at the report, engage with the community, talk to Indigenous leaders and other community leaders, and make a decision about this. But we will not support—we will certainly not support—a blanket rollout of this card across the country. 


I think the alcohol industry should be doing a bit more to put funding into these communities to support them. As part of any trial, I would call on the alcohol industry to look at what they can do in a positive way in these communities, instead of just taking profits out of these communities, putting more people into poverty and creating bigger problems. There is not just a need for the Greens, Labor, crossbenchers, the Liberals and the Nationals to debate these issues here; there has to be an approach, I think, where the industry that is making a profit out of people's misery actually does something constructive.


For some time we have called for an alcohol summit in this country. I believe that there should be an alcohol summit, and that could go hand-in-hand with a drug summit. We need to talk about these issues. We need to deal with them in a dispassionate manner. We need to look at the devastation that has been wrought on our communities in relation to these issues. On that basis, we say this trial has still not been finalised.


We do not support a disallowance. We will look at this in a strategic manner. We will analyse the report. We will talk to the community. My view is we should also be talking to the alcohol industry. They have a contribution that they should be making in these communities as well.

"Hanson, Sen Pauline",PHON,2017-03-29,"



Senator HANSON
 (Queensland) (19:00):  One Nation will not be supporting Senator Siewert's motion to disallow the Social Security (Administration) (Trial Area) Amendment Determination 2017. I was fortunate enough to be invited, by Andrew Forrest, to a meeting with Aboriginals from Ceduna and Kununurra. That was the reason to sit down and talk to them with regard to this card. At that meeting, over a lengthy period of time, they explained to me about the card and what it meant to their communities. They said that it had improved their communities. They saw less domestic violence, they saw less drinking and they saw more children start to attend school. They thought it was far better in their communities. They were praising the card, and they expressed to me their opinion on that.


We talk about pouring more money in to deal with the Aboriginal issues. Yes, there is a drinking problem. Yes, there are drugs. There are problems, such as domestic violence, that are not only in their communities. We see domestic violence throughout Australia. In dealing with the problems there over the years, I have seen billions of dollars being thrown at this whole thing to deal with the Aboriginals. Years ago I called it an Aboriginal industry. It was costing Australian taxpayers billions of dollars. If anyone spoke out about it, complained or questioned where the money went they were called 'racist'—you could not talk about it. I think it needs to be talked about openly and honestly.


I have been informed that we spend approximately $5.6 billion a year to deal with Aboriginal issues. Senator Siewert mentioned that we should put more money into services. I have just been over to Western Australia, and I visited Kalgoorlie. They are having a huge problem with the Aboriginal people there that are coming to town. They are accessing alcohol. They are sleeping on the streets. The councillors are saying, 'We don't know how to deal with this whole issue.' They informed me that there are about 170 different agencies, and yet they have this problem. The agencies do not work together. They do not communicate with each other. There is no cross-referencing of anything. We have this ongoing problem. The agencies only work from nine to five, and nothing happens after that period of time. The police have their hands tied. They do not know how to deal with this issue.


Having the card, as we have seen and as they have told me, restricts them from spending money on alcohol and on drugs. There is another issue. With the Aboriginal community usually if someone has something they must share it with the rest of the community. If a family comes along then they share what they have, whether it be money, alcohol or whatever they have. That is their culture. That card cannot be transferred to anyone else. When they know that they cannot get money from that card to gamble, to buy alcohol, to buy cigarettes or to buy drugs then the money is used wisely—to feed the kids, to buy decent food and to pay the bills. That is important. That is what this is all about.


If we really care about these people and want to do something about it we have to have an opinion and work together to help them. Regardless of whether they are Aboriginal, whatever people they are, if anyone needs this assistance in a community then we should look at it. We should look into what the community wants. Clearly, in my discussions with them, this is what the community wants. It works for them.


For too long I have heard too many bleeding hearts saying their opinions without truly looking at the whole issue that is happening here. It is the same as when I went up to Palm Island years ago. I saw what was happening up there; I walked around the place. I had three men—one was as young as about 15, and he was drunk at around about two o'clock in the afternoon—say 'Pauline, we want to work.' That is what they want to do, but no-one wants to get involved or say anything. I was accused of going up there, and I was called a racist. This is what is happening. They want someone to stand up and speak up for them, because they have real problems and real issues.


We need to start making the tough decisions and start really investigating what is happening. There is an Aboriginal industry out there. There are people who are abusing the system and ripping off taxpayers' dollars. It is not going where it is supposed to be going. Everyone shuts down, because it is taboo—you cannot talk about it. I believe in having an honest discussion about this. We should talk about it, because I know these people are.


I went to a meeting in 1998. I had all the media there. I had about 12 Aboriginal women and children who were in the room. They held up my hand and said, 'We have been hoping and praying for someone like Pauline Hanson to come along, because our women are being bashed and raped, and our kids are glue sniffing.' Nothing was reported, because they could not possibly do that. All these years I have been ridiculed about it, and what needs to be done is just openness and honesty. We need to talk about these issues that are happening, because they are crying out for it. 


When I went up to Port Hedland recently, two Aboriginal women came up to me and said: 'We need a royal commission into Aboriginal spending, about where the money goes. Where do our royalties go? Where does our money go?' They are questioning the whole system as well, because it is not going where it is supposed to go. They want to see improvements. They want to see their kids educated. They want to see law and order in their towns. They want decent housing. And it is not because the Australian taxpayer has not paid billions of dollars into this industry; they have. The Australian people have paid for this. But there are people who are not being accountable to taxpayers—and not to their own people. I have seen this over the years. 


I do support this, and I think we need to listen to the communities, and that is exactly what I have done. They do want this. And as regards those under 18 years of age getting this, I do support that. That is another thing that we must look at. As I have travelled Australia—and in rural and regional areas, and not only there but every place, we have a drug problem. There is a huge ice problem in this country. These kids are getting on the ice, because they cannot get jobs, because there is no future for them and because they are depressed, and so they get caught up in taking drugs. If the have cash in their pockets, of course they are going to buy the drugs. If having this cashless card means these kids cannot get cash to give to the drug dealers out there—these parasites that are feeding off them—then this may be the way to stop it, so that these kids can have a chance.


Forget about feeling soft and bleeding-heart over everything. Start making some touch decisions and ask the parents out there how they feel about it. Would the parents encourage this? Ask the Australian people if they want to see a cashless society for these kids that are under 18 years of age. Will it benefit them? Because a lot of these parents that I have spoken to would dearly love to have the right answers, and clean up the mess that this country is in. If we do not start dealing with the ice problem and the drugs, heaven help us and our future generations. Thank you.

"Lambie, Sen Jacqui",JLN,2017-03-29,"



Senator LAMBIE
 (Tasmania) (19:09):  I will not be supporting this either. As a matter of fact I have spent four or five days in Ceduna on a couple of different trips. I have heard all the positives. I have looked at all the help that Minister Tudge has put in there to make sure that the card makes it easy for people, so the help is sitting there. It was all aligned; it was all done well. I watched him, and, as soon as something came up, within 48 hours he fixed it. Everything has been thrown at this. 


When I was over there, it was nice to see—I walked up and down the streets for two days. I walked into most shops. I talked to—did not matter what colour skin they were—if they were outside the courts or they were inside the courts, I went and spoke to them. I went out to the communities. They want this card. First of all they are finding that their kids are taking lunch to school. They are getting breakfast. The elders are not getting bashed because the younger people in the community are not trying to get money out of them because they do not have any. That is a good result in itself. 


I can tell you that I feel really proud of myself as a taxpayer that I was feeding my son's ice habit, because that is where his social security benefit was going—to him and his mates! It makes me feel really proud that I was really a part of that! Every Australian is a part of that, because that is our tax and that is our money. I am not investing that money into the future of our kids, because that does not give our kids a future. That does not work. I watch my girlfriends that I grew up in public housing with, and their kids are not getting what they need and it is not just because they do not get much on welfare because their money is going elsewhere. I watch what comes into their households—and, I tell you what, organised crime is a very bad thing. The only people that are winning out of our taxpayers' money right now are those organised crime gangs out there. 


You cannot tell me that somebody who is on welfare—that 20 per cent cash that goes into their proper bank account—has any more cash left over than 20 per cent. If you have, then you probably do not need to be on welfare. By the time you pay your rent with the little bit of welfare you get—there is your rent; you put food on the table for your kids; you are paying your electricity bill—then you should not have any more money than 20 per cent left over. You are getting 20 per cent of that in cash. You cannot tell me in 10 years time there will actually be cash around. Everybody will be on cards. That is where we are heading. 


By feeding taxpayers' money into these people who already have issues what we are doing is feeding their habits, whether it is alcohol or drugs. It is absolutely disgusting. Fifty per cent of those on disability support pensions in Tasmania are on that because of drug and alcohol problems. And we are not doing anything about that. I absolutely commend Twiggy Forrest for what he has done. I have seen his 27 recommendations for creating parity, and I too—through the chair—like you, Senator Hanson, want that damn card rolled out to those kids under 18. I want it rolled out. I have seen kids out there. It was brought up in an ice committee last Friday—10 years of age and I said this and I have said it before: they are on ice pipes. What are mum and dad doing—that are on welfare? Where is the money coming from? You cannot tell me that kids that are under 18 years old should be spending that money on alcohol. They should not even be buying it. There is something terribly wrong.


We are not giving it to them as a gift. Welfare was never meant to be like that. Welfare is meant to help you when you are down and out. It is not meant to feed your habit. That is not on. And the sooner we get this card rolled out right across Australia for that first group, the better off we will be. That is the first generation we are going to start breaking. We are going to start breaking the cycle. Do you know how much heartache that is going to save families? Do you know how much money that is going to save the economy? Do you know how much that is going to lessen the impact on our public hospitals? 


That is what it will do. But let me tell you what: I do not want to take responsibility for my taxpayers' money feeding somebody else's son's ice habit. That is not on. That is why I will not be supporting this.


It is time to change, and sitting here and talking about it, taking years to do it, is only making it worse. Like I said, the people who are really benefiting from this are the organised crime gangs out there, and they are having a nice time taking advantage of our kids. For goodness sake, the trials are working and are doing well. But I do not need to see a trial, because I spent long enough on a disability support pension, on welfare. I saw it when I lived in public housing; I grew up in the damn thing. I could already sniff and see what this card would do before it was even given out for trial. I thought: 'Beauty! This is something that's finally going to work; we just have to iron out the creases as we go.'


A trial was a good idea. But those trials are nearly over, so let's get on the front foot and keep the momentum going. Let's get it out for those kids who are 17 years and under, because they should not be buying drugs or spending taxpayers' money on alcohol. It is not on. They get 20 per cent in cash and they do not need any more than that. The other 80 per cent should be helping them out with buying clothes or whatever. Twenty per cent is more than enough, and I do not want the momentum stopped. The Greens like to talk about social justice, but social justice is not taking taxpayers' money and making the situation worse by giving it to people to go and buy their ice or drugs or alcohol with.


It is rampant out there. I live in Tasmania, one of the most disadvantaged places in Australia. It makes me cry every time I walk outside my office, which is right near Kmart and outside a taxi rank. Do you know what the taxi people say?. They feed in to me. I know it is getting worse. They know who the dealers are. They are taking people to pick them up. This is what is going on out there. This is an absolutely chronic issue, and we now need to take it on lock, stock and barrel. Twenty per cent is enough, and that is why I will not be supporting this.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2017-03-29,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (19:17):  It looks like the government does not want to make a comment. In summing up and addressing this I want to make a few comments. I am passionate about this because I have looked at the evidence. I have looked at the Northern Territory intervention and the final evaluation, and I urge anybody looking at this debate to read that report. It did not meet any of its projected outcomes. It failed.


I want to explore this issue of people 'feeling' that things do better, because that evaluation showed that people there felt that things were improving. But, when the evaluators compared the evidence of what was changing on the ground with another community outside of the NT, there was no difference. People felt it was better. In fact, it was not better. That is why I am so passionate about where the report says 'people felt this'. It is all very well to feel it. The psychology suggests that, because people saw money being spent and a trial being done, they thought things were better. But the evidence is not there. Senator Cameron said he will look very carefully at the second report—well, please look very carefully at the interim report. Please look very carefully at this, because I spent quite a lot of time going through this report and showing that the evidence is not there.


I want to make a comment to those who are worried about 'the cash that will go back into these communities if we go off this trial'. That comment horrifies me, because what you are saying is that we always knew that this trial was inevitable and it was going to be entrenched because putting cash back into the community was in fact going to have a devastating impact. I know there are problems in these communities, and I am desperate to solve them, but this is not the way to do it.


With that, I urge you to support this. In the future you will look back, like people have done with the NT, and say it does not work. Even though the government is continuing with the NT intervention, the evidence shows that it has not been working. Please disallow this, and let us look at what really works. I am as passionate as anybody else in this chamber about trying to find out what really works.

Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (19:27):  Tonight I want to very briefly but very sincerely pay tribute to all of those who assisted selflessly during Cyclone Debbie, which ravaged parts of North Queensland in the past few days, and those who are still assisting in its aftermath. I cannot mention them all by name individually, as it would be impossible to do so because there are so many. Many who helped in their own quiet way will never be publically identified. We owe a real debt to all the emergency workers, police, fire rescue, SES, council workers, meteorologists, local radio presenters, neighbours, community groups and other countless helpers who did so much in their own way to help. It makes you proud to be an Australian to see the volunteers and those working beyond the call of duty to help with natural calamities that are unpredictable and unstoppable. Many people put their own personal safety and even their lives at risk to help others.


When driving from Ayr to Townsville airport this morning to come back to Canberra I was overwhelmed by the number of police, emergency, SES and fire rescue vehicles heading south but particularly by the constant stream of tradies' utes and four-wheel-drives with trailers, ladders, mobile workshops, a range of doors, gates and the like, and generators all heading south to help. I know from Yasi the reassurance of seeing Army convoys and helicopters heading into the affected areas. To know that the Defence Force is on the way is a real reassurance to those whose stress levels and equilibrium have been imbalanced by the events of the past 48 hours.


In Ayr, where I live and where the cyclone was originally tracking, we were very lucky. I want to thank and acknowledge all those friends, relatives and Facebook friends—many of whom I have never personally met—who sent messages of support, including, I am proud to say, almost every one of my coalition colleagues in this chamber and the Prime Minister. Believe me, in times of terror, it does help to know that others are thinking of you. 


In Ayr, we missed it, thankfully, but I do feel for those friends and the residents of Bowen, Airlie Beach, Proserpine and Mackay who have borne the brunt of Cyclone Debbie. Having lived through a couple of cyclones in my lifetime, I can attest to the absolute terror one feels for oneself and loved ones as the gale-force winds increase and the howling of wind and rain and flying debris escalates to a nerve-wracking crescendo, buffeting one's home as one huddles terrified, usually in a blacked-out room, almost defenceless, waiting and hoping and praying. Unlike other calamities, cyclones are entirely unpredictable and unstoppable. There is nothing you can do but try to stay safe with your loved ones and pray. And Debbie was worse than many in that it was so slow moving, meaning that the increasing terror was drawn out like some form of heinous torture. 


Cyclones are one small detriment of living in the North, in God's own country, I might say, and I know that the resilience of the people will shine through, as always, and that things will get back to normal quickly. The natural beauty of the North will quickly recuperate and tourists will shortly be again enjoying one of the seventh and, indeed, eighth wonders of the world, with the reef and the rainforests. The mines will crank up again, commerce will get back to normal, the farmers will harvest, and all of the wonderful services we have in the North will be business as usual.


We do feel for those who have lost homes and businesses and other property; the farmers in Proserpine and Mackay, in particular, who would have lost crops; and the tourist places that will suffer not only from the damage but from overinflated bad news. The Commonwealth and Queensland governments will help there. Insurance companies and banks will also be doing their bit. 


Tonight, I think it is important that we acknowledge all those who have helped. If you are one of those thousands who will never be named individually but whose main preoccupation in the last few days has been helping others, please accept this on behalf of perhaps all Australians as our thanks and our grateful acknowledgement for what you have done.
