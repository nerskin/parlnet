"Hull, Kay, MP",NP,2003-09-08,"—On behalf of the Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs, I present the committee's report, incorporating dissenting reports, entitled Road to recovery: report on the inquiry into substance abuse in Australian communities, together with the minutes of proceedings.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—From the outset, I place on the public record my immense appreciation for our secretariat—namely, Dr Sarah Hnatiuk, Bev Forbes, Margaret Atkin, Belynda Zolotto, Debbie Irwin, Rachelle Mitchell and Jill Miller—for their dedicated service to all members of the committee. In addition, my personal thanks is extended to the Clerk, Ian Harris, and the Deputy Clerk, Bernard Wright, for their genuine assistance. I thank the committee members for their solid application to such a sensitive task and believe that they should be proud of the outcomes.
The committee's report looked at a wide range of issues in relation to the costs of substance abuse in Australian communities. These involve family relationships, health care costs, crime, violence and law enforcement, road trauma, and workplace safety and productivity. If implemented, the recommendations in this report will see Australian communities far better equipped to deal with substance misuse, through targeted, comprehensive and well-resourced early intervention programs aimed at communities and the education and judicial systems.
The committee highlighted the need for family inclusive treatment programs that have been clearly identified as best practice models. These models should be nationally consistent and must be assessed for competency in real outcomes prior to being eligible for state and Commonwealth funding and they should report annually to their parliaments against their targets. In addition, the committee supports a nationally agreed curriculum and accreditation system in training and development of all of those who are involved in delivery of services, including health and senior professionals.
The committee is concerned about the current practice of methadone parking and has made strong recommendations to determine the effects of long-term methadone maintenance, including the cost and impact on the workplace, community and family. The dangers of cannabis use were of concern to the committee, particularly after receiving evidence that indicated cannabis use was considered to be harmless by a great number of the Australian public. With evidence from the 2001 National Drug Strategy household survey stating that cannabis was offered or available to almost a quarter of Australians surveyed and to nearly half the 14- to 29-year-olds surveyed, the committee believes it is vital that treatments for cannabis dependence be developed and that research be undertaken to determine the nature of the links between cannabis use and mental health and opioid or other drug use.
Effective and proven diversion programs in the judicial system are important tools in dealing with abuse sufferers, particularly the ability to identify drug users or those young people at risk of substance abuse through their general and associated behaviour that may lead to them presenting to the criminal justice or welfare systems. Establishment of independent drug-free units in correctional centres were supported by the committee, wherein numeracy, literacy and life skills should be provided in an educational format. 
The committee had a range of personal views on the trialling of naltrexone implants, particularly in prisons. Naltrexone treatment programs that the committee witnessed were very impressive, and the committee agreed that these programs, supported by holistic support services, including housing and education, are a valuable form of treatment that should be more readily available. The committee noted that naltrexone should be subsidised by the Commonwealth for drug abuse, as it is currently subsidised for alcohol abuse.
Finally, the committee supports the replacement of `harm minimisation' with `harm prevention' in the National Drug Strategy and all governments making evidence of the proven benefits of research to those affected by substance abuse and misuse a prerequisite for continuing and new funding of research projects. As chairman of the committee, I commend the report to the House. I believe that the 128 recommendations contained within this document are all valuable and considered responses to this difficult issue. I thank all of those witnesses, family members and professionals who gave of themselves to assist us in our work.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Family and Community Affairs Committee</title>,Committees,0,1,speech
"Irwin, Julia, MP",ALP,2003-09-08,"—My interest in this issue and my concern for major drug problems in my electorate, particularly the Cabramatta area, have driven my commitment to see the best outcome from this inquiry. In April this year, I visited Vienna, Zurich and Frankfurt to get a first-hand view of how European countries are dealing with drug addiction. In Vienna, I visited the United Nations at the time of its conference on the convention on narcotic drugs. There was a clear division between the approach of western European countries and the approach of the United States and some other countries.
For the European countries, the emphasis was on what we know as harm minimisation—needle and syringe programs, low-threshold methadone maintenance programs and safe injection rooms. This contrasts with the zero tolerance model now favoured in the United States. That strategy insists on treatments which require total abstinence. There was concern that the United States was mounting a diplomatic initiative for all countries to apply a zero tolerance approach.
Australia has for nearly two decades developed policies which could be broadly defined as harm minimisation. We have held the view that addiction arising from substance abuse is a health condition and that all individuals have the right to the best health care available to allow them to lead a safe and satisfactory lifestyle. Those policies have proved effective, particularly in reducing HIV-AIDS and hepatitis C infections among intravenous drug users. On the other hand, there is the view that illicit drug use is a criminal activity arising from human weakness and should be punished; individuals using illicit substances should face the consequences of their actions, including the risk of death or serious harm to themselves as a result of their abuse—the zero tolerance approach. Each member of the committee came to the inquiry with their own personal views on these issues. The report says:
The committee is concerned about the way in which the term harm minimisation may appear to encourage the maintenance of a drug habit and give rise to the idea that taking drugs is alright.
I have enough faith that the young people of this country know why they should not use harmful substances not to worry about sending that message. With the inclusion of the words `with the ultimate objective being to obtain a drug-free status for the client' there is a risk that such a policy will skew funding away from some of the most effective agencies dealing with people suffering from addiction. We cannot reject the findings of scientific studies which clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of harm minimisation strategies because they do not agree with a particular moral viewpoint. The lives of tens of thousands of Australians should be above the moralising of the opponents of harm minimisation. 
When you speak to the families and friends of those who have lost loved ones, you must ask what more can be done to prevent these tragedies. There is a role for law enforcement in reducing the supply of drugs, but some drugs will always get through. You can try to educate every parent and child on the dangers of drug abuse, but you cannot control the circumstances for every potential addict. We do so little to prevent the social damage which so often leads to substance abuse. The only safety net left is to keep people alive long enough for them to get their lives back together and overcome their addiction. That is the only hope left for the parents, the families and the friends of the tens of thousands of Australians who are the victims of drug abuse.
Finally, I want to thank one person who has guided my thinking during this inquiry. I would like to thank Patrick, a man who will always remain young, and his family, who have given me a unique insight into the problems of substance abuse. For the sake of all the Patricks in this world, we must continue to treat substance abuse as a health issue. We must never, ever close the doors on those who need our care and our understanding.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Family and Community Affairs Committee</title>,Committees,0,1,speech
"Wakelin, Barry, MP",LP,2003-09-08,"—It is with pleasure that I rise to support the comments of colleagues on the tabling of the report Road to recovery: report on the inquiry into substance abuse in Australian communities. It has been three years in the preparation. Certainly, those of us who have participated have valued the experience and the opportunity to educate ourselves more deeply on the issues. The terms of reference of the inquiry were to report on:
The social and economic costs of substance abuse, with particular regard to: 
·	family relationships; 
·	crime, violence (including domestic violence), and law enforcement; 
·	road trauma;
·	workplace safety and productivity; and
·	health care costs.
For the first time in 20 years, in the previous parliament we endeavoured to understand and bring to the parliament and to the nation some ideas and new thinking about how we might address these issues. The committee was chaired very capably by the member for Riverina and the deputy chair, the member for Fowler. I compliment them and the committee. It was a pleasure to work with them.
—And chaired previously by the member for Grey.
—Thank you very much, member for Cowan.
—Although the member for Cowan has been getting a good deal of licence, the member for Grey has the call.
—This is a very serious subject and, as I said, this is the first time in over 20 years that the national parliament has endeavoured to deal with the issues I mentioned. For me, the highlight at a personal level will be the contact we all made with hundreds of people and the sharing of the emotions, the tragedies and the realities of lives shattered, lives rebuilt and lives to be further enhanced as people deal with the issues of substance abuse. Whatever issues may have divided us and wherever we might have been at variance, there is no doubt in my mind that the document, with its 128 recommendations, will be a valuable document for bureaucracies, for our Public Service, for fellow MPs and senators, for state parliaments and for the community at large, because it will be a ready reference for many years to come on those issues which confront us and how we might manage them better. 
With regard to the impact on some of those issues, like methadone and cannabis, violence, our prisons and law enforcement, there is no doubt in my mind that there will be very valuable support to governments, to executives and to those who need to implement these sorts of recommendations and manage these issues in a way which will not only challenge people but also lay down the basis for a new way of thinking. We do come to these issues when things have made some turn for the better anyway. We are but part of that process. This report, from the inquiry so very well led by the member for Riverina, will enhance and bear testament to the evidence and the effort that was put in by so many individuals who came before this committee with so much courage and so much commitment to deal with issues which touched the very core of their lives. That is my overwhelming impression. I hope that this report serves them well and serves this country well into the future.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Family and Community Affairs Committee</title>,Committees,0,1,speech
"Quick, Harry, MP",ALP,2003-09-08,"—In the brief time allotted to me I want to make some observations about the excellent report entitled Road to recovery: report on the inquiry into substance abuse in Australian communities. This report has seen committee members from the previous parliament and the current parliament be part of a three-year process inquiring into substance abuse in Australian communities. It has seen committee members, especially those like me who have seen this inquiry from start to finish, provided with a real insight into the tragedy that is substance abuse.
Substance abuse, whether of licit or illicit drugs, is no respecter of social status or family income. Substance abuse impacts dramatically on all Australian communities, be they in metropolitan conurbations or tiny rural hamlets. As with so many social issues affecting our nation, as federal legislators we are faced with trying to get the three tiers of government to put aside their political blinkers and ideological stances to work cooperatively together to ensure that the resources and services needed are in place for those at risk and in need of treatment right here and now.
I have been associated with many fine reports from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs over my 11 years. This is another example of wonderful cooperation between members of all parties on an issue that can polarise and has polarised public opinion. I want to place on the public record my great admiration for those dedicated workers who are piecing together not only the lives of those afflicted by substance abuse but the families of these people. My admiration must also be expressed for those who look outside the square for solutions, strategies and treatments. Substance abuse and its victims can easily be targeted and vilified and simplistic solutions can be promoted for implementation, especially by those in the media. Human nature and human weakness are involved in this issue, and there but for the grace of God go I. Total abstinence and simply saying no does not always hit the right chord with each and every member of Australian society.
To my mind, substance abuse and its impact on family relationships, crime and violence—especially domestic violence—road trauma and workplace safety and productivity, along with its implication for national health care costs, are not well understood, tragically, by the majority of Australian families. Substance abuse, like cancer and HIV-AIDS, is hidden away from discussion and scrutiny unless it impacts on your family. Hopefully, this report, with its 128 recommendations, will receive due and proper scrutiny and consideration by each and every person working in this area and those with a genuine interest in substance abuse. I look forward to discussing this report in greater detail in the Main Committee, and I know that many other members who are not necessarily on this committee will avail themselves of the opportunity to speak on this wonderful report. 
I too would like to thank the committee secretariat for their dedication and professionalism; it has not been easy bringing this together. I want Australians to know that I will continue to work tirelessly to ensure that those afflicted by substance abuse, and their families, will be able to access appropriate and targeted services to assist them during this critical time in their lives. I urge all Australians to read this fine report, examine the many recommendations and assist us, the politicians, in both state and federal parliament, to implement these 128 excellent recommendations.
Finally, I want to thank the families who shared with us over the past three years their grief and tragedy—those who experienced at first hand the impact of substance abuse on their children's and other family members' lives. We need to develop an Australian solution to this vexed issue. In the Road to recovery: report on the inquiry into substance abuse in Australian communities report we have the basis for such a solution. I thank the House.

"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,2003-09-08,"—The Parliamentary (Choice of Superannuation) Bill 2003 follows my earlier bill from 2001, the Parliamentary (Choice of Superannuation) Bill 2001, providing for members of parliament to make their own retirement and pension arrangements in line with broader community standards.
This bill will provide for the funding of future superannuation accruals for new and existing members and senators who choose to join another complying superannuation fund or a retirement savings account. It will allow current members to have any superannuation benefit accrued under the parliamentary scheme rolled over into a complying fund of their choice. Members opting out will have contributions paid into their chosen fund or RSA by the Commonwealth, their employer. The superannuation guarantee contribution required of employers, currently nine per cent, will then also apply to those members who opt out of the parliamentary scheme. This is not radical. The Western Australian parliament closed off its scheme in 2000 and introduced freedom of choice for MPs' super, with the existing state fund one of the options—albeit with a 12½ per cent government contribution. 
When I introduced the 2001 bill, it was referred by Senator Brown to the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation and Financial Services. That inquiry drew strong media interest, especially from A Current Affair,and attracted almost 3,000 submissions from a public bewildered and angry at the excessive generosity and double standards they saw in the parliamentary super scheme. The parliament reacted by passing amendments to forbid access to the scheme by new members until age 55, but the inherent generosity of the scheme remains untouched.
Any technical or other deficiencies identified by the Department of Finance and Administration in evidence to the 2001 inquiry have been addressed in this revised bill. These include the authorisation of contributions by the Commonwealth at the superannuation guarantee minimum rate, a revision of clauses to clarify that contributions are currently made to the Commonwealth and not directly to the trust and clarification of unintended consequences of the 2001 bill, namely the disentitlement of some members from a reversionary benefit. A new subclause, 18C(3), addresses the department's concern about the possible disentitling of members whose spouses are former members. The department also commented that the 2001 bill was:
Silent on the framework in which choice will be applied to senators and members.
This has been overcome by the insertion of a regulation power under 4G(7).
The committee also commented in 2001 that the bill did not appear to provide for same-sex couples. This was a rather pedantic point from a committee that ultimately recommended only that the issue of parliamentary superannuation be considered by the Remuneration Tribunal as part of a consolidated package comprising salaries, superannuation and allowances. This was a cop-out. Why should the Remuneration Tribunal, a creature of the government of the day, be charged with determining the adequacy of a pension or lump sum payout that is clearly outside the benefits accruing to pension schemes of our own constituents? Politicians invented this scheme; they should reform it. As for same-sex couples and superannuation entitlements, that matter needs to be addressed in separate legislation. It is not the job of this quite specific bill to outline a legislative answer to the same-sex superannuation issue.
As I said in my original second reading speech in 2001, the parliamentary scheme was born in an era when MPs were considered more likely to face job insecurity than the rest of the work force. In 2003 there is no such thing as job security or a job for life. The career ladder is now a job lattice, and a very rickety one at that for most people. For politicians to insulate themselves from the marketplace with their pension entitlements, topped up by a 69 per cent national employer contribution from the employer—the Commonwealth in this case and the state government in most state parliaments—is unconscionable.
It is all the more unconscionable when we look at the substantial losses sustained by our constituents and their super holdings over the past two years. Yet we enjoy an unfunded scheme with guaranteed payouts and indexed pensions, something those we allegedly represent can only dream of. The Australian's Janet Albrechtsen sums up the scheme thus:
It is excessive. It is guaranteed—no market risk. It rewards losers. And it is unfunded—like writing a blank cheque payable by the next generation.
I urge the government to put its money where its mouth is and apply its freedom of choice philosophy to this exclusive club. Opting out is the most basic of rights of any member. I commend the bill to the House and table it with the very detailed explanatory memorandum. 
Bill read a first time.

(1)	acknowledges the 75th anniversary this year of the Royal Flying Doctor Service (RFDS);
(2)	congratulates the RFDS for providing essential emergency and primary health care to the people of remote, rural and regional Australia since its estab-lishment in 1928;
(3)	thanks the doctors, nurses, allied health prof-essionals, pilots, mechanics, support staff, volunteers and fund-raisers for their commit-ment to continuing the life-saving work of the RFDS; and
(4)	notes with concern the difficulty in recruiting and retaining health professionals in remote, rural and reg-ional Australia that threatens to impact on the services provided by the RFDS.
As the motion notes, this year marks the 75th anniversary of the Royal Flying Doctor Service. We take the opportunity today in this House to recognise the important contribution that the Royal Flying Doctor Service has made and continues to make to life in rural Australia, and to pay tribute to the men and women who have played their part in the achievements of this great organisation.
It is true to say that today the Royal Flying Doctor Service is an instantly recognisable symbol of outback Australia. It is an organisation that many Australians would regard as representing those traits that we like to think of as defining our national spirit: courage, resourcefulness and determination in the face of adversity. It is important, however, to look past the iconic status it enjoys today and remember the incredible vision and commitment that was required to establish this vital service at a time when inland Australia presented enormous obstacles of distance and climatic extremes and remained all but invisible to most Australians and their governments.
The Royal Flying Doctor Service is the result of John Flynn's determination, as he described it, to `provide a mantle of safety' over those who lived in the remote stretches of outback Australia. As the superintendent of the Presbyterian Church's Australian Inland Mission from 1912, John Flynn had responsibility for a vast area of the continent. He was horrified by the conditions that people living in Central Australia endured: the loneliness, the lack of services and the isolation that often proved fatal. Flynn could see that people lived with the constant fear of something going wrong, knowing that if it did they were on their own. Most inhabitants of the outback did not have the means to communicate with the outside world and they were often days or weeks away from even the most basic medical help.
John Flynn was already a passionate advocate of the need for medical services in remote Australia and the development of aviation as a means of delivering them when, in 1917, the story of Jimmy Darcy gained national prominence as a stark illustration of the dangers people faced when they lived and worked in the outback. Jimmy Darcy was a stockman who was severely injured while mustering in the remote Kimberley region. Despite heroic efforts to keep him alive, he died just hours before the nearest doctor, who lived in Perth, arrived after a journey of almost 10 days by boat, car and horse. Another 10 years of constant planning and lobbying by John Flynn saw the first flying doctor take up his duties in Cloncurry, in north-west Queensland, on 15 May 1928. Dr Kenyon St Vincent Welch answered his first call two days later when he flew with a pilot, Arthur Affleck, across to Julia Creek, 137 kilometres away, and performed two operations. 
John Flynn's vision of an aerial medical service had the support of another western Queensland pioneer, Hudson Fysh, one of the founders of QANTAS, who provided the plane and pilot to be stationed at Cloncurry under contract to the RFDS. Despite its earlier apathy towards John Flynn's proposal, the Commonwealth government also came on board to contribute half the cost of the plane. The last crucial piece in Flynn's `mantle of safety' for the outback came into place in 1929 with the invention by his colleague Alfred Traeger of the pedal wireless. Because it was simple and inexpensive, the pedal wireless meant that isolated families and communities now had the means to communicate over long distances and knew that help was available in emergencies.
The potential for aviation and communication technologies to deliver services to the people of remote Australia and conquer the dread of isolation had been demonstrated. Nonetheless, the years following those breakthroughs were still a struggle as Flynn and his team worked to expand the availability of aeromedical services throughout the inland. Seventy-five years on, John Flynn's dream of a comprehensive aeromedical service for rural Australians has been realised, and it is acknowledged throughout the world for its delivery of emergency and primary health care services in harsh and unique conditions.
Although for many Australians it retains the rather romantic and daring image of its frontier beginnings, the Royal Flying Doctor Service is today a modern and highly professional organisation, applying the latest technology to its medical, aviation and communication tasks. The Royal Flying Doctor Service has 20 bases throughout Australia and a fleet of 46 aircraft. This network of bases provides medical assistance over an area of seven million square kilometres. According to the Flying Doctor magazine, in 2002 the Royal Flying Doctor Service conducted over 190,000 patient consultations, including almost 24,000 patient evacuations and hospital transfers, while its aircraft clocked up over 16 million kilometres.
Those of us representing rural electorates—and I am really pleased to see the number of people contributing to this motion today who represent rural and regional parts of Australia—would all know someone who has needed the help of the flying doctor to stabilise their injuries and bring them in for treatment at their region's major hospital. The mining and farm accidents that weighed so heavily on John Flynn's mind when he first began lobbying for an aerial medical service are now routine call-outs for the RFDS in my electorate which can be responded to in minutes not days. The RFDS responded to a unique and particularly distressing call last year when its staff and aircraft were used to return victims of the Bali bombing home to Australia.
The staff at RFDS bases are on call 24 hours a day, every day of the year. Much of their work is in emergency medical retrieval using Beechcraft Kingair aircraft which are equipped to provide airborne intensive care. Increasingly, the Flying Doctor Service is also returning to its early days when the flying doctor was the family GP to many bush communities. With support from Commonwealth and state governments, the RFDS offers a range of primary health services to people in rural and remote areas, including many Indigenous communities. Medical consultation is provided through telecommunications technology such as phone, radio and videoconferencing and, in many communities, through the more traditional face-to-face clinics. In addition, special programs ensure that people living in remote areas have access to essential advice and information in the fields of mental health, child and family health, immunisation and women's health. 
Today's motion celebrates the achievements of the Royal Flying Doctor Service. The 75th anniversary is a time for celebration but it is also a reminder that the story of the flying doctor has always been full of challenges. As I read about the history of the organisation, it was interesting to note that the issues that troubled John Flynn in the 1920s have not really changed. John Flynn was passionate in his advocacy for inland Australia and would not accept the disadvantage that many people living in remote areas suffered in comparison with their urban counterparts. Back then, he was calling for better access to services, including health, transport, communications and education. Seventy-five years later, those of us who represent people in rural and remote parts of Australia still need to champion their right to equitable access to essential services and the personal and professional opportunities enjoyed by people in the cities.
The other challenge that has been with the RFDS since its inception, and which still exists, is the problem of recruiting medical staff and other professional and support staff to the organisation. Right through the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, John Flynn was reporting to his board and to the Presbyterian Church about the difficulty of recruiting nurses, doctors and other staff to the Flying Doctor Service. These days, when the issue of medical staff in the bush—specialists, nurses and GPs—still remains a critical problem, the Royal Flying Doctor Service, together with all medical services in regional, rural and remote Australia, is struggling with the problem of finding staff to carry out the important job it does for that area.
It is impossible to accurately measure the impact of the RFDS on the development of inland Australia. When John Flynn first set up the RFDS, his vision was as much a patriotic one as it was a humanitarian one. He saw the economic potential of rural and remote Australia in the expansion of the pastoral and mining industries but knew that it would not be possible while people were expected to forgo basic services and take unacceptable risks with their health and the lives of their families. By offering the security of health services and the life-saving work of its doctors, nurses and pilots, the RFDS has made a major contribution to the opening up of inland Australia. The Royal Flying Doctor Service has a great part in Australia's heritage and continues to be a great part of community life in this country. The organisation's success is due to the courage and commitment of many people. I congratulate them. (Time expired)
 (Hon. I.R. Causley)—Is the motion seconded?
—I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Royal Flying Doctor Service: 75th Anniversary</title>,Private Members' Business,2,1,speech
"Wakelin, Barry, MP",LP,2003-09-08,"—It is with great pleasure that I support this private member's motion on the Royal Flying Doctor Service. The history of Australia would not be complete without the story of the RFDS. In all its forms and with all its types of aircraft and practitioners, it is the stuff of legend. Seventy-five years ago the pedal radio and the flying machines, which were relatively new to the world, provided a revolutionary opportunity for greater safety, particularly in remote Australia. 
I remind the House of the services provided today by the RFDS. It provides 24-hour emergency services, primary health care clinics at remote sites and telehealth—that is, radio and telephone consultation. Communications are very important and are getting better. It also provides medical chests—there are 3,000 RFDS medical chests, containing an excellent range of numbered drugs and medical supplies, located in remote locations across Australia—inter-hospital transfers and female GP clinics. That is the core business of the RFDS.  
The RFDS of course is about people, and the outstanding thing that always comes to my mind is the individuals that commit themselves to this unusual provision of medical services. As I say, this is the stuff of national legend. I mentioned interhospital transfers. I can remember, when I was a boy, my father, who was a private pilot withan old Auster Autocar or Aiglet—one or the other—actually welding a stretcher in preparation in case he might be called upon in our rural location for an interhospital transfer. Sure enough, on a Christmas Day some 40 or 50 years ago, the call came. A young lady had got a new bike and fallen off it, and she had serious head injuries. My father was called upon to interrupt Christmas lunch and transfer this girl from the Kimba hospital and from the Kimba air base to Adelaide. I am pleased to report that the young lady grew up and is still living a full life today. That did not involve the RFDS, but that is the kind of thing the RFDS came to do more and more. I suppose it reflects the spirit of the RFDS. 
As a member of parliament, I can remember the effort that the national government has put in just to improve landing strips. For example, about halfway between Port Augusta and Coober Pedy you will find an area where something like half a million dollars has been invested in the national highway to turn it into an emergency landing strip for the RFDS. There are all sorts of adaptations to what the RFDS can do all over this country, and the service that it provides is second to none. 
In conclusion, on a more sombre note, I want to put on record the service by the pilots. These are the best and the most skilled of professionals, but sometimes things go wrong. There was an incident in recent years where, coming into Mount Gambier, an air crash occurred and the pilot lost his life. It is a very safe means of transport but it is not totally without risk. I need to put that in the context of the magnificent service that the RFDS have offered us over 75 years. I thank them. I am sure they will continue to do a great job and I am sure that the $25 million a year the Commonwealth provides is greatly appreciated.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Royal Flying Doctor Service: 75th Anniversary</title>,Private Members' Business,2,1,speech
"Melham, Daryl, MP",ALP,2003-09-08,"—I rise this afternoon in support of the motion from the member for Capricornia acknowledging the 75th anniversary of the Royal Flying Doctor Service. The RFDS provides a service that is crucial for members of the Australian community who live outside the cities. As shadow minister for heritage and territories, I particularly acknowledge the services provided to the territories of Australia. Whether or not they ever use the services of the flying doctors, everyone in Australia knows about the medical and health support services they provide and the tremendous goodwill they generate. 
The statistics about the Royal Flying Doctor Service are quite incredible. It operates 24 hours a day. It services the most remote and inaccessible communities in this vast continent, covering seven million square kilometres. The Alice Springs Hospital is the base hospital for Central Australia. It provides primary emergency response as well as secondary and tertiary services to the Central Australian region and the border regions of South Australia and Western Australia. The Flying Doctor Service covers 80 per cent of Australia, operates 45 aircraft from 23 bases and sees more than 200,000 patients a year. On an average day, the Royal Flying Doctor Service attends 540 patients and conducts 71 aerial evacuations, including interhospital transfers. It attends 24 health care clinics and carries out 156 consultations over the telephone. It performs 135 landings and flies 45,486 kilometres. That is not bad for a day's work. 
In the city, we are not totally isolated from the flying doctors. I know that on the edge of my own electorate, in Sydney, Bankstown Airport operates as an RFDS base. The base will be having an open day on 21 September and I invite people to come and view the aircraft and meet some of the pilots, doctors and nurses of the service. Bankstown provides aeromedical services, primarily clinic flights to country NSW supplying specialist care.
The traditional image of the flying doctor involves a flight into a remote cattle station to save the life of a seriously injured stockman. We should, however, remind ourselves of the range of services provided by the RFDS apart from the 24-hour emergency services. These include health care clinics at remote sites. These regular clinics are provided by doctors, flight nurses and other specialised health professionals and include routine health checks and advice, immunisation, child health care and dental, eye and ear services. There is also telehealth, which is where doctors use the radio or telephone to provide patient consultations for people in remote locations. A famous example of this remote support was the occasion when Captain Arne Rinnan of the Norwegian freighter Tampa contacted the RFDS Cairns base for advice on the medical status of a number of asylum seekers.
The service provides approximately 2,500 medical chests, containing an extensive range of numbered drugs and medical supplies, that are located at remote locations across Australia. These places include isolated pastoral properties, Indigenous communities, out-stations, remote mining sites and lighthouses. Interhospital transfers are another service the flying doctors provide, to transfer patients between small rural and remote area hospitals and larger metropolitan hospitals.
The history and the scope of operations of the RFDS are truly remarkable. With my colleagues, I pay tribute to its special history and vision. I congratulate the Flying Doctor Service and its supporters for its unique contribution to the health and wellbeing of the people in our territories and rural and remote regions. I recently met with Chris Benaud, the marketing manager for the south-eastern section of the service. I can think of no better way to conclude than by quoting one of the service's own values articulated on the south-eastern section web site: `We will do what we say we will do.'
Indeed, the Royal Flying Doctor Service is an Australian icon. It is recognised as such, because the founder, the Reverend John Flynn, and the Royal Flying Doctor Service are depicted on the back of our $20 note. They do not get there easily. It is a recognition of the work and the achievement of that service and of Dr Flynn. I salute the service on its 75th anniversary.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Royal Flying Doctor Service: 75th Anniversary</title>,Private Members' Business,2,1,speech
"Haase, Barry, MP",LP,2003-09-08,"—I rise in support of the Livermore motion, which seeks to provide rightful acknowledgement of a vital service to regional Australians. The Royal Flying Doctor Service, or RFDS, this year celebrates its 75th anniversary—75 years of providing essential emergency aid, 75 years of providing primary health care and 75 years of service and reassurance for people who live, work and travel in regional and remote Australia. Today that has resulted in icon status for that organisation. 
Since its inception in 1928, the Royal Flying Doctor Service has grown into one of the most respected organisations in the world, dedicated to the provision of aeromedical emergency and primary health care services over an area equivalent in size to western Europe. RFDS operates today from 20 bases, 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year—and all of this as a not-for-profit organisation. The concept and the reality of the Royal Flying Doctor Service is and always has been a team effort in some of the most harsh and extreme environments in the world. It is the pilots, health professionals, mechanics, support staff, volunteers, fundraisers and everyday rural Australians involved with RFDS who together make the glue that binds Reverend John Flynn's original concept on so many levels.
His dream of a `mantle of safety' continues to service outback Australians today. Those who inhabit the 2.3 million square kilometres—or 91 per cent of Western Australia—that constitute the Kalgoorlie electorate simply could not live where they do without the Royal Flying Doctors. By virtue of its remoteness, sparse population and climatic extremes, the seat of Kalgoorlie has had a long history with RFDS, starting with the Port Hedland base, founded in 1935, currently staffed by Lindsay Sosbery, Dr Geoff Day, Michelle Bodington and Robyn Boase. The Kalgoorlie base was opened in 1937 and is staffed today by Peter Naglewicz, Dr Lorin Monck, Tim Spokes and Barb Howard. Meekatharra was established in 1946 and is currently run by John Lee Steere, Dr Ron Dobson, Dr Christine McConnell and Joanna Chaston. The base administrator there is Doris Norman.
The last of the four bases that I have is the Derby base, opened in 1955 and now staffed by Captain Trevor Woods, Dr John Britten and Vivian Tapiolas. In fact, I have not long returned from officially opening the upgraded Derby airstrip. The total upgrade, at a cost of some $2 million—including $660,000 of federal government funds—has been justified on the basis of a continued RFDS presence at Derby and the provision of an ongoing service to the people of West Kimberley. Any likelihood of a reassessment resulting in removal of that vital service at Derby airport would be disastrous news indeed. The community of West Kimberley relies heavily on the service provided by the Royal Flying Doctors, and we as a government must continue to improve that service. We must not preside over a process that would see such a vital facility compromised for want of resources.
For any community, especially those living in our most sparsely populated landscape, the fear of service reduction by RFDS is a constant concern. But it is by no means a new fear. From the beginning of white settlement in the outback, the fear of a medical emergency has loomed large in the psyche of frontier Australians remote from major settlement. RFDS are recognised as an invaluable service, and we must acknowledge that they need our continued support and assistance. They need to be supported in their efforts to recruit and retain health professionals in the bush. They need ongoing financial assistance and encouragement to provide training opportunities and they need the cooperation of every community, not just the remote, rural and regional ones who rely so heavily on the RFDS for essential, life-saving services. Who knows when the once-a-year visitor, enjoying their real Australian outback experience, may find they too need the RFDS?
The Royal Flying Doctor Service is a recognised part of our national identity. It gives me a great deal of pleasure to join with my colleagues in this House today to wish a happy 75th birthday to the RFDS. Long may you service real Australians!

"O'Byrne, Michelle, MP",ALP,2003-09-08,"—It is with great pride that I am able to speak today about the Royal Flying Doctor Service, and I would like to join with the member for Capricornia, who initiated this discussion, and other members who have taken the opportunity to congratulate the Flying Doctor Service on its 75th anniversary. The RFDS is an integral part of many regional and rural communities through the provision of essential emergency and primary health care services.
Without the Royal Flying Doctor Service, many people living in remote, rural and regional areas would have great difficulty in accessing emergency health care. Whilst it is imperative to acknowledge the doctors and nurses who work with the service, there are also many other people who work just as hard in their commitment to saving lives in remote locations. I am talking about the pilots, the mechanics, the support staff, the volunteers and particularly the fundraisers, as without their efforts a service such as the RFDS would not be possible.
It is well known that the Reverend John Flynn started the service in 1928 in Queensland. However, it is less well known that the Tasmanian chapter, which is based at Launceston, was developed in 1960. The Tasmanian chapter of the RFDS has provided over 40 years of continuous community service, and it is an anomaly that it remains largely unnoticed in the general Tasmanian community. The lack of presence of the service is, in part, due to the perception that the Flying Doctor Service only goes to the outback. I believe it is crucial that this perception is changed and that the Flying Doctor Service is recognised as an essential service not only in Tasmania but in all regional areas as well.
We all know that the work of the Flying Doctor Service is often carried out under extreme conditions but we do not often realise just how severe the conditions can be until we are faced with the experience. One such extreme situation in late December last year followed a plane crash on Flinders Island in my electorate. The plane had six people on board, with four of them classed immediately as category 1 patients in a critical condition. By the time the volunteer ambulance officers had got to the crash site at Killiecrankie, which is around 40 minutes from Whitemark, the Flying Doctor Service had already arrived on the island. The relief expressed to me by the medical staff at the Flinders Island health centre, who said that the service had just walked through the door and were waiting for the ambulance when it arrived, was enormous. They said handling this situation was made so much easier with the assistance of the Flying Doctor Service. This of course is not an isolated incident, and the medical officers on Flinders Island maintain that the support of the Flying Doctor Service is vital to ensuring the medical needs of the island's residents are met. The Flying Doctor Service are also aware that if Flinders Island call for assistance it is because the situation is dire, and the service know they have to get there as soon as physically possible. The RFDS is an integral part of Flinders Island infrastructure, which is serviced only by one full-time medical officer, who also services Cape Barron.
The Tasmanian chapter of the Flying Doctor Service operates one fully equipped aircraft, which can be backed up by another from Victoria if needed. The service provides emergency trauma evacuation, routine inter-hospital transfers and emergency transfers from Tasmania to the mainland hospitals, including for spinal and burns cases. It also provides neonatal transport and, importantly, provides transport of organ transplant patients from Hobart to Sydney—ensuring that they arrive there within the three-hour time limit. That service means that transplant patients have the option of waiting at home until they are on a transplant list. 
Before 1960, seriously ill patients were evacuated by air from the Bass Strait islands and remote locations by pilots in the Tasmanian Aero Club, which is based at Launceston, Devonport and Wynyard, and the Aero Club of Tasmania, which is based at Cambridge. This was often done in aircraft that were not fully equipped or not equipped at all and by pilots who had no medical training, but there are many Tasmanians who owe their lives to these pilots. In the 1990s the Tasmanian Royal Flying Doctor Service purchased its own aircraft through donations and other funds that it and its volunteers were furiously fundraising for. Another very important aspect of the Tasmanian Flying Doctor Service is that it provides a fully equipped dental surgery, which conducts dental clinics on Flinders Island. Through these services the Tasmanian chapter of the Royal Flying Doctor Service has become a major part of the medical infrastructure in Tasmania. However, as you would understand, it needs the support of the local community and local businesses to continue providing these services.
We have had a community that has supported the RFDS. It has enabled them to make the purchases that they need to make, to get the plane and to get the equipment that they need. But we still need to get the Tasmanian community to understand just how vital the Royal Flying Doctor Service is to their survival. Because we do not see ourselves as an outback regional community, we forget just how crucial this service is. It is incumbent on all people in Tasmania and all those who have representative positions to make sure that everyone understands just how crucial the Flying Doctor Service is to us. It is up to all of us now to ensure that the Royal Flying Doctor Service is congratulated on its 75 years of incredible and excellent service and is there to be able to provide medical services for the next 75 years.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Royal Flying Doctor Service: 75th Anniversary</title>,Private Members' Business,2,1,speech
"Elson, Kay, MP",LP,2003-09-08,"—I am pleased to join with other members in this House—and I thank the member for Capricornia for giving us the opportunity in moving this motion—in congratulating the Royal Flying Doctor Service on their 75th anniversary. It is impossible to speak highly enough of the tremendous and vital services the RFDS provided during those 75 years to Australians in rural and remote areas. The RFDS has become an Australian icon, held in the very highest regard by the people of Australia, regardless of where they live. It would not be an exaggeration to say that many thousands of Australians over the last 75 years owe their lives to the Royal Flying Doctor Service. Having travelled to many remote parts of this nation on both the Aboriginal health and water inquiries, I know that the RFDS helps bridge the vast distances and ensures that quality health care is available to people living in even the most remote parts of this great country.
Dr John Flynn was surely a visionary, but I do not think he could ever have realised exactly how crucial the service has become over the past 75 years. I certainly extend my thanks to the many health professionals, brilliant pilots, mechanics, support staff and volunteers who help ensure the continued operation of the Royal Flying Doctor Service. I also thank the many people throughout Australia who fundraise and who donate to this great organisation. I would like to take this opportunity, if I may, to thank some of the city businesses in my electorate who have sponsored the fundraising efforts of the RFDS over many years. 
Late last year as part of the Year of the Outback celebrations, my husband, David, and I organised a special Year of the Outback pigeon race. The pigeons flew from Roma. They were part of the Queensland Racing Pigeon Federation. Their flyers were very eager to raise funds for a worthy cause and all race entry fees and proceeds went to the RFDS. I want to recognise and thank those special businesses who sponsored the event and donated prizes. My sincere thanks go to Howard Lawrence of De Bortoli Wines, Noel Jargo of Carlton United and Gary Teys from Teys Brothers. These businesses have a tremendous commitment to giving back to the community and supporting its worthy causes. Our Queensland state manager of the Flying Doctor Service particularly wanted me to thank these people because he said that without people like the ones I have just mentioned their service would find it very difficult to exist.
This particular fundraising event saw several thousand dollars raised. I know everybody involved was pleased to be part of this special event, and it brought people closer to understanding fully the services of the Flying Doctor Service. They stated to me that they would never have known of the service provided. But, even though they are city people, if they are out in the bush one day they may need the vital support of the RFDS. They are encouraging other people to support the Flying Doctor Service in the future. I would like to also congratulate Ray Shearer of Ipswich, who was the grand winner of that race. I know that community based fundraising such as this is very important for the Flying Doctor Service and I encourage our city cousins to embrace fundraising ventures throughout the year.
I know that it takes a team effort to make sure funds are raised, and I would like to put on record the state government's contribution in Queensland and also the many city and country people who work on a voluntary basis to fundraise for the RFDS and also the federal government's commitment to their funds. The government has an ongoing commitment to provide health services for all Australians, and I know that it supports the Flying Doctor Service in making sure we get more doctors into rural areas. I am pleased to advise the member for Capricornia that this government is taking action on the problems that she addressed in the recruiting and retaining of doctors in regional and rural areas. The results show that we are making progress.
In 1999 the Howard government introduced the Rural Retention Program, which makes payments to rural GPs. Since it was introduced, more than 2,400 doctors have received payments, and the latest data shows that the labour supply of GPs in rural areas has increased by 4.9 per cent in the last year alone. To further boost doctors in rural areas in Australia, we also introduced the Rural Australia Medical Undergraduate Scholarship. The scheme provides rural students with up to $10,000 a year until graduation to help them with their costs. We are also funding the rural women's GP service, which has provided 19,000 consultations in 104 rural and remote locations; the Regional Health Services Program, which has 98 new health services across Australia providing services to 900 communities; and $2.8 million each year for the Greater Murray Clinical School at Wagga.

"McFarlane, Jann, MP",ALP,2003-09-08,"—I am pleased to stand in the House today and add my voice to that of my colleagues in congratulating the Royal Flying Doctor Service on their 75th anniversary and wishing them a happy birthday. The Royal Flying Doctor Service, as has been pointed out, came out of the efforts of one man to make life better for people in the outback because of a tragedy. Out of this tragedy has evolved and developed one of the most magnificent services in the world. It shows that, when people have a vision and are focused on their community—not just on the needs of the community but also on what could be the solutions—amazing things happen. The Royal Flying Doctor Service is an example of an amazing thing. 
If people want to look at the Royal Flying Doctor Service web site to find out their history, what they do and some of their stories, the web site address is www.rfds.org.au. For those who do not have a computer, I encourage you to go to your friends, families, neighbours or local library to use a computer and look at the web site there, because it is a truly amazing story. It is a story of how medicine, aviation and radio combine to bring health and medical care to the people who live, work and travel in the more remote areas of Australia.
Coming from an electorate in Western Australia, I know that people sometimes think the Royal Flying Doctor Service is not really relevant to their lives. But Western Australia is the largest state. It covers the same landmass as that of four states on the eastern seaboard. It covers the same area as Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory combined—with Tasmania thrown in as an extra important area, as the member for Bass has pointed out. But why is the Royal Flying Doctor Service so important? It is important because we never know when we are going to need it. So I encourage people in the community, when you are giving your annual or biannual donation to a good community service, to seriously consider giving a donation to the Royal Flying Doctor Service.
For the purpose of expanding people's thinking about what can happen to you when you are travelling in a remote area, here is a story from the Royal Flying Doctor Service web site. It is about a family who went on holidays. The story is entitled `Like most people we never thought it would happen to us ...'. In this story, the parents went to Monkey Mia and set up camp. Their little boy, Ryan, was a bit off-colour. They went to the nurses station and, before they knew it, the Royal Flying Doctor Service had been called to evacuate Ryan and his mother to Carnarvon and then on to Perth. This story is an example of how a Perth based family went out into the remote areas of Western Australia and ended up very grateful that the Royal Flying Doctor Service saved the life of their son.
The people who work for the Royal Flying Doctor Service are, in a way, the last of the pioneers. The situations in which they work and have to carry out their duties are often quite difficult. If you do not have the skills to do the job then the people who need the services may suffer a loss. Another story on the web site is called `The wildflower evacuation'. Captain Doug Dawson talks about how a call came in from a station north of Southern Cross, a very remote part of Western Australia. A worker had broken his leg. He dragged himself to the phone. The Royal Flying Doctor Service were ready to fly out. They called the patient, who confirmed the strip had been inspected in the past few days, saying, `It's in good condition, but has a few wildflowers on it.' But when the plane got there, they found the landing strip also had cattle, who were eating the wildflowers, on it. The plane had to fly over a number of times to shift the stock. These are truly difficult conditions in which to work. It is an amazing story.
There are stories on the web site about people in the community having road accidents in remote areas and how the Royal Flying Doctor Service has had to fly in and land on roads. The stories show the community effort when people from a roadhouse go out and clear the road so the Royal Flying Doctor Service plane can land. There is another story on the web site about a search and rescue out at sea. When the local rescue services could not find a boat that had sent up a distress signal, the Royal Flying Doctor Service—which has the equipment to pinpoint beacons—went out and found the missing boat and the people who were affected. 
The Royal Flying Doctor Service runs a number of visitors centres around Australia. There are five in Western Australia. I encourage people to visit the visitors centres. Groups—school groups and tourists—and individuals can go there and have a look at the Royal Flying Doctor Service's work. But mainly I say to people: support the Royal Flying Doctor Service. As we know, we never know when we may need it. Australians love to travel. We never know when we may need to call on the RFDS. Happy birthday to the Royal Flying Doctor Service, and keep up the good work.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Royal Flying Doctor Service: 75th Anniversary</title>,Private Members' Business,2,1,speech
"Cobb, John, MP",NP,2003-09-08,"—I too join with members of the government and the opposition to congratulate the Royal Flying Doctor Service on its 75th anniversary. It is a chance for all of us to reflect on the work of the RFDS, especially those of us who represent remote electorates such as mine, the electorate of Parkes. Parkes covers some of the most remote towns and communities in New South Wales, from Broken Hill in the far west to Ivanhoe in the south, Tibooburra in the north-west and Dubbo in the east. For someone who has always lived in the western division of New South Wales, I am in a good position to value the work that the Royal Flying Doctor Service has always done.
Our praise for and congratulations on the work of the RFDS should be ongoing. While the commemorative year is a great chance to officially recognise the work of the RFDS and its volunteers, we can never afford to become complacent about the work that it does and that it must do in the future. As has already been mentioned, that goes for the doctors and nurses, the allied health professionals, the pilots and mechanics, the staff, the volunteers and the enormous number of fundraisers who work right around Australia. The easiest thing to do is to get people to agree that if they are going to give money they should give it to the Royal Flying Doctor Service.
The south-eastern division of the RFDS covers my electorate and the whole of New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania. There are bases at Broken Hill, Dubbo, Bankstown, Melbourne, Essendon and Launceston. It is more than just an emergency medical service; it provides comprehensive health care to people who live, work and travel in outback and country Australia. It is on stand-by 24 hours a day, waiting to make that emergency flight to a patient in any life-threatening situation. In effect, it is the lifeline of regional and remote Australia and, for those who live outside coastal and metropolitan areas, it has a great history of being a vital link.
We depend upon the RFDS not only for medical emergencies; we also depend upon them for specialist services which would otherwise have to be found in Sydney or Adelaide, which could be more than a day's drive away for many people in my electorate. In New South Wales, with the Rural Area Health Service, the RFDS brings city specialists to the country, ensuring country people get the best possible specialist care. ENT specialists, audiologists, dermatologists and many others fly to remote towns regularly giving consultations to the locals.
Specialists and primary health care services to western New South Wales are provided by the RAHS from the Dubbo base, which is an extremely important geographical and strategic base. It provides 24-hour access to high-quality aeromedical transport to more than 50 locations across central and north-western New South Wales. Prior to the establishment of the Dubbo base, Broken Hill RFDS and Sydney's Air Ambulance served all fixed-wing aeromedical services in rural and regional New South Wales. In Dubbo, the RFDS has a partnership with the University of Sydney's Department of Rural Health and the Dubbo Rural Clinical School of Medicine to foster training, professional development and medical education. 
The 2002 annual report of the RFDS showed that in the previous year almost 1,300 hours had been spent in the air by the Royal Flying Doctor Service, covering 440,000 kilometres. The service made 862 inter-hospital transfers. Broken Hill serves 640,000 square kilometres, providing 24-hour service, inter-hospital transfers, student placement programs and primary health clinics across the outback. The Rural Area Health Service facilitates specialist visits at all of those clinics. As well as diagnosing and treating injury and disease, the clinics promote preventative health care. Some 1,066 health clinics are provided by the Broken Hill base at about 30 locations, including White Cliffs, Tibooburra and Hungerford and towns where there are large Indigenous populations, such as Wilcannia and Ivanhoe.
With regard to the last part of the motion—`the difficulty in recruiting and retaining health professionals in remote, rural and regional Australia'—this government takes this responsibility very seriously. It is not just a problem for the RFDS; it is obviously a problem throughout much of country Australia, and we have introduced an enormous range of services to deal with it.

"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2003-09-08,"—I would like to congratulate the member for Capricornia for bringing this very important motion to the House today. The Royal Flying Doctor Service is an Australian icon, one which provides a vital service to people living in remote and isolated areas of Australia. The ethos and identity of the Australian outback are intertwined with the Royal Flying Doctor Service. It is only through its existence and the dedication of doctors and health professionals that provide the lifesaving medical care to people living in those areas that it has been possible for Australians to build their lives, businesses and economy in the outback whilst, at the same time, having access to medical care—be it in an emergency situation such as a snake bite or through ongoing medical care. I would like to recognise the 75 years of service that the Royal Flying Doctor Service has provided to Australians living in the outback. I would like to acknowledge the fine work and dedication of the pilots, mechanics, volunteers and fund-raisers, in addition to those doctors and health care professionals who work for the Royal Flying Doctor Service.
In the last parliament, I was a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs and we did an inquiry into Indigenous health. I was able to experience first-hand the fine work that the Royal Flying Doctor Service does in those outback regions. We visited the Royal Flying Doctor Service base at Broken Hill and we spoke to the doctors, who told us of the difficulties, the isolation and the challenges that they faced each day. I congratulate them on the fine work they do and their dedication to people living in the outback areas of Australia.
I would now like to turn to the fourth part of the motion, which states: 
... the difficulty in recruiting and retaining health professionals in remote, rural and regional Australia that threatens to impact on the services provided by the RFDS.
The Howard government have failed to ensure adequate services to people in rural and remote areas. Once again, I have experienced that first-hand when I have visited those areas and seen how the policies that this government have implemented have not met the needs of those communities. Those communities need to have doctors and nurses but very few of them do. The government need to realise that Australia exists outside the capital cities. They need to link into the needs of regional areas. They need to become aware of the fact that we do have a chronic doctor shortage throughout Australia and they need to address that. The fact is that specialists are very centralised and it is very difficult for people in regional, rural and outback areas to access them. Dental care is non-existent in some areas, and the nursing shortages are having an enormous impact. The government have failed to address this. They have not answered the needs of people living in these areas. They need to determine why there is a shortage, develop a strategy to address this shortage and recognise that Australia exists outside the capital cities.

"O'Byrne, Michelle, MP",ALP,2003-09-08,"—Around 60 people protested outside Parliament House in Hobart last week. That is not odd except that this protest consisted mainly of children and was organised by two grade 5 students who are unhappy about the decision to cut Behind the News. This is an important resource for teachers and parents in assisting children develop skills in critical thinking and analysis. Whilst it is the ABC management who have carried through with the axing of this program, it is an indictment that the federal government does not provide the ABC with sufficient funding to ensure there is no need to carry out such cuts. ABC Kids and Fly TV have also been cut, and last week it was announced that the ABC has cancelled plans to roll out ABC radio services to around 60 towns in regional Australia.
The government need to take a look at the reason why these decisions are being made, stop blaming the ABC for their own funding shortfalls and start looking at how best to service the needs of the whole of Australia. It is not this parliament's job to set ABC programs, but it is our job to listen. So let us now listen to some of the children of Launceston. Stephen from grade 6 said:
All the primary children in Australia plead to bring back BTN. It is our future and teaches the news to us. I never understood tax until I saw BTN.
Phoebe, also in grade 6, said:
I'm sure the ABC would not just go ahead and cancel the news, so don't cancel our news because we are the future.
And Zac said:
It cost $1.26 million for one year of BTN and it cost $15 million for fridge magnets! So why don't we take some of the money away from fridge magnets so we can keep BTN alive.",REPS,<title>STATEMENTS BY MEMBERS</title>,<title>Australian Broadcasting Corporation: Funding</title>,Statements by Members,3,1,speech

"SPEAKER, The",N/A,2003-09-08,"—I indicate to the member for Werriwa that I have had a look at the point. He is right to say there are occasions when opposition members have been interrupted in a point of order—so have government members, by the way, but there may be a greater frequency of opposition members, given that there are infinitely more points of order raised by opposition members than there are by government members. There may be instances in which I need to review my policy, but in most instances I have, as he is aware, only refused to hear a complete point of order when the point of order was being used to re-ask the question rather than simply draw the matter of relevance. My instance, as I have instanced before in this place, is that, if a member has a matter of relevance, it is easy for the chair to determine without hearing the question restated whether or not the answer is relevant to the question, particularly as the chair has already written the question out. As he would be aware, it is a common practice for all oppositions to use points of order to restate a question and that relevance is not necessarily the substance of the point of order.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS TO THE SPEAKER</title>,<title>Points of Order</title>,Questions to the Speaker,7,1,answer
"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2003-09-08,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	notes the problems and possibilities identified in the report Maximising Aust-ralia's Asia Knowledge: repositioning and renewal of a national asset, pre-pared by the Asian Studies Association of Australia;
(2)	recognises that the national interest is served by the knowledge Australians have of their world and particularly of their own diverse, complex region; and
(3)	commends efforts by governments, educ-ational instit-utions, businesses and voluntary associations to renew, enhance and extend Australian knowledge of Asia.
Knowledge of Asia is important for Australia: 50 per cent of our trade is with Asia; 154,000 students from Asia attended Australian institutions here and abroad in 2000; 40 per cent of Australian residents going overseas list Asia as their major destination; and more than a million Australians were born in Asia—that is six per cent of our population. However, in 2001, less than five per cent of the university student load was devoted to Asian studies or Asian languages. It is in our national interest that more students take up either Asian studies or Asian languages. By way of illustration, speaking about East Timor, Peter Cosgrove has made the point:
... many Australian officers were able to establish cooperative relations with Indonesian counterparts in East Timor because they had either trained in Indonesia, learned Bahasa (Indonesian) or had hosted Indonesian personnel who had trained in Australia.
He went on to make the point:
All of the regional contributors to INTERFET from the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore, South Korea and Malaysia were accompanied by Australian officers who spoke their languages, knew their cultures and had formed relationships with key officers in their armed forces.
The report Maximising Australia's Asia knowledge calls for a repositioning and renewal of a vital national resource—that is, Australia's Asia knowledge.
When we look at things like the study of Asian languages, there is good news. The number of students enrolled in Asian language subjects in Australian universities has increased substantially since the late 1980s. Student exchanges and study overseas are much more common and are encouraged by the government's University Mobility in Asia and the Pacific program, which supported 95 projects in 2003—more than half of them in Asia. The study of higher demand languages such as Japanese, Mandarin Chinese and Indonesian has increased between two and four times since 1988, but for lesser demand languages the picture is more mixed. The study of Korean has increased, while fewer institutions offer Hindi, Vietnamese and Thai. The study of Indian—where Australia has had an international reputation—and the languages of South and West Asia has contracted dramatically.
The report has 15 recommendations. The recommendations are practical and achievable. They will cost on average $3.8 million a year. They support, for example, web based learning and ways of securing strategically important languages such as Arabic, Pashto and Persian. They also recommend the establishment of an Australian Fulbright scheme for younger scholars in Asia to work in an Australian institution for a year. Such a scheme requires the name of an outstanding Australian to capture the imagination. When looking for a name, we should not go past Weary Dunlop, a surgeon famous for his humanitarian work on the Burma-Thai railway who had a lifelong interest in South-East Asia. Another recommendation encourages universities to cooperate in language teaching. This already occurs in Adelaide, where Flinders University teaches Indonesian and Adelaide University teaches Japanese and Mandarin. Arrangements like these make good sense in the use of resources. I encourage the House to support this motion and the Minister for Education, Science and Training and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to adopt the recommendations. 
It is sometimes simplistically suggested that the Labor Party is the only party interested in the region. Paul Keating used to lay claim to discovering Asia. The member for Griffith says it from time to time. The Leader of the Opposition only last week was calling for engagement with Asia. Engagement with Asia has been an Australian priority for more than 60 years. The recent two-volume history Facing North highlighted this and documents a century of Australian engagement with Asia. The Labor Party does not have a mortgage on Asia. In fact, the Liberal Party has a proud tradition of engagement with Asia. Under the Menzies government, our first missions in Japan and China were opened, the Colombo Plan began, Australia assisted the defence of South Korea, we helped defeat communist insurgency in Malaysia, we assisted Malaysia with their `confrontation', the Australian-Japan trade agreement of 1957 was signed and the great expansion of the study of Asia began in the 1950s. Under the Fraser government, we accepted more refugees from Indochina per capita than any other country.
This proud tradition of the Liberal Party continues with the Howard government. We have witnessed extensive bilateral agreements on counter-terrorism and people-smuggling. One example is the excellent cooperation between the Australian Federal Police and the Indonesian police after the Bali bombing. Our role in East Timor, the $25 billion liquid natural gas contract with China and the IMF support packages of 1997 are all testament to the Liberal Party's ongoing interest and achievements in Asia.

"Cox, David, MP",ALP,2003-09-08,"—I second the motion. The member for Boothby has outlined many sound reasons why the teaching of Asian studies and Asian languages in Australia is absolutely critical. These reasons were very well outlined in last year's Asian Studies Association of Australia report, Maximising Australia's Asia knowledge: repositioning and renewal of a national asset. It is an extremely impressive and, as events have proven, timely piece of work. The member for Boothby and I decided to sponsor this motion after arranging for its authors to brief our colleagues who are members of the Australia-Japan Parl-iamentary Friendship Group, of which we are respectively chair and deputy. I also arranged a briefing that was well attended by a wide group of Labor members who were impressed by the report and wanted to help further its aims. A number of my colleagues, including the member for Fremantle, wanted to contribute to this debate; unfortunately, the time available for private members' motions is too limited.
The report identifies the focus that needs to be put on the acquisition of knowledge about Australia and Asian languages at our institutions of higher learning because that knowledge is an asset that is essential to Australia's economic, strategic and cultural interests. Engagement requires an understanding of language, culture, politics and economics. We have much to gain not only in terms of economics and culture but also in terms of strengthening our national security. Australia needs to deepen its knowledge base on Asian issues and to substantially increase the number of Australians who have access to and use that knowledge base. Budget cuts at our universities have led to a contraction of subjects taught that primarily relate to Asia. The pool of Asian specialists is contracting. Universities are not necessarily replacing Asian specialists when they retire and some specialists are taking posts overseas, attracted by better resources for research and higher salaries. 
University courses, particularly those with a vocational focus, are self-consciously recognising the need to cover Asian issues in course content but are not able to provide the depth that would be desirable. The report estimates that only five per cent of undergraduates study either an Asian language or a subject substantially relating to Asia. This compares with a target set by the Asian Studies Council and the Ingleson report in 1988-89 of 20 per cent by the year 2000. Studies relating to China and the Chinese language have the highest rates of participation, but this amounts to less than two per cent of the undergraduate population. The number of Asian languages on offer in courses at Australian universities has actually been declining since 1987. As an example, the number of universities teaching substantial courses about India has fallen from 15 in 1988 to only five in 2001. 
The report describes the study of Indonesia and Indonesian language as having faltered. The modest recommendations made by the report—costing a total of $3.8 million per annum—are very worthy of the government's immediate attention. Unfortunately, the government dropped the ball on the study of Asian languages and Asian culture in our schools when it abolished its contribution to the national Asian languages and studies strategy that was developed in 1992 by the former Labor government and the state governments. I give particular credit in this regard to the member for Griffith, who was absolutely instrumental in making sure that that program was put together. The intention was to have all kids doing an Asian language from grade 1 to year 12 and to give them an appreciation of Asian culture. The states and the Commonwealth together were spending about $500 million on that program over 10 years, and it was making real inroads. I have had a son learning Japanese and another learning Mandarin.
—And they still will be.
—And they still will be because they will be supported in doing that; unfortunately, they will not be supported by the Howard government. The Howard government cut out the Commonwealth's contribution entirely. A few tens of millions of dollars a year were cut to pay for some other programs in the education and training portfolio, which I did not think had anywhere near the quality of the National Asian Languages Program. I think Australia is going to suffer greatly in the coming years for that lack of commitment by the Commonwealth government.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Australian Knowledge of Asia</title>,Private Members' Business,8,1,speech
"Charles, Bob, MP",LP,2003-09-08,"—I rise to support this motion. I thank the member for Boothby for bringing it to the parliament's attention. In the few minutes available, I would like to restrict my comments largely to the second point contained in the motion, which states:
(2)	recognises that the national interest is served by the knowledge Australians have of their world and particularly of their own diverse, complex region ... 
My love affair with Asia only began in reasonably recent times. In 1997, I had the opportunity to visit China for two weeks as a guest of the Chinese government as part of a delegation of MPs and senators who were members of the Australia-China Parliamentary Friendship Group. That was in April 1997. Approximately two weeks before our visit, the Prime Minister had visited China with a group of very senior businesspeople from Australia. I had read in our press, and I kept hearing from Labor frontbenchers at the time, that we on this side of the House were downplaying our involvement with Asia—our participation, our encouragement of the Asian tigers and our integration with the Asian community. In China, I found that they so valued the Prime Minister's visit that the then Vice-Premier, Zhu Rongji, who had not scheduled a visit with us, asked for us to please stop by and see him at the Summer Palace. We did that, expecting that it would be just a courtesy call, that we would be there a few minutes, shake hands, have a photograph taken and away we would go. Instead, we were there for an hour and a quarter. We exchanged views. We asked and answered questions on human rights, China's sale of their state owned enterprises, the integration of their economy and the modernisation and opening up of their economy.  
Since then I have had a chance to go back once again to China and to a number of other countries in Asia. Labor says that this government have disengaged with Asia. That is wrong. I think that we are more respected in Asia now than at any time in our dim or close future. It is instructive that, following our first visit to China in 1997, when Jiang Zemin came to visit Australia in the following year or the year after—I forget which—he asked to visit us, the Australia-China Parliamentary Friendship Group, his friends from the Australian parliament. So we had a meeting. When we went back to China again in 1999, Zhu Rongji was then Premier and he scheduled a 1½-hour meeting with us. We discussed very important issues of cooperation between Australia and China. When Li Peng came to visit—I believe it was last year—he put us first on the list of his appointments, before even the Minister for Foreign Affairs.
It is my view that our engagement with China has caused us to be able, from federal parliament, to tell Australians about what a great job China is doing in modernising itself, trying to become part of the world and, hopefully, becoming more open, more transparent and perhaps even some day democratic. I believe that the Chinese view Australia as a very important middle-ranking power that plays far above its weight in international circles. Our discussions with Zhu Rongji in 1999 occurred the day before he left for the United States for major discussions on China's proposed entry to the World Trade Organisation. China viewed Australia's help, Australia's friendship, our location and our relationship as primary factors in trying to convince the Americans that China should become a member of the WTO.

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2003-09-08,"—I rise to speak on the motion moved by the member for Boothby. I think it has particular significance for our relationship with the region. It raises serious questions about our relationship with our closest neighbours. In deciding to comment on the motion, I felt compelled to look in depth over the last week at the report entitled Maximising Australia's Asia knowledge: repositioning and renewal of a national asset. I can say that it is certainly a worthy report. It has some decent practical recommendations for all governments to embrace. The report is a lengthy review of the need to confront what it refers to as `the crisis of renewal' in redressing the decline in the significance this nation attaches to the important dissemination of useful knowledge of Asia among Australian university students. I could not help but notice that the report was devoted to the memory of long-time Indonesian academic, peace activist and founder of Monash University's Centre of South-East Asian Studies, Herb Feith. I had the good fortune to be a student of that inspiring lecturer in the early 1980s. If he had not tragically died, only days after I was elected to this place, I am sure he would have commended the report's efforts to regain momentum in an important area of Australia's learning. 
I think it is important to note, however, that this government really has let us down in this important area. I agree with the comments made by the member for Kingston when he touched on the cancellation of the national Asian languages program that was reported on late last year. I agree with the shadow minister for education and with the shadow minister for foreign affairs, who said: `Terminating the strategy threatens Australia's links with neighbouring countries and will diminish our position in the Asian region.' The budgetary cuts are certainly a slight on our relationship. The member for Boothby indicated that Labor do not have a mortgage on our relationship with Asia. That may well be true, but in decades no prominent Labor member in this place has been on the record indicating that there should be significant cuts to immigration; nor have we ever played Asian immigration for political or electoral gain in the way in which the Prime Minister has. I have to say that there are some black marks on the government's side in respect of our relationship with Asia. 
I do agree that our relationship with our closest neighbours is a long one. It is one that has been developing over time. This report intends to ensure that we strengthen the relationship and that we initiate an impetus that will reactivate that relationship. The report makes some very significant recommendations which I think should be considered by this government and indeed all governments, because learning languages crosses more than one governmental jurisdiction. It is something for all governments to contemplate. It is important that we ensure that our relationship is strong. It is fair to say that former Prime Minister Keating was correct this year when he said:
Australians must never forget, and our governments must never forget, that, in the end, the only place Australia can find its security is in Asia, not from Asia.
Those words are wise, and they should be considered by this government. This report in particular should be considered by this government. Perhaps the budgetary cuts should be reversed in order to ensure that our understanding of Asia and its languages is put in its proper place so that our relationship can only be strengthened as a result.

"Johnson, Michael, MP",LP,2003-09-08,"—I am delighted to speak on the motion moved by the member for Boothby, and I want, first of all, to commend him on the motion and acknowledge the great contribution he makes to promoting Australia-Japan relations in this parliament through his chairmanship of the Australia-Japan friendship group. The Asian Studies Association of Australia exists to support and promote the study and understanding of Asia in Australia. I have a great interest in speaking on the recent report that it released, Maximising Australia's Asia knowledge: repositioning and renewal of a national asset. 
Australia's Asian knowledge is indeed a national asset. It has developed through the dedicated study and research of Asian experts and specialists throughout the universities and educational institutions of this country since the 1950s. Since then it has flourished. Indeed it has grown tremendously through the diverse contribution that has been made to it by immigrants. The report concludes that the challenges facing Australia's Asia knowledge are greater than ever and that much more certainly needs to be done to rise to meet the demands and pressures that surround the learning and skilling of Australians in terms of our broad Asian knowledge base.  
We especially need to rise to new heights and new standards to meet the competition of the region and the world when it comes to renewing and growing this knowledge for our future security, prosperity and cultural interaction. The recommendations of the report focus on education and they propose increased study of and research into Asia at a tertiary level. The solutions that are proposed include new fellowships, new academic places and increased opportunities for language teaching. In terms of language exposure, I can certainly speak personally of the enriching experience of learning another language. I had the opportunity of learning Chinese Mandarin in Beijing, in 1994, and at Shanghai's Fudan University, where I had the opportunity of spending some time enrolled in Chinese language courses. 
The multicultural heritage that this country has is substantial. The multicultural nature of our nation brings with it a very rich heritage of knowledge, cultural understanding and language. This heritage is wonderfully diverse and a tremendous asset to our country. An example of this diversity can be seen in Brisbane with the existence of Radio 4EB, the ethnic broadcaster. I had the opportunity of speaking to Radio 4EB listeners yesterday, on the Indian program and then on the Chinese program. These sorts of resources are wonderful for our country. They provide the opportunity for Australians from different backgrounds to be enriched and to have exposure to all the important topics that this country has for them to consider.
Many of our largest trading partners are in Asia. Japan, China and Korea were Nos 1, 3 and 4 respectively in 2000-01. The Prime Minister was recently in China to meet its new President, Hu Jintao, and the Chinese President is coming to this country in October, which will be a wonderful opportunity for Australians to meet China's new President. Australia is also involved in a number of organisations in the region, such as APEC, and we are very committed to advancing the cause of open and free trade in the Asia-Pacific region. Recently the foreign minister signed a free trade agreement in Singapore, and there are great possibilities of doing that with Thailand.
I want to say in the parliament that, for my part, it is important that I let the people of Ryan know of the contribution that I am making in small ways to promote the very critical relationship that this country has with Asia. In my maiden speech, I referred to the fact that I was the first Australian in the House of Representatives to have a Chinese heritage—a great source of pride to me. In the Ryan electorate I have had the opportunity of addressing both schoolchildren and teachers of language courses. In 2002 I had the great privilege of speaking at the National Chinese Teachers Conference at my old school of St Peter's Lutheran College at Indooroopilly, and only in June this year I had the privilege of speaking to the students of Centenary State High School. I was very kindly invited by Mrs Hu Richards to speak of my experience of studying a foreign language and of the wonderful opportunities that having another language can open up to individuals. In terms of the parliament, I have just had the great privilege of being in Cambodia, where I was with my colleague the member for Cowper. We had the opportunity of playing a part in the Cambodian national elections.

"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,2003-09-08,"—I say at the outset that, while we are all comforted that the member for La Trobe goes to copious meals with the Chinese leadership both here and in China, that probably has much to do with this government's determination to discuss human rights behind closed doors rather than in open dialogue. There is also their conduct towards Burma; in the Western world they are a pariah for their facilitation of that government through the so-called legal aides course. But I do welcome, although I am somewhat surprised by, the initiative of the member for Boothby in moving this motion. As the member for Burke detailed, it obviously again brings to light debates over migration and multiculturalism and, more particularly, those initiatives by the current Prime Minister which have unfortunately led to his current minister for immigration being forced to cross the floor of this parliament. So it does highlight that history, for all the talk about what the Liberal and conservative governments did after the Second World War, initiatives which were largely unavoidable in the context of the decline of colonialism anyway. They were really not earth-shattering initiatives. The opening of relationships with China was perhaps an initiative of some international importance—one undertaken by a Labor government. 
It also highlights the government's termination of the National Asian Languages and Studies in Australian Schools, NALSAS, strategy. All speakers on both sides have emphasised the need for Asian studies in this country. The decision to pull out of that funding initiative because it was supposedly self-sustaining is not really the highlight of activity on this front. Over $200 million was poured into it during that time. Despite the fact that half of our trade is with Asia, that we have significant Asian migration—we have had a fivefold increase since 1981, manifestly in Western Sydney and other regions—that there are a number of international hot spots, including the Korean Peninsular, Russian and Japanese border issues, Kashmir and its impact with regard to Islamic fundamentalism, and the Philippines and Mindanao autonomy moves and the Muslim insurgency there—despite all these positives as to why we should emphasise this area, the Asian Studies Association of Australia report Maximising Australia's Asia knowledge: repositioning and renewal of a national asset is fairly dire in its predictions. It notes:
The momentum for the study of Asia which built up in the late 1980s and early 1990s is at risk ... we also identify an overall sense of diminution of resources, opportunities and expertise. Other inquiries of the 1990s point in similar directions. The key point is that the spread of useful knowledge of Asia among Australian university students is stalled.
Earlier speakers detailed that the question of cost cutting and lack of taxpayer support for universities has led to a position where these courses have been downgraded and reduced, to the disappearance of some of our academics overseas and to a message to those people interested in this study area that your future may not be very rosy within Australia in these fields. Perhaps of course that is interrelated with the enhanced dominance of English internationally. Probably the mind-set of many Australians is that, with computerisation, international advertising and American media power, English has become so dominant that perhaps there is less value to Asian studies. However, I join with other speakers in saying that, if we are to understand the region, if we are to be a part of it, if we are to have advantages with regard to our crucial trade—as I said, essentially half of where we are seeking to operate is in Asia—then we should have an emphasis on this. The government's decision to end that funding is not in line with the spirit of the member's motion. 
 (Mr Jenkins)—Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The debate is adjourned and the resumption of the debate will be made an order of the day for the next sitting.

"Andren, Peter, MP",IND,2003-09-08,"—I wish to raise concerns about the future of the Landcare movement. I am pleased to see the Minister for the Environment and Heritage and the parliamentary secretary in the House. We are at a time when severe crises in Australia's environment demand urgent action. The results of decades of unsustainable land use and vast clearing of native vegetation and habitat do not exist in some mythical future but are happening now. 
On current trends the total area of—mainly farming—land affected by salinity in Australia is expected to rise to over 15½ million hectares. This is an increase of over 620 per cent from the current unacceptable 2½ million hectares and it does not include the consequences of the hitherto unchecked land clearing in Queensland. Within 20 years, drinking water supplies taken from the Murray River in South Australia will, on average, be too salty to drink two days out of every five. On current salinity trends, internationally significant Ramsar listed wetlands such as New South Wales's Macquarie Marshes will become wastelands within this lifetime. The water agreement struck recently is a very welcome milestone, but the journey has only just begun. 
In April this year the Australian Terrestrial Biodiversity Assessment gave a stark picture of the collapse of Australia's rich biodiversity. Australia already accounts for a third of the world's recent mammal extinctions, with 22 mammals already gone and another eight just hanging on but only on the islands. Another 346 animals and birds, eight invertebrates and an incredible 1,241 plants are facing a threatened survival. With Australia containing about 10 per cent of the world's biodiversity, this is nothing short of environmental disaster. Even our previously thought pristine wilderness areas are facing the same sort of biodiversity loss, and nearly 3,000 unique bushland types throughout Australia are at risk of disappearing—from the Kimberley to Northern Australia to the Queensland rainforests. 
One of the worst droughts in living memory—with Australians in rural areas still struggling with the consequences—and the crisis of the once mighty Murray have refocused attention on the Australian continent's fragile and dying ecosystems. We have a once unlikely coalition of conservationists and farmers agreeing that this ravaged country needs urgent restoration. Their 2000 manifesto, Repairing the country,put a $60 billion figure on the cost of repairing land clearing, salinity and soil degradation, with a minimum cost of $4½ billion needed immediately. That is four times the amount of money already delivered by the government's Natural Heritage Trust, which—welcome though it is—unfortunately had to be funded by the part sale of Telstra. The Prime Minister's Science, Engineering and Innovation Council has costed the repair bill at $6 billion per year.
This is the current picture. Yet bleak as it is there is another, brighter story being told, where land-holders and regional communities have been identifying environmental problems in their own paddocks and putting together projects to address them. That is the Landcare movement. From its small beginnings in the mid-1980s, Landcare has nourished solid partnerships between farmers and environmentalists, scientists, land managers and different levels of government. It has grown to over 4,250 groups across Australia. Between 30 and 40 per cent of Australia's primary land managers—our farmers—are members of a Landcare group, with many of the remainder accessing those extension services hitherto provided by government and seeking individual support to achieve environmentally sustainable management practices on their land. 
The Landcare movement embodies an investment of 15 years of community and individual commitment—15 years of capacity building and education, of turning around entrenched attitudes, and of ownership of local environmental problems and their solutions. It is people coming together to improve our environment for the public good. Landcare is Australia's own unique success story and it has been copied worldwide. But now it is itself in need of support. With diminishing funding dollars and our environmental values being eroded and felled at an unsustainable rate, it is obvious that a more integrated approach to natural resource management is urgently needed. It makes sense to better coordinate community and government efforts within a catchment by allocating resources towards those issues determined as priorities and fitting in within an overall plan—the catchment blueprint. 
But, in moving towards a regional model of natural resource management, there is a grave danger of moving away from local ownership of projects and losing the enormous asset of the grassroots goodwill and social capital so vital to the success of so many environmental solutions. It is essential that the funds and energy put into regional priorities are matched by strong links with community. Those regional bodies overseeing the catchment blueprints must recognise and support land care and community. If those linkages are not built into the new framework and local ownership of projects is diminished with the new regional model of environmental funding, the momentum built over the past 15 years will diminish and the dollars poured into projects could well turn out to be a complete waste of money. 
Over the past year, the concerns I have heard from Landcare groups are numerous and worrying. The catchment management boards, faced with a huge job of change management within impossibly short time frames, are unsure of their own futures beyond the end of the year and have been part of the general uncertainty that is undermining Landcare confidence. The new authority model—although it is generally thought that it will provide much-needed accountability and transparency—has yet to be established, and that means more change. Information about strategies for investment, informing the community and the prospective community service officer positions has yet to be released. Despite this lack of guidelines, committed people are being invited to apply for the positions, which are to be filled by next month.
Community groups face losing their expert guidance and their major link with the whole process—their Landcare coordinators. They face an uncertain future, with the real possibility that their own management plans may not even get a look in under the regional priorities. In my electorate, community groups have not been privy to information that has informed and involved their own priorities. Already I hear of groups wanting to give up because they believe their voice is no longer deemed important enough. Without the coordinators and the facilitators from those groups to encourage, educate and involve, we run a huge risk of leaving behind the input of the farmer, or the new blockie, leaving them withering on the branch. This important change in our natural resource management funding has been handled abysmally and is causing great damage at a grassroots level. Perhaps the government knows better and we are not being told, but it seems to me that the state government has a large role to play in this, and this has contributed enormously to the uncertainty. 
While the new regional authority model is mooted to be more accountable, there need to be mechanisms embedded to ensure a transparent community-led regional assessment that actively involves land managers and responds to subcatchment priorities. There needs to be an assurance built into the framework that NHT2 funds will not be absorbed by research that has already been done, by government coffers—in the states particularly—and by the rapidly growing private consultancy industry. The money must reach the ground where it is so urgently needed. The new authorities must include in their constitutions a demand for capacity building and true community involvement. At the end of the day it is the landowners, and their community support, who can and do commit to and deliver the specific outcomes. Accredited property management plans must also be allowed every opportunity to link into the regional plan. This further empowers the landowner and allows the mapping of progress and an accountable means of delivering public money. In Victoria, the BushTender pilot program has received terrific support from landholders, and maybe that is the sort of model that is needed. 
All of this is obvious, but the change does not seem to be taking these issues into account. It seems to be ad hoc, at least in the minds of the Landcare people I speak to. Our Landcare groups and our long-suffering catchment management boards are waiting, with bated breath, for the next instalment. To their credit, the New South Wales Minister for Natural Resources and our own federal ministers are hearing these concerns and, I believe, are responding. There are people on the tablelands who are anxious to get on with the job now that they have had three inches of rain; in fact, they are going to self-fund their coordinator position in the intervening period, so concerned are they that the continuity must be there.
We need to make sure that, when this drought breaks, the community and the land-holder will be there to provide the most important part of this jigsaw; and it is like a big jigsaw. It is no good looking at the completed model; we have got to look at the constituent bits. These people are telling me that their concern is that their own efforts will be disregarded—and that is something to which a dollar value just cannot be put.",REPS,<title>GRIEVANCE DEBATE</title>,<title>Environment: Landcare</title>,Grievance Debate,9,1,speech
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,2003-09-08,"—I move:
That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Perimeter Security Fence, RAAF Base Tindal, Katherine, NT.
The Department of Defence proposes to provide an alarmed perimeter security fence with an intruder detection and monitoring system around RAAF base Tindal at Katherine in the Northern Territory, to enhance base security. RAAF base Tindal is one part of the chain of airfields stretching across Northern Australia, from Learmonth in Western Australia to Townsville in North Queensland. It is home base for No. 75 Squadron, a tactical fighter squadron equipp-ed with FA18 Hornets. Tindal is also a deployment base for other defence elements, a staging area for exercises conducted in the area and a possible secondary base for the airborne early warning and control capability.  
The capability of RAAF base Tindal to conduct its role in peace or in war can be seriously impaired by loss or damage arising from sabotage or theft. Also, injury to persons entering RAAF controlled areas may give rise to claims if access is inadequately controlled and signposted. To prevent and counter threats associated with sabotage or theft and to reduce the likelihood of injury, a physical security protection system is required for RAAF base Tindal. A component of an integrated protection system is a fence of sufficient standard to be effective in preventing or detecting unauthorised access. 
The proposed perimeter fence system will consist of the following components: a weldmesh security fence; an intruder detection system with security cameras; and a cattle fence, access roads, firebreaks and supporting civil works. Over the construction period of some nine to 12 months, about 30 to 40 personnel may be directly employed on construction activities. Additional effort will be associated with off-site prefabrication and material activity to support the project. The budget estimate for the proposed works is $9.25 million. 
In its report, the Public Works Committee has recommended that this project proceed. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction will start early next year and be completed by the end of that year. On behalf of the government, I would like to thank the committee for its support. I commend the motion to the House.

"Melham, Daryl, MP",ALP,2003-09-08,"—I propose to treat the debate at this stage on the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 as a cognate debate so that my comments will relate to each of the environment and heritage bills that are returned from the Senate with amendments. Labor opposed these amendments in the Senate. Although some changes were made to the government's original package of heritage bills before they were introduced to this House, there were still far too many problems for Labor to support them without a long list of necessary amendments. On that basis, Labor proposed a large set of amendments in the Senate. Nearly all of them were voted down. The Senate's amendments that have returned to the House improve certain aspects of the government's legislation, but they do not go far enough. That is why Labor will not be supporting these amendments in the House, but we will not divide on the matter.
Labor remains concerned that the government wants to turn back the clock and risk wiping out a generation of gains in heritage protection in Australia. Labor is concerned about the removal of independent decision making on places that will benefit from heritage protection. The government wants to replace the independent Australian Heritage Commission with an advisory council stripped of any meaningful powers. There is a real danger that a mere advisory council will be a severely weakened advocate for heritage matters in Australia. The proposed new Australian Heritage Council will open the way for further politicisation of heritage protection.
In the Senate, my colleague Senator Lundy explained that Labor do not want to see existing heritage protections removed. Where we believed existing protections were being watered down, we moved amendments in the Senate to reinstate them. At the outset of the debate in the Senate, we explained that if our amendments were not carried or supported we would vote against the bills. 
As it currently stands, the Australian Heritage Commission has a broad range of functions and operates as an independent body. The government's plans are to replace the commission with the Australian Heritage Council. As I said, it will be a mere advisory body. The proposed new regime will give the minister the ultimate power to determine what deserves heritage protection. That decision will not be based solely on the heritage value of any site; there will be room for other factors to creep in and influence decisions. Labor proposed amendments in the Senate that would have diverted control of the listing, assessment and disclosure processes back to the Australian Heritage Commission and kept it at arm's length from the minister. Those amendments were voted down in the Senate.
The government also proposes to reduce the breadth of coverage offered by heritage protection. As it stands, heritage protection currently flows to `a place and its associated values'. The government's proposed new regime will limit the protection to just `the values of the place'. In the Senate, Labor moved amendments to reinstate the current level of heritage protection to `a place and its associated values'. Labor believe that the legislation should continue to protect places, including their associated values, as opposed to just relying on values alone. We reject the suggestion that this would somehow restrict the number of places that could be considered. We have always supported the protection of a heritage place and its associated values rather than just the values. Again, those amendments were voted down in the Senate. 
Labor also remains concerned that the government will not honour its commitment to transfer Commonwealth places on the existing Register of the National Estate to the new Commonwealth Heritage List. The government initially gave an undertaking to have all Commonwealth places on the Register of the National Estate immediately placed on the Commonwealth list. But that is not what the bills before us offer. The government has reneged on its promise. It is a move that threatens to turn back the clock on heritage protection in this country. A generation of heritage gains may be wiped out in the process of change. We know that this government cannot be trusted with important national treasures. We need look no further than Norfolk Island, where there are plans to sell off crown land for a song.
The amendments that have passed the Senate are the result of deals between the government and the Independent senators. Even the leader of the Democrats, Senator Bartlett, keen to be part of the action on these bills, acknowledged that they deliver `the weakest possible outcome that gives them'—the government—`the most power'. Senator Bartlett went on to criticise the `exceedingly bad faith' of the government's conduct in negotiating the amendments in the Senate. It is my sincere hope that such bad faith will not be evident in future negotiations on heritage legislation, particularly the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Bill. Senator Hill assured the Senate on 20 August, during debate on this package of legislation:
Progress is being made and we do not believe that it will be long before we are able to bring the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Bill to the chamber.
I urge the government to deliver on its commitments, to ensure that Indigenous heritage does not become the poor cousin in Australia's heritage protection regime.",REPS,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2003-09-08,"—I rise to support the comments of my colleague the shadow minister and member for Banks and place on record my disappointment that Labor's amendments were not adopted in the Senate. Labor have taken a very principled view on this bill. We have done that to retain our own heritage because, after all, the Australian Heritage Commission and the Register of the National Estate are important icons of Labor achievements of the Whitlam government and of, in particular, my good friend and mentor, the Hon. Tom Uren, who, as Minister for Urban and Regional Development, established the foundation legislation. This legislation was indeed courageous because it ensured the key point of the independence of the Australian Heritage Commission. That independence was critical because it ensured that the merits of the protection of a place and its associated values would be the key determinant factor, not politics.
As for what these changes have done, it is unfortunate that the government has made a predictable response but it is sad that the minor parties, in particular the Australian Democrats, have folded once again on this. They parade around electorates like mine as the great protectors of the environment and heritage but the truth is they are obsessed by politics and deal making and, just like the sell-out over the GST, we have seen this sell-out over this issue. The replacement of the independent Australian Heritage Commission with an advisory council, the Australian Heritage Advisory Council, will mean that in effect the minister will have ultimate power. This is a considerable watering down of the protection which has been there for the last generation of Australians. I reiterate the call of the member for Banks for the Register of the National Estate to be transferred across in full, as was promised by the Commonwealth but not delivered in this legislation. We will be vigilant in ensuring that that occurs. 
I congratulate the member for Banks, the new shadow minister for heritage and territories, on his stance and the role that he has played. I also place on record my admiration of the role played by the member for Wills, the shadow minister for the environment, who took a courageous, principled stance on this bill. It is a pity that the Australian Democrats cannot learn from people such as the member for Wills regarding this issue. We in the Australian Labor Party will continue to monitor the implementation of this legislation and continue to stand up on this side of the House for the important values that we place upon the heritage of this nation.",REPS,<title>ENVIRONMENT AND HERITAGE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title>,<title>Consideration of Senate Message</title>,Bills,18,1,speech
"Stone, Dr Sharman, MP",LP,2003-09-08,"—This is a most historic occasion. We have here the opportunity to make it possible for us to move into the next generation of heritage protection in Australia. This is what the Australian community wants and it is what parties—other than Labor—appreciate and have supported in this House. We thank them for that, for being true Australian spirited people who understand that heritage in our country is vulnerable and must be protected to the full extent of the law. This package of bills, as amended, represents the largest advance in heritage protection in a quarter of a century. The proposed National Heritage List has the ability to, for the first time, fully recognise and protect places of national heritage significance that are of special importance to Australians.
The first of these bills, the Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002, forms the central component of a package of legislation which fulfils this government's 2001 election commitment to establish a new and improved system for conserving Australia's unique heritage assets. We took it to the people; the people said yes. This bill has an impressive pedigree. It is based on the outcomes of the 1997 Council of Australian Governments Heads of Agreement on Commonwealth/State Roles and Responsibilities for the Environment. This agreement, signed by all levels of government, sets out that the Commonwealth's role in relation to heritage matters should be focused on places of national heritage significance. 
The new system that will be implemented by these bills has also been developed in a spirit of consultation, with more than six years of community discussion. The Australian Heritage Commission has played a very active role in this process and released three discussion papers, as well as convening the 1998 National Heritage Convention. During 2000, as the legislation was being drafted, there was a national briefing program whereby officials conducted 76 briefings in state and territory capitals and many regional centres. These were highly successful. The National Cultural Heritage Forum—which comprises key stakeholder organisations including the Australian Council of National Trusts, the Worldwide Fund for Nature, the Humane Society and the Tasmanian Conservation Trust—played a crucial role in the development of this legislation. The government recognises the work that these organisations have put into the process and commends their commitment to improving the national heritage system. The government also wishes to acknowledge the constructive role of Senator Meg Lees and, as I said before, the other Independent senators in helping to bring this important legislation to fruition.  
Since this chamber last saw this bill, a number of amendments have been made. These increase transparency in the nomination and listing processes through additional notification and publishing requirements; enhance the definition of Indigenous heritage value to provide more certainty in relation to Indigenous historic heritage places; and improve the protection of heritage places, including Commonwealth heritage places. There are also some minor government amendments to the bills which relate to listing overseas places in the National Heritage List and provide clarity in relation to the criteria for the National Heritage and Commonwealth Heritage lists. I think that many members of the public will understand that Gallipoli is one of the overseas places that we are most concerned about.
The Australian Heritage Council Bill 2002 establishes the Australian Heritage Council as the nation's primary heritage advisory body. Its role is to provide independent and expert advice to the minister on the identification, conservation and protection of places on the National Heritage List and the Commonwealth Heritage List. The establishment of the Australian Heritage Council will provide the minister with the best possible advice from highly regarded professionals in the natural, Indigenous and historic environments. The Australian Heritage Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Bill 2002 puts in place arrangements for a smooth transition from the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975 to the new scheme established by the main heritage bills. 
In summary, we have before us a package of three bills that will establish for the first time a truly national system that will significantly improve the conservation and management of natural, historic and Indigenous heritage in Australia—and I am sorry that the Labor Party cannot share in the celebration at this time. I commend the bills to the House.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2003-09-08,"—In rising to speak in the debate on the Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 2003 today at the outset I indicate that I will be moving an amendment to the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2003 along the following lines: 
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words: 
Whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House: 
(1)	condemns the Government for: 
(a)	its neglect of vocational education and training since it came to office in 1996; and 
(b)	making misleading statements about the future funding levels for the new Australian National Training Authority (ANTA) agreement; and 
(2)	calls on the Government to amend the Bill to provide appropriate funding levels for the new ANTA agreement and to provide funds for 20,000 additional TAFE places.
On budget night of this year the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Brendan Nelson, released a fabulous looking budget kit that was far slicker than any other portfolio package. In fact, through Senate estimates, we have found that the kit alone cost some $76,416. The minister had spent up big on the packaging in the hope that he could distract attention from the actual content of the kit. Part of this slick kit was the minister's media release stating that he had written to the states and territories offering them an additional $218.7 million for the new ANTA agreement for 2004-06. It created a buzz of excitement. Finally it seemed that after years of lobbying and difficult times the desperate pleas of the ALP, state and territory ministers, the education union and the students had been heard.
After all, the vocational education and training sector is in desperate trouble. Despite promising results in the early 1990s, the funding cuts by the Howard government have hit hard. The budgets of 1996 and 1997 not only reneged on the commitment to growth but also imposed a cumulative reduction of $240 million in Commonwealth funding for vocational education and training. These cuts came at a time when the number of students participating in vocational education and training courses across Australia had been growing by an average of 5.9 per cent per annum to more than 1.75 million students. Ten years ago there were fewer than one million students.
But it turns out that $76,416 can buy you a lot of smoke and mirrors, because that is about all that the new funding announced on budget night was about. Let us be absolutely clear: the government has not provided one cent of additional growth funding for 2004-06. The government is offering to maintain 2003 growth funds of $100 million over the next three years and to index that figure. Of course, indexation merely covers increased costs and does not deliver a single cent for a new place. The other $119 million in the so-called offer is a part of welfare reform already announced in past budgets. That is why when you go to the budget papers `future expenditure' shows zero, zero, zero and zero.
On top of this, in the 1998-2000 ANTA agreement the Howard government did not give one extra cent. This means that the Howard government has not given one extra cent for TAFE in six out of the nine years it has been negotiating ANTA agreements, despite the record growth. This means there is no new funding offered to resource new enrolment growth that will occur during the life of the proposed agreement. Sadly, the fact that the government has tried to pretend that there was new money when there was not should come as no surprise, because this government has form when it comes to telling the truth about anything. The minister has many nicknames. Some call him Braveheart. Others on this side of the House call him Comrade, in affectionate memory of his days as a Labor activist not that long ago. But perhaps we should call him Big Brother. Like Big Brother in 1984, who tried to convince us that two plus two equals five, this minister has tried to convince us that zero, plus zero, plus zero, plus zero equals $218 million. 
The other issue of major concern is that, in order to receive this stagnant funding, the Commonwealth is demanding an expansion of user choice. Make no mistake—this is just another part of the government's agenda to privatise the education system. Without any real increase in funding, this will result in pulling dedicated funding out of TAFE. The Commonwealth proposes a series of targets, but it is not willing to ensure that the funding is available for the targets to be met. Australia's training needs have changed. Gone are the days when we could afford to educate just some of our people once, at the start of their lives, and expect them to use the same knowledge and skill throughout their lives. Today we need to educate all of our people continuously if we are to maximise their potential and that of the nation. Australia needs nothing short of a revolution in our education and training system if we are to become all that we can be. We need to create a world leading system of lifelong learning, to create wealth and end the scourge of unemployment that blights so many of our nation's suburbs. In particular, it is worth remembering that, while people who have nothing more than a basic education make up one-third of the work force, they comprise more than half of those who are unemployed. Vocational education and training is the key to changing that.
As well as containing real growth money, the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2003 and the Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 2003 should have taken action in a number of areas. Firstly, they should have rebalanced the incentive scheme to ensure that real training effort was rewarded. At the moment, there is a bias against apprenticeship training. The AQF and AQTF systems need to be reviewed. We need, and these bills should have provided for, a pathway to a truly national training system with agreed standards across all jurisdictions. We need to give the AQF rigour and integrity. Why not, for example, give consideration to completion bonuses for apprentices? Why not give consideration to ensuring that there are caps, as a percentage, on the number of employees who can be classified as trainees in any particular company? Why not acknowledge that some companies—private providers—are essentially effectively becoming second tier public providers? They get no money from the private sector and rely completely upon public funds. Why not restructure the system to ensure that there is increased incentive for longer term traineeships and apprenticeships?
These issues are not academic. In my speech today I want to give a number of real examples of where mistakes are occurring. The first example that I have been approached about comes from an apprentice plasterer. This apprentice plasterer worked for a company called T&A Ceilings. He was retrenched on 8 July, after the company went into liquidation. It has been revealed that this plasterer was not actually attending a traditional TAFE college. His training was being delivered by a private provider, Murray Mallee Training Company. The first concern is that, unlike other apprentices who were working for the company and attending a TAFE college for five days every five weeks, he was receiving only two hours of direct student-teacher contact every six weeks. A representative of the Murray Mallee Training Company would visit the work site and discuss the last module that had been issued. He would then be issued with between one and four modules according to their thickness, to be completed during the next six weeks. This particular apprentice found that the theory content to most modules was pretty easy to complete, because the answers were at the back of the modules that he was given by this company. All the rest of this apprentice's theory was completed at home during his own time. 
There was no on-site practical component to each module. To verify the apprentice's practical component, the instructor from this company would come and take photos of the apprentice working during the six-weekly visits. The Murray Mallee Training Company was also the New Apprenticeships centre that signed up this apprentice and his employer to the training contract. It was at the signing of the training contract that the employer was introduced to this new style of apprenticeship training. This is not a one-off. This is occurring right around Australia. The real problem as well is that pressure is now placed upon TAFE to actually compete with this. So we are seeing more and more practical examples on the ground of individuals essentially being ripped off and, indeed, taxpayer funds being ripped off. In the longer term, the Australian economy is being ripped off because proper training is not occurring.
But there are other issues as well. We need to make sure that there are targeted training initiatives for the existing work force, and we need to draw a distinction between new training for new entrants into the work force and training of existing workers. That is a critical distinction that needs to be made in policy terms. I want to give a second example, this time of an existing worker. It refers to a company called DEC Painting—once again the company is in Victoria. The CFMEU received a telephone call requesting that they come and talk to one of their members, and it turned out that one of the painters was concerned about a training contract that he was requested to sign. The training in question was to qualify for certificate III in general construction: apprenticeship painting and decorating, which is a four-year apprenticeship. During the conversation, it was revealed that up to 20 workers from the company had signed these training contracts and that a majority of these workers had been working in the industry as painters for 20 years or more. Among the tasks being offered were teaching modules on `applying paint to walls using rollers.' These were people who had worked in the industry for many years!
But many of them were happy enough to sign up. It did not result in decreased wages to them. But what did matter is that it then attracted a Commonwealth subsidy. That is what is occurring and that is one of the things that is allowing Braveheart over here, the minister, to come in and beat up his comments and talk up the figures all the time, telling us about how many people are in new apprenticeships. These are the sorts of rorts that are beefing those figures up. For people who are existing workers what should be given is a recognition of prior learning towards the trade papers, but this process is undermined because there is a government subsidy of around $4,000 for each person involved.
So we have new entrants being exploited within the system and we have problems with existing workers and training. We also need to consider the VET in schools program. Currently the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Training is undertaking an inquiry into the effectiveness of VET in schools. There are many good programs and many good people out there providing quality VET in schools programs, but there needs to be, surely, a national approach towards VET in schools. This must link it to future skills needs and job opportunities and consider matters such as teacher training issues and people teaching VET courses in schools without any industry experience. Indeed, there is a need for a national approach on all these issues, in cooperation with the states. Instead all we have is more buck-passing—just like in health—despite the states indicating their willingness to form a productive partnership.  
It is yet another lost opportunity. How long can we afford to keep missing these opportunities, especially when our competitors—like Singapore, Hong Kong and the European Community—are taking education so seriously? The failure of this bill to come up with a real agenda to improve access to VET is symptomatic of the minister's whole approach to education. We know the minister's sole source of inspiration is the United States. All the minister is interested in is creating a handful of Harvards, Yales and Princetons, to give advantage to the graduates of our category 1 private schools. He thinks that pipedreams will solve all of our nation's educational needs. He is wrong. We all admire the quality of America's elite universities, but we have to get over this fixation with copying the US system. We need a system that suits our needs and is based on our values—values like equal opportunity and a fair go.
I want to draw members' attention to an important article by UK economist Will Hutton in the 1 September edition of the US magazine The Nation. Hutton argues persuasively that the recent explosion in fees in the US university sector and the comparative decline of its vocational education system is destroying the American dream of social mobility and undermining the principle of success based on talent. At private universities fees alone cost around $A30,000 per year and at state universities they are about $A12,000. Scholarships are not keeping pace. The very poor are not getting in and their lifelines, the community colleges—which are the equivalent of our TAFEs—are being run down. Higher education is again becoming increasingly class based and stratified. It benefits the sons and daughters of the lucky few but not the nation as a whole.
As Hutton says, a new aristocracy, armed with passports from the elite universities, is emerging, and it is closing off opportunities for everyone else. This appears to be the type of education that this minister cares about and wants for Australia. Well, it is not the sort of education or country that I want. Instead, I want a system where the education you get is based upon your ability and not your ability to pay. A nation with as large a population as the US can perhaps get away for a short time with educating the lucky few; Australia certainly cannot. We need a different model—one that not only improves the skills base of the whole community rather than just benefiting those from privileged families but also ensures that there are genuine entry level training opportunities for young people, disadvantaged groups and people seeking to re-enter the work force. We need a model that takes the Western Sydney Institute as seriously as the University of Sydney and a trainee car mechanic as seriously as a medical student. We need to focus not only on young people but also on older Australians who are currently in or out of work. We need to, as the ACTU has suggested, target training initiatives for the existing work force through the introduction of a new workplace development training fund focused on developing skills information about targeted industries, industry sectors and enterprises. 
Australia and Australians have had seven years of rhetoric from this government on the importance of education and training, but absolutely nothing else. This total lack of care and vision has led to many businesses and organisations speaking out against the government's current approach. In its submission to the Senate's skills inquiry, the Australian Industry Group reported that over half the businesses surveyed face skills shortages. To try to jolt the government into action the ACCI publicly revealed the results of their members survey, which indicated the availability of qualified labour is rated as the second most serious constraint on investment—after taxes.
In Australia we are currently experiencing a crisis in skills. We have industries, services, businesses and communities crying out for skilled staff, including nurses, aged care workers, childcare workers, hairdressers, plumbers, builders and mechanics—to name just a few. This is just crazy for a country like Australia, particularly as we have such a high youth unemployment rate. The skills crisis is a direct result of the Howard government's policies. It is living proof of the government's lack of vision and shows just what a negative impact their policies are having on all of us.
The driver of this policy is the government's desire to go for short-term, cheap options rather than take a strategic approach that would deliver long-term economic and social benefits. Under this government, the nation's training dollar is not being targeted towards addressing acute skills shortages in the economy or towards providing young Australians with the skills that will improve their long-term career prospects. A startling indication of the scheme's inadequacy is the consistently high non-completion rate among trainees. For every two people who commence a traineeship or apprenticeship, someone drops out. This means that the government is paying double.
On top of this drop-out figure, between 20 and 30 per cent of those undertaking traineeships are receiving inadequate training. I have a document, which I will seek leave to table, which is an example of one of the reasons why this is the case. It is an advertisement which says:
How many of your staff attract a $4,400 government grant? Train your staff and make money at the same time. The government is currently giving grants of up to $4,400 to $5,400 per employee to employers and providing national accredited qualifications—
and then it goes into big letters—
ON THE JOB. This is available for all staff, regardless of how long they have worked for your company.
Here we have companies advertising that they can rort the government and pick up a fee of $4,400 for doing nothing. If the government spends money on that, it is $4,400 that cannot go into proper training. I seek leave to table this document.
Leave granted.
—In a study undertaken by Mark Cully from the National Institute of Labour Studies and Richard Curtin from Curtin Consulting, it is revealed that 47 per cent—almost half—of those who did not complete their apprenticeship or traineeship did not complete it because they felt that they were `being used as cheap labour'. A further indication that the government is simply not interested in quality training is the fact that the minister rarely mentions a word about the critical need to improve the checks and balances on the use of the apprenticeship and traineeship systems. This is despite the problems that have been publicly documented in the media. The minister believes he can just blame the states and territories. 
A great example of this was the company Broadscope in Victoria. This company picked up some $18 million in federal government funds. Under the scheme, $6,700 is available. The training company got $4,510 per worker, and the client company got $2,200 for female employees and $1,100 for male employees. What did the company have to do? What training did they have to provide for this? They had to do 2½ days of training a year. One IT firm—set up by a couple of spivs who probably went to the same schools as the front bench members over there—picked up $18 million in federal government funding. 
The minister did not do anything about it. The Victorian government intervened and is taking action, but these are federal government funds and this is the direct result of an abuse of federal government policy. It is a rort—just like the many other rorts that exist in this system. But the minister never talks about them; he just mentions these figures as if proper training were being provided throughout. The fact is that more scrutiny is required by governments of how and where employer incentives are being paid. Incentives should be designed to encourage greater levels of training effort and should increase more sharply with the levels of qualifications undertaken, as well as for longer term traineeships and apprenticeships. 
Under the Howard government, training effort is now largely being driven by access to training dollars instead of by skills development needs. This is absurd. It is not good for the workers, it is not good for the companies and it is not good for our nation. The problem is that the future under the Howard-Costello government is very bleak. In the weeks leading up to the last budget, the minister was going around telling people that this year's budget was going to be focused on universities but next year the focus was going to be on TAFE and VET. We all know what his focus on universities means: fewer places for people who study hard and earn the marks and more places for people who can afford to buy their way in. I do not know where his focus on TAFE and VET will lead, but I know it will not lead to greater public investment, it will not recognise the current skills crisis and it will not improve access. Only a few weeks ago, the minister stood in this very House and said:
Vocational education and training underpins the competitiveness of our industries and supports Australia's economic and social development.
That is a grand and true statement but, in the end, it is just an empty line, because the 2001 ANTA funding agreement provided about one-third of what the state and territory ministers said they needed in 2001 and this year's budget papers show no real increase.
In their letter of response to the minister's offer, the state and territory training ministers wrote back and said:
We note your offer of $220 million for the period of the next Agreement and the objectives you wish to see included. While agreeing with you on some of the objectives which should be contained in the next Agreement, the fact that your proposal contains no new funding is a matter of considerable concern.
Once again we have a stand-off. The annual agreement has not been signed—just like the other Commonwealth-state agreements—and the government is placing pressure on the states and territories  rather than sitting down and working out what would be good, decent policy.
Currently ANTA is working on a national strategy for 2004 to 2010, entitled Shaping our Future, which has been endorsed in principle by the relevant state and federal ministers. I believe Shaping our Future is off to a good start and provides the right sort of framework for actually being able to ensure Australians have access to world-class skills and knowledge. But I am concerned that the words on the page will not actually turn into an action plan that is implemented. This is a government that is notorious for commissioning reports, setting up task forces and establishing expert groups, but nothing actually happens. The ANTA board needs to be the primary driver in this regard and that is why it is in everyone's interests to get the right people on the board. We need to make sure that the ANTA board has a good mix of skills, background and experience. I welcome the expansion of the board from seven to nine members and I look forward with great interest to seeing what impact it actually has on achieving outcomes.  
The amendment that I have foreshadowed also refers to the need to provide funds for 20,000 additional TAFE places. Last year some 15,000 school leavers who were eligible missed out on TAFE simply because the funding was not there. When we move this amendment we will be giving the government the opportunity to adopt good Labor policy and to adopt the 20,000 places. I am sure that, if they are fair dinkum about the minister's rhetoric, they will do that, because these 20,000 places would mean more Australians, particularly young people, would get the skills and training they need for a decent job and a bright future. 
At a time when Australia's youth unemployment is stuck at over 20 per cent, we need a plan to break that cycle of unemployment and poverty. We also need a plan to address the skills shortages which are there. Skills growth as a driver of productivity has dropped 75 per cent in the last decade. The Productivity Commission has found that to maintain and raise current living standards more Australians must attain higher skill levels. That is what this debate is about today and that is why Labor announced, as the first segment of our Aim Higher policy, 20,000 new TAFE places. We recognise that it is good for the individuals who go through TAFE to get those skills but that it is also necessary for the economic future of this nation. We can either be a high-skill, high-wage growth economy or we can go down the competition road to the bottom—that is, we can go for trying to compete with our neighbours in terms of low wages and low skills, and we all know what that would mean. 
Our policy will cost $88.5 million if they agree to this amendment. That is a minor cost compared with the cost to this nation of not doing it. We need to invest in skills and jobs for young Australians. We can even tell the government how to fund it: just take away the tax break that foreign executives were given in the budget. It is a matter of priorities, and the government should prioritise TAFE.
I believe that in the next period we need to really go after these issues. The Dusseldorp Skills Forum have estimated that 80,000 young people will leave school and risk long-term unemployment. They estimate that if you spent $2.3 billion over five years you would have an economic benefit of $8.2 billion by 2050. Surely investing in the potential of our individuals and investing in our nation is something that should be supported. We have a minister who is good on rhetoric but bad on action. Voting for this amendment gives him a chance to show that he is fair dinkum. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Billson, Bruce, MP",LP,2003-09-08,"—What a convoluted, confused and contrite contribution on the Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 2003 and the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2003 that was. We listened to a Labor Party spokesperson trying to talk about an interest in vocational education. That is quite novel, given a disclosure—something admitted to quite clearly—by the former member for Sydney, Peter Baldwin. I will come to that shortly. People in this place have sat here year after year listening to Labor spokespersons trying to describe education and future opportunities as being only about universities. People have sat in here and listened to a shadow education minister rattle on about a dozen-odd questions about universities before finding an interest in vocational education. We know in this place that, when the Labor Party tries to talk about vocational education it lacks credibility, it lacks substance and it lacks an understanding of issues. Never has that been more evident than in the contribution we just heard. The former member for Sydney, Peter Baldwin, admitted in his The Lighthouse discussion paper, published in 1997, that Labor's policies had failed young people when Labor was in office. He said: 
Accommodating the needs of those not intending to proceed directly on to university education in the final years of schooling is something that we—
being the Labor Party—
didn't do enough about in government.
How true that point is, particularly when, nationally, 70 per cent of young people do not go on to tertiary education. In the community that I represent, the figure is nearer to 80 per cent. Eighty per cent of the young people in the Dunkley area—in the greater Mornington Peninsula and Frankston area—do not go on to tertiary education. They were forgotten and not thought of under Labor governments. That is something that has been confessed by a member of that party—the former member for Sydney.
Today, against that backdrop, we had the shadow spokesman trying to move an amendment criticising the Howard government for its work in resurrecting, recovering and revitalising vocational education. He suggested that, despite everything that is supposedly wrong with this program—and it is so appalling!—all you need to do is throw a little bit more money at it. What a poor excuse for a reform agenda! It goes very much to my point that Labor have no ideas about vocational education and training. What you will hear and what you have already heard is the `three Cs'—they condemn by outing themselves. 
What the Labor Party do is recognise their own failings and then try and attribute the Howard government's performance to the Labor Party. That will not work, and I will show the facts and figures to prove that point. They then go and criticise all the measures that have been taken that actually bring about that improvement and say there is something horribly wrong with them, but they do not propose to remove any of them. As the shadow spokesman said, just throw a bit more money at it; just cobble together a few of the ideas that have come from the ACTU or one or two unions that have been spending their time trying to find a rare example of poor performance, use that as some kind of evidence that the whole system has a problem and throw a bit more money at it just the way it is. That is what we have from the Labor Party and that is what highlights the fact that the Labor Party have no idea about vocational education and training.
There are two bills before the House today. One is a mechanical bill that will bring about an opportunity to provide funding in the short term through a 2004 package while the state Labor governments work out whether they are for real about vocational education and training—whether they are seriously interested in the growing amount of substantial funds from the Commonwealth being put on the table to support vocational education and training through the Australian National Training Authority over the next three years—or whether they want to continue to play politics. That is one of the pieces of legislation before the House today. The other piece seeks to extend the Australian National Training Authority by expanding the size of the board and therefore boosting its capacity and its horsepower to make sure that it provides wise advice and supports the federal government's initiative and the state governments in lifting their game. They are the two bills that are before the House today. They both go to the further extension of the vocational education system, a system that needed a transfusion. It got it under the Howard government and continues to get it through not only increased funding but wiser policy. 
Wiser policy has delivered a far better outcome, and I would like to put on the record tonight some examples of how the Australian government has played a leadership role, and continues to play a leadership role, in the overall direction and strategies needed to develop a skilled Australian work force. Vocational education and training does underpin our competitiveness, and that is why the Howard government has taken it so seriously and has sought to bring about improved performance and better opportunities for employers and employees and to assist industries in providing the skills and the training that is needed to support economic and social development. In 2002 there were around 1.7 million students in VET—one-ninth of Australia's working age population. Participation in VET by Australia's youth exceeds one in four for those between the ages of 15 and 19. New Apprenticeships have grown by a staggering 177 per cent since December 1995. This is the performance that is being condemned: 177 per cent increase in New Apprenticeships since December 1995, with over 391,000 participants in training at the end of March this year. What an outstanding improvement!
This is the resurrection and the reinjection of energy that this system has needed. It now covers a suite of over 500 occupations—not only the traditional trades but also emerging areas of skill requirement for the Australian economy—and you see an enormous increase in participation. That is evidence of what has been achieved under the Howard government. It has not happened just because we have recognised that it needed to be done; policies have had to be put in place to bring about the change. Some of those policies that have delivered not only improved participation but also remarkably improved completion rates are the very things that the Labor Party seek to criticise. They are critical of incentives—incentives for employers to participate. The one thing that a worker needs is work; otherwise, they are an `er'. A worker needs work. You need employers to participate to make sure that those opportunities to gain those skills in the workplace and apply them and to provide a career pathway are there. That is why incentives are required. That is a budget item that grows to take account of increasing levels of participation. The Labor remedy is to remove incentives. We need the `work' in `worker'; otherwise, we end up with `er'. That is correct: `er' is a mistake. That is why we need to encourage the work part of the worker combination.
There was a proposition from the Labor Party to put a cap on the number of training places in workplaces. I thought the point they were trying to make two minutes earlier was that we needed more people in training. Again, there is that confusion that seems to run through. Underpinning it all is this TAFE-centric view that only TAFEs can provide vocational education and training. One of the reasons why the Howard government has been able to achieve that 177 per cent increase in participation is the greater variety of training opportunities that are available, where different providers— 
—Shonks!
—and they are being called shonkies and all sorts of things by the Labor Party—who are in many cases not-for-profit providers, although some are for-profit training providers, are able to provide a service and training package that not only suits the employee in terms of their development but also is compatible with the employer. Remember that partnership, that collaboration that is needed to make this work? You need to be able to accommodate those things. Gone are the days when a single provider would say to a builder: `You want to train your staff through TAFE; here is the day. This is the only format, the only style and the only timing of this training that is available. If you want some skills that we choose not to accommodate, that's tough.' Gone are those days, because we have a new range of providers, properly accredited, making sure nationally recognised levels of skills are being obtained. That is what is in part driving this increase in participation. This TAFE-centric view of the Labor Party should be seen for what it is: a supposed `one size fits all', but it is pretty much a `take it or leave it' model.
What you have seen through new training providers is a revision in the way training is made available and a requirement for training providers—whether they be TAFE, not-for-profit or private providers—to be responsive to what industry, the employers and the employee need so that that collaboration comes together to encourage participation. That is an undoubted positive, but it is a positive that has been criticised and condemned by the Labor Party. Why? It is because they are TAFE-centric, and apparently the ACTU have said: `We pretty much have a good inroad into the TAFE sector. If it all ran through there, we'd get to run the show.' I cannot understand what the other logic would be, because TAFE is being supported by the Commonwealth government through these training agreements at a time when there is a skills shortage. This skills shortage is understood by the government. The Howard government is seeking to address it through cooperation and national initiatives like the National Industry Skills Initiative, which is an industry led partnership to identify those skills needs and the strategies to address them.
What do you see from the Labor Party? You see a criticism of the engagement that the government has with industry to identify those very skill needs. At the same time, within the TAFE sector, 26 per cent of all those who are full time in TAFE are doing non-vocational training. The Labor Party is absolutely confused by its own effort to cobble together a range of slogans pre-chewed—if they are passing the test of the Labor leader, Simon Crean—and market tested. So they sound great, but when they are all put together they mean nothing, because pre-chewed grabs cobbled together from all over the place do not equal a plan.
The alternative that the government is putting forward is a cooperation—a collaboration—with industry to recognise where those skills shortages exist and to do something about them; to look at the way that strategies can be developed to market what is available and what is needed; to make attractive career options that are presented to young people that encourage participation not only in the industry but also in the training that supports successful careers in those industries; and to promote the value of and the need for training to employers and employees. How could you argue against that? Yet the Labor Party seeks to be critical of the pathway the government is pursuing to ensure not only that quality training is available for the widest possible range of participants but also that it actually addresses skills shortages. 
What could the Labor Party do? Rather than take their instructions to come into the federal parliament and simply parrot some of the nonsense the state Labor training ministers say, maybe federal Labor could say, `Guys, if you want us to run the skills shortage argument pretty hard, you might want to have a look at the training mix that is offered within TAFE. If we're going to say that the only game in town is TAFE and the only objective should be addressing skills shortages, let's have a look at the one-quarter of the full-time participants in TAFE that aren't doing any vocational training.' The minister in this parliament, in answering a question from the member for Jagajaga, outlined some of those examples: funding belly dancing, feng shui—
—What's he done about it? Nothing. He is a do-nothing minister.
—I can hear the member for Jagajaga's personal feng shui seems a little uptight at the moment—blues harmonica for beginners at the Moreton Institute, astrology and tarot workshops, art foundation courses and fruit carving. These are quite interesting and, I am sure, very entertaining and engaging programs, but if the challenge from the Labor Party—if the charge it is directing at the Howard government—is that there is something wrong with the way in which skills are being addressed, the Labor Party should talk to its own training ministers. It should say to the training ministers, `We understand the way the federation works: the federal government provides leadership, it provides enormous funding and, at times, it has to cajole the states and territories to do something in the national interest, but the direct levers about TAFE are not in the hands of the federal government.' So maybe the member for Jagajaga and the shadow spokesman could do something constructive.
In the absence of any plan to deal with vocational education and training, maybe they should just go back to their state Labor training ministers and say, `Some of these training course aren't really addressing the skills shortage that we would like to be talking about. Hopefully no-one will realise that there has been a 177 per cent increase in participation since Labor was last in power at a federal level,' in the hope that those facts are overlooked. Then the Labor Party might have some credibility on the subject.
But it does not. The evidence is there and the evidence is clear that the Howard government has resurrected vocational education and training to a point where participation is now widely spread, where there is growth in those that are participating, strong growth in the number that are concluding and growth across all age brackets. There is growth across school leavers, growth across the youth and growth across the 40-and-over age group, to a point where the participation rate of 7.1 per cent for people over 45 years in all education in 2000 is the highest of that age group of all OECD countries.
You have got the Labor Party coming in here condemning the Howard government when, by any measure you could think of, its performance is recognised as being internationally excellent and an example to other countries. At a time when there is such a skills shortage, do you think increasing some of the fees, as the Carr government has done in New South Wales, by 200 or 300 per cent is going to be helpful? Is that likely to encourage or discourage people? We have talked about incentives playing a role. Is that going to be an incentive? Is that the kind of incentive that the Labor Party talk about? They are all over the place on this subject, understandably very confused and quick to try to mask their own failure in this area. 
An example of how all of this comes together is in the community that I represent. We are very fortunate to have seen not only strong and sustained growth, at around 25 per cent a year for each of the years from 1990 to 2000, in participation in New Apprenticeships, but also an increasing amount of federal government incentives to local employers. These things combine to see from a base of about 1,421 new apprentices in 1999-2000 an increase to 2,052 the following year and up to 2,442 new apprenticeship commencements in 2001-02.
That positive picture goes further, though, as you see a sustaining of that growth in commencements into the most recent year—2002-03—with 2,898 new apprenticeship commencements in the Dunkley electorate alone. What a fantastic improvement that is. It is a near doubling—in fact, slightly more than a doubling—of new apprenticeship commencements since 1999-2000. How has that been achieved? It has been achieved by the formula that I have outlined: new responsive training providers; incentives for employers, totalling in the 2002 calendar year $4.867 million of incentives to local employers; and access to New Apprenticeships centres, where employers and job seekers can be supported in their decision to participate in a new apprenticeship. This is a terrific story.
For those people not quite ready for a new apprenticeship who are looking for further assistance to help them develop their skills to improve their chances of securing a new apprenticeship through prevocational training support and assistance, the Commonwealth is funding the New Apprenticeships Access Program, which is also active in the Dunkley electorate, which SkillsPlus Peninsula have been very successful in tailoring to the hospitality and retail sectors.
I was very pleased to attend a presentation only a few weeks ago where, amongst a classroom of recipients, mobile phones were going off—many of them residents from your electorate, Madam Deputy Speaker Corcoran—as they were getting phone calls about job opportunities, about a chance to do a retail apprenticeship, as a result of that prevocational pre-paration that was available. It was terrific news. I must say, to hear those phones ringing and finding out they were not people looking for something social to do—they were job offers—was a very positive experience for all those concerned. So that picture is very positive.
In the few minutes remaining for me to speak, I would like to talk about vocational education and training in schools, another area criticised by the Labor Party—the very tool that is articulating to young people that you can be gifted in ways other than academically; the very tool that is showing young people who are skilled and have talents that they are valued and supported and that the kind of effort, endeavour and interest that goes into higher education is equally delivered for those of a more vocational talent platform.
In the Dunkley electorate, PVET, the Peninsula Vocational Education and Training program, does a fantastic job right across all of the secondary schools. We are seeing huge levels of participation whether they be government schools, schools in the Catholic system or non-government schools. In fact, we are seeing a greater level of participation than the programs can at times support. That highlights the popularity for young people, even those planning to go on to higher education, of having a rounded education while they are at secondary school, many of them getting involved in these vocational education and training programs purely to make sure that they are as competitive and as able as possible to pursue the career pathways that they are interested in. 
The thing that we can do to best support that, as the TAFE sector withdraws its level of subsidy for providing facilities for these programs, is make sure that there are adequate facilities available. In the Mornington area in the southern part of my electorate, the information technology skills centre provides that support for students wishing to study IT. I commend the work going on at Langwarrin Secondary College where they are looking to pursue, with my support, a skills centre proposal that tackles not only sport and leisure—in keeping with the VCAL trial that has been adopted there—but also clothing design and production. A skills centre would be an excellent boost for the relationship already established with the private sector and for students wishing to pursue niche market opportunities in our region. There is some good work going on there. The automotive skills centre proposal at Monterey Secondary College is another illustration of the fact that this is a policy that is alive and well.

"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,2003-09-08,"—The Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2003 amends the principal act to provide supplementation of funding for 2003. Funnily enough, the money did not make it into the previous speaker's speech, largely because there is not enough of it. All it does is reflect the Treasury indexes of real price movements and appropriate funding for 2004 to cover the first year of a new agreement with the states and territories for funding through the Australian National Training Authority, ANTA. The second bill, the Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 2003, provides for a new three-year ANTA agreement commencing in 2004 by amending the reference to the years of the agreement. The bill also increases the number of members of the board of ANTA from seven to nine. The two bills overlap—one providing the funding; the other providing the machinery. In many ways, these are routine bills. They bring the principal acts up to date and provide badly needed funding, but unfortunately just to meet the effects of inflation. We will not be opposing the passage of these bills, because even this small increase to meet the effects of inflation is desperately needed in vocational education and training.
The bills, especially the vocational education and training bill, expose this government's real position on its responsibilities for vocational education and training in Australia and certainly reflect the hypocrisy of the government's position. The minister in his second reading speeches on both bills stated that the Commonwealth has offered $218.7 million in `additional' funding compared to 2003. He said that this reflects average real growth in recurrent funding of 2½ per cent per annum. The proposed ANTA agreement would require matching funding from the states and territories totalling $445 million over the three years from 2004 to 2006.
But where is this additional Commonwealth money? Of course the first place you would look to see if it exists would be the budget papers, but it is not there. Budget Paper No. 3, which spells out the government's new measures, is particularly eloquent: zero in each of the next four years. It is certainly not in this bill. In this bill there is no additional funding for vocational education and training above meeting the costs of inflation.
The ANTA agreement also covers what is described as `growth' funds—they use the word `growth', so we are talking about money on top of what the government should be providing for vocational education and training. This bill will increase growth funds in 2003 by $2.3 million, or 2.2 per cent, once again just to meet the effects of inflation and cost increases. These amendments will bring the level of growth funding in 2003 to $104.025 million. And what is the allocation for 2004? Item 2 in the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill makes it clear. For 2004 it will be just a little over $104 million—exactly the same as the figure for 2003. So much for the word `growth'. These funds for 2004, and those in the forward estimates for later years, were provided in last year's budget. What a very slippery road this minister once again takes us down. It is indeed no wonder that the state and territory ministers are baulking at the federal minister's so-called `generosity'—only so called by the minister himself. 
State and territory ministers have formally written to the federal minister setting out their concerns about the Commonwealth's offer. They have pointed out that the $218.7 million so-called `additional' funding—only so called by the federal minister—in the offer includes indexation. So it includes the money needed just to keep up with the growth in costs. That indexation is to cover both the base and the growth funding components of the package. It is patently clear in this bill that for 2004 there is no growth. The $119.5 million was announced in previous budgets for welfare reform programs. So there is no actual growth in this budget for vocational education and training and there is no growth contained in this bill for vocational education and training. In other words, there is no additional funding for vocational education and training above cost increases.
We do know that the Howard government has form in this area. The previous minister was an absolute master at it. He presided over the notorious growth through efficiencies regime, where constant Commonwealth funding was conditional on states and territories meeting growth targets. This resulted in larger classes, lower remuneration for TAFE teachers, an increased reliance on casual staff and in some cases the closure of TAFE colleges because of a lack of growth in funding. But at least the former minister was open and honest about it. There is no mention of growth through efficiencies this time—only a misleading statement of Commonwealth funding trends.
By contrast, Labor have made a real commitment to vocational education and training in Australia. We have announced that we will create an additional 20,000 full- and part-time places in TAFE, which will make a serious contribution to meeting unmet demand for vocational education and training in this country. The important difference, once again, between Labor's commitment and the government's commitment is that Labor's additional places for vocational education and training are fully funded. It will cost an additional $88.4 million over the four years from 2004 to 2007. We have shown how we intend to pay for that—that is, by scrapping one of this government's tax concessions that they want to give to foreign executives who are resident in Australia. This saving will contribute about $160 million over four years to Labor's higher education and training policy. It will certainly cover the additional $88 million for 20,000 additional TAFE places right around Australia.
The other good news is that Labor's commitment will meet the full costs of these places. We want to make sure that priority is given to those school leavers who have been unable to get a place in the vocational education and training system. This means that Labor will provide access to a publicly funded TAFE place for all those young Australians who qualify for but have so far been unable to gain entry to a VET course in TAFE.
Labor are also prepared to give an unequivocal commitment to TAFE. We have certainly heard plenty of criticism of TAFE by the government here tonight. We know that TAFE is an outstanding public provider of quality training to 1.3 million Australians. TAFE institutes and colleges throughout Australia have a very proud history of expanding opportunities for skills development and employment for Australians from all walks of life. Labor will certainly be supporting TAFE to build on its traditions of providing high-quality vocational education and training to develop the skills that more Australians need for the future. We want to make sure that our TAFE colleges and institutes continue to serve the whole community and, most importantly, to contribute to the skills levels that are needed in our economy in the future. This requires stability and commitment from the federal and state governments, not uncertainty and the sort of criticism we have heard of TAFE here tonight. 
I want to go to a couple of references in the minister's second reading speech. He said that he wants to provide `an open and flexible training market' as one of the Commonwealth's priorities for the next ANTA agreement. This sounds likes some sort of code for extending the use of competitive tendering to allocate Commonwealth funds. When the minister responds to the second reading debate, I would appreciate it if he would spell out whether that is in fact his intention.
We would also be interested to know, given the minister's form on increasing fees for university students, what he intends to do to student and industry contributions when it comes to vocational education and training. We know that the government wants to see very significant increases in the fees charged to university students under the Higher Education Contribution Scheme. The government is going to allow universities to put their fees up by up to 30 per cent, and this will mean massive HECS debts for those students—anything up to $50,000. What we really need to know is what this minister is planning when it comes to dealing with student and industry contributions to the cost of vocational education and training.
The minister in his second reading speech also stated that one of the Commonwealth's priorities for the ANTA agreement will be to address skills shortages. This is about the only admission by the government that they have been spectacularly unsuccessful in addressing a very serious problem facing the Australian economy—that is, the skills shortages that now exist in many industries, whether it is the building and construction industry or the range of other industries that desperately need more highly skilled people from the vocational education and training sector. But there are no clear strategies for addressing this. We have the government's record. There has been a lot of empty rhetoric about the growth in New Apprenticeships, but we know that that growth in New Apprenticeships has not addressed the very serious skills shortages that there are now in some industries in this country.
We also know that too many young people are being churned through short-term training in areas where employment outcomes are insecure. So, rather than encouraging these young people into areas where they would get higher levels of skills and therefore higher wages, they are going into areas where wages and salaries are low and where skills are relatively low and unfortunately in abundance.
A very serious criticism of the government's scheme is that the distinction between training and cheap labour is being blurred. Unfortunately, there are far too many examples but I have one that I want to refer to. A 50-year-old man was put on a traineeship and given one week of training at the start of his employment. After 11 months work, he was sacked with one month's notice. The reason his employer gave for this termination was that he had completed his traineeship. 
Many apprentices and trainees are certainly worried about getting exactly this treatment. In calls to Job Watch—a community legal service specialising in employment law—by far the largest proportion of apprentices with concerns is the 35 per cent who report examples of unfair dismissal. Job Watch are getting far too many complaints from apprentices who are being sacked unfairly while they are still in training. The other problems relate to workplace violence, underpayment of wages, unfair work conditions and non-payment of wages. The minister's media releases and ravings in this House never mention any of these concerns or the serious skill shortages either. There are very serious problems with the government's apprenticeship and traineeship system, and it is high time that they were addressed.
As I mentioned previously, the government's understanding of the meaning of the word `growth' is nothing short of bizarre. `Growth' funding—can you believe it!—for 2004 will be exactly the same amount of money as it is in 2003. In fact, since the government took office in 1996, its first action in relation to vocational education and training was to introduce an efficiency dividend. Of course, the real meaning of that phrase was a cut in funding of about five per cent. At that time, it also discontinued real increases in growth. The next agreement, 1998 to 2000, started with a budget cut of $20 million, which then required the states and territories to achieve growth targets with no extra money—the growth through efficiencies regime. Real increases were provided in the agreement that was signed in June 2001, with matching funds from the states and territories. These are the amounts that we see in the current act: $50 million in 2001 and another $25 million in both 2002 and 2003. The Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2003 will therefore bring that total funding up to $104 million.
As I said, there is no increase in funding for 2004 in this bill. There are no strategies to meet unmet demand. For the 15,000 young people who cannot get into TAFE and cannot pursue their dreams of getting vocational education, there are no strategies—not one extra place. There is no extra money being provided to make sure that those young people can get into TAFE and get the education they want, and there is none to support the states and territories to meet what they know to be increased pressures for growth. Most importantly for me, it is the 15 per cent of teenagers who are leaving school early, are not involved in full-time work and are not involved in education and training. We know that the only way to address the needs of these young people is to make sure that we do a whole lot more to keep them at school, including vocational education and training at school. It also means making sure that if they want to go to TAFE there will be a place for them.
Labor have made it clear that we will provide the money needed for an additional 20,000 places so each and every one of the students who are currently missing out can get a place. If the government are serious about addressing the problems that those young people face in getting the sort of training that they really want so that they can get a decent job in the future, they should accept Labor's amendment and adopt Labor's policy of an additional 20,000 places in TAFE. That will be 20,000 more young people with the opportunity to get a great education and the training they want so that they get a well-paid job in the future.",REPS,<title>VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Barresi, Phillip, MP",LP,2003-09-08,"—It gives me great pleasure to rise in support of the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2003. This bill reaffirms the federal government's commitment to improving the opportunity for all Australians to achieve their goals. I had an opportunity to listen to the shadow minister for vocational education and training, the member for Grayndler, foreshadow his amendment. Quite frankly, I was perplexed at his speech and at the amendment. I find it an absolute joke that the ALP are moving such an amendment. It is an amendment which criticises the government for its inaction on vocational education and training. This is from a party which, when it was in government, presided over a drop in apprenticeships. This is from a party that is more content to talk about the 30 per cent of students who go on to university. In fact, most of the member for Grayndler's contribution was about universities and the elite universities rather than about vocational education and training. We are very hard-pressed to find him saying anything about training or about apprenticeships in general. 
The other thing that perplexes me is that this amendment has been foreshadowed by a party that supports state premiers who have turned their backs on apprentices through various policy initiatives, changes and backflips which have been introduced over the last few months. I will note some of those in a little while. What really disappointed me about the shadow minister's contribution was that it was full of hatred and that it aimed vitriol at anything that the government and the Minister for Education, Science and Training do. It seems that these days it is a set piece: whenever the member for Grayndler gets up and opposes us, rather than talking about the issue, he attacks the minister as a person and attacks his credentials. The member for Grayndler does not come from the southern states and he probably has not heard of the concept of playing the ball, not the man. It is terminology which those of us who follow Australian Rules football know all too well. If the member for Grayndler spent more time in this place discussing the issue and less time hating, perhaps progress would be made in the area of policy development.
The other reason I am disappointed in the amendment is that it makes no reference at all to the inaction of the state premiers. There is growth funding in this bill, and I will talk about that in a moment. In the 2004-06 ANTA agreement, which this bill gives power to, there is an extra $218.7 million allocated. That is a real increase of 2½ per cent per annum for training places. The agreement provides $325.5 million in growth funding to be matched by the states as well. The member for Jagajaga says that this government is not doing enough to provide funds to the states to meet the pressures. This government is doing its part. The state governments also have a role in further education and training. The state governments have a growth tax in their possession, through the GST. They have the ability; the problem is they do not know how to manage money—and it is starting to show in the various decisions that they are taking throughout this country.
For example, we find that the states and territories are making it harder for students and employers to participate in vocational education and training. Remember, this is from a party that love to speak about the 30 per cent who take up tertiary places rather than those whom they should be supporting. You would normally expect that they would be supporting the blue-collar workers or those who come from families where it is more likely that they will go on to vocational education and training. They have neglected that group. 
I have heard the minister say that the New South Wales budget increased TAFE fees by some 300 per cent. That 300 per cent increase places an impost on the students of an additional $27.3 million. These are students from the western and southern suburbs of Sydney—from those areas where one would not expect them to be able to afford up to a 300 per cent increase in TAFE fees. The member for Grayndler conveniently ignored that. I wonder if he has told his constituents—those who perhaps will be going on to VET courses—that he has been silent and has not attacked Bob Carr and his government for increasing TAFE fees by about 300 per cent. The New South Wales budget provides only a 0.3 per cent increase in operating expenses. I say to the member for Grayndler that that is no real growth. That is where the phrase `no real growth' comes into it: when you look at the New South Wales budget. 
In my own state of Victoria—and yours, Madam Deputy Speaker Corcoran—the situation is no better. The Victorian government had the cheek to abolish the payroll tax exemption for employers of new apprentices. Therefore, if I run a small business and I am employing new apprentices I now no longer have payroll tax exemption. What does that cost? It costs employers $210 million because there is a sleight of hand there. The Victorian government will say to you that they are also providing some form of incentive if people finish their course or if an employer is employing more than three apprentices. That does not do much for the small business out there that only has the capacity to put on one or maybe two apprentices. We know that the real growth in employment is in small business. Some of the very small businesses that are struggling may see the potential to grow their business if they put on some apprentices, but there is a disincentive for them to do so unless they really reach out and put on more than three apprentices.
In South Australia, TAFE fees have increased by 50 per cent, costing students $1 million in the first year and $2.1 million thereafter. So where are the costs coming from? Who is being penalised? What regimes are penalising young people for going into vocational education and training? Is it the federal government? No, it is not the federal government. We have seen a 177 per cent increase in apprenticeship places since this government came to office in 1996. Where the pressures are coming from and where the neglect is taking place is in those ALP regimes around this country—in particular, I note, in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia.
I say to the member for Grayndler: if you have any credibility on this issue, stand up in parliament and attack the premiers from those ALP states. Do not come in here with fake indignation, hatred and vitriol towards the minister and this government for inaction when it is this government, this minister and the previous minister that have acted on behalf of the many young kids who do not want to go on to tertiary education but want to do apprenticeships and traineeships. To any member opposite who is looking to use cheap terminology I say that this government's record is far from one of inaction. As I say, there has been a 177 per cent increase in new apprenticeships since 1996. We are fortunate to have a government and an education minister that are willing to stand up for young people and say to them: `It's okay if you don't want to go on to university. As a government, we will support you.' That is what this funding amendment is about. It provides support to young Australians who pursue career aspirations beyond those pushed by careers teachers and by the ALP in this place.
An achievement that I do not think is lauded enough is this coalition government's track record in job creation. Since we came to power in 1996, more than one million jobs have been created. I notice in the job advertisement figures that came out today that there has been another 1.5 per cent increase this month, making four months in a row that there have been increases in job advertisements. This is a signal from employers of confidence and of wanting to grow their businesses and employ people. They are doing so in an economy and an environment which are supported by this government and which encourage growth and security of future employment. 
The Minister for Education, Science and Training has made very clear the Commonwealth's strong commitment to the VET sector with the funding outlined in the bill. The bill sees a dramatic increase in funding in 2003. The Australian National Training Authority, as the statutory body, is responsible for this $1.1 billion in funds, which it will allocate around the country. Vocational education and training in Australia relies on the support of not just state governments working with the Commonwealth but local governments as well. I note with interest that the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry stated:
Australia's National Training System is thriving.
It is thriving because of the support of this federal government. This growth in the sector can be linked to industry support, and we are seeing participation rates up, satisfaction up and funding up. The federal government is spending more than twice as much on the VET sector now as was spent in its first term. This ultimately means that Australians looking to start or change a career have many more options available to them. 
In this place we tend to talk about billions of dollars for massive programs in one policy area or another, but we need to keep a level head about some of these dollar figures and we need to look at how these billion-dollar programs trickle down to our community level and how local service providers are using the funds to interact with current and potential apprentices—in this case in Deakin. This focus ensures that we keep some perspective in interpreting these large figures. At a local level, I am proud to say that in Deakin the federal government has not abandoned those seeking VET alternatives once they leave school. 
During the winter break I was very pleased to host a visit by the Prime Minister, who decided to launch New Apprenticeships centres in Deakin. In fact he chose a location called Starr Performance Automotive in Blackburn to launch the new contract with the Victorian Employers Chamber of Commerce and Industry. The importance of providing a local access point for apprentices is essential. Information and guidance are all on offer. The Prime Minister's leadership on this issue further enhances the importance of the VET sector to a strong and productive Australia. I look forward to that particular apprenticeships centre, which will be in Mitcham Road, Mitcham, Victoria, opening very soon under the auspices of VECCI.
The government embarked on a series of reforms of which we are now seeing the benefits. In Victoria last year almost half a million people were enrolled in VET, which equates to 12.7 per cent of Australia's working-age population. A proportion of these included people with a disability. In fact, 22,000 Victorians that were engaged in VET had a disability. These statistics were brought about by the hard work of organisations like NADRASCA in my electorate. NADRASCA is a success in every sense of the word. Frank Harris and his team help people with disabilities learn new skills and gain confidence to pursue their vocation and seek out their goals. NADRASCA recently acquired new premises and has commenced operations as a community hub for people wanting to improve their knowledge base. An organisation like NADRASCA has shown that the success of VET is not solely dependent upon funding. The effectiveness of the programs being offered at the local level is the ultimate judge of government policy. 
I am also fortunate to be able to witness on a number of other occasions the effect that certain VET groups are having on my electorate. The Jobs Pathway Program is one such program whose success I have outlined at length in this place on a number of occasions. The Jobs Pathway Program helps young people who are leaving school to make a smooth transition between their school environment and work. It takes guts to leave school and venture out into the working world before you have finished your year 12 examinations. One organisation that operates within my electorate and in surrounding electorates is KYM Employment Services. KYM have a proud history of helping young people work towards their goals and enter a vocation. I am pleased to sit on their youth advisory committee and to hear first-hand of their work to give real hope to young people who otherwise might be neglected. 
At this point it is also important to note the distinction between pursuing employment and pursuing a vocation. It is an important distinction to make because some tend to focus on getting young people employed without much emphasis being placed on young people choosing a vocation in line with their own set of values and goals. KYM Employment Services operate under the banner `put your hand up and get what you want'. This identifies a fundamental shift that is occurring in schools and within the sectors dealing with young people and their futures. If young people have the capacity to recognise their skills and aspirations simultaneously, their ability to fulfil their ambitions in life will be greatly enhanced.
Last week I hosted in my office a luncheon with school captains in the area. I do this on a regular basis. One of the interesting things that came out of that luncheon with the school captains from 10 or 12 schools in my electorate is that they identified that one of the key areas that is often neglected in secondary schools is the ability to give career advice early enough to make a difference. They said that by the time they get to year 11 or year 12 it is basically too late for many of them. We must get in early, by about year 8 or year 9, to help these young kids to make career or study choices. Not everyone wants to go to university. Not everyone wants to go on to higher education of whatever kind. They just want to be able to be pointed in the right direction. This is what the school captains were telling me last week. I say to those school captains once again, as I said to them last week, that we as a federal government recognise that. 
At this moment we have a pilot program called Career and Transitions, or the CATS program, in operation. KYM also has a part to play in that. In Lilydale, the Minister for Education, Science and Training launched the CATS program, which operates in the outer eastern suburbs and the entire outer eastern region of Melbourne, taking in part of my electorate. As an initial model, the KYM-CATS program will operate in eight schools in the Shire of Yarra Ranges. The program looks intensively at early intervention approaches to careers and transition to work for school students. I look forward to seeing young people emerging from the pilot program confident in their direction in life and I am also looking forward to seeing the CATS program being extended to other schools in the area. If the feedback from those school captains is anything to go by, it certainly is a program that is much needed all over the state. 
A number of great VET programs are in operation out Deakin way. The minister has had a hand to play in some of those, with my encouragement. In the short time I have available, I will mention a couple of these programs. One is at the Heathmont Senior Secondary College in my electorate. That is a school that is leading the way in helping students to achieve their goals. The education minister launched the Enterprising Education package at Heathmont. This was not a coincidence, as the school has over some time built strong relationships with community groups and organisations within the area. It forms part of the Enterprising Education model where schools develop a partnership with the wider community to encourage students to become active in their community. This activity may be in the form of work experience, possibly even community service; whatever its form, young people are encouraged to get out into the community.
Another project that is affected by this funding announcement—it is one that I have been working on with in the community—is the Mullum Cluster. This project brings together many schools in the eastern region of Melbourne—specifically, Aquinas College, Bayswater Secondary College, Boronia Heights Secondary College, Fairhills High School, Luther College, Mater Christi College, Mullauna Secondary College, Scoresby Secondary College, Siena College, Our Lady of Sion College, Vermont Secondary College, Wantirna Secondary College, Donvale Christian School and Warrandyte High School. This VET cluster was established by Aquinas College in 2000 and it brings together schools from state, Catholic and independent sectors. The group detected a real void in the region in providing opportunities to students in the field of hospitality. After its establishment, the cluster worked extremely hard in the six months to place 191 students into school based VCE/VET programs in 2001. As the RTO, the group then submitted an application to ANTA for refurbishment of the hospitality facilities at Aquinas College. Its submission was successful, and the Mullum Cluster received $79,000 to fund the refurbishment and purchase equipment. It is a testament to the devotion of the member schools, and I was happy to assist the cluster in those early days. It is indeed pleasing to see the hard work paying off.
I have also been working with Ringwood Secondary College, which has been an active member of the Eastland VET cluster. That cluster is looking to expand to offer an automotive skills centre. I believe that this skills centre is absolutely essential to give more opportunities to young people in Deakin. The aim is to offer the automotive program on campus, which is consistent with how prominent the automotive industry is in the region. For example, component manufacturing and high-performance vehicle modifications, just to name a couple, are very prevalent in Deakin. The cluster is seeking around $250,000, and it is my sincere hope that some form of federal government assistance through ANTA will be given at some time in the near future. This government is committed to VET, as is indicated by this bill.

"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,2003-09-08,"—The bills we are debating tonight, the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2003 and the Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 2003, go to the heart of vocational training in Australia. The first bill amends the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992 in order to supplement the funding appropriated in 2002 for vocational education and training which is provided to the Australian National Training Authority for distribution to the states and territories in the year 2003 in line with price movements. It will also appropriate VET funds to be provided to ANTA for the year 2004. The second of the two bills amends the Australian National Training Authority Act to increase from five to seven the number of members of the National Training Authority—that is, other than the chair and deputy chair. The second bill would also no longer require the new ANTA agreement to be incorporated into a schedule of the act. The importance of vocational training in Australia cannot be underestimated. Vocational training is the first-line provider of skills for Australian industry. It also provides many unemployed workers and many others with a second opportunity to develop a satisfying career.  
One does not hear anywhere near the same level of public debate over VET funding as over university funding. This may be because of the structure for VET funding put in place by Minister Dawkins in 1992 which, by and large, provided the growth funds necessary for a stable VET system—a system that has been undermined by this government. There can always be improvements, and you do hear from time to time concerns about funding of the VET system. In New South Wales there has been criticism about the increases in course fees at TAFE, which indicate a shortfall in funding for that state. That is to be regretted and the state government has to justify those fee increases—and I acknowledge the stress and strain that such increases could place on ordinary working people. 
The government's approach and the Labor Party's approach to vocational education could not be more different. It is important to place in context what this government has done to vocational education funding and what the ALP did when we were last in government. In the 1993-95 triennium the Commonwealth maintained its then current financial support for VET. It also provided an injection of $100 million in recurrent funding and added an additional $70 million in growth funding. These arrangements were extended to 1996-97 by the then Labor government. In its 1996-97 budget the coalition government introduced a so-called efficiency dividend, which resulted in a five per cent reduction in funding provided to ANTA. In addition to this cut, the five per cent real growth on base recurrent funding was discontinued. The following 1997-98 budget saw another reduction in annual funding to the states and territories, which took effect on 1 January 1998 and resulted in a cut of some $20 million in that calendar year. This new base funding level formed the core of the 1998-2000 ANTA agreement, thereby locking in the reduction in annual funding. This slash-and-burn approach to public policy by the government has damaged this important sector of our education system. 
To demonstrate the growth of this sector, one needs only to look at the situation in South Australia. The South Australian department of education figures for the year 2002 show that 14,428 students participated in VET in schools—up from 2,417 in 1997. But, at both the state government level and the secondary school level, doubts are being expressed about the lack of ANTA funds for this increased demand. To give an example, the Adelaide Advertiser on 12 August this year in an article headlined `Funding fails to match school training' said:
But a state government submission to the national inquiry into VET in Schools says the increase in student numbers—
to which I have already referred—
has seen the value of funding decline from $6.57 a student hour in 1997 to just 70c in 2001.
VET in Schools is vitally important in directing young Australians into areas of most demand in Australian industry and it should not be neglected to the extent that this government is neglecting it. For example, there appears to be a continuing decline in the number of young people attracted to traditional trades in the metal and building industries. Small and medium sized industries appear to be suffering most in this regard. National data shows that, while the number of apprentices and trainees has increased since 1995, the occupational mix has changed significantly. Large rises in numbers for professionals, associated professionals, intermediate services and clerical jobs have outweighed declines in several trades and related positions. 
The trend towards student preferences for vocational school subjects has been highlighted by a 20-year study of 14,000 students from 300 schools carried out by the Australian Council for Educational Research. The results of this study were published in an article by Linda Doherty in the Sydney Morning Herald on 21 August this year. It showed that the number of year 12 students taking history, geography, most science subjects, languages and economics had declined, while enrolments in computer technology, business, food and catering subjects had increased significantly. This surge in VET subjects has been highlighted in an annual report of one of the senior high schools in my electorate, Wyndham College. In 2002, Wyndham College had 410 enrolments in vocational education and training courses, and that comprised well over 50 per cent of the student population. Students accessed VET courses through both TAFE and the college. The college is accredited to deliver six industry curriculum frameworks: retail, hospitality, business services, information technology, building and construction, and metal and engineering. Exact surveys of the 2002 year 12 students who completed VET courses as part of their HSC showed that 91 per cent of the students felt they had gained employment skills as a result of studying VET courses, 62 per cent of students thought that the completion of a VET course had influenced their chosen career path and 97 per cent of students stated that the VET course met their expectations. This just shows how vital VET in Schools is to our community's future.
The demand for VET places is high, but there is also an associated problem of unmet demand. The issue of the number of places available at TAFE is an important one that cannot be overlooked. The Western Sydney Institute of TAFE, which covers the Blacktown, Baulkham Hills, Penrith, Blue Mountains and Hawkesbury areas, had a shortfall of over 3,200 places last year. The Western Sydney Institute of TAFE is by no means on its own in having a huge number of students unable to access its services. The problem is nationwide and must be addressed at a national level. Labor has made that commitment in our recently released policy, Aim Higher: Learning, Training and Better Jobs for More Australians. Labor committed to providing an extra 20,000 TAFE places across the nation. Labor recognises the importance of vocational education and will once again place it at the forefront of our education policy.
I have had a strong commitment to TAFE over many years. I started out as an apprentice fitter and turner. In those days I worked for the railways, and the training was done by the railway institute. After completing my apprenticeship, I did a number of post-trade courses to improve my ability to get employment. I did a variety of courses such as welding, refrigeration and diesel mechanics. Since then, as a trade union official I was appointed to the New South Wales Vocational Education and Training Accreditation Board and the Industrial and Commercial Training Council of New South Wales and I also served a period of time on the TAFE Council of New South Wales. I have therefore seen at first hand how important a vibrant and active vocational education sector is. 
TAFE needs to be fully funded. It needs to be able to be flexible and adapt to changing technologies and innovative work practices. Apprenticeships and TAFE training are often the first step in a satisfying engineering career, as tradesmen continue their education into the professional and semiprofessional fields. But the demand for these skills is not yet met by our current training institutions. In an article in the Financial Review last Friday, entitled `Engineers in short supply', Kate Marshall says:
A critical shortage of skilled engineers in the automotive industry is forcing local manufacturers to go to an international recruitment drive.
And industry groups are warning that the boom in local vehicle manufacturing and design could translate to a skills shortage of between 5,000 and 10,000 in the longer term.
Ford Australia's vice-president, product development, Trevor Worthington, said company recruiters were travelling to the UK and Germany this week after a flood of responses to job advertisements in the European press. 
“What we need is 50 to 60 experienced engineers, but we're really struggling to find them locally—and as time goes on the response we get to job ads is less and less,” Mr Worthington said.
That quote demonstrates the need for increased funding for vocational education. It is a sector that needs growth to accommodate the changing needs of Australian industry. What we find is that the growth funding contained in these bills is not really growth funding at all. At roughly 2.5 per cent, it will not even cover the cost of the CPI increases. It certainly does not go anywhere near covering the growth demand for new places and new courses.
I was approached by a community organisation in my electorate regarding the impact of the Australians Working Together legislation on their core activities—the provision of TAFE outreach places. As members would know, the Australians Working Together legislation requires single mothers to undergo 150 hours of either voluntary work or education, primarily at TAFE. The funding available to this organisation, which arranges TAFE outreach for these single mothers, has not increased, yet the workload has increased considerably. Increased TAFE fees and a requirement from government that this group must undertake education and training has resulted in a great strain being placed on this sector. This is just one more point of pressure that the government is failing to address.
The integration of our education streams is something I have spoken about on a number of occasions. I highlighted the situation of Wyndham College earlier in my speech. As members may know, Wyndham College is part of the innovative Nirimba Education Precinct in my electorate. The Nirimba Education Precinct incorporates at one location a campus of the Western Sydney Institute of TAFE, a campus of the University of Western Sydney and two senior high schools—one public, that being Wyndham College, and the other, Terra Sancta College, private. All four organisations work together to maximise resources and create better educational outcomes for all students who attend, be they high school, TAFE or university students. More and more the lines of demarcation are being blurred. University students are supplementing their degrees with practical vocational courses offered by TAFE, TAFE students are doing extra academic units provided by the university and high school students at both Wyndham and Terra Sancta are accessing both the TAFE and the university. Gone are the days when a person was locked into one type of education—just university or just TAFE. Our modern economy and business requirements do not work that way any more. Gone also are the days when a person would obtain one post-school qualification—be it the intermediate level qualification or the leaving certificate. Increasingly, there is a need to retrain and constantly update and upgrade a set of skills. 
In his speech, the shadow minister, the member for Grayndler, raised the valid point that many workers will change the nature and skills of their employment several times during their working lives. Indeed, unless our older workers are trained in new skills and technology Australia will be facing a skills shortage in the next 10 to 15 years. In an article by Andrew West in the Sun-Herald on 24 August, under the headline, `Nation's Looming Crisis: Too Many Jobs', the following point is made:
Australia faces an occupational crisis, with the number of people entering the work force predicted to fall by a staggering 90 per cent in the next 15 years. According to an Access Economics report, by 2020 only 12,500 people will be entering the work force each year, down from the current annual average of 170,000.
The article goes on to say:
The country's peak seniors body, the National Seniors Association, says Australia will suffer a severe skills shortage unless business and government change their attitude to older workers.
Further on the article states that Australia has 200,000 people over the age of 50 who are unemployed and 100,000 who are long-term unemployed. Clearly Australia has a human resource base that is not being used efficiently.
To reinforce the seriousness of the problem, I would like to refer to an article that appeared in the Financial Review on 18 January this year, under the heading, `Keeping grey power in the workforce'. The article begins:
As the population ages, Australian employers will face a skills shortage unless older workers continue formal training into their 30s, 40s and even 50s, according to demographic experts.
The article goes on to point out that at Australia Post the model age of workers has increased from 27 to 42 years in the last 12 years. According to the article, Pat McCarthy, national manager of organisational development and change at Australia Post, has said that employees would have to be willing to take up training later in their careers and employers would have to offer training to mature workers, in order to keep the skills base constant. One final quote from the article is also of interest:
Opening up training and education to the over-45s could be a difficult and slow process, said the Federal Minister for Ageing Kevin Andrews.
I would suggest that it will indeed be a slow process if more money is not allocated to the vocational education and training sector by this government. Unless the investment is made, the opportunity—whether that be for school leavers or mature age workers seeking new and improved skills—to access the vocational education sector will simply not be there.
This is a policy area that will become increasingly important over the coming years. We cannot afford to neglect this sector. Labor has promised 20,000 new TAFE places in our fully costed and fully funded education policy. We believe that education starts in early childhood and continues throughout a person's life. The continually changing nature of our society demands a flexible and adaptable work force. The way to achieve the flexibility that is needed is to adequately fund the very institutions that provide the framework for new skills—that is, TAFE and vocational training in skills. Labor recognises this. It is just a pity that the government does not seem to. In conclusion, I support the second reading amendment to be moved by the member for Grayndler.",REPS,<title>VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Elson, Kay, MP",LP,2003-09-08,"—I appreciate the opportunity to speak on the Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 2003. This bill amends the act under which the Australian National Training Authority was established in 1992. The purpose of the bill is to increase the number of ANTA board members from five to seven, excluding, of course, the chairman and the deputy chairperson. It also removes the requirement that new ANTA agreements be incorporated in the schedule to the act. 
To understand the purpose and importance of this bill, we need to look at what the Australian National Training Authority actually is. We are talking about something this government believes is important to the social and economic wellbeing of Australia. We are talking about providing quality vocational education and training. We are talking about providing practical options and pathways—other than through universities—for our young people to continue their education and to acquire trade and career skills. We are also talking about providing opportunities for older or redundant workers to change their career paths or to get back into the work force. I would sincerely like to thank the staff at Mission Australia in Beaudesert for the excellent work they do with the BITS program for older workers in the Boonah and Beaudesert area.
In this bill we are also talking about helping disadvantaged groups. This means ensuring that Australia has a quality work force through which it can grow its economy. A thriving business—or, of course, economy—employs more people. It provides more employment opportunities which, in turn, underpin the health of our society and our ability to continue to meet our welfare obligations.
The creation of ANTA in 1992 was something of a milestone in federal-state relations because it marked the beginning of the collaboration between the Commonwealth, states and territories in this important field. It was established to promote the development of a national vocational education and training system in accordance with the objectives of a Commonwealth-state agreement which was called the ANTA agreement. Through ANTA—through this Commonwealth-state agreement—Commonwealth funding is used to support vocational education and training, which is, of course, administered by the state and territory governments. These Commonwealth funds are appropriated under the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992 but they are distributed by ANTA.
The ANTA agreement sets out planning, accountability and funding arrangements for the national system of vocational education and training. It addresses policy directions and priorities, and is renegotiated every three years. The third agreement—which is for 2001-03—expires at the end of this year. A new agreement for the period 2004-06 is currently being negotiated. The ANTA agreement established the ANTA board—the governing body of ANTA—which oversees all its operations and bears ultimate responsibility for its performance. It also advises the ANTA ministerial council, MINCO, which is made up of the state and territory training ministers.
The board currently consists of seven members—a chairman, deputy chairman and five others. It is industry led and its members are nominated by the ANTA ministerial council and appointed by the Governor-General. Late in 2002, ANTA MINCO resolved to approach the Commonwealth minister responsible for vocational education and training to request that the number of board members be increased from seven to nine. The Commonwealth supports the MINCO decision and, as a result, this bill seeks to amend the act to increase the number of ANTA board members.
Mr Deputy Speaker, you may well ask, `Why do we need more board members?' As the Daily Telegraph reported in August this year, TAFE studies have become a changing feast. As well as traditional courses, there is a new generation of courses—from mortuary practices and zookeeping to saw-doctoring and museum guiding. The scope of the work dealt with by MINCO is wide ranging, and the board is required to consult extensively with an increasingly wide range and number of stakeholders. An increased diversity of backgrounds and perspectives across the membership of the board will enhance its capacity to advise MINCO on strategies and positioning to meet the present and future needs of business, industry and the community. This is why MINCO—the state and territory ministers—and the Commonwealth support the appointment of two more members to the board. 
Let us look at the other amendment contained in this bill. The Australian National Training Authority Act 1992 currently requires that the legislation be amended to incorporate any newly negotiated ANTA agreements into schedule 1 of the act. This amendment means that the act could no longer be amended to give effect to any new ANTA agreement negotiated or signed by the federal and state ministers. Obviously, as an agreement which has been reached by all the relevant ministers, who are of different political persuasions and have different priorities, it has already undergone extensive research, analysis and debate. As the federal Minister for Education, Science and Training said in his second reading speech, once the new agreement is reached and has been signed by all the relevant ministers, he will make the document public by tabling it in both houses of parliament.
Having said that, I note that, although each new ANTA agreement details the Commonwealth's commitment to the states and territories for the duration of the agreement, the actual Commonwealth financial contributions or appropriations which give effect to this commitment are made under the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992. This means that, although under this bill new ANTA agreements will not require the Australian National Training Authority Act 1992 to be amended, any new funding arrangements will still be subject to parliamentary scrutiny; they will still be debated in the House by way of amendments to the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act. As the minister said in his second reading speech:
Vocational education and training underpins the competitiveness of our industries and supports Australia's economic and social development.
New Apprenticeships are now available in more than 500 occupations, and the numbers have grown by 177 per cent since 1995. We are also seeing a record number of New Apprenticeships completions. They are at 118,500 as at 31 March 2003, and they are up by 19 per cent on the previous year. In my electorate of Forde, we have seen a steady increase in the number of New Apprenticeships commencements, with an average increase of approximately 400 per year. Spending on New Apprenticeships incentives in my area is up to $4 million. This is all good news for the young people in my electorate and also for our businesspeople. In other areas, including the disadvantaged, there has also been significant growth. As the minister has stated, there is increasing participation by groups in the community which suffer great disadvantage. The number of Indigenous Australians in vocational education and training is up by 129 per cent since 1995, and the number of students enrolled who are from rural and remote areas has risen by 45 per cent in the same period. It must be stressed that record levels of Commonwealth funding are contributing to these achievements. Over the next four years the government will spend over $8.4 billion on vocational education and training. 
I would like to thank all the staff, volunteers and students at Logan TAFE. They provide programs with real, practical outcomes. I would also like to thank the excellent work done, and support given, by Cheryl Taylor and her staff at the Beenleigh Industry Training Network. They provide projects within my area for young people at Beenleigh State High School, Canterbury College, Rivermount College, Trinity College and Windaroo Valley State High School. I would also like to thank the Ipswich High School and Industry Links, who provide the Boonah and the Logan School to Work programs, which also assist the Loganlea State High School and the Marsden State School. I would also like to thank SCISCO on the Gold Coast who cater for Coomera and Pacific Pines State High School. They do a fantastic job.
The Commonwealth offer for the 2004-06 ANTA agreement would provide funding of $3.57 billion over three years. This offers real average growth in recurrent funding of 2½ per cent per annum, and the total increase of funding over the three years is 12.5 per cent higher than the 2001-03 agreement. The Howard government's priorities for the new agreement include improving the quality of training; addressing skills shortages; providing a flexible training market for participants; assisting older workers, people with disabilities and parents returning to work; and strategies for practical reconciliation with Indigenous Australians. 
I place on record my thanks to the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Brendan Nelson, for the time that he has taken to visit my electorate. He has left a great impression with the people in my electorate as someone who is being responsible and has a genuine interest in young people's education. He has a practical approach to providing education and training to all Australians. I commend this bill to the House.",REPS,<title>VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"King, Catherine, MP",ALP,2003-09-08,"—I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 2003 and the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2003 in this cognate debate. The purpose of the ANTA Amendment Bill is to increase from seven to nine the number of members of the board, which reflects a decision by the ANTA ministerial council. It is an appropriate decision, as it reflects the diversity of interests required on the ANTA board to actually reflect the needs of the vocational education and training sector into the future. I support the changes.
The purpose of the VET Funding Amendment Bill is to supplement the funding appropriated in 2002 to the Australian National Training Authority for vocational education and training in line with real price movements, and to appropriate funds for VET to be provided to ANTA for distribution to the states and territories for 2004. It includes funds for the Australians Working Together policy and the VET related elements of the government's Recognising and Improving the Capacity of People with a Disability initiative.
While supporting the measures contained in the bill, I want to take the opportunity to dispel a few of the mistruths that the government has tried to put forward about its record in relation to vocational education and training. The first is the minister's grand claim that he is providing new funding for VET in this bill. In the May budget press release, the minister stated that he wrote to states and territories offering them what he said was an—and I say it was a so-called—additional $218.7 million for the next ANTA agreement. There was some excitement about the announcement—finally the minister was going to put some money where his mouth was; finally he was actually going to fund vocational education and training in Australia.  
The glossy kit that went with the announcement did the minister proud. I think it outglossed the releases of pretty much every other minister's portfolio on budget day. It was a terrific piece of slick marketing. But as the weeks went on it became increasingly clear that there was some small print that was not included in the minister's glossy press release kit on budget night. The $218.7 million included $119.5 million from the welfare measures already announced in previous budgets. I am not quite sure how announcing something that you have already announced is new, but apparently to the minister it is new. It also contained three years of indexation of both base and growth funding.
When you look at the budget papers—which is where you would naturally look to see how much the increase is going to be in vocational education and training funding—and try to find where the increase is in what is going to be allocated, you find that it is actually zero, which seems pretty amazing when you have the minister talking about additional funding. I am pretty sure I know what I mean when I use the word `additional'. I am pretty sure I know what I mean when I use the word `growth'. I am pretty sure the states and territories and VET providers also know what they understand when they hear the words `additional' and `growth'. But the minister seems to have got pretty good at redefining the English language. I guess that for `additional' we now need to read the words `the same'. `Growth' is not about increasing funding; rather, it is about shrinking funding, it would appear, under the minister's new definitions.
The minister's offer contains no real new funding. The base rate remains current at 2000 levels and the growth funding on offer is barely in line with indexation—that is, it is barely in line with the increasing costs of providing vocational education and training. The state and territory ministers have to date expressed considerable concern over the stagnation in Commonwealth funding for VET and they have rejected the minister's offer. If the minister were serious about improving opportunities for young Australians to access VET, he would increase funding, but what we have had over successive years of this government has been funding cuts to vocational education and training.
In its first budget, this government introduced an efficiency dividend which resulted in a five per cent reduction in funding to ANTA. In addition, the five per cent real growth on base recurrent funding was discontinued. In the subsequent budget the government reduced annual funding to the states and territories appropriated under the VET Funding Act—an estimated cut of about $20 million in the 1998 calendar year alone. Each subsequent ANTA agreement has locked in the Commonwealth reduction in base funding, resulting in a $240 million reduction in the Commonwealth's contribution to the VET sector. This latest funding offer continues in that same vein.
What we have so far is no new money for VET and, in the first few years of this government, significant cuts to TAFE funding. I do not know what sort of commitment to vocational education and training is in the minister's book. In my book, it means not very much of a commitment at all. All of this has been occurring in the context of a shortfall of approximately 39,000 in TAFE places. There has been a significant growth in demand for TAFE places. In some instances, this has occurred because people are seeking an alternative pathway into higher education because of the government's higher education funding cuts and the lack of places in higher education institutions; in others, we are seeing people trying to become far more competitive in what is becoming an increasingly fractured and difficult labour market. 
We know that, in terms of opportunities, young people and mature unemployed people have better outcomes the more education they have. So it is certainly something that we want to support people in. Rather than restrict people's access to vocational education and training, we should be doing all we can to encourage and engage people in it. Lifelong learning is something that government should support and encourage. But support and encouragement requires more than flowery rhetoric and the ability to tell a good tale in parliament and quote endless reams of statistics; it actually requires government funding for new places.
Labor has committed to fund an extra 20,000 fully funded part-time and full-time TAFE places. The minister to date has offered no new growth in VET funding and TAFE funding cuts across successive years, and he has failed to address the shortage of TAFE places. Labor, in stark contrast, has bitten the bullet and committed to increasing TAFE places. I guess the government just has some different priorities. It would rather see tax cuts continue to some of this country's highest paid imported foreign executives than increase opportunities for young people to attend TAFE. The minister in his second reading speech stated:
Vocational education and training underpins the competitiveness of our industries and supports economic and social development.
Yet the minister has failed to actually increase funding for VET and has focused his efforts on short-term outcomes, not on long-term solutions. The minister's statement occurs at a time when there is a serious skill shortage in Australia. Skill shortage is a serious constraint on investment in Australia. In regional and rural areas such as mine, the skill shortage—particularly in areas such as plumbing, building, mechanics and bricklaying—are getting worse. The ACCI members survey rated it as the second most serious constraint after business taxes and government charges. The Australian Industry Group in its submission to the Senate inquiry reported that over half the businesses surveyed face skill shortages. This is inexcusable in the context of high youth unemployment and pockets of unemployment across many regional and rural communities.
The minister boasts that apprenticeships and traineeships have grown under his watch, but fails to point out that the growth has occurred mainly in short-term training in industries such as retail and fast food—worthy industries, of course—but not in the areas where there are significant skill shortages. Skill shortages are a major problem in this country, a problem which this minister must address. Initiatives to try and get young people interested in traditional trades and particularly in the manufacturing sector are welcome, but frankly they are just not enough. I note that, at the ACTU congress, a background paper into VET states as one of the quick facts:
The availability of qualified labour is now regarded as one of the most serious constraints to business. Yet, in 2003, only one in ten private sector employers are delivering structured industry training leading toward a national qualification and less than one quarter of employers are providing training through traineeships or apprenticeships.
That is a situation we cannot continue to tolerate. The VET in Schools program is also an important way of engaging young people, while they are still at school, in the vocational education and training system. But the costs involved to schools are significant. If we are to seriously create pathways between vocational education and training and school then we need to understand that, despite initial growth, there are dangers that schools will opt out unless we can address the real costs of VET in Schools. 
There are also some major problems in utilising VET to assist 15- to 19-year-olds. We have to do much better in keeping them engaged in education and training. A recent survey in my own electorate estimated that the unemployment rate amongst 15- to 19-year-olds was running at about 23 per cent. Whilst it does not quite accord with the formal statistics, I think the local survey taps into some of the real problems with the unemployment statistics. If we are actually going to seriously engage 15- to 19-year-olds in the workplace and in vocational education and training, we have to get serious about it. The current system is failing many in this group who are not likely to continue through to VCE. We have to do something about it. I certainly hope the parliamentary inquiry into VET in Schools has a good look at that issue.
The government has done very little to address the skills crisis in Australia. The government's training dollar is not being directed towards addressing acute skill shortages, nor is it being directed to areas that will assist young people's longer term career prospects. There are currently significant problems with the traineeship scheme with—despite growth in the numbers of young people entering the scheme—a large proportion of traineeships not being completed. A large number do not include structured off-the-job training, and a large number of traineeships are covering basic entry level enterprise skills which employers would previously have provided without government subsidy or wages. Many young people feel that they are being used as cheap labour under these schemes and that no permanent job offer will result at the end of the scheme if they happen to complete it. Many are opting out of the scheme before they complete it. The system of employer incentives is an important one, but more attention should be paid to how this system is working and the long-term employment, training and education outcomes of this scheme. The bill says nothing about this at all.
The minister has said next year will be the year he sets his sights on VET. We now know what the minister meant when he decided that he would reform higher education: he meant higher fees, a two-tiered university system and limited real growth in university places—in fact, very little growth at all. What will the minister do to vocational education and training? I guess we can only speculate, but from his past form you can get a pretty good sense about what the minister believes should happen. The minister is proposing to expand the competitive training market through the user-choice mechanism, potentially removing the role of TAFE as the major public VET provider.
Institutions such as the School of Mines in Ballarat have a strong history—one which I personally would like to see expand to other areas of my electorate. The school comes under enormous pressure as it struggles with the demand for TAFE places in the region. It tries to reflect the needs of incredibly diverse regional industries across a broad range of sectors and competes with other training providers. The School of Mines is a public institution we are pretty proud of in Ballarat, and I will be most concerned if the minister's changes seek to undermine its role in any way in my community.
Vocational education and training in Australia has undergone enormous changes over the past decade. If we are serious about developing the future economic opportunities for this country then we are going to have to have a much bolder vision for vocational education and training. It is not just about tackling skill shortages today—whilst that is important and it is something the government has failed to do—but also about determining what they will be in the future and doing everything we can as a nation to provide opportunities for young people to participate in education and training that will provide them with the skills that will grow our economy. 
We have faced seven years of stagnation in VET under this government. This government is slow and cumbersome and takes too long to react to what are serious shortages in skills. It lacks the capacity to innovate and provide a vision for further education that places Australia at the heart of new technology development, and it lacks the will to seriously ensure that we are the country of first choice for investment opportunities. If it was that sort of government then the bills we are debating tonight would be a source of great excitement in the vocational education and training sector. Instead, they are being treated as very much more of the same—more of the same stagnation in VET funding that we have seen under this government.",REPS,<title>VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Prosser, Geoff, MP",LP,2003-09-08,"—I rise tonight in support of the Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 2003, which promotes the development of the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2003 and recognises that vocational education and training promotes a highly skilled work force and complements the efficiencies in our industry, which promotes a productive Australian economy. I am encouraged to learn of the uptake of vocational education and training programs by Australian youth and applaud the increase in the number of apprentices currently in training, spanning some 500 occupations. These occupations not only include the traditional trades in building, construction and engineering but also have been extended to take in new technologies, such as telecommunications and information technology as well as electro-technology.
This uptake is not limited to the more populated metropolitan areas as the programs are spread over rural and remote areas, which contributes to the growth of industries and commerce in regional and rural Australia. In fact, in my electorate of Forrest in the south-west of Western Australia, there are a number of traditional industries encompassing electrical utilities, alumina production, and machining and fabrication through to boilermaker welding, cabinet-making, carpentry, bricklaying and the like, as well as plastering.
At this time of the year, traditional trades are recruiting apprentices for the 2004 intake year. They recruit local people to work within their local communities to obtain and develop the necessary work skills that provide opportunities for these people either to remain in the local area or to be posted anywhere within Australia to take up their work in other companies and, of course, to maintain the high level of skills that are now nationally recognised.
People in regional areas have increased their participation in New Apprenticeships significantly, to more than 97,000 places for people in rural and remote areas compared with fewer than 40,000 in 1995. The success of the vocational education and training achievements can no doubt be attributed to record levels of Commonwealth government funding, which demonstrates that this government is totally committed to this country's future training needs by providing world-class skills based training to the work force.
The Australian National Training Authority, or ANTA, agreement sets out the planning, accountability and funding arrangements for the national vocational education and training system and is renegotiated every three years. The agreement for 2001-03 expires at the end of 2003 and negotiations are well advanced on a new agreement for the 2004-06 period. The Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2003 aims to supplement 2003 funding by $24.4 million to provide for normal price movements, as required by the 2001-03 Australian National Training Authority agreement between the Commonwealth and the states. As a result, total funding for 2003 will be increased to $1.118 billion, including some $104 million in growth funding. 
The bill will also appropriate some $1.136 billion to be provided to the states and territories through ANTA for vocational education and training in 2004. This includes $104 million in growth funding, to be matched by the states and territories under the terms of the proposed ANTA agreement for 2004-06. Over the next four years, the Commonwealth will spend some $8.4 billion on vocational education and training, encompassing some $5.04 billion in funds for the vocational education and training sector, most of which is for distribution to the states and territories through the Australian National Training Authority. The Commonwealth will also provide nearly $3 billion for employer incentives and New Apprenticeships support services.
In 2003-04, the Commonwealth is providing total funding of $2.1 billion for vocational education and training, including an estimated $682.4 million to support New Apprenticeships arrangements—including employer incentives—and an estimated $1.167 billion to the states and territories under the ANTA agreement for 2001-03. At present there are over 1.76 million students in vocational education and training, which is equal to about one-eighth of Australia's working age population. I am told that not only are there record numbers of new apprentices entering vocational education and training, such as a 177 per cent increase over the eight years from 1995 to 2003—from 141,400 at December 1995 to over 391,000 in training by March 2003—but also record numbers of new apprentices are completing their training, with 118,500 completions in the 12 months to 31 March 2003, which represents an increase of 19 per cent from the previous year.
New Apprenticeships continue to increase in popularity with women as well. Females now represent 37 per cent of all new apprentices, up from 34 per cent 12 months ago. In 2001, 24 per cent of students were aged 15 to 19 years. This has grown by 30 per cent since 1998, which represents the success of vocational education and training programs in schools, which are now available in more than 95 per cent of Australian secondary schools. However, vocational and education training is not only for youth; it is also being extended to older workers, people with disabilities and parents returning to the work force, ultimately delivering improved productivity outcomes for employers complemented by the maintenance of highly trained workers combining their skills for the continued competitive development of our economy.
It is notable too that, while New Apprenticeships have increased for all age groups, proportionate growth has been strongest for people aged 40 years and over, where numbers have increased almost sevenfold in the five years to March 2003. This is an important achievement. The reskilling of mature aged workers helps in positioning industry to address the labour force challenges of the future. This is a real success story for Australia. We must keep promoting the need for participation in vocational education and training programs that forge better relationships with industry and the partnerships that form from supplying suitably trained apprentices to our industry base. It is critical to Australia's economic future that we secure the arrangements under which these achievements can be built upon. 
The cycle of training has attracted world-class industry trainers to undertake learning outcomes that maintain the high standard of skills training. Training packages have been developed in many industries. They are nationally agreed competencies, qualifications assessment and teaching resources designed to deliver maximum flexibility to industry. Vocational education and training is for students, apprentices or trainees in every industry. It is about traditional skills and the latest technologies, and provides pathways to better jobs. There has never been a better time to get a head start with vocational education and training. It involves learning practical work skills that industry and employers value.
Vocational education and training programs allow pathways for students to start as beginners and can combine regular school subjects with vocational training and progress through a lifetime of learning new skills and trades. It is not uncommon for school students to complete certificates in hospitality, office and multimedia skills and get a real head start. New Apprenticeships are available in a much wider range of industries than ever before and mix practical work with training to provide nationally recognised qualifications and the experience required to secure a good job.
Employers are embracing higher skill levels, with 83 per cent of all new apprentices in training participating at the certificate III level or higher. This participation growth has not been at the expense of the traditional trades. The figures show 137,000 traditional trades new apprenticeships in training as at March 2003, encompassing trades such as carpentry, plumbing and electrical, making up 35 per cent of new apprentices in training. This growth is in direct response to industry's needs for skilled workers. From my experience as a registered builder I can certainly acknowledge the invaluable contribution made to the construction industry by fully indentured apprentices.
When it comes to vocational education and training, TAFEs are the largest providers of training and started out as the place apprentices went to study their trade. Now TAFEs tackle almost every kind of training under the sun, and many other registered training organisations exist besides TAFE. Their qualifications are also recognised nationally by industry. I congratulate the Howard government on its foresight and commitment to support world-class excellence in skills based training to complement the country's future economic development. I applaud the collaborative efforts of the states and territories working with the Commonwealth to develop a new agreement for the period from 2004 to 2006. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Crosio, Janice, MP",ALP,2003-09-08,"—I rise tonight to speak in this cognate debate on the Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 2003 and the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2003. I do so to condemn the government's short-sighted approach to training by providing a system whereby Australians are not able to have the skills that the market demands. The truth of the matter is that funding to the sector is so slim that appropriations will not be able to cover wage increases to the teachers and trainers. The recent federal budget has not provided any extra funding to the Australian National Training Authority, ANTA, until 2007. So no matter what the government members come into this House and say, I suggest they go back and, rather than listening to the rhetoric, read their budget papers. I therefore find it hard to believe that the minister is able to enter this House and argue that he is somehow assisting the vocational education and training sector. 
The current ANTA agreement expires at the end of the year. From my reading of the budget papers, once a new agreement is reached, the increase in funding to ANTA will be negligible. The current ANTA agreement saw the states stuck with a $450 million shortfall for the three years of the agreement. The previous ANTA agreement from 1998 to 2000 locked in the government's funding cuts announced in the 1997-98 budget and maintained 1998 funding levels over the three years of the agreement.
Whilst the Howard government has continually reduced funding in real terms to the vocational education and training sector since 1997, the states and territories have been expected to match the Commonwealth's funding. Proportionately, they are making a much more significant contribution to the training of Australians. As real funding levels from the Commonwealth have dropped, enrolments have increased by over 20 per cent. So the demand is there. However, the Howard government steadfastly refuses to put its hand in its pocket and provide the necessary funds. It is mean and cruel, and shows no foresight whatsoever. Added to the funding problems is the spectre of the government imposing a HECS style system on TAFE students. The history of this government suggests to me that where there is smoke there is fire. I state emphatically to the House today that I will oppose with vigour any suggestion of introducing a HECS system into TAFEs.
Whilst the government refuses to keep its side of the bargain in a period of increasing demand, the states have dropped their average fees in the corresponding period. I realise that government members have been denigrating the Carr government's recent fee increases, but the facts are that they were for many years the cheapest fees in Australia. Nearly a quarter of all students—approximately 120,000 in New South Wales—will still be exempt from fees, and no apprentice or trainee will be paying more than $350 for a course. If the Howard government was making a positive contribution then it might have a right to criticise. However, I know from experience that the NSW TAFE system is second to none.
The critical issue in this debate is that Australia requires skilled workers in our industries to be competitive in a globalised world. I realise that the government essentially wants to compete by making Australia a low-wage, low-skilled society—the very essence of Toryism. The Labor way is to make Australia a highly skilled and highly paid society. This is the debate that has to be fought and won. I believe the community will adopt Labor's vision for industry in this country.
According to industry, we have significant problems with the quality of training outcomes. What seems to be occurring is that what students are being trained in is not matching the requirements of our industries. With the reduced levels of funding from the Commonwealth, a great pool of untapped talent is being wasted in the government's obsession with being so mean. Why not train people to learn a trade, rather than leaving them to the unemployment scrapheap or consigning them to the low-skilled jobs that are increasingly unstable? We are creating a generation which will have two sides—one will be university educated, professional, earn high wages and own most of the property, and the other will be on low wages, have low skills, suffer increased casualisation and have little or no chance at all of buying a home.
What is the government response to this? I will tell you what they are doing. They are doing nothing because they are letting it happen. It takes up to seven years to train a person to reach industry standard. Employers have stated over a number of years that it is becoming increasingly difficult for them to afford to pay for all of the training, so the cost falls on either the individual or the government. We on this side of the House argue that it should be the government, because it is the whole nation that benefits from the skills of these people in the end. 
I note some disturbing figures. In 2001, 80 per cent of young Australians received either a year 12 or a VET qualification. On the face of it, government members would probably jump up and say that this figure is quite good. However, when you consider the levels that were reached during Labor's period in office, which were close to 90 per cent, and compare this latest figure with our competitor nations—Canada, Germany, the Republic of Korea and the United States of America—we are certainly falling way behind. I believe this is all due to the lack of vision and attention of the Howard government.
If a student leaves school before the end of year 12 and does not attend TAFE, their chances of being unemployed rise exponentially. Twenty weeks after leaving school, over 40 per cent are either unemployed, in part-time work without study or not in the labour force at all. This figure is highly disturbing and you would think it would push this government to act—but not if your goal is for two Australias. This government thinks these young people can join that second group—the group that will always be in that awkward position of temporary employment. Low wages are better than high wages and better skills, according to the government.
The Australian Financial Review in an editorial on 22 May this year argued quite correctly, I believe, and vigorously for a concerted national approach to alleviate the skills shortages of this nation. This national approach must include all players—both Commonwealth and state governments, industry, unions and the education sector. It would not be the worst idea for the minister to organise a meeting with all of these people to attempt to find some solutions to this crisis. Why not? Can it hurt? Of course it cannot. Why doesn't the minister act in this regard?
However, `action' is not usually a word that is in this government's vocabulary. The government boast that apprenticeships have increased since they came to office, but what about the so-called traditional trades which are still crying out for new apprentices? Not everybody wants to work in the hospitality industry. Again, we see that pattern with this government of the two tiers in the work force. According to the Financial Review, we have shortages of hairdressers, upholsterers, cabinet-makers, chefs, bricklayers, plumbers, electricians, refrigeration mechanics, car mechanics, panel beaters, vehicle painters, fitters and sheet metal workers, just to name a few. Think about it. Every time, Mr Deputy Speaker, you and every member of this House tries to get a tradesperson around to fix something from one of these trades, you usually have to wait at least a week before they are able to attend the problem. One asks: why? I will tell you why: because there are not enough of them and we are not training them in those particular fields.
I hear arguments that the economy has changed and that we are now substantially service driven. But aren't many of these areas of need I have mentioned services? In the future, we will continue to want our hair cut and styled, we will want our lounges to be upholstered, we will want to buy cabinets, we will want to go to a restaurant, we will need our houses built and pipes put in them and we will still drive cars which will break down or be smashed and need to be fixed. So what will happen? We will do it, because of this government's policies, by what I have now classified DIY—do it yourself. That seems to be their answer to all of our nation's problems—DIY, do it yourself. 
It is ridiculous. We have a demand for skilled people but no supply because we have a government with no foresight. The National Centre for Vocational Education Research has produced figures that indicate that the government's New Apprenticeships scheme has the lowest number of people commencing apprenticeships in the traditional trades for five years. In the December 2002 period, only 6,000 people started apprenticeships in the traditional trades. The Financial Review also comments on the lack of spending that business itself provides for training. Previously, business was able to obtain tradespeople from the old state utilities. However, most of these now have been either privatised or corporatised, meaning that the supply base has been removed.
Within my electorate, we have the largest industrial estate in the Southern Hemisphere—the Wetherill Park industrial area—and there is another one close by at Smithfield. A number of businesses in these areas have approached me in the last few years, stating that they are concerned that there are not enough apprentices or skilled employees to meet their demand. In my electorate, many people traditionally have taken up a trade and have either worked with a local business or started a local business of their own in the area. The TAFE system is crucial to their training and development. However, despite all its rhetoric, the government refuses to provide the funding that the sector demands. This is another example of an economic rationalist mind-set that prevents forward thinking. Other minds would see it as a mind-set for today, not for tomorrow.
If this government were tight with its fiscal policy, you could in a way see where it was coming from and you would be able to see a determination to maintain a disciplined control over expenditure. However, this is not the case. It is a spendthrift government that is running the surplus on empty and, might I add, doing so deliberately. Instead of spending exorbitant amounts on consultants, expensive motels or cars—`fringe benefits' might be a good way of describing how the public see these outlays—the government should be looking ahead, talking to stakeholders and planning where we should be as a society in 10 years. Other than the Treasurer's Intergenerational Report of last year—even that was more of a threat to take money away than a grand and substantial plan—the government has been derelict in its duty to provide some vision for this nation. Since this government's election in 1996, I have risen in this House to speak time and again on education funding bills and appropriation bills, and complained that the government has constantly been withdrawing money from the education sector. The morale in the sector is poor, and why wouldn't it be? They are expected to produce results that are competitive with the rest of the world but to do it on a shoestring.
The Dusseldorp Skills Forum in Melbourne has had some very fine results in providing students with some future direction. The number of students leaving school with no plans has been reduced by 50 per cent, which has subsequently reduced the rate of unemployment by the same rate, while the number of those entering worthwhile and useful training programs has increased by 150 per cent. What does the Dusseldorp Skills Forum do? It sends advisers into schools to provide guidance to students on career options and on the types of subjects they should be studying, while monitoring the students who do choose to leave school early. In the Australian Financial Review, Dusseldorp estimated that if this program were available around Australia it would cost $80 million. The Australian Financial Review, Dusseldorp, employers, teachers and students believe there should now be a concerted national approach and increased funding. What is the government doing? I repeat: absolutely nothing. 
The budget papers indicate that there is going to be little or no extra funding. In the meantime, approximately 50,000 students are being failed by the system. It is a disgrace and the government, as the controller of the purse strings, should be ashamed of itself. It should forgo a few consultants to pay for our students' training. But students are not a priority for this government. This is in stark contrast to the Australian Labor Party. In July, Labor announced its plan to create an extra 20,000 TAFE places and provide an extra $35 million to support secondary school students from disadvantaged backgrounds to progress to TAFE or university. Labor's TAFE and university package is worth $2.34 billion over four years. As announced by the Leader of the Opposition and the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Labor will alter the government's budget priorities. It will redirect money from the Howard government's university package, reverse the government's decision to increase the diesel fuel rebate to mining companies, cut $160 million from the Howard government's tax breaks for foreign executives and oppose the abolition of the student financial supplement assistance scheme. Government members say, `Where's the money coming from?' We say, `The money is there; just get your priorities right.'
Labor wants to develop a truly national TAFE system. A national curriculum would be beneficial to business as it would know that a prospective employee with a particular qualification would have that qualification recognised throughout Australia. It is achievable, and it must be achieved for our work force to compete with the demands of the economy of the 21st century. There must be an education policy that embraces all sectors: schools, vocational education and training and tertiary education. There should be a total package, which Labor has continually exemplified by its platform. I recommend that the minister and the government read and take a leaf out of Labor's book. 
My electorate has always relied upon the activities of TAFE. The Wetherill Park TAFE has worked very closely over the years with businesses in the Wetherill Park industrial estate. This relationship has been quite successful, and I would encourage businesses in other areas to establish good working relationships with their TAFEs. It is crucial for the economic wellbeing of my electorate for these relationships to work. The Howard government should be placing greater emphasis not on cutting funds but, rather, on recognising its primary obligation to improve the links between business and vocational education and training. 
The government should be working with all stakeholders to improve and develop the sector. I call on this government to reprioritise its spending and to dig deeper into its already deep pockets and provide more funding to our vocational education and training sector. It is absolutely crucial not only to the future developmental needs of the people of my electorate of Prospect but also to the future of our nation. Our teachers are out there crying to be heard. Our students are out there wishing to be educated, either through tertiary or vocational education. The government must not let those cries go unheard. It must stand up and be counted, reprioritise its spending and look at what the needs are. If we are going to talk about our country, let us talk about its future, not just its present. If we cannot do that, let us learn from its past. We will never be able to advance as a competitive nation if we do not have the skills and the education in our work force and if we do not provide them in the years to come to our many students who are now looking for that assistance and help. Wake up government, Australia needs you. ",REPS,<title>VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Ferguson, Martin, MP",ALP,2003-09-08,"—I rise this evening to speak on the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2003 and the Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 2003. In doing so, I say at the outset that the opposition believes that these bills confirm its assertion that the Minister for Education, Science and Training has continued to deliberately misrepresent the facts about vocational education and training funding in recent times. It is for that reason that I have pleasure in supporting the second reading amendment proposed by my colleague Mr Albanese, the member for Grayndler, to the Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2003.
An analysis of the facts demonstrates clearly that the minister for education has no interest in training working Australians but has a very deliberate interest in misrepresenting the facts about so-called additional funding for training in the TAFE sector. It is another example of `do not listen to what he says; rather, look at what he does'. In any examination of what the minister for education has produced, we quite clearly see that once again he is fudging the figures. An examination reveals that increases in the base funding and growth funding for ANTA simply reflect CPI increases. Any suggestion that the increases are more than that is a very clear and deliberate misrepresentation of the facts. Funds above the level of the CPI are in fact earmarked for targeted programs where the minister for education is trying to force states and territories to fund—guess what?—his priorities. In the light of the huge training challenge facing the Australian community, I believe that reflecting the CPI increases is not enough.
From my ongoing consultations not only with industry but also, more importantly, with regional Australia, I would say that Australia faces at this point in time a huge challenge on the apprenticeship and training front. Sooner rather than later we will be facing a very dramatic shortage in traditional trades in Australia. Industries such as the building industry, the motor repair industry and the vehicle manufacturing industry—this evening I met with representatives of the vehicle manufacturing industry—are crying out for assistance on the training front. They are finding it very difficult to attract tradesmen in this day and age because of the shortage of training opportunities, the smaller number of people going into traditional trades and the failure of the current government to lead on the apprenticeship training front.
As we all appreciate, this also creates problems from an economic point of view. When there is a shortage of trades there is a difficulty on the wages front, which in turn can eventually have an impact on the rate of inflation in the Australian economy. It is about time that we confronted the training challenges as a matter of urgency. I say that because the bills we are debating this evening are about merely maintaining the status quo when it comes to funding and the challenges confronting the Australian community on the apprenticeship training front. The bills do nothing to address the chronic problems in the vocational education and training sector. They fail to move Australia forward. I adopt the view that unless we as a nation front up to the challenge on the education and training front we will deny ourselves the opportunities in economic growth and development that will exist in the future. 
Australia must invest in education and training if it is to have any future as a nation. That is the view not only of those who are prepared to think about our future but also of a number of leading international commentators. I remind the House of the comment made by Rupert Murdoch in the lead-up to the 2001 election that Australia needed to do more on the education and training front to secure its future. It was a rallying cry to politicians of all political persuasions to front up to their responsibilities on the education and training front. In that context, it is also my very firm view that for far too long we as a nation have focused all too often on university opportunities rather than the TAFE opportunities that are presented through the workings of ANTA. We must take Australia forward. That means that we must not only invest more in education and training but also take our responsibilities for apprenticeship training more seriously. 
My problem this evening is that I believe that the bills before the House fail to recognise that Australia has a rapidly changing work force that is increasingly dependent on highly skilled workers. That also reminds me of the fact that it was this government that walked away from the practice of the previous department of employment of producing a fairly regular statement which analysed the position of the Australian work force at a particular point in time. Those studies of the Australian work force were very important for both current and future needs, not only for training but also with respect to the career choices that young people are forced to make sooner rather than later in this day and age.
I am pleased to say that when I was the shadow minister for employment and training, the Labor Party commissioned one of those reports, entitled Workforce 2010. It built on the work done by the then minister for employment, Simon Crean, in a report entitled Australia's workforce 2005: jobs for the future, which was prepared prior to our losing government in 1996. I make a plea to the government of the day to take seriously the work done previously in work force planning and to return to some of that spadework which is of fundamental importance to work force planning and training in Australia. It is important not only for industry but also for our young people and their parents.
As we all appreciate, people in the Australian work force require skills on entry and updated skills throughout their working life. Universities cannot be left alone to help provide these skills, nor—as the minister would have us, the Australian community, believe—can the category 1 private schools. The vocational education and training sector has a significant role to play in skilling our work force. Yet this is the sector that the minister for education has completely ignored. To fulfil the need for increased skill levels within the Australian work force, more people need access to higher level vocational education and training, especially New Apprenticeships. Let us actually consider this evening what is happening on the ground. The minister lectures us on a regular basis in question time that the number of people in training is at record high levels. Raw numbers might suggest that is actually the case, but this follows sustained levels of growth throughout the 1990s of approximately five per cent per year. What the minister fails to tell the Australian community, in his dorothy dixers in question time, is that growth has not been sustained. Those are the facts. The growth in vocational education and training in Australia has not been sustained. The truth is that over the last year this growth has slowed.
Continued growth and higher skill levels are necessary for this nation. Unfortunately, the minister clearly does not recognise this, probably because he has no interest in or understanding of the sector. In contrast, the opposition has demonstrated time and time again a clear understanding of the need for a greater focus on the future skills needs of the Australian community. This is why the Leader of the Opposition, Simon Crean, and our shadow minister for employment, education and training have announced that Labor in government would fund 20,000 new full- and part-time places at TAFE. As someone committed to apprenticeship training in Australia, I am delighted by that announcement. New places that actually grow access to vocational education and training are of fundamental importance to my electorate, an electorate in which I have a huge challenge to actually get young people to stay at school until years 10, 11 and 12, let alone think about the opportunities of university. To me, additional TAFE places represent the greatest chance for numerous people in my electorate to try to get their children to remain at school to complete years 10, 11 and 12, to apprenticeship at school and to hopefully eventually conclude an apprenticeship, having completed school. 
This is about trying to tailor the education system to the needs of our young people, working hand in glove with the school system and also meeting the needs of employers and industry in Australia. Those new places are of fundamental importance to our future as a nation, and this announcement by the Leader of the Opposition, Simon Crean, confirms Labor's commitment not only to the university sector but, more importantly in my mind, also to the vocational education and training sector, the neglected second-class cousin on the training front in Australia since the election of the Howard government in 1996. It is only Labor that has promised these places and it is only Labor that will deliver them. Only Labor will form with the state and territories the real partnerships that are necessary. Continued blaming and point scoring by the current Howard government with respect to state and territory governments, for federal policy paralysis, will not deliver the important enhancements necessary for the VET sector. This commitment by the opposition is in stark contrast to the policies of the minister for education and the coalition government, the government's focus being entirely on universities and category 1 private schools.
In the few moments that are available to me this evening, I also think it is important that we do not focus just on the issue of pure numbers. I believe that the minister has never stopped to ask if apprenticeships and traineeships are in the right areas or if they are for the right skills, which goes back to Workforce 2005, which was a very important document in terms of the skills development of Australia, and the decision by the Howard government to cease to produce similar reports. That brings me to the fact that, whilst this government crows about the number of new apprenticeships, our nation's regions recognise that this is just a smokescreen. Our regions can see that the numbers of people trained in the traditional trades have diminished in areas such as plumbing, carpentry, bricklaying, boilermaking and hairdressing, to name a few. Our regions are being hindered in their growth because people with the skills needed are not available. If members on the other side of the chamber do not believe this then they should get out more and consult their communities. I know that cockies corner has had a meeting this evening to consider the future of their leader. They should get out of their offices and talk to people in rural and regional Australia, as I do. Businesses are choosing to locate where they have the best chance of attracting skilled workers. More often than not the skilled workers can be found in capital cities and the high-growth regions on the south-east coastline. Inland regions are losing businesses. They are losing opportunities. They are also falling further and further behind. 
Proof can be found in the recently released Regional Business Development Analysis which was commissioned by the Minister for Transport and Regional Services. This independent review highlights the need for coordinated government action to provide flexible access to skills development and training in rural and regional Australia. It highlights the concern that the national vocational education and training system is inadequately meeting the needs of a significant section of its market in regional Australia. It confirms Labor's view that vocational education and training in regional Australia is inadequate. It reinforces the inadequacy of the federal government decision to privatise the coordination and promotion of apprenticeships and traineeships training, a decision that has narrowed choice and reduced services in nonmetropolitan areas. The privately operated but publicly funded New Apprenticeships centres only concentrate on promoting apprenticeships and traineeships that will return the greatest profit for them. They will not deliver services to the businesses or industries outside their core services. Once again, with this government and its citycentric economic policies, it is people outside the capital cities who are the losers. Employers, young people hoping to gain a trade and existing workers looking to increase their skills who live and work in regional Australia are missing out. These are the same people who will suffer the consequences of many of this government's policies, such as the full privatisation of Telstra. 
I also want to note this evening that with the ANTA bill it is proposed that the ANTA board be increased in size. I can think back to when ANTA was originally established. Its establishment followed detailed negotiations by the then government with state governments of a variety of political persuasions. In establishing the ANTA board, it was understood that we had to try and do something special to take forward apprenticeship training in Australia. It was also understood that those who were offered appointment to the ANTA board had a great opportunity to actually do something about apprenticeship training in Australia. It was understood that, if you chose to accept that offer of a very privileged position, you accepted it on the basis that you were prepared to leave your traditional position or the constituency that you traditionally represented outside the meetings of the board of ANTA. I only hope that with the expansion of the ANTA board this evening we are not walking away from the original intent going to the establishment of the ANTA board. 
I am pleased to say that when the ANTA board was originally established I was invited to join it. But for a variety of reasons, including the fact that money was involved for serving on the board, I chose to reject that invitation. As President of the ACTU I never accepted the offer of a board position which involved additional money, because I always worked on the basis of `one person, one job' and that you should never accept board positions which paid additional remuneration. Therefore, I just reinforce this evening that, with the expansion of the board, those who might be chosen to actually serve on that board should return to the original thinking going to the establishment of ANTA. It is about what we can do on the training front. We do not go to those boardrooms with the additional baggage of the constituencies that we have traditionally represented. Apprenticeship training in Australia is too important for that. We have huge skill shortages in Australia at the moment, especially in the traditional trades. The onus today is on the Commonwealth and the state governments in association with the territories to put aside some of the points scoring that is occurring at the moment. In Australia we have major apprenticeship and trade shortages, and we all lose as a result of that. I simply say that, whilst I have some serious concerns about the lack of additional funding, the government has made its decision and it is now for us as a community to try to make it work.  
In terms of the future of apprenticeship training, the passing of these bills is obviously a necessary step to ensure that states are able to access supplementation of Commonwealth funding; I therefore support their passage. However, I fully support the second reading amendment to be moved by the member for Grayndler and I condemn the government over its misleading statements about future funding levels for the new ANTA agreement. There is nothing new. They basically represent a continuation of the existing funding commitment. I commend the second reading amendment to the House but, in doing so, indicate that I only wish there was additional funding. We have huge skill shortages in Australia. We need to get more people in the ANTA sector and more people in the apprenticeship sector. Basically we need to say to Australia at large that doing an apprenticeship is just as important as going to university and becoming a doctor, a lawyer, a nurse or a member of any other profession. For too long apprentices have been ignored. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Hull, Kay, MP",NP,2003-09-08,"—In rising to speak in the debate on the Australian National Training Authority Amendment Bill 2003 and the related bill, I can only say to the member for Batman, `Hear, hear!' It is about time that the Labor Party considered TAFE and apprenticeships as being part of education—something that has been significantly lacking in the way in which it has dealt with the higher education bill in recent weeks. The member for Batman speaks of the National Party not being in touch. I cannot understand that type of comment when Labor Party policy supports a 300 per cent increase in TAFE fees—and this is where apprenticeships are delivered. It is obvious—and I am not surprised—that the member for Batman does not realise apprenticeships are actually dealt with under a TAFE structure. He stands in this chamber and talks about the National Party losing touch and about his visits into the rural constituency but does not recognise that the rural constituency's apprenticeships are delivered through TAFE, whose fees have spiralled—there now being a 300 per cent increase in fees for moving into an apprenticeship in TAFE.
And that is not all. Centralisation is now being looked at. The member for Batman talked about rural and regional areas needing skills and needing jobs, and yet here we have Minister Refshauge looking at turning the TAFE education system into eight super regions. He is looking at centralising them in the cities, taking them away from the country areas where they are now delivering work and workplace based training. Suddenly, when they are starting to work well with employers and delivering the apprenticeships that are needed on the floor, Labor determines to centralise them into eight super city based regions. I find it absolutely amazing that the member for Batman can come into this House and talk about how in touch he is with rural issues. If that is in touch, give me the National Party any day—National Party delivery of absolute commitment to rural people.",REPS,<title>VOCATIONAL EDUCATION AND TRAINING FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,22,1,speech
"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,2003-09-08,"—I rise to draw this parliament's attention to the chronic shortage of child-care places in the electorate of Greenway and other Western Sydney electorates. This is an issue I have spoken of on a number of occasions in this parliament, but it appears that the problem still exists.
If you take the figures produced at the Senate estimates committee in June this year, you will find that the number of places requested for outside school hours care in the Blacktown local government area numbered some 1,090—well in excess of any other area in New South Wales or Australia. The next highest is 590 in the neighbouring area of Holroyd—not quite half the Blacktown number. This is not surprising when you consider that the number of new dwellings approved for building by Blacktown council so far this year is 1,056. Since June 1998, five years ago, that number has risen to 10,727. Most of these new dwellings would house two-income families with small children, where parents are paying a large mortgage and child care is essential.
David Wilson, the Vice-President of the Quality Child Care Association of New South Wales, has said there is a shortage of care for the zero-to-two age group in Blacktown, Parramatta and Penrith. A spokesman for Blacktown council has confirmed the limited vacancies for babies in this age group, saying that Blacktown council has approved seven new child-care centres in the past 12 months, while a further two are still awaiting approval. In all, there are 76 child-care centres in Blacktown city, and 24 of these are run by council. But demand is still not being met.
The electorate of Greenway has the third largest population in the zero-to-four age group, behind the electorates of Chifley and Werriwa. These are all Western Sydney electorates and that again emphasises the child-care needs of the region. One of the Blacktown local papers has highlighted the plight of one working mother, Diana, who is a qualified accountant desirous of placing her three young children in day care. After a four-month wait, Diana was able to find a place one day a week for her four-year-old son, Stephen, although she really needed two days. Her younger daughter is still on the waiting list at three centres, and Diana has been told that a space may not come up until early next year. Diana's youngest daughter is expected to face a longer wait, because she falls into that higher demand age group of zero to two. The prospect that this young mother will have to place her three young children in different child-care centres emphasises the stress that this shortage of child-care places is having on young families in the electorate.
A reporter from our local paper, the Blacktown Advocate, was told by a spokesman for the minister that the answer to the shortage was more child-care workers to meet demand. This would be only part of the solution. There are a number of problems with this overly simplified approach. First of all, child-care numbers in centres are determined largely on the amount of physical space available, not by the number of workers employed. If there is not enough space then another worker will not help to increase the numbers. Secondly, the question of cost comes into it. As I have said, many of the young families in my area have very large mortgages and cannot necessarily afford a non-subsidised place. More money is needed to increase the child-care benefits for parents.
The third problem with this sweeping statement is the difficulty of retaining staff at child-care centres. This was highlighted by a report prepared by the Western Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils, WSROC, called Where are the staff going?, released in July of last year. The study focused on three main issues: why teachers and directors were leaving child-care centres, where they were going and what would encourage them to stay. The report questioned staff who were not planning to leave the industry, staff who were planning to leave the industry and, most importantly, staff who had already left the industry. Overwhelmingly, in all three groups the issue of most contention was pay and conditions. The lack of career progression was also a factor in many workers' decisions to leave. Without addressing the problems outlined in the WSROC report, we will make no progress towards fixing the underlying problem associated with this lack of appropriate child care in our communities in Western Sydney.

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2003-09-08," asked the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 14 November 2002:
Has his attention been drawn to the assertion that claims made during the last election campaign that asylum seekers threw their children overboard were in breach of section 329 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act in that they deceived and misled electors prior to the casting of votes; if so, will the Government urge an investigation into possible breach of the law; if not, why not.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title>,<title>Immigration: Asylum Seekers</title>,Answers to Questions in Writing,24,1,question
