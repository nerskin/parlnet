Mr JENKINS
 (Scullin) (09:09):  Madam Deputy Speaker, in the spirit of the member for Braddon, I wish you a good morning, and may you have a top day in the carrying out of your duties today.


On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, I present the committee's report entitled Examination of legislation in accordance with the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011:bills introduced 18-29 June 2012.


In accordance with standing order 39(f) the report was made a parliamentary paper.




Mr JENKINS:
  by leave—In tabling the first report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights of 2012 I would like to take this opportunity to draw the attention of the House to the approach the committee has adopted in examining each of the bills referred to in this report. Members will recall that the committee is established under the Human Rights (Parliamentary Scrutiny) Act 2011 to examine and report to parliament on the compatibility of bills and legislative instruments with Australia's human rights obligations under seven core human rights treaties specified in section 3 of the act.


The committee is able to examine existing legislation and conduct broad inquiries into matters relating to human rights as referred to it by the Attorney-General. Before discussing the committee's consideration of bills in this report, I would like to emphasise the significance that the committee attaches to the statement of compatibility.


As I said in my statement to the House on 20 June this year, the committee views statements of compatibility as a key element in the parliament's consideration of human rights in the legislative process. The requirement for each new bill and each legislative instrument to be accompanied by a statement of compatibility has the potential to significantly increase transparency and accountability in the development of policy and legislation. It is obviously a significant starting point for the committee's consideration of bills and instruments.


The committee considers that the preparation of a statement of compatibility should be the culmination of a process that commences early in the development of policy, and not as a 'tick-box' exercise at the end. In this way, a statement of compatibility can reasonably be expected to reflect in appropriate detail the assessment of human rights that took place during the development of the policy and the drafting of the legislation. The statement of compatibility should take the objective of the proposed legislation as its point of reference, identify the rights engaged, indicate the circumstances in which the legislation may promote or limit the rights engaged and set out the justification for any limitations, in an appropriate level of detail, together with any safeguards provided in the legislation or elsewhere.


I now turn to this first report of the committee. The committee has considered 17 bills introduced during the period 18 June to 29 June 2012. Having examined these bills, the committee has approached them in the following way. Five of the bills do not engage human rights; however, one of these bills was introduced with a statement of compatibility that does not accord with the committee's expectations. The committee therefore proposes to write to the relevant minister and provide advice that it hopes will assist in the preparation of statements of compatibility of a similar nature in the future.


The committee has identified a further four bills that were each introduced with a statement of compatibility claiming the bill does not engage human rights but for which the committee considers it requires further information before it is able to form its own view. In each case the committee proposes to write to the proponent of the bill and invite them to elaborate on the information provided in the statement of compatibility.


This leaves eight bills that engage human rights. The committee has formed the view that five of these are compatible with human rights and that it requires further information to assist in its consideration of the remaining three bills.


I would like to make it clear that it is not the committee's intention to name and shame anyone in this report. I want to emphasise that at this relatively early stage in the implementation of this process the committee is committed to working con­structively with ministers, agencies and individual members and senators as they familiarise themselves with these requirements. In this context I draw your attention to a particular matter that the committee has considered in this report.


Two of the bills examined in this report contain strict liability and reverse burden offences. In each case, the statement of compatibility claims that these offences have been drafted in light of guidelines provided by the Criminal Justice Division of the Attorney-General's Department and are consistent with these guidelines. In considering this claim, the committee has not accepted at face value the inference that the guidelines themselves are fully consistent with human rights.


The committee has therefore examined the relevant part of the guidelines and is generally satisfied that strict liability and reverse-burden offences that are drafted in accordance with these guidelines are likely to be compatible with human rights. However, the committee will continue to consider such offences on a case-by-case basis.


The committee intends to adopt this approach in its consideration of all pro­visions that are said to be drafted in accord­ance with specific guidelines or drafting conventions. I therefore draw the attention of the House to the committee's consideration of the Commonwealth Government Securities Legislation Amendment (Retail Trading Bill) 2012 and the Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill 2012. I would like to emphasise that the committee considers that both of these bills are compatible with human rights.


In closing, I would like to take this opportunity to once again place on record my thanks to the deputy chair, the member for Hasluck, and other members of the committee for the constructive and collegial approach to the committee's work. I also indicate the committee's thanks to the very small secretariat that supports us under secretary Jeanette Radcliffe, and thank them for the efforts in this very early stage of establishing the committee. I say to you, Madam Deputy Speaker, that members and senators should be aware that there is great interest in the work of this committee, from a wide-ranging stakeholder base; that there is a lot of onus on us as members of the committee, as individual members and senators, of executive government, through ministers and the bureaucracy, to ensure that the intentions of the legislation for proper parliamentary scrutiny of human rights is put in place, is sustainable and is credible. I thank the House.

"Chester, Darren, MP",Nats,2012-08-22,"



Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland) (09:17):  Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I take pleasure in joining in the debate on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 2012. As other speakers from this side of the chamber have indicated, the legislation proposed by the government makes a series of minor, technical amendments to various pieces of legislation which affect veterans. It is non-controversial in nature and the coalition intends to support the measures contained within it.


But there is another aspect to the legislation, and amendment put forward by the member for Fadden, which is somewhat more controversial and has been the subject of great debate, both in this place and in the broader community. We believe there is an opportunity before the House today to make this legislation better, and the coalition is seeking to do so. We are seeking to legislate for fair indexation as a requirement for the passing of this legislation. As a member who represents a large constituency of Defence Force personnel, with the RAAF base at East Sale, and also as a member who regularly attends Anzac Day services and participates in a whole range of activities in commemoration of the service provided by men and women of the armed forces throughout Australia's history, I believe very strongly in the unique nature of military service—as I believe those opposite do. Australia's service personnel, the men and women both past and present, have given an enormous amount to our nation. I believe that they deserve to live out their lives in the knowledge that they have financial security. And that is the very essence of the amendments put forward by the member for Fadden and supported so strongly by members on this side of the House.


As I said, the bill before the House makes a number of important legislative changes, which the coalition will support. However, we believe that the government has the opportunity now to introduce fair, just and equitable arrangements for military superannuants.


We are in a position in this place to make a very real difference here today. The time for fair indexation has come, and it is time this parliament delivered it. I am sure members and senators on both sides would be very much aware of the ongoing campaign by individuals and veterans groups regarding this important issue. There would not be a member in this place who has not been approached by a veterans group expressing concerns with the current situation. The coalition has committed itself to beginning the process of military superannuation reform. That is why the coalition made the commitment, more than two years ago now, to provide fair indexation for Defence Forces Retirement Benefits and Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme superannuation pensioners.


The coalition's commitment will see DFRB and DFRDB military superannuation pensions being indexed in the same manner as the aged and service pensions. This commitment will benefit in the order of 57,000 ex-service men and women and their families. It concerns me that as we stand here today, and as I speak to the chamber, the coalition—the Nationals and the Liberal Party—are the only parties in the Australian parliament that have shown their commitment to fair indexation of DFRB and DFRDB military superannuation pensions. To be fair, there are members from other parties and within the ranks of the crossbenchers who have expressed strong support for the position taken by the veteran community. But, as we stand here today, only the Liberals and National Party members are prepared to actually vote in support of this measure. It remains to be seen what happens when the crossbenchers enter the parliament later on today.


To show why this is important, I would like to refer to a very practical example in my own electorate. As I said, I have had the chance to meet with members of the veteran community in the Gippsland region, who have expressed their concerns with the current situation. To say that they are angry and disappointed would probably be an understatement. A typical letter is the one I have here from a Mr Ken Phelps in Traralgon, who outlines the process as it currently stands and then goes on to say:


The purpose of pension indexation is to maintain the purchasing power of our pension. Until 1997 CPI was considered the relevant index but the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) concluded that 'the tight nexus between movements in the CPI and wage and salary adjustments no longer exists.' In 2001 ABS said that '… CPI is not a measure of the cost of living.'


It goes on to say:


In 1997 the Government acted to maintain the purchasing power of Age and other Welfare pensions by changing indexation to CPI or MTAWE whichever was the greater. More recently it included another index factor, the New Pensioner and Beneficiary Living Cost Index (PBLCI).


Nothing however has been done for Military Superannuants, even though a number of Senate inquiries have recommended a form of wage-based indexation be introduced.


And:


Military retirement and disability pensions now stand out as being more harshly treated than almost every other long-term Commonwealth payment that is subject to regular indexing to maintain its value.


Mr Phelps goes on to say, in conclusion:


Service in the ADF is unique and it must be treated that way. It is the military who use every firepower resource available to kill or capture the enemy. The military endure the greatest hardships and it is the military who give up their personal freedoms to carry out the Government's orders. We must not contaminate the uniqueness of military service by including other non-military members or organisations. If the DFRDB superannuants are treated separately funds could be available to provide a higher benchmark for indexation.


Mr Phelps attached his DFRDB benefit statement from 20 June 2012. It is the most bizarre situation of all that we have Mr Phelps receiving a statement saying that his fortnightly pension increase is going to be the princely sum of 62c. He is going to receive a pension increase of 62c. And I can only describe as bizarre that the end result for Mr Phelps is that, because he gets tipped into another tax bracket, he actually ends up being worse off. His net fortnightly payment drops by $23.38.


So I have written to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Mr Snowdon, on this matter to explain the situation, and I attached the documentation to go with it. I wanted to make the case on behalf of one constituent of mine—and there are about 20 who have contacted me on this issue—that we have people like Mr Phelps who rightly feel aggrieved that they are actually going to be worse off under the current arrangements. He is concerned that he and his fellow military superannuants are being unfairly penalised at a time when everyone in the community appreciates the cost-of-living increases and other increases related to government policy, such as the carbon tax. The military superannuation is simply not keeping up with those costs. I have written to the minister and sought his advice on that matter, and I look forward to hearing what he has to say.


I have another example that concerns a veteran named Ralph Faber, from Stratford, who in an email to me puts it somewhat more dryly. He writes:


A few weeks ago I told my good wife that when 1 July comes we would get an increase in our DFRDB pension. I salivate at the prospect of no longer having to share our one serving (two slices) of raisin toast with our coffees.


Well, notification arrived today and advised that I will receive the princely increase of 88 cents … that's right, 88 bloody cents. Even a mini dim sim costs a dollar. 88 cents … that is about as useful as being the world's tallest midget. Oh well … back to sharing the raisin toast.


At least Ralph has kept his sense of humour, but I believe he has every right to be angry, frustrated and disappointed with the current situation. I appreciate that in the contributions from those opposite they have asked why we did not fix this situation, given that we had the opportunity during more than 11 years in government. Perhaps that is a valid argument. I think I heard the minister himself make that argument. Perhaps we could have done better in that regard.


But we stand here today trying to make an improvement to the situation. We have the capacity in this place to actually make a difference for people like Ken and Ralph and about 20 other people in my electorate who have directly contacted me on behalf of other ex-service personnel.


The coalition has been committed to beginning the process of military superannuation reform. I am concerned that the government took a position before the 2007 election that, if not a direct promise, certainly gave a nod and a wink to the veterans community that the government would be taking action in this regard. But the government has failed repeatedly to deliver on its commitment before the 2007 election. The coalition, and I imagine every member in this place, has probably had the same experience as me in that they would have been approached by veterans, ex-servicemen and ex-servicewomen, ex-service organisations and current ADF personnel expressing concern about this issue.


I fear that not only has Labor failed veterans when it comes to military superannuation reform but if the vote does not go the way we would like it to go in the coming days and weeks this parliament will continue to fail veterans when it comes to military superannuation reform. I acknowledge that members opposite may say the cost of fair indexation is too high. But I do suggest that we have a situation where we have a government with twisted priorities in that regard. We have seen the government's home insulation debacle, whereby it cost $1 billion to put the insulation in and another $1 billion to take it out. We have seen the wastage associated with the school halls program: a $16 billion program that was not based on needs but was based on shovelling the money out the door to provide some level of economic stimulus. Even Ken Henry admitted as much as a year or two later that the first priority was not to achieve value for money for taxpayers' dollars—which I found to be quite a staggering admission. So we had the wastage associated with that program and the home insulation debacle, and right now as the government attempts to recover its position in the polls we are seeing $36 million being spent on carbon tax propaganda. So we are telling veterans that we cannot afford to assist them with fair and equitable indexation of their superannuation payments but we can afford to find $36 million for a carbon tax propaganda campaign. That is a government with a twisted set of priorities.


The cost to the Commonwealth of fair indexation over the next four years is something on the order of $100 to $150 million. It is not the inflated $1.7 billion that the Labor Party claims. I think the minister should be honest with the veterans community in that regard. The coalition has already come up with savings proposals in terms of how you could find the funds necessary to implement this important change. As we have this debate I want to stress that there does not appear to be any philosophical divide in this chamber in relation to this issue. There are members opposite who we know want to do the right thing by our veterans. Also, members of the cross bench have indicated they want to do the right thing by our veterans. I note that in his speech even the member for Eden-Monaro—and I acknowledge his service to our nation in the armed forces—after going through his attack lines on the coalition concluded with what I would say was quite a remarkable statement on the coalition's commitment to fair and equitable arrangements for military superannuants. I will quote the last line from the member for Eden-Monaro's comments:


I am intent on actually delivering a result. I really believe we can do this, we can find a way to do it, and I will never cease my efforts to achieve an outcome in this respect. I am committed to work for as long as it takes to achieve that result.


I say to my good friend and electoral neighbour the member for Eden-Monaro that this is exactly what we are attempting to do today. The member for Eden-Monaro can actually help us achieve the result he so obviously believes in and spoke about in his own contribution in this place.


So there is no philosophical divide on this. This is about the government being prepared to make this a priority, to find the savings, if necessary, to support our veteran community and to recognise the extraordinary contribution they have made to our nation and the uniqueness of the service they have provided to our country. There is no philosophical divide. If we want to find the money, we can find the money and we can provide a fairer outcome for our veteran community. 


In conclusion, as I said, the coalition announced this fair indexation commitment more than two years ago, in June 2010. We have been strong and consistent in our support for veterans and in our advocacy on this issue in the chamber and in the wider community. Our commitment extended fair indexation to superannuants aged 55 and over to DFRB and DFRDB scheme members. Under a Liberal-National government their pensions will be indexed in the same manner as age and service pensions. We took that commitment to the 2010 election. 


It is history now that we did not quite achieve a majority or secure the opportunity to govern with the crossbenchers. Despite losing that election we introduced our legislation to the Senate on 18 November 2010 to provide fair, just and equitable indexation for DFRB and DFRDB military superannuants. There have been already more than half a dozen inquiries, all of which supported our approach towards fair indexation. 


As I have stressed in my contribution here this morning, there is no philosophical divide on this issue. There are members opposite who strongly believe in what we are trying to do. There are members on the crossbench who strongly believe in what we are trying to do. And, of course, members of the Liberal and National parties are also advocating very fiercely on this issue. The time for action on this important issue is now. 


In closing, I would simply like to congratulate the member for Fadden for his dogged pursuit on behalf of the veteran community. I thank the House.

"Baldwin, Bob, MP",LP,2012-08-22,"



Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson) (09:32):  I rise to speak on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 2012. This bill seeks to make some minor measures and amendments to legislation affecting our veterans and ex-servicepeople. Most importantly, the bill seeks to clarify the arrangements regarding the payment of travel expenses for treatment under the Veterans' Entitlement Act and the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests (Treatment) Act. It also makes exemptions from income tax for reimbursements under the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, MRCA Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, and the new Veterans' Pharmaceutical Reimburse­ment Scheme. The bill also exempts bereavement payments in respect of Indigenous veterans or members from social security income tests. However, as welcome as these amendments are, I, in concert with my coalition colleagues, believe that they do not go far enough. As I said back in May 2010 when I spoke on the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Income Support Measures) Bill:


This government seems to believe that tinkering on the edges of policy development and introducing administration bill after administration bill on veterans' affairs issues are wholesale substitutes for policy reform. It is disappointing that I again stand here and debate yet another bill that fails to deal with the No. 1 issue that affects our veteran community, an issue that the then Rudd and now Gillard Labor Party said prior to the 2007 election it would fix.


I speak about the promise to fix the indexation of military superannuation pensions. It is as live an issue today as it was back then—perhaps even more so. However, before I address the indexation issue I want to address the issue of the Veterans' Pharmaceutical Reimbursement Scheme. For those who do not remember, this government went to the 2007 election with much fanfare, promising our ex-service community a Veterans' Pharmaceutical Reimbursement Scheme. As with so many of their promises which they had failed to deliver during their first term of office, they then took the scheme for a second time to the 2010 election. However, what was eventually delivered—by regulation I might add, not by legislation in this parliament—was a poor imitation of what had been initially promised and it has not been widely welcomed by the veteran and ex-service community.


The wholesale changes that the veteran community were expecting after the promises made by Labor at the 2007 and 2010 elections and since then have simply failed to materialize. Like the Rudd government before it, the Gillard Labor government promised much to the veteran community but have repeatedly failed to deliver, due to their own self-interest and poll-driven policy paralysis.


Like the government, the coalition also promised a veterans' pharmaceutical reimbursement scheme at the 2010 election. However, unlike the government scheme, which only gave those veterans with qualifying service and in receipt of a disability pension help with their out-of-pocket expenses, the coalition promised that all veterans and ex-service people in receipt of disability pension paid above 50 per cent of the general rate would qualify for the scheme. The coalition believes the govern­ment's Veterans' Pharmaceutical Reimburse­ment Scheme creates two classes of disabled veterans and is unfair, to say the least. More importantly, it means that 1,500 of our most disabled ex-servicemen who receive a disability pension are not eligible for the scheme. The coalition during Senate estimates asked the government for the advice used to introduce the scheme by regulation, which it has refused to provide. It is for this reason that we on this side of the House have introduced amendments to this bill to correct what we perceive as a flaw in the scheme that was introduced by regulation.


Saturday was the 46th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan. As I said at the two Vietnam Veteran Day ceremonies I attended in my electorate in the Medowie and Forster, the day was an opportunity to pause, reflect and remember the sacrifice over 10 years between 1962 and 1972 of nearly 60,000 Australians who served in the Vietnam War. Throughout the campaign 521 were killed in action and more than 3,000 were wounded. For many Vietnam veterans, Australia's involvement in the war is as vivid and fresh today as it was all those years ago, even though the conflict for all intents and purposes ended 39 years ago. General Westmoreland, the commander of US forces in Vietnam, said of the Australian troops at an Anzac Day service, 'I have never seen a finer group of men. I have never fought with a finer group of soldiers.' Yet their return home was not a happy one for the Vietnam War had divided our nation. There were no welcome home matches, no garlands placed around their shoulders, no tributes to their gallantry. Many have told me of the hardships they faced and the feelings of rejection and alienation from a nation that was looking to put the Vietnam War behind it. 


Passing this legislation with the coalition's amendments would be a significant win for our veterans. The RSL has already called for the abolition of out-of-pocket pharmaceutical expenses for all veterans, something that has also been supported by Legacy, the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia and Vietnam Veterans Federation of Australia. This would be a strong step in that direction.


Recently the House paid tribute to the service of Sergeant Blaine Diddams, whose parents, Peter and Cath, live in Pacific Palms in my electorate. He was tragically killed on 2 July during an engagement with insurgents on his seventh tour of operation in Afghanistan. As a member of the Special Operations Task Group from the Special Air Service Regiment, he was a true hero who leaves behind a wife and two children. Working so closely together in the services, mateship is like no other. This is something we were reminded of in the family statement on Sergeant Diddams' death, which read, 'His mates really became members of our family and the men he stood side-by-side with in the SASR were his brothers in every sense of the word.' His death again brought home to me the sacrifices our soldiers today are prepared to make for our country and those that our veterans have made from lines that run from Gallipoli through Kokoda to also reach into Long Tan and Tarin Kowt. 


As my phone call expressing my deepest condolences over the loss of their son drew to a close, I asked what I could do to help the family. Sergeant Diddams' father Peter, himself a Vietnam veteran who retired in 1998, simply asked that I should do all I could to look after our troops. We should never forget the sacrifice of all 33 of the Australians who have died in Afghanistan and neither should we forget the troops who have died in all conflicts that our nation has been involved in, from the first Australian soldiers killed in South African wars in the last years of the 19th century to recent operations in Afghanistan. However, we can honour their memory by looking after all of those veterans who have returned. Today we recognise that the way the Vietnam veterans came home at the end of that conflict was not our country's finest hour. It is therefore time to heed Sergeant Diddams' father's call to look after our troops and honour all veterans. 


As I alluded to earlier, the number one issue for our veteran community is to achieve a fair indexation for the 57,000 military superannuants and their families, something the coalition is determined to see happen. That is why the coalition will support this legislation while seeking to introduce two significant amendments.


The fair indexation of military superannuation has been an ongoing campaign, most notably by the Alliance of Defence Service Organisations and the Defence Force Welfare Organisation campaign, which calls for a fair go.


In this House we have all received ongoing correspondence on this matter. I have received hundreds of emails and letters from many of my constituents regarding the paltry increases in the DFRDB pensions this year. Dave from Medowie asked: 


I notice from the news that the federal MPs will receive a three per cent pay increase, which is the second in three months. This news came to me the same day that I was advised from DFRDB that my pension would increase by 0.1 per cent for the year. How is it that your pay increase is by a factor of 30 compared to mine?


Brian from Raymond Terrace wrote:


I received my DFRDB update that informed me the CPI had risen by 0.1 per cent, thus raising my pension by 66 cents. With the carbon tax and increasing costs on everyday essentials this seems bizarre in the extreme. Can you look into this unfair and possibly discriminatory action, not just for me but for all military pensioners?


Ernie from Salt Ash wrote:


After 20 years service to queen and country I received my six-monthly self-funded update of that pension. It was 0.1 per cent. This equates to 86 cents per fortnight until the next CPI increase. I feel insulted and sad.


Ernie concluded by asking, 'Is there no way that the subject can be raised again?' Well, Ernie, like all DFRDB recipients in my electorate Paterson—indeed, across our nation—you deserve better. I believe, as do my coalition colleagues, that it is not acceptable for parliamentarians to bestow upon themselves pay increases, whether awarded by an independent body or otherwise, without looking after those veterans, such as Dave, Ernie and Brian, who have served our nation in a much greater capacity.


Veterans' organisations have also been making strong representations on this issue. The submission to the Senate committee on the coalition's Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Amendment (Fair Indexation) Bill 2010 by the Alliance of Defence Service Organisations noted:


In no other calling, occupation or profession has the State the power to accept or demand the surrender of these rights [Universal Human Rights]. The Unique Nature of Military Service deserves unique solutions and also places a great burden on the Government as the “employer” to ensure that ADF members are looked after both during and after Service.


The submission by the Returned and Services League of Australia, the RSL, further argues that the differences between the legislation for military superannuation schemes and other Commonwealth superannuation schemes is a policy aberration. It says:


An examination of legislation for the Australian Defence Force shows that in almost all respects, the Parliament has been consistent since Federation in regarding the nation's armed forces as a separate and quite distinctly different part of Australian society.


I have been calling for indexation for some time now. In fact, prior to the last election my colleague Louise Markus, who is now the member for Macquarie, and I developed the policy to increase the DFRDB that was taken to the election. We feel very strongly about this issue. That is why I am delighted the coalition have heard these calls and have responded, as we are doing here today. 


The coalition is committed to seeing the DFRB and the DFRDB military superannuation pensions being indexed in the same manner as the aged pensions. Last year, in Melbourne, the Leader of the Opposition recommitted—to our last election campaign commitment—to fairly index the DFRB and the DFRDB. This was during his address to the RSL national conference. In fact, he signed a pledge this March to deliver fair indexation.


The government has not yet responded. On the same day that our side recommitted to providing veterans with fair indexation, the Treasurer rejected it outright. Labor is also still to respond to the Podger review on military superannuation, despite having had four years to do so. Labor should do better than let its wasteful and reckless spending erode veterans' pensions even further by not supporting the coalition's fair indexation amendment.


Military superannuants should not have to wait for a coalition government to be delivered fair indexation, which is why I call upon all parliamentarians—whatever their political affiliation—to show support for our veterans by supporting the coalition's amendments. I know that there are others outside the coalition who share our position on this matter.


On 18 May this year the member for Lyne gave notice of a motion which called for fair indexation of these pensions. Today is the day that he can join in and support the coalition and deliver on his commitment in that notice of motion. The member for Denison, back in October 2011, also spoke in favour of this measure—




Mr Katter:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Some of us do want to know whether voting for the opposition's amendment—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mrs D'Ath
):  Order! What is your point of order? The member for Kennedy will get his time to speak shortly.




Mr Katter:
  will negate all the benefits that are in here.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member for Paterson has the call.




Mr BALDWIN:
  That is an unusual interjection from a preposterous fool. The member for Denison, back in October 2011, also spoke in favour—




Mr Snowdon:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I ask the member to withdraw that statement.




Mr BALDWIN:
  I will withdraw, for the expediency of the House. The member for Denison, back in October 2011, also spoke in favour of this measure.




Mr Katter:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, as I understand it, that gratuitous insult was directed at me, and I want an apology.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The statement has been withdrawn, as has been requested by the House.



Mr Katter interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Kennedy will get his time to speak very shortly.




Mr BALDWIN:
  As I said before I was interrupted, the member for Denison, back in 2011 also spoke in favour of these measures—again, this will be an opportunity to vote for what he has previously said, instead of just blatantly lining up with the government. I am sure there are others on the crossbenches who must be in favour of a better deal for our superannuants


However, these are amendments that all members of this House should be able to support. By coming together in a bipartisan manner in this House, we can show Australians that we always do the right thing by those who give so much to our nation through their service. Sergeant Diddams father, Peter, whose son made the greatest sacrifice of all, has asked us to look after those who have served our nation and returned home. By supporting these amendments we are able to do that.

Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (09:47):  We come in this place to debate, to reach an intelligent consensus. I asked the opposition spokesman a reasonable question and I got by way of reply a gratuitous insult. Let him reflect upon whether this place is a place where we have intelligent debate or whether it is a name-calling political party escapade.



Mr Baldwin interjecting—




Mr KATTER:
  I am not grandstanding; you are the one who grandstanded. Madam Deputy Speaker, would you shut him up please, so I can continue with my speech? Let me say that, when a minister or an opposition spokesman asks us to vote for a proposal, it is reasonable for us, because we have not been able to get it out of his office, to ask: 'What are the implications of the amendment he is moving? I am more than happy to take the interjections from the opposition spokesman. The question that I asked the opposition was: as we understand it, your amendment throws out all these benefits. That is the question I ask. Would someone in the opposition like to answer that?



Mr Robert interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Does the member for Fadden wish to raise a point of order?




Mr Robert:
  I am simply responding as the opposition spokesman in this area.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  No, the member does not have the call; the member for Kennedy has the call.




Mr KATTER:
  We are simply asking these people—they are not going to tell us, obviously; we ask for some information and we cannot get it off them. But, as we understand the implications of what they are doing, these benefits that are needed and wanted will not flow if the opposition gets their way. What you are looking at here is a re-run of the Malaysia solution: 'Oh, no; if we get a solution then that will not be to our political benefit.' It would be nice if they thought a little bit about the benefit to their country, and the servicemen. Quite frankly, if you are going to throw these benefits out, one would have to question your sincerity.




Mr Robert:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, a point of order on relevance: you cannot equate it with the Malaysia solution. Secondly, I misspoke—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mrs D'Ath
):  No. You have made your point of relevance. I am not going to allow the member for Fadden to enter into debate.




Mr KATTER:
  I volunteered to go to Indonesia as a lad of 18. We had to give out three telephone numbers, and we were on 24-hour call-up to go over there. I want to make the point that I do not think I was being very patriotic; I just assumed everyone was going. My logic at the time was that it was better to get in first. So I do not want to make out that I was a hero, because I most certainly was not.


My electorate takes in Townsville and has for a long time, so I am very familiar with the biggest Army base in Australia and the people who man that Army base. The family breakdowns in the Army are horrifically higher than in any other areas in Australian society. Mining is another very bad area. Because of fly-in mining, people are away from home all the time, and loneliness creates problems in family relationships. There are forced separations. There is the Child Support Agency, which makes it very easy now for a woman to leave. And then there is a very oppressive regime that falls upon the soldier, because now he has to make child support payments and is left with no money.


So when you go into the Army there is a very grave risk to your family. When you go into the Army you go and fight, and there is a grave risk to your life. We recently had probably one of the most moving events in North Queensland's history in the last 20 or 30 years: Ben Chuck's funeral. He was from a very prominent and well loved family up on the Atherton Tablelands. The Prime Minister—God bless her—and the Leader of the Opposition—God bless him—both turned up to honour a man who had given his life for his country. If you knew that family, you would never doubt for a moment that—unlike me, who joined up because everyone was joining up, not for the best of reasons—they really are very patriotic people. Ben was a very, very patriotic person. My chief of staff was at school with Ben. You would never doubt their patriotism. And they made that point that his death will not be used as an argument with respect to Afghanistan. It is the decision of our country to be there, and it is our patriotic duty to stand by our country. That is the line they took—and I hope I am interpreting that correctly.


Service men and women are just very patriotic people. They risk their life, they risk their family—out of all proportion to anyone else in our society. And because of these factors, particularly the marriage one, we have a very high attrition rate in the Army. People start thinking about it and then decide they do not want to be in the Army, so we lose people with very great attributes that our country simply cannot afford to lose. When the opposition spokesman spent his time passing gratuitous insults to me and wasting three or four minutes of his speech time—rather stupidly, I thought—I was thinking: 'Well, you were there for 12 years. If this was so dreadful and horrific and terrible, why didn't you do something about it in the 12 years you were there, as the government of Australia?' I, amongst many others, including some of your own members, were screaming for action on the indexation issue with respect to our soldiers. You stand here in a position of colossal hypocrisy, because you were there for 12 years and you did nothing about it. If these are such burning questions, were you just a bunch of numbskulls who did not understand it or were you very callous people who did not even bother about it?


The government and the opposition agree, as do the crossbenchers, although I speak for myself and not for them, that these are good moves. The people in the Army I have spoken to have advised that these are very good little things. The pharmaceuticals is one; travel is another. It sounds like a small thing but it is not. It is 20 bucks to get a taxi to go anywhere these days, and $20 is a hell of a lot of money to a veteran on a pension. To be able to do that afterwards is very important, because you get sick and you cannot ring up and get permission in a time frame that is acceptable. The bereavement payment and clean energy are very good things.. But I am not going to go through them all as other members have already done so. There are a lot of good things here.


The second reason we will be voting for this is that as we understand it—I cannot get any sense out of the opposition on this—if we vote for the opposition's amendment all of this is lost. I cannot see any purpose in losing all of this.




Mr Neville:
  That's not right, Bob.




Mr KATTER:
  The honourable member said that that is not right. Well I wish somebody on his side would explain it to us. If people are of limited ability intellectually they do not like taking interjections. I understand that. But if you are a spokesman—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member for Kennedy will resume his seat. The member for Fadden on a point of order.




Mr Robert:
  Standing order 90 requires that a member not impugn a motive upon another member. The member for Kennedy cannot say of another member that they have limited intellectual abilities.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Are you saying that you have been personally—




Mr Robert:
  No, I am stating that he cannot impugn the other member he was speaking about.




Mr KATTER:
  I retract that. I apologise for saying 'limited intellectual abilities'.


There are three options, and I think that most people probably understand this. It can be indexed on male average weekly earnings, 27.7 per cent, on the CPI or on the fairly complex pension benefit arrangement that exists at present. So, there are three different ways it can be indexed. As I understand it, the decision by successive governments—which is a good decision—is that they choose the best of those three for the Australian pensioner. All we are saying is: for heaven's sake, surely our returned servicemen should get the same treatment.


I ask the government: why wouldn't you do this for these people? I ask the minister again to put this before his government. Other crossbenchers and I will be moving legislation along these lines yet again. We plead with you to go down this path. It is not a lot of money. You have cut four thousand million dollars out of the Army budget. Surely you can give back a little bit. But you are losing very valuable personnel at present. These people suffer death on the front line defending the things we believe in, and they have family breakdowns. Really, they should be entitled to a better deal than we in this place have with our indexation arrangements or even, God bless them all, Australia's pensioners. These people should get the best deal of all, but they are not. They are getting a second-rate deal at present.


I strongly agree with the opposition on this. If they did nothing in 12 years at least they are doing something now. As to what their motives are, I am not going to impugn them for that. I am just going to say, 'Good on you, Mr Opposition. We hope that you continue to fight for the best outcome, which is simply putting them in line with all of the other pensions.' I think that is more than warranted.


I can see absolutely no point in depriving our servicemen of these benefits. It would appear to me that the opposition is doing that, and, I hate to say it, but they are doing it for political reasons. That seems to be the clear and unequivocal interpretation that I can put upon what is happening here. If I am wrong someone can come and explain it to me. I would be quite happy to listen to them.


We thank the government for these changes, but we must emphasise that there is no logic, and there most certainly is no humanity involved, in the continuing position by the government of not accepting the preferable alternative as far as indexation of the pensions goes. It is a point of view that my own party will be hammering continuously and continually. Many of the people in the services are closely associated with us and we most certainly intend to be their champions. I think that every single person here should be their champions, but for 12 years the opposition were not and for three years the government has not been. But we will be the first to congratulate either side if they move forward to a serious indexation of the pensions.


I, like many members here, am very gravely embarrassed by us getting parliamentarians' indexation through—indexation of a very generous nature—while having to face these people who have risked their lives, risked their families and sacrificed themselves in a very tough occupation for our sake. I really do think that—unlike myself—a lot of these people act out of patriotism. 

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 2012</title>,BILLS,3,1,speech
"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2012-08-22,"



Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (10:01):  I thank all of those who have contributed to this debate. I am not sure that I can agree with everyone, obviously, because, as the member for Kennedy rightly points out, if the proposal of the opposition were passed it would deprive those potential beneficiaries of the benefits contained in the amendments we are putting before the House. That, to me, is just silly. What it highlights is the political stunt that is being pulled here by the opposition to highlight an issue which they have got out of the public domain about their attitude towards DFRDB indexation. I will come to that in a moment.


What we need to do is to concentrate on this bill. The bill, as you would be aware, exempts from income tax reimbursements made under the Veterans' Pharmaceutical Reimbursement Scheme and the MRCA Pharmaceutical Reimbursement Scheme. The payments are due to commence in the first quarter of 2013, benefiting 50,000 veterans. Why should we deprive those veterans of the benefits that will flow as a result of this legislation? There is absolutely no reason for us to do so. To have this bill hijacked for a political stunt is, to my mind, something which we should be very concerned about. 


There will also be amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act to make it clear that treatment costs reimbursed under the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests (Treatment) Act are exempt from income tax. There were 155,000 claims for reimbursement processed in 2010-11. That is an important element. This will clarify administrative arrangements for the payments of travel expenses under the Veterans' Entitlements Act and the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests (Treatment) Act. There will be amendments to the Defence Service Homes Act to ensure that those with operational service as part of Operation DAMASK VI in 1993 are eligible for subsidised home loans and insurance under the act—another important benefit. 


This bill will ensure bereavement payments for funeral expenses in respect of indigent veterans or members is exempt income for the purpose of the social security income test. There are amendments to the definition of 'Australia' to authorise clean energy payments under the VEA and MRCA to residents of Norfolk Island. That is important to the residents of Norfolk Island but clearly not important to the opposition. And the bill will provide for more timely provision of special assistance under the VEA and MRCA via legislative instrument, instead of the current arrangements, which require regulation. The bill will ensure that debt recovery provisions will be applicable to all relevant provisions of the VEA, the regulations and any legislative instruments made under the VEA, and amend the MRCA to replace obsolete references to pharmaceutical allowances and telephone allowances.


There are important things. Many of them are small but they are very important to the veteran community and they should not be side-tracked and put off as a result of this stunt by the opposition to try and get us to accept an amendment which would have the House decline to consider the bill. Let us be very clear about this: whilst I appreciate the integrity of some in the debate—and I understand full well the intensity of the debate—I think we need to appreciate a number of points.


The first point is—and the member for Kennedy rightly pointed this out—the opposition did nothing during the 11 years they were in power to address the issue they now say is at the front of their minds. Why is that? Perhaps it is because the then government took a conscious decision not to do so. We know that because of a contri­bution recently made by Nick Minchin, the former finance minister, to the Australian on 2 May. In this letter to the editor, he said that this claim to change indexation:


… was properly rejected by the Howard Government, of which I was a member … There is no inherent logic to the proposition that a public sector employment-related superannuation payment should be indexed in exactly the same fashion as a means-tested welfare benefit in this case, the aged pension. 


I table that correspondence.


Let me make it very clear. One of the furphies of this debate is that somehow, by supporting this amendment by the opposition today, we should come to agree that we are equating a superannuation benefit—an employment benefit—with income support payments. How different are they?


Let me just take you through what the DFRDB scheme provides. It has generous benefits: payment of benefits on retirement after 20 years of service—I might just point out that 75 per cent of the people who are beneficiaries under the DFRDB after 20 years of service retired before their mid-forties—they are 45 before they retire—that is three-quarters of them; the ability to commute between four and five times the annual retirement pay in exchange for a reduction in retirement pay—this option has been exercised by 99 per cent of members; a higher employer contribution to other schemes, around 30 per cent from the Commonwealth, compared to the current community standard; and, since 1988, a separate three per cent productivity benefit fortnightly that is available as a lump sum on retirement. What does that mean? Let me put this in context. For example, a colonel aged 55 with 35 years of service, retiring at the beginning of 2012 would, it is estimated, receive a payment without commutation of approximately $84,000 a year. If they decided to commute a proportion of it, they would receive a lump sum of $420,000—that is, five times their annual pay—and a reduced annual payment of $64,000 per year. 


What we are being asked to do here is equate that $64,000 a year which can be received at age 55 with the income support payments made to a pensioner at age 65. They are very different. One is a superannuation benefit, a worker entitlement; the other is an income support payment. Should a former member of the Defence Force have an income below the threshold, they will be eligible for—potentially, depending on their service—a service pension at age 60 or, if not, an age pension at 65. I might also point out that this proposal being put forward by the opposition does nothing for the 150,000 service men and women who joined after 1991, who are on the MSBS payments—nothing. 


Let us be very clear about it. What we are being told here is that we should equate a superannuation benefit with an income support payment. This is not the place to have that debate. We have been diverted from discussing the intention of this legislation. It is a political stunt by the opposition to try and put off the benefits that will come as a result of this legislation if it passes through the chamber. If it does not—if we do not get this legislation through and we fall, a sop to the opposition's proposal—this House will decline to consider the bill. That will mean none of the benefits outlined in this legislation will flow on to veterans who are entitled to those benefits. Let us be very clear, this is a stunt. 



Mr Robert interjecting—




Mr SNOWDON:
  You know it is a stunt. We all know it is a stunt. There is a bit of to-ing and fro-ing as to what they mean, by the way. We have shadow minister Ronaldson's report from a meeting at Caboolture. It says that the indexation issue will be addressed in the first term. During the course of last night's debate in this chamber Wyatt Roy, the member for Longman, who was at that meeting, said that it would happen in the first budget.


Let us be very clear. There is obvious confusion. I am not sure what the message is to the veterans community, who they are going to on an almost daily basis to plead their case about this. 



Mr Robert interjecting—




Mr SNOWDON:
  I am sick and tired of listening to the banal comments coming from the opposition about this matter. We can certainly have a discussion about it, but this is not the time. We should be looking at the benefits that can accrue to veterans as a result of the legislation being put through the House. We should pass the bill and move onto the next stage of the legislation—and reject the opposition's amendment.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The question is that the amendment be agreed to.

Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland) (09:17):  Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. I take pleasure in joining in the debate on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 2012. As other speakers from this side of the chamber have indicated, the legislation proposed by the government makes a series of minor, technical amendments to various pieces of legislation which affect veterans. It is non-controversial in nature and the coalition intends to support the measures contained within it.


But there is another aspect to the legislation, and amendment put forward by the member for Fadden, which is somewhat more controversial and has been the subject of great debate, both in this place and in the broader community. We believe there is an opportunity before the House today to make this legislation better, and the coalition is seeking to do so. We are seeking to legislate for fair indexation as a requirement for the passing of this legislation. As a member who represents a large constituency of Defence Force personnel, with the RAAF base at East Sale, and also as a member who regularly attends Anzac Day services and participates in a whole range of activities in commemoration of the service provided by men and women of the armed forces throughout Australia's history, I believe very strongly in the unique nature of military service—as I believe those opposite do. Australia's service personnel, the men and women both past and present, have given an enormous amount to our nation. I believe that they deserve to live out their lives in the knowledge that they have financial security. And that is the very essence of the amendments put forward by the member for Fadden and supported so strongly by members on this side of the House.


As I said, the bill before the House makes a number of important legislative changes, which the coalition will support. However, we believe that the government has the opportunity now to introduce fair, just and equitable arrangements for military superannuants.


We are in a position in this place to make a very real difference here today. The time for fair indexation has come, and it is time this parliament delivered it. I am sure members and senators on both sides would be very much aware of the ongoing campaign by individuals and veterans groups regarding this important issue. There would not be a member in this place who has not been approached by a veterans group expressing concerns with the current situation. The coalition has committed itself to beginning the process of military superannuation reform. That is why the coalition made the commitment, more than two years ago now, to provide fair indexation for Defence Forces Retirement Benefits and Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme superannuation pensioners.


The coalition's commitment will see DFRB and DFRDB military superannuation pensions being indexed in the same manner as the aged and service pensions. This commitment will benefit in the order of 57,000 ex-service men and women and their families. It concerns me that as we stand here today, and as I speak to the chamber, the coalition—the Nationals and the Liberal Party—are the only parties in the Australian parliament that have shown their commitment to fair indexation of DFRB and DFRDB military superannuation pensions. To be fair, there are members from other parties and within the ranks of the crossbenchers who have expressed strong support for the position taken by the veteran community. But, as we stand here today, only the Liberals and National Party members are prepared to actually vote in support of this measure. It remains to be seen what happens when the crossbenchers enter the parliament later on today.


To show why this is important, I would like to refer to a very practical example in my own electorate. As I said, I have had the chance to meet with members of the veteran community in the Gippsland region, who have expressed their concerns with the current situation. To say that they are angry and disappointed would probably be an understatement. A typical letter is the one I have here from a Mr Ken Phelps in Traralgon, who outlines the process as it currently stands and then goes on to say:


The purpose of pension indexation is to maintain the purchasing power of our pension. Until 1997 CPI was considered the relevant index but the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) concluded that 'the tight nexus between movements in the CPI and wage and salary adjustments no longer exists.' In 2001 ABS said that '… CPI is not a measure of the cost of living.'


It goes on to say:


In 1997 the Government acted to maintain the purchasing power of Age and other Welfare pensions by changing indexation to CPI or MTAWE whichever was the greater. More recently it included another index factor, the New Pensioner and Beneficiary Living Cost Index (PBLCI).


Nothing however has been done for Military Superannuants, even though a number of Senate inquiries have recommended a form of wage-based indexation be introduced.


And:


Military retirement and disability pensions now stand out as being more harshly treated than almost every other long-term Commonwealth payment that is subject to regular indexing to maintain its value.


Mr Phelps goes on to say, in conclusion:


Service in the ADF is unique and it must be treated that way. It is the military who use every firepower resource available to kill or capture the enemy. The military endure the greatest hardships and it is the military who give up their personal freedoms to carry out the Government's orders. We must not contaminate the uniqueness of military service by including other non-military members or organisations. If the DFRDB superannuants are treated separately funds could be available to provide a higher benchmark for indexation.


Mr Phelps attached his DFRDB benefit statement from 20 June 2012. It is the most bizarre situation of all that we have Mr Phelps receiving a statement saying that his fortnightly pension increase is going to be the princely sum of 62c. He is going to receive a pension increase of 62c. And I can only describe as bizarre that the end result for Mr Phelps is that, because he gets tipped into another tax bracket, he actually ends up being worse off. His net fortnightly payment drops by $23.38.


So I have written to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Mr Snowdon, on this matter to explain the situation, and I attached the documentation to go with it. I wanted to make the case on behalf of one constituent of mine—and there are about 20 who have contacted me on this issue—that we have people like Mr Phelps who rightly feel aggrieved that they are actually going to be worse off under the current arrangements. He is concerned that he and his fellow military superannuants are being unfairly penalised at a time when everyone in the community appreciates the cost-of-living increases and other increases related to government policy, such as the carbon tax. The military superannuation is simply not keeping up with those costs. I have written to the minister and sought his advice on that matter, and I look forward to hearing what he has to say.


I have another example that concerns a veteran named Ralph Faber, from Stratford, who in an email to me puts it somewhat more dryly. He writes:


A few weeks ago I told my good wife that when 1 July comes we would get an increase in our DFRDB pension. I salivate at the prospect of no longer having to share our one serving (two slices) of raisin toast with our coffees.


Well, notification arrived today and advised that I will receive the princely increase of 88 cents … that's right, 88 bloody cents. Even a mini dim sim costs a dollar. 88 cents … that is about as useful as being the world's tallest midget. Oh well … back to sharing the raisin toast.


At least Ralph has kept his sense of humour, but I believe he has every right to be angry, frustrated and disappointed with the current situation. I appreciate that in the contributions from those opposite they have asked why we did not fix this situation, given that we had the opportunity during more than 11 years in government. Perhaps that is a valid argument. I think I heard the minister himself make that argument. Perhaps we could have done better in that regard.


But we stand here today trying to make an improvement to the situation. We have the capacity in this place to actually make a difference for people like Ken and Ralph and about 20 other people in my electorate who have directly contacted me on behalf of other ex-service personnel.


The coalition has been committed to beginning the process of military superannuation reform. I am concerned that the government took a position before the 2007 election that, if not a direct promise, certainly gave a nod and a wink to the veterans community that the government would be taking action in this regard. But the government has failed repeatedly to deliver on its commitment before the 2007 election. The coalition, and I imagine every member in this place, has probably had the same experience as me in that they would have been approached by veterans, ex-servicemen and ex-servicewomen, ex-service organisations and current ADF personnel expressing concern about this issue.


I fear that not only has Labor failed veterans when it comes to military superannuation reform but if the vote does not go the way we would like it to go in the coming days and weeks this parliament will continue to fail veterans when it comes to military superannuation reform. I acknowledge that members opposite may say the cost of fair indexation is too high. But I do suggest that we have a situation where we have a government with twisted priorities in that regard. We have seen the government's home insulation debacle, whereby it cost $1 billion to put the insulation in and another $1 billion to take it out. We have seen the wastage associated with the school halls program: a $16 billion program that was not based on needs but was based on shovelling the money out the door to provide some level of economic stimulus. Even Ken Henry admitted as much as a year or two later that the first priority was not to achieve value for money for taxpayers' dollars—which I found to be quite a staggering admission. So we had the wastage associated with that program and the home insulation debacle, and right now as the government attempts to recover its position in the polls we are seeing $36 million being spent on carbon tax propaganda. So we are telling veterans that we cannot afford to assist them with fair and equitable indexation of their superannuation payments but we can afford to find $36 million for a carbon tax propaganda campaign. That is a government with a twisted set of priorities.


The cost to the Commonwealth of fair indexation over the next four years is something on the order of $100 to $150 million. It is not the inflated $1.7 billion that the Labor Party claims. I think the minister should be honest with the veterans community in that regard. The coalition has already come up with savings proposals in terms of how you could find the funds necessary to implement this important change. As we have this debate I want to stress that there does not appear to be any philosophical divide in this chamber in relation to this issue. There are members opposite who we know want to do the right thing by our veterans. Also, members of the cross bench have indicated they want to do the right thing by our veterans. I note that in his speech even the member for Eden-Monaro—and I acknowledge his service to our nation in the armed forces—after going through his attack lines on the coalition concluded with what I would say was quite a remarkable statement on the coalition's commitment to fair and equitable arrangements for military superannuants. I will quote the last line from the member for Eden-Monaro's comments:


I am intent on actually delivering a result. I really believe we can do this, we can find a way to do it, and I will never cease my efforts to achieve an outcome in this respect. I am committed to work for as long as it takes to achieve that result.


I say to my good friend and electoral neighbour the member for Eden-Monaro that this is exactly what we are attempting to do today. The member for Eden-Monaro can actually help us achieve the result he so obviously believes in and spoke about in his own contribution in this place.


So there is no philosophical divide on this. This is about the government being prepared to make this a priority, to find the savings, if necessary, to support our veteran community and to recognise the extraordinary contribution they have made to our nation and the uniqueness of the service they have provided to our country. There is no philosophical divide. If we want to find the money, we can find the money and we can provide a fairer outcome for our veteran community. 


In conclusion, as I said, the coalition announced this fair indexation commitment more than two years ago, in June 2010. We have been strong and consistent in our support for veterans and in our advocacy on this issue in the chamber and in the wider community. Our commitment extended fair indexation to superannuants aged 55 and over to DFRB and DFRDB scheme members. Under a Liberal-National government their pensions will be indexed in the same manner as age and service pensions. We took that commitment to the 2010 election. 


It is history now that we did not quite achieve a majority or secure the opportunity to govern with the crossbenchers. Despite losing that election we introduced our legislation to the Senate on 18 November 2010 to provide fair, just and equitable indexation for DFRB and DFRDB military superannuants. There have been already more than half a dozen inquiries, all of which supported our approach towards fair indexation. 


As I have stressed in my contribution here this morning, there is no philosophical divide on this issue. There are members opposite who strongly believe in what we are trying to do. There are members on the crossbench who strongly believe in what we are trying to do. And, of course, members of the Liberal and National parties are also advocating very fiercely on this issue. The time for action on this important issue is now. 


In closing, I would simply like to congratulate the member for Fadden for his dogged pursuit on behalf of the veteran community. I thank the House.

"Baldwin, Bob, MP",LP,2012-08-22,"



Mr BALDWIN
 (Paterson) (09:32):  I rise to speak on the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill 2012. This bill seeks to make some minor measures and amendments to legislation affecting our veterans and ex-servicepeople. Most importantly, the bill seeks to clarify the arrangements regarding the payment of travel expenses for treatment under the Veterans' Entitlement Act and the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests (Treatment) Act. It also makes exemptions from income tax for reimbursements under the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, MRCA Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, and the new Veterans' Pharmaceutical Reimburse­ment Scheme. The bill also exempts bereavement payments in respect of Indigenous veterans or members from social security income tests. However, as welcome as these amendments are, I, in concert with my coalition colleagues, believe that they do not go far enough. As I said back in May 2010 when I spoke on the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Income Support Measures) Bill:


This government seems to believe that tinkering on the edges of policy development and introducing administration bill after administration bill on veterans' affairs issues are wholesale substitutes for policy reform. It is disappointing that I again stand here and debate yet another bill that fails to deal with the No. 1 issue that affects our veteran community, an issue that the then Rudd and now Gillard Labor Party said prior to the 2007 election it would fix.


I speak about the promise to fix the indexation of military superannuation pensions. It is as live an issue today as it was back then—perhaps even more so. However, before I address the indexation issue I want to address the issue of the Veterans' Pharmaceutical Reimbursement Scheme. For those who do not remember, this government went to the 2007 election with much fanfare, promising our ex-service community a Veterans' Pharmaceutical Reimbursement Scheme. As with so many of their promises which they had failed to deliver during their first term of office, they then took the scheme for a second time to the 2010 election. However, what was eventually delivered—by regulation I might add, not by legislation in this parliament—was a poor imitation of what had been initially promised and it has not been widely welcomed by the veteran and ex-service community.


The wholesale changes that the veteran community were expecting after the promises made by Labor at the 2007 and 2010 elections and since then have simply failed to materialize. Like the Rudd government before it, the Gillard Labor government promised much to the veteran community but have repeatedly failed to deliver, due to their own self-interest and poll-driven policy paralysis.


Like the government, the coalition also promised a veterans' pharmaceutical reimbursement scheme at the 2010 election. However, unlike the government scheme, which only gave those veterans with qualifying service and in receipt of a disability pension help with their out-of-pocket expenses, the coalition promised that all veterans and ex-service people in receipt of disability pension paid above 50 per cent of the general rate would qualify for the scheme. The coalition believes the govern­ment's Veterans' Pharmaceutical Reimburse­ment Scheme creates two classes of disabled veterans and is unfair, to say the least. More importantly, it means that 1,500 of our most disabled ex-servicemen who receive a disability pension are not eligible for the scheme. The coalition during Senate estimates asked the government for the advice used to introduce the scheme by regulation, which it has refused to provide. It is for this reason that we on this side of the House have introduced amendments to this bill to correct what we perceive as a flaw in the scheme that was introduced by regulation.


Saturday was the 46th anniversary of the Battle of Long Tan. As I said at the two Vietnam Veteran Day ceremonies I attended in my electorate in the Medowie and Forster, the day was an opportunity to pause, reflect and remember the sacrifice over 10 years between 1962 and 1972 of nearly 60,000 Australians who served in the Vietnam War. Throughout the campaign 521 were killed in action and more than 3,000 were wounded. For many Vietnam veterans, Australia's involvement in the war is as vivid and fresh today as it was all those years ago, even though the conflict for all intents and purposes ended 39 years ago. General Westmoreland, the commander of US forces in Vietnam, said of the Australian troops at an Anzac Day service, 'I have never seen a finer group of men. I have never fought with a finer group of soldiers.' Yet their return home was not a happy one for the Vietnam War had divided our nation. There were no welcome home matches, no garlands placed around their shoulders, no tributes to their gallantry. Many have told me of the hardships they faced and the feelings of rejection and alienation from a nation that was looking to put the Vietnam War behind it. 


Passing this legislation with the coalition's amendments would be a significant win for our veterans. The RSL has already called for the abolition of out-of-pocket pharmaceutical expenses for all veterans, something that has also been supported by Legacy, the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia and Vietnam Veterans Federation of Australia. This would be a strong step in that direction.


Recently the House paid tribute to the service of Sergeant Blaine Diddams, whose parents, Peter and Cath, live in Pacific Palms in my electorate. He was tragically killed on 2 July during an engagement with insurgents on his seventh tour of operation in Afghanistan. As a member of the Special Operations Task Group from the Special Air Service Regiment, he was a true hero who leaves behind a wife and two children. Working so closely together in the services, mateship is like no other. This is something we were reminded of in the family statement on Sergeant Diddams' death, which read, 'His mates really became members of our family and the men he stood side-by-side with in the SASR were his brothers in every sense of the word.' His death again brought home to me the sacrifices our soldiers today are prepared to make for our country and those that our veterans have made from lines that run from Gallipoli through Kokoda to also reach into Long Tan and Tarin Kowt. 


As my phone call expressing my deepest condolences over the loss of their son drew to a close, I asked what I could do to help the family. Sergeant Diddams' father Peter, himself a Vietnam veteran who retired in 1998, simply asked that I should do all I could to look after our troops. We should never forget the sacrifice of all 33 of the Australians who have died in Afghanistan and neither should we forget the troops who have died in all conflicts that our nation has been involved in, from the first Australian soldiers killed in South African wars in the last years of the 19th century to recent operations in Afghanistan. However, we can honour their memory by looking after all of those veterans who have returned. Today we recognise that the way the Vietnam veterans came home at the end of that conflict was not our country's finest hour. It is therefore time to heed Sergeant Diddams' father's call to look after our troops and honour all veterans. 


As I alluded to earlier, the number one issue for our veteran community is to achieve a fair indexation for the 57,000 military superannuants and their families, something the coalition is determined to see happen. That is why the coalition will support this legislation while seeking to introduce two significant amendments.


The fair indexation of military superannuation has been an ongoing campaign, most notably by the Alliance of Defence Service Organisations and the Defence Force Welfare Organisation campaign, which calls for a fair go.


In this House we have all received ongoing correspondence on this matter. I have received hundreds of emails and letters from many of my constituents regarding the paltry increases in the DFRDB pensions this year. Dave from Medowie asked: 


I notice from the news that the federal MPs will receive a three per cent pay increase, which is the second in three months. This news came to me the same day that I was advised from DFRDB that my pension would increase by 0.1 per cent for the year. How is it that your pay increase is by a factor of 30 compared to mine?


Brian from Raymond Terrace wrote:


I received my DFRDB update that informed me the CPI had risen by 0.1 per cent, thus raising my pension by 66 cents. With the carbon tax and increasing costs on everyday essentials this seems bizarre in the extreme. Can you look into this unfair and possibly discriminatory action, not just for me but for all military pensioners?


Ernie from Salt Ash wrote:


After 20 years service to queen and country I received my six-monthly self-funded update of that pension. It was 0.1 per cent. This equates to 86 cents per fortnight until the next CPI increase. I feel insulted and sad.


Ernie concluded by asking, 'Is there no way that the subject can be raised again?' Well, Ernie, like all DFRDB recipients in my electorate Paterson—indeed, across our nation—you deserve better. I believe, as do my coalition colleagues, that it is not acceptable for parliamentarians to bestow upon themselves pay increases, whether awarded by an independent body or otherwise, without looking after those veterans, such as Dave, Ernie and Brian, who have served our nation in a much greater capacity.


Veterans' organisations have also been making strong representations on this issue. The submission to the Senate committee on the coalition's Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Amendment (Fair Indexation) Bill 2010 by the Alliance of Defence Service Organisations noted:


In no other calling, occupation or profession has the State the power to accept or demand the surrender of these rights [Universal Human Rights]. The Unique Nature of Military Service deserves unique solutions and also places a great burden on the Government as the “employer” to ensure that ADF members are looked after both during and after Service.


The submission by the Returned and Services League of Australia, the RSL, further argues that the differences between the legislation for military superannuation schemes and other Commonwealth superannuation schemes is a policy aberration. It says:


An examination of legislation for the Australian Defence Force shows that in almost all respects, the Parliament has been consistent since Federation in regarding the nation's armed forces as a separate and quite distinctly different part of Australian society.


I have been calling for indexation for some time now. In fact, prior to the last election my colleague Louise Markus, who is now the member for Macquarie, and I developed the policy to increase the DFRDB that was taken to the election. We feel very strongly about this issue. That is why I am delighted the coalition have heard these calls and have responded, as we are doing here today. 


The coalition is committed to seeing the DFRB and the DFRDB military superannuation pensions being indexed in the same manner as the aged pensions. Last year, in Melbourne, the Leader of the Opposition recommitted—to our last election campaign commitment—to fairly index the DFRB and the DFRDB. This was during his address to the RSL national conference. In fact, he signed a pledge this March to deliver fair indexation.


The government has not yet responded. On the same day that our side recommitted to providing veterans with fair indexation, the Treasurer rejected it outright. Labor is also still to respond to the Podger review on military superannuation, despite having had four years to do so. Labor should do better than let its wasteful and reckless spending erode veterans' pensions even further by not supporting the coalition's fair indexation amendment.


Military superannuants should not have to wait for a coalition government to be delivered fair indexation, which is why I call upon all parliamentarians—whatever their political affiliation—to show support for our veterans by supporting the coalition's amendments. I know that there are others outside the coalition who share our position on this matter.


On 18 May this year the member for Lyne gave notice of a motion which called for fair indexation of these pensions. Today is the day that he can join in and support the coalition and deliver on his commitment in that notice of motion. The member for Denison, back in October 2011, also spoke in favour of this measure—




Mr Katter:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Some of us do want to know whether voting for the opposition's amendment—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mrs D'Ath
):  Order! What is your point of order? The member for Kennedy will get his time to speak shortly.




Mr Katter:
  will negate all the benefits that are in here.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member for Paterson has the call.




Mr BALDWIN:
  That is an unusual interjection from a preposterous fool. The member for Denison, back in October 2011, also spoke in favour—




Mr Snowdon:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I ask the member to withdraw that statement.




Mr BALDWIN:
  I will withdraw, for the expediency of the House. The member for Denison, back in October 2011, also spoke in favour of this measure.




Mr Katter:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, as I understand it, that gratuitous insult was directed at me, and I want an apology.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The statement has been withdrawn, as has been requested by the House.



Mr Katter interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Kennedy will get his time to speak very shortly.




Mr BALDWIN:
  As I said before I was interrupted, the member for Denison, back in 2011 also spoke in favour of these measures—again, this will be an opportunity to vote for what he has previously said, instead of just blatantly lining up with the government. I am sure there are others on the crossbenches who must be in favour of a better deal for our superannuants


However, these are amendments that all members of this House should be able to support. By coming together in a bipartisan manner in this House, we can show Australians that we always do the right thing by those who give so much to our nation through their service. Sergeant Diddams father, Peter, whose son made the greatest sacrifice of all, has asked us to look after those who have served our nation and returned home. By supporting these amendments we are able to do that.

Mr KATTER
 (Kennedy) (09:47):  We come in this place to debate, to reach an intelligent consensus. I asked the opposition spokesman a reasonable question and I got by way of reply a gratuitous insult. Let him reflect upon whether this place is a place where we have intelligent debate or whether it is a name-calling political party escapade.



Mr Baldwin interjecting—




Mr KATTER:
  I am not grandstanding; you are the one who grandstanded. Madam Deputy Speaker, would you shut him up please, so I can continue with my speech? Let me say that, when a minister or an opposition spokesman asks us to vote for a proposal, it is reasonable for us, because we have not been able to get it out of his office, to ask: 'What are the implications of the amendment he is moving? I am more than happy to take the interjections from the opposition spokesman. The question that I asked the opposition was: as we understand it, your amendment throws out all these benefits. That is the question I ask. Would someone in the opposition like to answer that?



Mr Robert interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Does the member for Fadden wish to raise a point of order?




Mr Robert:
  I am simply responding as the opposition spokesman in this area.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  No, the member does not have the call; the member for Kennedy has the call.




Mr KATTER:
  We are simply asking these people—they are not going to tell us, obviously; we ask for some information and we cannot get it off them. But, as we understand the implications of what they are doing, these benefits that are needed and wanted will not flow if the opposition gets their way. What you are looking at here is a re-run of the Malaysia solution: 'Oh, no; if we get a solution then that will not be to our political benefit.' It would be nice if they thought a little bit about the benefit to their country, and the servicemen. Quite frankly, if you are going to throw these benefits out, one would have to question your sincerity.




Mr Robert:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, a point of order on relevance: you cannot equate it with the Malaysia solution. Secondly, I misspoke—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mrs D'Ath
):  No. You have made your point of relevance. I am not going to allow the member for Fadden to enter into debate.




Mr KATTER:
  I volunteered to go to Indonesia as a lad of 18. We had to give out three telephone numbers, and we were on 24-hour call-up to go over there. I want to make the point that I do not think I was being very patriotic; I just assumed everyone was going. My logic at the time was that it was better to get in first. So I do not want to make out that I was a hero, because I most certainly was not.


My electorate takes in Townsville and has for a long time, so I am very familiar with the biggest Army base in Australia and the people who man that Army base. The family breakdowns in the Army are horrifically higher than in any other areas in Australian society. Mining is another very bad area. Because of fly-in mining, people are away from home all the time, and loneliness creates problems in family relationships. There are forced separations. There is the Child Support Agency, which makes it very easy now for a woman to leave. And then there is a very oppressive regime that falls upon the soldier, because now he has to make child support payments and is left with no money.


So when you go into the Army there is a very grave risk to your family. When you go into the Army you go and fight, and there is a grave risk to your life. We recently had probably one of the most moving events in North Queensland's history in the last 20 or 30 years: Ben Chuck's funeral. He was from a very prominent and well loved family up on the Atherton Tablelands. The Prime Minister—God bless her—and the Leader of the Opposition—God bless him—both turned up to honour a man who had given his life for his country. If you knew that family, you would never doubt for a moment that—unlike me, who joined up because everyone was joining up, not for the best of reasons—they really are very patriotic people. Ben was a very, very patriotic person. My chief of staff was at school with Ben. You would never doubt their patriotism. And they made that point that his death will not be used as an argument with respect to Afghanistan. It is the decision of our country to be there, and it is our patriotic duty to stand by our country. That is the line they took—and I hope I am interpreting that correctly.


Service men and women are just very patriotic people. They risk their life, they risk their family—out of all proportion to anyone else in our society. And because of these factors, particularly the marriage one, we have a very high attrition rate in the Army. People start thinking about it and then decide they do not want to be in the Army, so we lose people with very great attributes that our country simply cannot afford to lose. When the opposition spokesman spent his time passing gratuitous insults to me and wasting three or four minutes of his speech time—rather stupidly, I thought—I was thinking: 'Well, you were there for 12 years. If this was so dreadful and horrific and terrible, why didn't you do something about it in the 12 years you were there, as the government of Australia?' I, amongst many others, including some of your own members, were screaming for action on the indexation issue with respect to our soldiers. You stand here in a position of colossal hypocrisy, because you were there for 12 years and you did nothing about it. If these are such burning questions, were you just a bunch of numbskulls who did not understand it or were you very callous people who did not even bother about it?


The government and the opposition agree, as do the crossbenchers, although I speak for myself and not for them, that these are good moves. The people in the Army I have spoken to have advised that these are very good little things. The pharmaceuticals is one; travel is another. It sounds like a small thing but it is not. It is 20 bucks to get a taxi to go anywhere these days, and $20 is a hell of a lot of money to a veteran on a pension. To be able to do that afterwards is very important, because you get sick and you cannot ring up and get permission in a time frame that is acceptable. The bereavement payment and clean energy are very good things.. But I am not going to go through them all as other members have already done so. There are a lot of good things here.


The second reason we will be voting for this is that as we understand it—I cannot get any sense out of the opposition on this—if we vote for the opposition's amendment all of this is lost. I cannot see any purpose in losing all of this.




Mr Neville:
  That's not right, Bob.




Mr KATTER:
  The honourable member said that that is not right. Well I wish somebody on his side would explain it to us. If people are of limited ability intellectually they do not like taking interjections. I understand that. But if you are a spokesman—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Order! The member for Kennedy will resume his seat. The member for Fadden on a point of order.




Mr Robert:
  Standing order 90 requires that a member not impugn a motive upon another member. The member for Kennedy cannot say of another member that they have limited intellectual abilities.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Are you saying that you have been personally—




Mr Robert:
  No, I am stating that he cannot impugn the other member he was speaking about.




Mr KATTER:
  I retract that. I apologise for saying 'limited intellectual abilities'.


There are three options, and I think that most people probably understand this. It can be indexed on male average weekly earnings, 27.7 per cent, on the CPI or on the fairly complex pension benefit arrangement that exists at present. So, there are three different ways it can be indexed. As I understand it, the decision by successive governments—which is a good decision—is that they choose the best of those three for the Australian pensioner. All we are saying is: for heaven's sake, surely our returned servicemen should get the same treatment.


I ask the government: why wouldn't you do this for these people? I ask the minister again to put this before his government. Other crossbenchers and I will be moving legislation along these lines yet again. We plead with you to go down this path. It is not a lot of money. You have cut four thousand million dollars out of the Army budget. Surely you can give back a little bit. But you are losing very valuable personnel at present. These people suffer death on the front line defending the things we believe in, and they have family breakdowns. Really, they should be entitled to a better deal than we in this place have with our indexation arrangements or even, God bless them all, Australia's pensioners. These people should get the best deal of all, but they are not. They are getting a second-rate deal at present.


I strongly agree with the opposition on this. If they did nothing in 12 years at least they are doing something now. As to what their motives are, I am not going to impugn them for that. I am just going to say, 'Good on you, Mr Opposition. We hope that you continue to fight for the best outcome, which is simply putting them in line with all of the other pensions.' I think that is more than warranted.


I can see absolutely no point in depriving our servicemen of these benefits. It would appear to me that the opposition is doing that, and, I hate to say it, but they are doing it for political reasons. That seems to be the clear and unequivocal interpretation that I can put upon what is happening here. If I am wrong someone can come and explain it to me. I would be quite happy to listen to them.


We thank the government for these changes, but we must emphasise that there is no logic, and there most certainly is no humanity involved, in the continuing position by the government of not accepting the preferable alternative as far as indexation of the pensions goes. It is a point of view that my own party will be hammering continuously and continually. Many of the people in the services are closely associated with us and we most certainly intend to be their champions. I think that every single person here should be their champions, but for 12 years the opposition were not and for three years the government has not been. But we will be the first to congratulate either side if they move forward to a serious indexation of the pensions.


I, like many members here, am very gravely embarrassed by us getting parliamentarians' indexation through—indexation of a very generous nature—while having to face these people who have risked their lives, risked their families and sacrificed themselves in a very tough occupation for our sake. I really do think that—unlike myself—a lot of these people act out of patriotism. 

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,3,2,speech
"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2012-08-22,"



Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Minister for Indigenous Health and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Centenary of ANZAC) (10:01):  I thank all of those who have contributed to this debate. I am not sure that I can agree with everyone, obviously, because, as the member for Kennedy rightly points out, if the proposal of the opposition were passed it would deprive those potential beneficiaries of the benefits contained in the amendments we are putting before the House. That, to me, is just silly. What it highlights is the political stunt that is being pulled here by the opposition to highlight an issue which they have got out of the public domain about their attitude towards DFRDB indexation. I will come to that in a moment.


What we need to do is to concentrate on this bill. The bill, as you would be aware, exempts from income tax reimbursements made under the Veterans' Pharmaceutical Reimbursement Scheme and the MRCA Pharmaceutical Reimbursement Scheme. The payments are due to commence in the first quarter of 2013, benefiting 50,000 veterans. Why should we deprive those veterans of the benefits that will flow as a result of this legislation? There is absolutely no reason for us to do so. To have this bill hijacked for a political stunt is, to my mind, something which we should be very concerned about. 


There will also be amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act to make it clear that treatment costs reimbursed under the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests (Treatment) Act are exempt from income tax. There were 155,000 claims for reimbursement processed in 2010-11. That is an important element. This will clarify administrative arrangements for the payments of travel expenses under the Veterans' Entitlements Act and the Australian Participants in British Nuclear Tests (Treatment) Act. There will be amendments to the Defence Service Homes Act to ensure that those with operational service as part of Operation DAMASK VI in 1993 are eligible for subsidised home loans and insurance under the act—another important benefit. 


This bill will ensure bereavement payments for funeral expenses in respect of indigent veterans or members is exempt income for the purpose of the social security income test. There are amendments to the definition of 'Australia' to authorise clean energy payments under the VEA and MRCA to residents of Norfolk Island. That is important to the residents of Norfolk Island but clearly not important to the opposition. And the bill will provide for more timely provision of special assistance under the VEA and MRCA via legislative instrument, instead of the current arrangements, which require regulation. The bill will ensure that debt recovery provisions will be applicable to all relevant provisions of the VEA, the regulations and any legislative instruments made under the VEA, and amend the MRCA to replace obsolete references to pharmaceutical allowances and telephone allowances.


There are important things. Many of them are small but they are very important to the veteran community and they should not be side-tracked and put off as a result of this stunt by the opposition to try and get us to accept an amendment which would have the House decline to consider the bill. Let us be very clear about this: whilst I appreciate the integrity of some in the debate—and I understand full well the intensity of the debate—I think we need to appreciate a number of points.


The first point is—and the member for Kennedy rightly pointed this out—the opposition did nothing during the 11 years they were in power to address the issue they now say is at the front of their minds. Why is that? Perhaps it is because the then government took a conscious decision not to do so. We know that because of a contri­bution recently made by Nick Minchin, the former finance minister, to the Australian on 2 May. In this letter to the editor, he said that this claim to change indexation:


… was properly rejected by the Howard Government, of which I was a member … There is no inherent logic to the proposition that a public sector employment-related superannuation payment should be indexed in exactly the same fashion as a means-tested welfare benefit in this case, the aged pension. 


I table that correspondence.


Let me make it very clear. One of the furphies of this debate is that somehow, by supporting this amendment by the opposition today, we should come to agree that we are equating a superannuation benefit—an employment benefit—with income support payments. How different are they?


Let me just take you through what the DFRDB scheme provides. It has generous benefits: payment of benefits on retirement after 20 years of service—I might just point out that 75 per cent of the people who are beneficiaries under the DFRDB after 20 years of service retired before their mid-forties—they are 45 before they retire—that is three-quarters of them; the ability to commute between four and five times the annual retirement pay in exchange for a reduction in retirement pay—this option has been exercised by 99 per cent of members; a higher employer contribution to other schemes, around 30 per cent from the Commonwealth, compared to the current community standard; and, since 1988, a separate three per cent productivity benefit fortnightly that is available as a lump sum on retirement. What does that mean? Let me put this in context. For example, a colonel aged 55 with 35 years of service, retiring at the beginning of 2012 would, it is estimated, receive a payment without commutation of approximately $84,000 a year. If they decided to commute a proportion of it, they would receive a lump sum of $420,000—that is, five times their annual pay—and a reduced annual payment of $64,000 per year. 


What we are being asked to do here is equate that $64,000 a year which can be received at age 55 with the income support payments made to a pensioner at age 65. They are very different. One is a superannuation benefit, a worker entitlement; the other is an income support payment. Should a former member of the Defence Force have an income below the threshold, they will be eligible for—potentially, depending on their service—a service pension at age 60 or, if not, an age pension at 65. I might also point out that this proposal being put forward by the opposition does nothing for the 150,000 service men and women who joined after 1991, who are on the MSBS payments—nothing. 


Let us be very clear about it. What we are being told here is that we should equate a superannuation benefit with an income support payment. This is not the place to have that debate. We have been diverted from discussing the intention of this legislation. It is a political stunt by the opposition to try and put off the benefits that will come as a result of this legislation if it passes through the chamber. If it does not—if we do not get this legislation through and we fall, a sop to the opposition's proposal—this House will decline to consider the bill. That will mean none of the benefits outlined in this legislation will flow on to veterans who are entitled to those benefits. Let us be very clear, this is a stunt. 



Mr Robert interjecting—




Mr SNOWDON:
  You know it is a stunt. We all know it is a stunt. There is a bit of to-ing and fro-ing as to what they mean, by the way. We have shadow minister Ronaldson's report from a meeting at Caboolture. It says that the indexation issue will be addressed in the first term. During the course of last night's debate in this chamber Wyatt Roy, the member for Longman, who was at that meeting, said that it would happen in the first budget.


Let us be very clear. There is obvious confusion. I am not sure what the message is to the veterans community, who they are going to on an almost daily basis to plead their case about this. 



Mr Robert interjecting—




Mr SNOWDON:
  I am sick and tired of listening to the banal comments coming from the opposition about this matter. We can certainly have a discussion about it, but this is not the time. We should be looking at the benefits that can accrue to veterans as a result of the legislation being put through the House. We should pass the bill and move onto the next stage of the legislation—and reject the opposition's amendment.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The question is that the amendment be agreed to.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The question now is that this bill be now read a second time.


Question agreed to.

 (North Sydney) (13:45):  I want to pay tribute to Genia McCaffery, who is retiring as the Mayor of North Sydney after having served four terms and also having served as President of the Local Government Association of New South Wales and President of the Australian Local Government Association. Genia is a very decent person, and she has been an outstanding Mayor of North Sydney. She has been a community fighter. She is someone who has stood up for our local community in the face of very challenging circumstances.


I took great pleasure in campaigning with her to try and obtain Graythwaite as an accessible site for the people of North Sydney. We failed in that endeavour, but she was incredibly successful in having the coal loader preserved as a community facility on Sydney Harbour.


Genia has always put the interests of the people of North Sydney first. She has dedicated herself full time to what is an important job and a challenging job. It is a diverse community in North Sydney. From commercial interests to residential interests, the community has been served extremely well by Genia. I thank her for her service and wish her well for the future.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:00):  My question is to the Prime Minister. I refer her to the fact that on the first stage of the Olympic Dam expansion the carbon tax will cost BHP Billiton tens of millions of dollars and to the statement from its chairman, Jac Nasser, who said:


… uncertainty about Australia's tax system is generating negative investor reaction.


I ask the Prime Minister: if BHP Billiton delays its massive expansion of Olympic Dam, will she accept responsibility for the uncertainty and extra cost her carbon tax has created?

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:00):  We believe that the Olympic Dam project is a very important project for the future of South Australia, which is why every step of the way we have worked strongly with BHP, the proponents of Olympic Dam, in order to see this project realised for South Australia. Of course, BHP has to go through all of its internal processes and decision making, as is proper, but the government has worked consistently with BHP and will continue to do so.


The Leader of the Opposition refers to a statement from Mr Jac Nasser about uncertainty in tax policy. The source of that uncertainty is the Leader of the Opposition. The tax policies and plans of this government are clear and are there for all to see. We have legislated the minerals resource rent tax. There is no uncertainty: every mining company in Australia is well aware of the rules. We have legislated carbon pricing. There is no uncertainty: every mining company, indeed every business that has to pay a carbon price—a very limited number of them, well under 1,000—is well aware of the rules. We have set up a business tax working group. You could not take a more consultative approach to the future of business taxation.


We on this side of the House wanted to deliver a one per cent reduction in the company tax but ran into the destructive negativity of the Leader of the Opposition, who has prevented businesses around Australia, whether BHP or any other, from realising that one per cent tax cut. The Leader of the Opposition actually plans a company tax increase for businesses like BHP. So, on this side of the parliament there is responsible economic policy, a budget coming to surplus, certainty for the business community and a consultative approach about the future; on that side of the parliament, yes, there is risk—you betcha!

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:03):  BHP will make its investment decisions, as is proper. We have legislated carbon pricing so BHP, when it is making those decisions, can do it against a backdrop of certainty. Yes, amongst some sections of the business community, carbon pricing has been controversial, but overwhelmingly the thing that the business community has said to the government about carbon pricing is that it knew that, inevitably, a carbon price was coming. It had diagnosed that from the fact that both major political parties went to the 2007 election promising a carbon price. It had diagnosed that from the fact that—



Mr Simpkins interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Cowan is warned!




Ms GILLARD:
  it was the policy of the government and that it was a policy supported by every living Liberal leader. The business community diagnosed that it was inevitable that there would be a carbon price. So, knowing that there would be a carbon price, its call was for certainty. We have given certainty. The Leader of the Opposition might want to turn his back on the facts and he might want to turn his back on reason, but in fact the uncertainty for BHP and Olympic Dam, the uncertainty for every business in this country, comes from the destructive negativity of the Leader of the Opposition and his reckless attempt to roll back every economic reform that makes sense for this country and that will build our prosperity—including the carbon tax.

Given that the Treasurer claimed tax increases of $16 billion as savings in this year's budget, will he rule out further tax increases to pay for his big spending promises?

Mr SWAN
 (Lilley—Deputy Prime Minister and Treasurer) (14:09):  I thank the shadow Treasurer for that question, He certainly knows all about high-taxing government. He was a member of the highest taxing government in Australia's history. Tax to GDP peaked at 24.2 per cent under the Howard government. We are committed to keeping the tax-to-GDP ratio at or below the level that we inherited. The tax-to-GDP ratio is just 22.1 per cent in 2012-13. So I think by any measure we have demonstrated that we can put in place a very strong fiscal policy and that we can make the savings in our budget to fund our Labor priorities—and that is what we have been doing.




Mr Hockey:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on point of order that goes to relevance. He was asked whether he would rule out tax increases.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for North Sydney will resume his seat. The Treasurer has the call.




Mr SWAN:
  We have a proven track record of making room for Labor priorities, such as our Paid Parental Leave scheme. Those opposite want to put tax up to fund their parental leave scheme. They have a commitment to jack up company taxes under the Leader of the Opposition, the shadow Treasurer and the shadow finance minister—the three stooges who are in charge of economic policy on that side of the House.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The Treasurer knows that he is not to use that reference. The Treasurer will withdraw.




Mr SWAN:
  I do withdraw. We on this side of the House will put in place—and we are putting this in place—very strict fiscal discipline. We have made the savings to fund Labor priorities and we will continue to do that. We will meet our commitment to keep the tax-to-GDP ratio below the level that we inherited from those opposite.


Of course, we know why we are getting these questions today. It is because the shadow Treasurer over there on breakfast television—

Mr Hockey interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for North Sydney is warned.




Mr SWAN:
  We are bringing our budget back into surplus in 2012-13 and we are doing it because we have put in place expenditure restraints, the type of expenditure restraints you did not see from the shadow Treasurer over there or the shadow finance minister when they were in government.




Mr Pyne:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Under standing order 91(c), it is disorderly conduct to persistently and wilfully refuse to conform to a standing order. He is persistently and wilfully refusing to conform to the standing order on direct relevance.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The Treasurer will refer to the question before the chair.




Mr SWAN:
  I am. I am referring to taxation. I am referring to our commitment to keep the tax-to-GDP ratio below the level that we inherited from those opposite, who were the highest taxing government in our history. I am referring to our record of making savings to make room for our Labor priorities. I am also referring to the fact that there is a $70 billion crater in their budget bottom line, which is one of the reasons they have committed at this stage to jacking up the company tax rate. So there is a very clear contrast between the fiscal discipline we see on this side of the House and the clowns that are running economic policy on that side of the House. (Time expired)

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:37):  To the member who asked the question, once again we reserve the right to check the facts because we have found consistently this week, including in the area involving agriculture, meatworks and the like, that the opposition has come into this parliament and claimed things that are simply wrong. So we reserve the right to check what is being asserted by the member. Why would we be surprised at all that the opposition would be asserting things that are wrong? This is the same opposition that said Whyalla would be wiped off the map. This is the same opposition that said there would be no coal mining anymore. This is the same opposition that said there would be astronomical increases in the price of living. This is the same opposition that has gone up and down the country peddling fear instead of facts.


I would remind the member who asked the question that in assessing the impact of carbon pricing on a small business, what we find from the opposition is that they are coming in here and either getting it entirely wrong or are seeking to misrepresent the position. Electricity prices are only one component—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The Prime Minister will resume her seat. Before the member for Murray puts a point of order, I will ask the Prime Minister to return to the question before the chair.




Ms GILLARD:
  I was just about to say, for businesses electricity prices are only one component of their costs. For the vast majority of businesses, total electricity costs are two per cent or less of their turnover, making a carbon price impact of around 0.2 per cent. Then, when you have truly assessed the carbon price impact, there are various ways of businesses working to reduce their carbon emissions, to reduce their electricity usage, to adopt clean energy measures and energy efficient measures. The government is working with business to provide assistance with a number of those measures.


I hope the member is not so blinkered that she is participating in the fear campaign or that she is not doing things like providing information to her constituents about the $40 million Energy Efficient Information Grants program, which is helping small businesses cut energy costs. I hope she is not so determined to be out there peddling fear that she is not pointing to all aspects of this package.


Once again, I would remind the member for Murray, who is a member of long standing in this place, that she was a supporter of a price on carbon. She asked her constituents to vote for her in 2007 on the basis of supporting a price on carbon. She proudly supported John Howard's emissions trading scheme and the truth is if she was going—

 (Calare) (14:48):  My question is to the Prime Minister. The electricity bill of a cold store owner in Blayney in my electorate has increased by over $5,000 as a direct result of the carbon tax. As most of the produce in the cold store is exported into overseas markets without a carbon tax, this business cannot pass these costs on. Why is this business being hit with a carbon tax of over $5,000 a month when the Prime Minister continues to claim that small business will not pay the carbon tax?

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:48):  I thank the member for this question. I would direct him to the comments made by the Minister for Climate Change during the course of this question time—I believe it was in answer to a question from the member for New England. He outlined some of the support and work that is happening to help cold storage businesses—it was a business that was refrigerating meals—to cut their electricity costs and seize a clean energy future. I refer the member to the Minister for Climate Change's answer because it is pointing him to parts of the clean energy future package, the carbon pricing package, that can work with the sort of business that he is describing. I would say to the member that, rather than going out and peddling fear and falsity, it would be better if he directed that business to aspects of the carbon pricing package which may be able to help them seize a clean energy future. That is the kind of thing that local members do.


Can I also say in respect of the member's question about carbon pricing that I am a little surprised that this seems to be the only day on which the Leader of the Opposition has not come into this parliament and backed in his stunt for the day by raising it as a question. He has talked about Olympic Dam but he has not talked about the cost-of-living-impacts of carbon on families. He was out with a family today. I am wondering if was too frightened to raise that because one of the members of that family was a public servant. Maybe he thought this was a particularly bad day to be talking about the cost of living for a family whose job he is trying to destroy—like those of 12,000 others. He is destroying not only jobs but also health and education services.


Unlike the opposition, we will continue to get this nation ready for a prosperous future. A clean energy future is part of that. The member who asked the question stood for a price on carbon in the 2007 election. If he wants to talk to his constituents about the future, he should make sure he tells them that John Howard supports a price on carbon, Brendan Nelson does, Malcolm Turnbull does and so does this Leader of the Opposition.

"Burke, Anna (The DEPUTY SPEAKER)",ALP,2012-08-22,"



The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
) (15:22):  Mr Speaker has received a letter from the honourable the Leader of the Opposition proposing that a definite matter of public importance be submitted to the House for discussion, namely: 


The urgent need for the Government to address the cost of living pressures on Australian families.


I call upon those members who approve of the proposed discussion to rise in their places.

"Abbott, Tony, MP",LP,2012-08-22,"



Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (15:22):  Haven't we seen an extraordinary spectacle from the Prime Minister and government ministers today in question time. Every time members of the coalition asked the government about the extraordinary increase in power prices due to the carbon tax, government ministers, led by the Prime Minister, have laughed. That is what they have been doing. They have laughed off this hit on the cost of living of decent Australian families. And doesn't that just prove: every time your power bill goes up the Prime Minister has a smile on her face, because that is just the carbon tax doing its job. The whole point of the carbon tax is to increase the cost of living for Australian families.


We did have a truly extraordinary performance from the Prime Minister today. She said today, in answer to the first or second question she got: businesses knew a carbon price was coming.



An opposition member:  How?




Mr ABBOTT:
  How? Did they read the chicken entrails? Did they read the tea leaves? Because if they had listened to the Prime Minister what would they have heard?



Opposition members:  'No carbon tax under the government I lead'!




Mr ABBOTT:
  No carbon tax! No emissions trading scheme! Nothing whatsoever until—



Opposition members:  'A deep and lasting consensus'—




Mr ABBOTT:
  was achieved. So how this Prime Minister could attribute some kind of ESP to the businesses of Australia—particularly to BHP, which is on the verge, it seems, of announcing the cancellation of the Olympic Dam mine expansion—is just utterly beyond comprehension. The Prime Minister today liked to talk about something that might have been said in the 2007 election. Well, this Prime Minister and this government have dudded the Australian people not once but twice. They said at the 2007 election there would be an emissions trading scheme; they did not deliver it. They said at the 2010 election there would be no carbon tax, and they did. What a fraudulent display from this Prime Minister.


Then of course we had the Prime Minister claiming that the coalition would keep the carbon tax if we formed a government, and the minister for families saying we would claw back the assistance if we formed a government. Well, they cannot even get their scare right; they cannot even get their smear right, which shows what an extraordinary government we have got.


I went back to the record of August 2010, election month, and on no fewer than five separate occasions we had this Prime Minister saying that her whole objective was to help families with cost-of-living pressures. She does not say that anymore, does she? She cannot say it anymore because no government that took the pressure on families seriously and wanted to relieve it would hit every single Australian family with a carbon tax.


Members opposite never stopped talking about working families. Remember that phrase that rung around this chamber, day in and day out, back in 2007 and 2008? They never talk about working families anymore because they are precisely the people who are being hit by the toxic carbon tax.


Let us have a look at what has happened to the cost-of-living pressures on working families since members opposite formed a government. Since December 2007, power prices are up 64 per cent; water prices are up 60 per cent; utilities prices are up 58 per cent; gas 42 per cent; insurance 35 per cent; education 31 per cent; health 33 per cent; and rent 27 per cent. What do they want to do? Make it all so much worse by adding to all of the price rises that have occurred up till now the greatest hit of all: the world's biggest carbon tax at the worst possible time.


Let us look at the economic situation that this government has created when it comes to ordinary families. Employment has risen very, very little. In fact, 2011 was the first year since the early 1990s when no net new jobs were created. GDP growth per person was 2¼ per cent a year between 1996 and 2007 under the Howard government, and just half a per cent a year under the current government. No wonder the families of Australia are feeling under pressure. No wonder the Howard era looks like a golden age of prosperity, now lost because of the bumbling and the new taxes of members opposite.


Consumer confidence is down. Manufacturing output is down. Employment growth is slow. Productivity growth is poor. Economic growth is fragile and confidence is almost non-existent in many sectors of our economy. So what is this government doing? They have got the answer! 'We have the answer,' they say. What is it? A carbon tax. Oh, great! What geniuses! Look at their own modelling. Members opposite like to say that the coalition is engaged in a scare campaign. Let us engage in a fact campaign by looking at the government's own modelling. On the government's own modelling, steel production under a carbon tax: down 21 per cent. Aluminium production under a carbon tax: down 61 per cent. Coal-fired power generation absent carbon capture and storage: down from over 70 per cent to just 10 per cent of Australia's total.


But there's more. Gross national income per head—that is, the real wealth of Australians—by 2050, will be $5,000 a year less under a carbon tax than without a carbon tax. Our cumulative GDP with a carbon tax is $1 trillion less than it would be without a carbon tax. This is on the government's own figures. It is as if this country were to stop working for a whole year. That is the wrecking ball that is going to swing through our economy as a result of this government's carbon tax. 


And the tragedy is that it is not even going to reduce emissions. Again, look at the government's own modelling. Our domestic emissions do not go down by five per cent; they go up. That is right; they go up by eight per cent from 578 million tonnes to 621 million tonnes in 2020, despite a carbon tax that by then will be $37 a tonne. We only get the five per cent emissions reduction that the government is committed to, and that we support, because Australian businesses have got to buy $3½ billion worth of carbon licences from foreign traders. 


Who do government ministers think are ultimately going to pay for those carbon licences?—Australian consumers, Australian families. But it just gets worse. In 2050, when we are supposed to achieve an 80 per cent reduction in our emissions—in fact, the reduction in domestic emissions is more like three per cent—we only achieve the much boasted reduction in emissions because in that year alone Australian families have to pay for $58 billion worth of carbon credits being bought abroad. We will spend 1½ per cent of our gross domestic product buying carbon credits from foreign carbon traders. We will spend more buying carbon credits than we will on defence, as a percentage of GDP. Shame! 


It is no wonder that members opposite want to talk about anything but the carbon tax. They would rather talk about the member for Dobell than about the carbon tax, because this is utterly toxic to their standing with the families of Australia.


Let's look at the burdens that this government is placing on the families of Australia. Taxes are going up and up and up, because spending is going up and up and up. Let's contrast the record. The last four budgets of Peter Costello delivered the four biggest surpluses in Australian history. 




Dr Emerson:
  It was the biggest-taxing government in Australian history.




Mr ABBOTT:
  The first four budgets of the member for Lilley, the current Treasurer, delivered the four biggest deficits in Australian history. He wants to be known as 'Surplus' Swan; he will forever be known as 'Wasteful' Wayne.


This budget—the budget that he is so proud of, where he thinks we might achieve a surplus so small as to be invisible to the naked eye—is achieved by cooking the books and moving $6 billion of national broadband network spending off budget. Honest accounting—even as things stood at budget time—would have produced a deficit of at least $12 billion, not the microsurplus that he is promising. 


As I said, taxes just go up and up, and they are all ultimately paid by the struggling families of this country—the forgotten families of Australia. There is the alcopops tax, the extra tax on employee share schemes, the cigarette tax, the LPG tax, the flood levy, the private health insurance tax, the mining tax and the carbon tax. Then there is the means test that they put on the family tax benefit part B, against a clear election promise. There is the means test that they whacked on the baby bonus—again, a clear broken election promise. There is the freeze in indexation for the family tax benefits and the baby bonus—again, an absolute rip-off of the forgotten families, the working families that Labor said they were here to represent. And, coming in 2014—safely, just after the election—there will be massive additional charges on people going into aged care. 


This is a government which has ripped off the working families of Australia. The working families of Australia want change and they want change for the better. Briefly in the time left to me let me give you 10 important areas where there will be change for the better—because, yes, change will come. There will be no carbon tax, because we do not believe in hurting the economy for no environmental gain. There will be no mining tax, because we do not believe in penalising our most successful sector. We will have stronger borders because we will implement not just one, but all three of the Howard government's policies that worked. 


There will be higher productivity because, amongst many other things, we will restore in full the Australian Building and Construction Commission, which gave that sector $5 billion a year in productivity improvements. There will be higher participation because there will be a proper paid parental leave scheme at long last—and aren't we in the coalition so proud to be giving the women and the families of Australia this long-overdue benefit! There will be less red tape because there will be $1 billion worth of savings for small business. There will be a cleaner environment because a green army, 15,000 strong, will be going to the rescue of our Landcare groups. We will have modern infrastructure, including the M4 East, the CityLink in Melbourne and the Gateway extension in Brisbane. 


We will have better services from community controlled public hospitals and from independent public schools. Finally, there will be greater engagement with Asia through more language training in our schools, and a two-way street Colombo Plan.


This is a great country. We are a great people. We have been tragically let down by our very bad government. The message which the Australian people are coming to understand is that there is nothing wrong with this great country of ours that a change of government would not substantially improve.

"Emerson, Craig, MP",ALP,2012-08-22,"



Dr EMERSON
 (Rankin—Minister for Trade and Competitiveness) (15:37):  As each day goes by this parliament becomes more astonishing. After question time, coalition frontbenchers stood up and made personal explanations, including the Leader of the Opposition, who denied that he has a policy to increase company tax. Then he went straight into the matter of public importance where he reaffirmed that the coalition would, indeed, have a paid parental leave scheme over and above that which has already been implemented. Either the coalition has just announced that it will not increase company tax by 1½ per cent, which was their pre-election commitment—and that is the basis of the personal explanation that the opposition leader gave—or they have just increased their $70 billion black hole by another $3 billion.


Where do I get the $3 billion figure? I get it from the 2010 coalition election policy. It is actually $3 billion a year, which would make it $12 billion over the period of the forward estimates. So $70 billion just grew to $82 billion. The coalition now has an $82 billion black hole, because the Leader of the Opposition stood up and gave a personal explanation saying there is no proposal to increase company tax. That is news to the member for Indi, who has said on Q&A, 'It is a small levy on a small number of businesses.' They are reaffirming what they said at the last election, that there will be a 1½ per cent increase in company tax for larger companies. The opposition leader said that is not true anymore. He took a personal explanation and the $70 billion black hole just grew to $82 billion.


While they were parading their righteous indignation by taking personal explanations, the shadow Treasurer—when he took a personal explanation—said that he had never mentioned a $70 billion funding problem. But the shadow Treasurer said:


Therefore finding 50, 60 or 70 billion is about identifying waste and identifying areas where you do not need to proceed with programs.


He made no apologies for that. The shadow Treasurer said that on the Sunrise program on 12 August 2011, but just took a personal explanation and said he has never talked about a $70 billion funding hole.




Mr Hockey:
  That's right!




Dr EMERSON:
  So the transcript was doctored? Is that what you are saying?




Mr Hockey:
  It's your spin.




Dr EMERSON:
  It's your spin!




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms Rishworth
):  I ask the minister and shadow minister to direct their comments through the chair.




Dr EMERSON:
  Your coalition frontbench colleague the shadow finance minister said:


The $70 billion is an estimate of the sort of challenge that we will have.


That was on ABC News Radio, 16 August 2011. That was four days after the shadow Treasurer made the same admission. The member for Goldstein said:


The $70 billion is an indicative figure of the challenge that we've got.


Paul Kelly asked him if it was a furphy. Robb said:


No, it's not a furphy. We came out with the figure, right?


That was on Meet the Press, on 4 September 2011. And they have the temerity to stand up here and say that this is a Labor fabrication, that the $70 billion was made up by Labor. In fact, that is exactly what the Leader of the Opposition said on 25 August as they were rolling through and trying to backtrack on the $70 billion:


Well, this $70 billion figure is a fanciful figure. It's plucked from the air by government ministers and I'm surprised you're re-telling it to me.


It came from the mouths of babes: it came from the mouths of the shadow finance minister and the shadow Treasurer. The leader of the opposition thought: 'God! The cat's out of the bag! I'll have to say that Labor made it up.' And then he came in today and said the same thing.


Who has been doctoring your transcripts? That is what I have to ask the Leader of the Opposition. This is not a Labor myth—this is truth. This is an admission of truth by the coalition that it has a $70 billion black hole which just grew by $12 billion today because the Leader of the Opposition, in righteous indignation, got up and said, 'We have never proposed a company tax increase to pay for the paid parental leave scheme.' He reaffirmed that today. The member for Indi told the ABC's Q&A, 'Of course there's a company tax increase.' You cannot hide from a million viewers, and that is what the member for Indi and the shadow industry minister said.


During the discourse across the table, we reiterated that the coalition was the highest-taxing government in Australia's history. Across the table, the shadow Treasurer again said: 'Rubbish! It's not true.' But it is in the budget papers! Do they think that the Treasury is part of a one-world government conspiracy? Do they think that it doctors the figures with the Australian Bureau of Statistics? They are out there at Tidbinbilla in a huddle! They are the people who were involved in faking the moon landing all those years ago! The ABS, the Treasury, Tidbinbilla Tracking Reserve, the radio telescope at Parkes—it's all part of this one-world government conspiracy! 'It ain't true,' they say. 'No, no, it never happened. We weren't the highest taxing government in Australia's history.'


Then the opposition leader went on with this: in criticising the Labor government he said, 'They've done this terrible thing. It includes means testing family tax benefits. It includes means testing the baby bonus.' He said these were really bad things. They forced up the cost of living and made it harder for people. But we just added to the $82 billion. Is that what has happened? Is the Leader of the Opposition, in saying that they do not support the means testing of the family tax benefits or of the baby bonus, saying that they have just gone from $70 billion to $82 billion?


It has been an expensive day at the office, hasn't it—and it's going through the roof! A hundred billion dollars, here we come.


We were talking about one source of cost-of-living increases: electricity prices. We pointed out that the bulk of electricity price increases have come from factors other than putting a price on carbon. The opposition said this was a fabrication by the Prime Minister, an absolute furphy. That was on 9 August. On 20 August, much more recently, the Leader of the Opposition said it is true the carbon price is not the only factor in the dramatic rise in power prices. Well, let me tell you: in New South Wales, over the last four years, there has been an almost 70 per cent increase, less than nine per cent of which was from the carbon price. In Queensland it was a 42 per cent increase—11 per cent from the carbon price. In Western Australia, it was almost a 63 per cent increase—nine per cent from the carbon price.


We are saying there does need to be reform in the electricity sector. The opposition leader said there is no problem; there is no gold plating. He said it was a furphy, something the Prime Minister made up. He has had to admit there is a problem. But we are struggling to get any cooperation from the opposition, because they believe there are two types of electricity price rises: one is associated with a carbon price, for which there is compensation—that is the bad one; and the other is the good one, a much bigger electricity price increase over the last four years from state governments, with no compensation. 


They are saying that is all right. If it goes through the roof and there is no compensation, but it is done by a state government, it is fine. If there is an electricity price increase associated with the carbon price for which there is compensation, with the average increase in household bills being $3.30 a week and compensation on average being $10.10, that is a bad one. But the uncompensated ones are good ones. The fact of the matter is the opposition leader will not repeal the carbon price. That is the fact. I know that he has already created for himself an escape clause. 


That escape clause is in an opinion piece. Opinion pieces are very considered—they are written down; they are gospel truth. This is what the Leader of the Opposition said in an opinion piece: 


Opposition by contrast tends to be a permanent debating society because even the most final decisions can sometimes be revisited in office.


He is saying: 'We'll make a final decision. We'll announce that we're not going to repeal the carbon price; even that can be revisited in office'. It is just like the 'rock-solid', 'iron-clad' promise the Leader of the Opposition made—when he was heath minister before the 2004 election—not to tamper with the Medicare Safety Net. One of the first things the coalition did when they were re-elected was tamper with that Medicare Safety Net.


If a 'rock-solid', 'iron-clad' promise is not actually rock solid and is not iron clad—and is broken—then anything that the Leader of the Opposition says about the future amounts to a hill of beans—if that! Maybe half a hill of beans or a can of beans. That is about it, because this opposition leader said even the most final decisions arrived at in opposition can be revisited in government. And revisit they would if you saw what was going on in Victoria, if you saw what was going on in New South Wales with Liberal governments and if you saw what was going on in Queensland with can-do cuts—he is cutting everything—and he is doing it through an audit commission. These are policies that have been revealed after an election. 


They got Peter Costello, the former Treasurer, to go up there in a very, they would say, unbiased way. He had a look at the books and went, 'Oh my God, the cupboard is bare! We'll have to cut the place to pieces.' They are cutting BoysTown; they are cutting support for child protection. For goodness sake! They cut a program that tries to get women out of jail and keep them out of jail. That is expensive stuff, having women—and anyone else—in jail. They cut that program: $70,000 a year. They have some sort of white picnic thing, where they all go and dress up to the nines. It's called a 'posh picnic'. They can afford a posh picnic but they reckon they have to cut these programs and cut tens of thousands of jobs. 


When I saw that audit commission announcement by Mr Newman—can-do-cut Newman—I thought, 'I've heard that idea of an audit commission somewhere before.' And there it is. It was not so long ago. It was Friday, 9 March 2012. Tony Abbott, Leader of the Opposition, said:


Today, I announce a further commitment to reduce the cost and complexity of government through the swift establishment of a commission of audit that will examine the detail of what the Commonwealth government does and whether it could be done better and more cost-effectively.


This is just straight out of George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four. 'Don't worry about it, we're just going to have this cute little audit commission. It won't be a problem.'


This is the device that Campbell Newman has used to slash services, to attack the most vulnerable people in this country. It is the device that the Leader of the Opposition—if ever he were to become Prime Minister—would use to slash programs and jobs and avoid announcing them before an election. That is exactly what the shadow finance minister told a business group recently. He said, 'We are not going to reveal all the details of our cuts.' He criticised the Hewson Fightback! program, which he said was an 800-page suicide note because it did detail all the cuts. At least it was honest. 


We have the shadow finance minister saying: 'We wouldn't do that. What we would have instead is the commission for audit.' You know what? They would be cheered on by the former Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett. The Weekend Australian of 4 to 5 August said:


FORMER Victorian premier Jeff Kennett has backed Campbell Newman's cuts to Queensland's public service and taxpayer-funded social services, calling for Tony Abbott to adopt a similar program if he wins the next federal election.


Jeff Kennett said that the cuts should be 'savage'. This is the LNP way. 


What we are seeing in Queensland is a dress rehearsal for an Abbott government—a dress rehearsal to cut services and jobs. And they have the temerity to talk about cost-of-living increases! Do you know who they would bring back to help? They would bring back none other than Godwin Grech. Godwin Grech rides again! Godwin Grech is available. Godwin Grech has told the Sydney Morning Herald: 


The good news is there is reason to hope that the wounds will be cauterised as the Rudd-Gillard government meets its end at the ballot box within 12 months. If the Coalition is to improve the way we are governed, it must provide solid leadership, a healthy respect for due process and a much more accountable public service.


And you know what he recommends? That they sack the entire senior executive service—that they sack the public servants—put Godwin Grech back in the saddle, Godwin Grech riding through the Treasury, working on the commission of audit, working with other Liberals, who have the audit going, rolling away working out how to slash services for the most vulnerable, how to slash those 12,000 jobs that they have already announced—let alone all those jobs that they have not announced.


So what we have here is a government where, indisputably, the consumer price index, which is a measure of the cost of living, is at its lowest level in 13 years. Nevertheless, there are cost-of-living increases associated with electricity prices—and the coalition ought to get in there and report some of these programs instead of just criticising and cutting.

Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (15:53):  Okay, I want to make a confession—just between us here.



An honourable member:  No, don't!




Mr HOCKEY:
  I kind-of like Emmo.



Government members interjecting—




Mr HOCKEY:
  I know, I know, I kind-of like him because he reminds me of that character—I don't know if you remember during the Iraq war: Baghdad Bob or Comical Ali. Everything is on fire, but find him and he says, 'Everything's okay here in Baghdad! It's all under control; move on—there's nothing happening here!' And every time he pops up on Sky News there he is saying, 'The government's during a great job; it's there fighting for the workers'—and out there, the workers are telling us a very different story. They are not happy.




Dr Emerson:
  They want Work Choices back!




Mr HOCKEY:
  Yes, that's right: when in trouble, break glass labelled 'Work Choices'—that is what Labor does. Let's just go through a key of the few reasons why the workers of Australia and their families are not too happy with this government. Starting point No. 1 is that this government just doesn't get it. You see, if you increase taxes then it increases the cost of living. So when you introduce an alcopops tax, the price of alcohol goes up. When you introduce higher cigarette taxes, cigarette prices go up. When you introduce taxes on company cars—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms Rishworth
):  Order! I will ask the shadow Treasurer to take his seat. The minister on a point of order?




Dr Emerson:
  Thank you. At the first available opportunity I seek to make a personal explanation.




Mr HOCKEY:
  No, do you really want this?



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I think we will continue with the MPI—



Opposition members interjecting—




Dr Emerson:
  Taxes have gone down—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  No, we need to continue with the MPI. I call the shadow Treasurer.




Mr HOCKEY:
  If you cut the subsidy or support for private health insurance then private health insurance premiums for everyday Australians go up. If you increase the taxes on luxury cars, the cost of luxury cars goes up. It goes on and on: ethanol taxes go up, LPG taxes go up—you see, the Labor Party does not get it. Bob Hawke used to say, 'That Craig Emerson; he's a smart guy.' Bob! What the hell has happened? He's not that smart, because he does not understand that when you introduce taxes, someone has to pay—and it is the same person out there: the worker, the battler, who has to pay the higher taxes, and nothing illustrates that better than the carbon tax. The carbon tax increases the cost of everything.


And in a female impersonation of Comical Ali, the Prime Minister stands before us in this place and says solemnly, 'Oh, only a few hundred people pay the carbon tax.' She just does not get it. Now this government are addicted to a new wave of spending. They are announcing from that great money tree—that great money tree that sits in the Prime Minister's courtyard out the back of Parliament House—that this government is going to deliver bigger surpluses. They are going to deliver their first surplus, they claim. And it is going to do that by spending more money! How are they going to do that? It is quite a wonderful formula that would deliver that. The starting point is that the government are going to spend up to $8 billion, maybe $10 billion, a year on the National Disability Insurance Scheme. But they will not tell us where the money is coming from.


The government now have a $2.1 billion blow-out on trying to hold back asylum seekers coming on boats, but they will not tell us where the money is coming from. The government are planning to deliver $26 billion more for schools in Australia, but the government will not tell us where the money is coming from. The government are going to build 12 homemade submarines in Adelaide. They claim they can do that. That is $36 billion, but they will not tell us where the money is coming from.


Well, before the last election, they did not tell us where the money was coming from. They did not tell us about the carbon tax—the tax that dare not speak its name before the election. In fact it was denied. And now we know why: because that is what Labor does. It dresses mutton up as lamb. It claims things are savings when in fact they are higher taxes, and higher taxes means that everyday Australians have less money in their pocket to meet the needs of their families. And now we have the Treasurer and the Prime Minister playing this rather cute game. They are saying, 'We will find the savings through our massive new promises'. As they define the term 'savings' it means higher taxes. The Treasurer was on Radio National yesterday and he claimed that they found $33 billion of savings in the budget. It just so happens that $16 billion of that $33 billion was increased tax to about 20 taxes. That is what the Labor Party call savings: increasing taxes or introducing new taxes; and of course they would define the carbon tax as the greatest saving of all!


This is a government that is running out of money, and it is going to come to an ugly end. We know they are digging deep not only into the pockets of Australians now, with a carbon tax and a mining tax—oh, that mining tax, let us not forget. The intention of the original mining tax was to slow down the mining boom. And it is working. BHP announced today that they will not proceed with a full-scale Olympic Dam in South Australia. So this government's mining tax is at work, this government's mining tax is doing its job: it is slowing down investment in mining in Australia. And the carbon tax will obviously have a significant role to play in helping to increase the cost of mining in Australia, because they are—by their own admission and the admission of the government—significant carbon dioxide emitters.


Not only are the government taxing today, not only are they taxing tomorrow, but they are also engaging in retrospective taxing. In the last few weeks, the Labor Party have introduced retrospective tax legislation on transfer pricing, with a value of $1.9 billion, and in relation to company consolidations, worth $6 billion. They are trying to go back and tax yesterday—taxing yesterday, when people were legitimately complying with the law as it stood at that time and as it stands today. The government are taxing today, taxing tomorrow and now taxing yesterday. Why? Because they are a wasteful government. There is no money. 


Dr Martin Parkinson, the government's own Treasury secretary, warned only a few days ago:


… the days of large surpluses being delivered by buoyant tax receipts are behind us.


Yet the government are still making big spending announcements. The previous Secretary of the Treasury, Dr Henry, said in the last few days:


… the Australian tax base simply will not deliver what people expect of it …


You don't want to put yourself on a burning platform.


Well, these are the pyromaniacs of spending! They are the ones going out there with new spending promises, desperate to build up the primary vote of the Labor Party and save the Prime Minister's leadership. They are doing it with big spending announcements, but they are not prepared to be upfront with the Australian people about how they are going to pay for it. 


And why would the Australian people give them $1 extra of tax, after we have had blow-outs on everything? The National Broadband Network was meant to cost $4.7 billion, as they said at the 2007 election. It is now closer to $50 billion. And you know what? It is passing six homes a day. Dick Adams and I could doorknock faster than that! The NBN is going at a rate of six homes a day. There were the pink batts, where $2.4 billion was wasted. There were the $900 cheques, where they sent 16,000 cheques to dead people—to stimulate the Australian economy. Go figure. I don't think sending 16,000 cheques for $900 to dead people was particularly stimulating! But they outdid themselves by sending 27,000 cheques for $900 to people overseas to try and stimulate the Australian economy. No wonder John Key said to me that that was the best thing he had had happen to New Zealand for a while. The government have had an $850 million blow-out on solar panels and $300 million wasted on the Green Loans Program. They spent $4.7 billion try to stop the boats and now they want an extra $2.1 billion. They had a billion-dollar blow-out on computers in schools, a $1.7 billion blow-out on school halls, and now they want $26 billion extra for schools. They are saying they can do it all. They can spend the money. They do not have to raise taxes—well, it is more that they do not have to tell you about the new taxes.


This government will be judged at the next election not just on its dishonesty but also on its honesty. And there is no honesty in this government. It is a government that is bereft of principles. It is a government that is wicked and malevolent towards everyday Australians. It is a government that is indifferent to the plight of the families and workers of Australia. And it is a government that will be thrown out because, when it comes to trust and honesty, this government gets a fail. (Time expired)

"Ripoll, Bernie, MP",ALP,2012-08-22,"



Mr RIPOLL
 (Oxley—Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer) (16:03):  Hell hath no fury like a shadow Treasurer scorned! 




Mr Hockey:
  Amen!




Mr RIPOLL:
  And 'amen' he might well say.




Mr Hockey:
  Remember that!




Mr RIPOLL:
  Yes, Your Honour! If you listened to the shadow Treasurer's speech or read it later, you will know that what he is doing is belling the cat in terms of what the coalition's program is—what the opposition plan on doing to this economy if they get into government. The reality of this MPI, 'the urgent need for the government to address the cost-of-living pressures on Australian families', is a complete distraction. It is a distraction from their own failures, from the $70 billion black hole in what they have promised to fund. On one hand, they are saying they are going to provide more; on the other hand, they are saying they are going to make savings. If you add the two together, it makes for a very big funding black hole, and that is exactly what they have got.


The MPI also highlights the fact that the opposition are in popularity mode: 'What's out there? What group can we please? What group will just side with us, on the basis that we'll promise to do or say anything to garner a few votes?' Unfortunately, that is not how you run an economy and it is not how you run a country, and it should not be how you run a political party either. Their strategy right now is just to frighten people—families, small business, everyone they can find. They particularly want to frighten schoolkids. Their latest rant and rave is about cutting, slashing and burning funding for schools as well.


But if we need to be serious about cost-of-living pressures, if there is an 'urgent need' for government to address those issues, then let's talk about that. Let's talk about the government's record. What has this Gillard government done? It has done quite a lot, actually. Sometimes it is easy to forget just how much you have put into an area and how difficult it was to do so in tough economic times—unlike in the glory days, when the opposition were in government for nearly 12 long years, when the 'rivers of gold' used to run into Canberra. Revenue was so large, so indiscriminate, they could not spend it all. They had trouble even estimating how much the surplus would be because they did not have a clue. No matter how hard they tried to spend, no matter how much they raised taxes—the highest taxing government in Australian history—there was always plenty of spare money because we had a very strong economy.


But, in these much more difficult times, we also have a strong economy because we are doing the heavy lifting, the hard work, the hard yards, and making the tough decisions—not always the popular decisions but the right decisions, the decisions that are required to run this country properly, to ensure this economy continues to provide jobs and keeps the numbers strong. And no-one can question the numbers. This is the fallacy coming from those on the other side. They talk about the economy as though we were Spain or some other country where there are in fact some very disturbing numbers related to where their economy is going. Instead, in Australia we see an economy that is running with inflation well under control, with interest rates at the lowest they have been in a very long time, with the total government tax take lower than it has been in 20 years and with unemployment at around five per cent. In my state of Queensland, we also have a really strong economy, with $500 billion worth of projects in the pipeline, about $150 billion of which are well advanced. These are advanced projects.




Mr Dutton:
  What about the rising debt?




Mr RIPOLL:
  Look, there will always be this issue of debt. Who doesn't understand borrowing for a house? I think most Australians get that. They understand that, sometimes, to build really good things you need to borrow. But you need to do it responsibly, and that is exactly what we have done, with one of the lowest debt-to-GDP ratios in the world, a debt that can be easily managed by the government.


Let us talk about what we know about the coalition. What are the facts? We know about Work Choices—and it has never been more real and it has never been more violent. There is one thing workers in this country understand—that is, the reality. It is a rolled gold guarantee. The Leader of the Opposition wants to slash the Public Service—whether with you need it or not, you are just going to have to cop it. The opposition want to cut funding to schools. It is really clear now that not only do the opposition have a hit list on schools but, in the view of Tony Abbott, public schools have too much fun. He did not say it just once. In case you did not hear the Leader of the Opposition, he repeated himself. 



Mr Ewen Jones interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms Rishworth
):  I warn the member for Herbert that he is not in his seat.




Mr RIPOLL:
  He said twice that it is just too much money. How can any credible Leader of the Opposition say that there is too much money in the public school system? Not only do they oppose our investment at a really important time in the economy for school infrastructure, but also they say there are too many teachers, that we should cut one in seven. The shadow education minister said that there are too many teachers and that none of them are good enough so let us start by cutting one in seven, that class sizes do not matter. In which part of the world do they not matter? The opposition is clearly setting out a slash and burn agenda and it is a rolled gold guarantee.


Let us look at the lived experience. What are people experiencing right now? I will give you a really good example—let us just go to Queensland. You want to talk about frightened people not just in the public sector but right across the economy? People are genuinely scared because they are seeing a government with an enormous unprecedented majority out of control to the point where they are having really big fights internally over the cutting, slashing and burning of the Australian economy. They are trying to have it both ways. On one hand the Queensland government is saying that it is so bad in Queensland that they will be the next Spain, that there is a collapse imminent. At the same time, the Queensland Treasurer is going overseas and lauding it to the rest of the world that we have the best economy in the world because we have such great numbers and opportunities. 


Let us turn now to the living experience of the really good things we have done. We have the schoolkids bonus to help families educate their kids. We understand that families are doing it tough and we are doing something about cost-of-living pressures. It is urgent and we have a $3.6 billion cost-of-living package for families under pressure. The beauty about us is that we got this package through a hung parliament, in difficult circumstances, but the opposition opposed it every step of the way because they do not want families to get relief from those cost-of-living pressures. I agree: there are cost-of-living pressures and the opposition make them more difficult by not supporting any measures to ameliorate them.


Not only have we made a commitment to increase the tax-free threshold but also we have tripled it to $18,000, which means that more than one million working Australians will no longer have to fill out a tax return. This is something people dreamt about two decades. I do not know how many times constituents would come into my office and say, 'Why can't you lift the tax-free threshold from $5,000 or $6,000 up to maybe $10,000?' We took it to $18,000 and we did it in a tough economic climate. We did not just do it when it was easy, when anybody could have been a good Treasurer and you literally just had to turn up for work and you did a good job; we did it in tough times when you have to manage an economy, to make hard decisions, to make savings in the right areas, to spend in the right areas, to invest in schools and education, to invest in health, to reform parts of the economy and to make big structural changes including a new carbon economy in step with what the rest of the world is doing. 


The Climate Commission has come out with its report which says we are now in step with the middle of the pack when it comes to our policies on climate change and carbon pricing because the world has a number of schemes in place. There is one thing clear about that report and that is, if we do not do something now, we will be left behind and it will cost 10 times as much. That is the lived experience. That is what happens in real life.


What else is happening right now? Since we got into government we have lowered taxes. If you are on $50,000 a year, which is a fairly basic wage, you are now paying $1,750 less tax than you were in 2007-08—that is, 18 per cent less tax. Under a Labor government you pay less tax and the total tax take from government is a figure which cannot be disputed. You cannot just accept a figure when it suits you and then not accept it when it does not suit you. In fact, all taxpayers with incomes up to $80,000 get a tax cut. That is the lived experience. That is what we are doing as a government to make cost-of-living pressures come down. We understand cost-of-living pressures are real. We do not just oppose them, bleat about them and frighten parents about their kids' education. We put more money in and that is how to deal with it.


Family payments will increase by $1.8 billion from1 July next year. That is on top of the increases we have already put in place. We understand families are doing it tough because we had a GFC and one of the worst natural disasters in Australian history. The Queensland floods had a bigger impact on this economy, a whole percentage point on GDP, than the GFC. We responded. We took action to make sure that the economy did not suffer. What did that mean? People did not lose their jobs. The economy is still going. It means that people can still go to a hospital. They can still send the kids to school. It means they still have a job to pay the mortgage. The best thing you can do to reduce cost-of-living pressures is keep people in jobs. (Time expired)

"Gambaro, Teresa, MP",LP,2012-08-22,"



Ms GAMBARO
 (Brisbane) (16:13):  I rise to speak on the urgent need for the government to address the cost-of-living pressures on Australian families. I know the member for Oxley gave us a very colourful insight and, coming from Brisbane, I am sure he talks to different families from those I talk to. Everywhere I go—to information booths or in my office—I find there is a great deal of hurt out there and the cost-of-living pressures across the board are great, and the feedback is that is being felt very strongly by all in the community. Whether they are young professionals, students, pensioners or forgotten families, Australians are all feeling the pain and the squeeze at this very moment. 


In a recent report, we saw that Brisbane is one of the most expensive cities in the world right now. It is hard to believe that it is worse than New York, London, Rome and Hong Kong. In fact, according to the latest ranking of 130 cities by the Economist Intelligence Unit, all five Australian mainland state capital cities are more expensive than any major international city, such as Los Angeles, Berlin, Beijing and Shanghai. Sydney came seventh; Melbourne was closely behind in eighth position; followed by Perth, as the 12th most expensive; and Brisbane in the 13th spot. Brisbane's ranking was two spots higher than its 15th position in the previous year. So it is now much more expensive to live in Brisbane.


So you would think that the national government, with all of these cost-of-living pressures on the rise, would be taking action to ease the cost burden on Australians. However, what are we seeing from the Gillard government? We are seeing exactly the opposite. Why make it harder for people? That is exactly what they are doing; they are making it harder each and every day. 


If there is one thing that this government can do, it is to take the cost-of-living pressures off Australian families by repealing the carbon tax. As we know, the carbon tax is based on a deliberate mistruth to the Australian people. We remember those hollow words, spoken to the Australian people prior to the last election: 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.'



Mrs D'Ath interjecting—




Ms GAMBARO:
  The member for Petrie can well interject, but her Prime Minister uttered those words days before the election and her Prime Minister misled the Australian people. Yet we now have exactly that: a carbon tax that is slowly starting to filter through to the Australian economy. It is hurting families; it is hurting consumers. We have seen numerous examples all week during question time of the massive increases in electricity bills to businesses and families. 


And let's face it: the whole point of a carbon tax is to raise electricity prices and it is doing that beautifully. If the carbon tax did not raise electricity prices, it would not be doing its job.



Mrs D'Ath interjecting—



Mr Mitchell interjecting—




Ms GAMBARO:
  Members opposite can interject, but the wholesale price of power has doubled because of the carbon tax. The retail price has increased by an average of 10 per cent or more. I gave the example today of the memorial swimming pool in the electorate of Moreton. Their electricity price has actually increased by 15 per cent. Many families are suffering.



Mr Mitchell interjecting—




Ms GAMBARO:
  The member opposite spoke about the wonderful compensation that he and his government are giving to families. It will not be helpful. It will provide minimal relief because of these huge price increases, and any direct compensation from the Gillard government to offset household power bills will not assist the flow-on effect to households. Every business in Australia will have increased electricity prices, and the price of every good and commodity will be passed on to Australian consumers and families.


On the government's own figures, millions of Australian families will be worse off and, clearly, its compensation package will not assist with these massive cost increases. Those flow-on costs and the passing down of increased costs to consumers will hurt everyday families.



Mr Mitchell interjecting—




Ms GAMBARO:
  The member interjects about GST. GST is a fixed amount. Your carbon price will continue to grow year after year and will continue to inflict pain year after year. 



Mr Mitchell interjecting—




Ms GAMBARO:
  The member refers to economics. I think he needs a lesson in Economics 101 himself. I have spoken in this House many times about local sporting groups, such as the Wilston Grange Gorillas, an AFL club in my electorate. They, like many other sporting clubs, predominately train of an evening. In Queensland we have got the added impost because we have daylight saving, which means our electricity bills are a bit higher than those of the southern states. Clubs have to train— 



Mrs D'Ath interjecting—



Mr Mitchell interjecting—




Ms GAMBARO:
  Members opposite can laugh and they can be ridiculous but the players have to train and because of daylight saving most parents are in the dark longer and that is just a fact. Because of the training schedules of all the players and because of work and school commitments they have to have lighting on the fields, which uses a lot of electricity. The club's monthly electricity bill, following the introduction of a carbon tax, has increased by more than 15 per cent. Over the financial year, this will equate to approximately a $5,000 increase due to the carbon tax. That is a massive amount of dollars for a volunteer sporting organisation, and it is the mums and dads who will wear that increase through higher sporting fees. 


Then, to add insult to injury, the government has named Brisbane City Council as one of Australia's top 500 polluters. So the carbon tax will cost the Brisbane City Council $65 million over four years, after the Gillard Labor government branded it as one of the top polluters in the country. I do not know what the logic is of this. The council has purchased 100 per cent green power for its buildings; it has offset its carbon emissions from its public transport and vehicle fleets; it has planted two million trees; and it has protected more than 500 hectares of bushland from development over the past four years by bringing that land into public ownership. So the decision to slug the Brisbane City Council with a carbon tax is a slap in the face for struggling households, because that cost has only one way to go—it has to be passed on to the ratepayers. The 40 per cent rate increase in this year's council budget is because of the government's carbon tax. 


The general manager of Communify, Karen Dare, a community organisation based in Bardon in my electorate, recently told me about the increasing number of people coming into their organisation because of the rising cost of living. She has seen a huge number of people coming into their organisation because the cost of rent, power, food and transport has gone up. 


Power bills are particularly devastating for people on pensions. They have risen over 20 per cent, but there is no corresponding rise in the pension. In addition, pensioners are particularly vulnerable because they have no opportunity to increase their income. So they are doing it particularly tough. Rising rents, because of increased council rates and utility rates, have led to many people falling behind. Tenants either go without food to pay rent or fall behind and are faced with eviction. Or they end up relying on emergency services or become homeless. The government must do something to address the rising costs of living. The first thing that they can do is remove this toxic carbon tax.


I move on to the private health insurance rebate which, again, has been another area that has been slashed by this government and that is hurting families. In my electorate of Brisbane, 89,920 people are covered by some form of private health insurance. That equates to 72 per cent of the voting population, which is 20 per cent above the national average. Yet this government says these people are rich. Under tier 1, the rebate is slashed by 10 per cent for singles earning $80,000 and for couples earning $160,000 per annum. Let's get this right: that is a teacher married to a policeman. They are hardworking, forgotten Australians aspiring to success and now their household costs have increased because of the increase in private health insurance premiums through the action of this government.


Another issue which is causing great concern in my electorate is the cuts to occasional child care. This government cut $12.6 million from limited childcare funding in 2010 and the state governments carried the Commonwealth's share. However, due to the poor financial state of the Queensland budget, this cannot continue beyond December 2012. So, unfortunately, childcare centres like Kitchener Road in my electorate are going to have to increase fees to parents.


In conclusion, the coalition is committed to reducing the cost of living for Australians. We will repeal the carbon tax, taking the pressure off electricity prices. We will reintroduce the private health insurance rebate. We are committed to a Productivity Commission inquiry to look at ways to offer more affordable child care. This government continues to hurt Australian families. Australian families are facing increased living costs because of this government's toxic carbon tax. The coalition can offer real relief to families. (Time expired)

Mr MITCHELL
 (McEwen) (16:23):  It is a pleasure to follow the member for Brisbane, who reminds us that it was a Liberal government that reduced the feed-in tariff to families and households—please do not walk out until I am finished, because you will love this—from 32c to 8c. You have actually ripped the guts out of it. Just for the record, I want to clear this up. I know she did not mean to deliberately mislead the House, but Queensland does not have daylight savings. You said they did. You might just want to find out where you live, mate. It is unbelievable.


I tell you what: the biggest joke was the cuts in health insurance that she talked about. What she is saying clearly is that every working family should be subsidising her health insurance, my health insurance and that of everyone else in here. That is an absolute joke.



Mr Dutton interjecting—




Mr MITCHELL:
  Don't you talk, mate. The shadow minister at the table interjects because he has not asked a question all term of the health minister. That is why he has the hashtag 'world's laziest shadow'—because he does not do anything.


Our economy is very strong because this government put in a fiscal policy that has kept us out of recession and kept us the envy of the world. We are the envy of the world because what our government has done is give assistance. We have had the biggest pension increase to pensioners we have seen. It was not under your government—in 11 years there was not a thing. You are running behind. You talk about social housing. There can be nothing clearer than the hatred of old people by those opposite when you listen to Campbell Newman saying, 'Don't live on your own. You should all get into a communal home. You should all be locked down in a little dog box together.' That is what they want. It is absolutely amazing when you listen to those opposite whinge and whine and carp, and they come up with nothing.


The simple facts are that since we have come to office we have created 100,000 jobs. Since we have had Liberal or LNP—or whatever they are calling themselves this week—premiers in different states we have seen job after job being slashed. In my home state of Victoria, over 50,000 jobs have gone. How does that help people with the cost of living?



Mr Tehan interjecting—




Mr MITCHELL:
  The mumbler for Wannon over there was out there supporting Premier Baillieu as he cut the pensioners' winter concession on power and electricity bills. He smiles and he laughs; he thinks it is fun. But it just shows that he is a heartless, empty shell. He is a very empty shell.

(

Mr MITCHELL:
  During the GFC we had the opposition leader sitting there and going to sleep. He did not think there was a GFC. He just missed the whole lot because he was snoozing. He was snoozing away in his office, doing nothing, while Treasurer Wayne Swan was getting on with the job of keeping us the strongest economy in the world, delivering things that they can only dream of. We had lower interest rates, lower unemployment, higher job growth—every major factor that you look at when you talk about the economy we had, and they sit there and wallow in their negativity. They cannot find a positive thing. I want to quote Julian Morrow because I reckon his quote was fantastic. He said that the Leader of the Opposition is so negative the only thing he would eat for an entree is an antipasto. I think that was an absolutely amazing and so truthful comment.


We have been working extremely hard to deliver the things that they cannot do. Our net debt is one-tenth that of major advanced economies. We have to tame inflation. We have a budget coming into surplus in 2013. We have done this during the toughest economic times in my lifetime. We have delivered this and we have got on with the job of making sure that we support working families. We support workers. We do that by not cutting their wages and conditions. That is really not going to help them, is it? Lose your wages and conditions and earn less money—that is the Liberal way of thinking. They have voted against every single opportunity to support families across this nation. When our bills come before the parliament, they are gone. They hide away and they keep coming up with this idea of, 'We can do it better. But we can't.' They will not release their policies. The cat was let out of the bag by the shadow minister for finance, Andrew Robb. He said they will do that at a later date because at the last election they went and got their policies audited by an auditing company and, lo and behold, that company was charged and fined for fudging the figures.


Today we learned—because Minister Emerson came out and showed us—that the $70 billion black hole has grown to $84 billion in one day. That is $84 billion that they have to find. Where are they going to find it? They are going to cut workers' jobs. They are going to cut wages and conditions. They are going to cut support to families. It is just rank hypocrisy for them to come in here and say, 'We're here to help look after the families.' The shadow minister, Sophie Mirabella, said on Q&A—




Mrs Griggs:
  What's her title?




Mr MITCHELL:
  Well, there are a lot of names for her, but we will just stick with—




Mrs Griggs:
  She's the member for Indi.




Mr MITCHELL:
  the member for Indi. She said that their small-business tax levy is an impost on families. She said: 'It is a small levy on a small number of businesses. I'm assuming businesses will have a cost structure that reflect their costs. So if that modest cost increase directly from the levy is incorporated in their prices then, sure, it is an increase.' She would have to be the only member I have ever seen get booed on the stage during Q&A. That was about the grocery tax that they are going to deliver which will cause the cost of living to increase.


We have seen right across this nation—and I have seen this in my own state of Victoria—that since the Liberal-National parties have come to power they have slugged commuters with fare increases, without delivering on their previous plans to improve public transport. They have stripped $300 from the household budgets of 100,000 families by axing the school start bonus. At a time when parents need money, when their kids are going to school for the first time, they take the money away. They take it away and what have they delivered? Absolutely nothing.


The report in the Herald Sun today showed just what the LNP think, their big priorities: 'Let's go and see if Victoria has pumas running in the wild.' Fifty thousand jobs are gone. Businesses are closing because 'Premier Faillieu' cannot do anything, and what do they do? 'We're going to go and look for pumas.' It gives you an insight into—you could not say the intelligence of those opposite, but their way of thinking. We also see that they forced up apprenticeship fees by $200 a year by cutting support for apprentices. They cut the school bonuses. They cut the education maintenance allowance for all students, putting schools in the red. That is taking away uniforms, it is taking away equipment and it is taking away excursions.


We have to go back and have a look at how their scare campaign works and how what they say can never, ever be believed. Joe Hockey, the shadow Treasurer, said on 12 March 2008:


I firmly believe we are heading into recession nationally, and this government is taking us down the path at high speed.


That was backed up by the member for Sturt, who said:


… we are definitely—


I should not use a deep voice—


… we are definitely going to be in a recession this year.


That was followed up by Tony Abbott, the Leader of the Opposition, who said:


I think what we're going to get is massive debt and a deep recession.


The great Nick Minchin, the great factional warrior—remember him?—said:


… particularly at a time when the economy is … headed for a recession.


Well, where is it? It never eventuated, because what they say and what is actually happening are two different things. They talk about carbon pricing. I tell you what: these are direct quotes from the member for Warringah. When he talked about the Medicare safety net he said it is not the same as a carbon backflip: 'It's not the same. When I said we wouldn't touch it, I meant that.' But straight after the election he said:


I faced changed circumstances. I made a choice and I'm happy to stand by it.


What we know is that circumstances were changed. They won the election, they won control of the Senate and they thumbed their noses at the Australian public. If you want to talk about untruths, you do not have to look any further than the member for Warringah and what he says.


What about this golden oldie from last year? You can imagine sitting at the Liberal Party's national conference and there is the member for Warringah. He sits there and he says: 'Reithie, mate, I'll look after you, old son. You nominate for the Liberal presidency. I'll look after you. You're the man! I'll do the right thing.' Then he turns to his left and says, 'Stockers, mate, here's my vote.' That is a deliberate untruth. He set up Peter Reith—not that I am complaining about that, but you cannot trust a word that comes out of the opposition leader's mouth. He has never ever stood by what he has said. He admits you cannot believe anything he says unless he writes it down. And then what happens? He writes it down and says, 'Oh, well, I didn't really mean that.' This government has delivered the strongest economy that we have seen. We are the envy of the world and we are going to keep delivering for families and keep your hands off the Australian economy.

Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland) (16:33):  It is a pleasure to join this matter of public importance debate. It seems that the poor member for McEwen has forgotten where he is. He still seems to be fighting his past battles in Victorian parliament. I will just remind the member for McEwen that he is now in the federal parliament. He actually broached the topic of trust. I am staggered that the member for McEwen would broach the topic of trust, because there are a few things the Australian people expect of us in this place. We come to this place and they expect us to act with honesty. They expect us to act with responsibility. They expect us to act with integrity. They also expect us to act in a way which is in the best interests of all Australians and they expect us to be trustworthy, Member for McEwen. They certainly do not expect us to say one thing before the election, something like—what was it? 'I rule out a carbon tax. There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.'




Mr Tehan:
  I haven't heard that before!




Mr CHESTER:
  You have not heard that before, Member for Wannon?




Mr Tehan:
  No. What happened?




Mr CHESTER:
  It is funny you mention that, Member for Wannon. He had not heard that before. The member for McEwen did raise the topic of trust. What Australian families do not expect is for us to make their lives harder, and that is the very essence of the matter of public importance before us today.



Mr Mitchell interjecting—




Mr CHESTER:
  The member for McEwen wants to bring up the GST. There is a significant difference between the GST and the carbon tax, and I acknowledge that the former Prime Minister did change his mind after an election. The former Prime Minister changed his mind and took it to the Australian people and gave them a chance to vote. He had the guts. He had the courage of his convictions. He went back to the Australian people and said: 'What do you think, Australian people? Would you like the GST?' And they voted for him. Have we had any other Prime Minister do anything like that? Let me think. 'No carbon tax under a government I lead. I rule out a carbon tax.' That was before the election. After the election: 'I changed my mind. Do I go back and get a mandate? No, I won't get a mandate. I'll just scurry around and do deals with the Greens.'




Mrs Griggs:
  To cling on.




Mr CHESTER:
  And cling onto power. The families of Australia acknowledge that governments cannot solve all their problems, but they can help. They certainly should not do things to make life harder for Australian people. That brings me to the fundamental issue with a carbon tax. Why make things harder for Australian businesses? Why make things harder for Australian families? This matter of public importance strikes at the very heart of this government's betrayal. It strikes at the very heart of the fundamental breach of trust of the current Prime Minister. Until this Prime Minister deals with that issue, that fundamental breach of trust, no-one will believe a single word she says.


This is a message that I get every day. The member for McEwen can bellow, he can holler, he can protest and he can rant. But he never mentions what the people in his electorate are saying to him. I know some of the people for McEwen. They are not that unusual. They are not that much different, actually, from the people in Gippsland. It is a good rural and regional mix.




Mr Mitchell:
  Most of them are intelligent.




Mr CHESTER:
  Here we go! The member for McEwen says most of his are intelligent. So now the member for McEwen is insulting every Gippslander.


You are a genius, Mensa; you are a genius! Make my job easier, will you! Okay, the people from Gippsland are not as smart people as the people from McEwen. Well done, genius! Good on you, Mensa! That will run well in the election campaign: the member for McEwen says the people in Gippsland are not very smart at all.


Well, the people in Gippsland are smart enough to reject the Labor Party. In the by-election in 2008, the people in Gippsland had the choice of voting for the great Kevin Rudd, the juggernaut at the peak of his powers, but, in a by-election, what did they do to Kevin? They took six per cent off him. At the first chance when he went to an election, they took six per cent off him. And did Kevin front up to another by-election? No, Kevin would not go to another by-election after that. He ran off and hid, and clung to power for as long as he possibly could until Julia got him.


As I was saying, the problem for the member for McEwen—and the problem for the Prime Minister—is that no-one actually believes a word the Prime Minister says. The message that I am getting from the people in Gippsland—and I am sure the member for McEwen is getting the same message—is that they cannot wait to get rid of her. They simply cannot wait to get rid of this Prime Minister. The caucus could do Australians a great favour—they could get rid of this Prime Minister. They have done it once. They could do it twice. The message we get consistently in our electorates is: 'Get rid of her. Why prolong the agony?'


The very nature of this carbon tax and of the matter of public importance that is before us today is—




Mr Ripoll:
  Oh, finally!




Mr CHESTER:
  Don't start—there has been a little bit of encouragement from the member for McEwen! The very nature of the carbon tax—and of the matter of public importance—is that it is meant to be punitive. It has to hurt to work. If it does not hurt, it does not change people's practice, it does not change their consumption of electricity and it does not change their consumption of other goods—if it does not hurt, it does not work. And the Leader of the Opposition is right when he says: 'Every time electricity prices go up, the Prime Minister smiles.' The Prime Minister likes it when prices go up because that is her carbon tax at work—that is what it is meant to do. If it does not hurt, it does not work.


If you do not believe me, look at the comments earlier this year from the Salvation Army when they polled over 1,700 of their clients. Along with pointing out a whole list of things that people on fixed and low incomes were struggling with, Major Bruce Harmer said:


The increased cost of living has clearly meant larger numbers of Australians are now struggling to keep up with rising utility bills. Many are going without things we take for granted like nutritious food or a warm bed. Many are questioning how they will get through the winter months with what appears to be a never ending increase in the cost of living.


He goes on to say:


The ever rising cost of utilities, motor vehicle expenses and running costs, food, medical expenses, etc. is intensifying the struggle and they wonder where it will end.


There is only one place it can end. It can end with the Labor Party getting rid of this Prime Minister, or with the Australian people finally getting the chance to do that in about a year's time. There is not a single problem in this country that cannot be improved with a better government. I take up the comment made by the Leader of the Opposition in his address today—a better government can start working to fix some of the problems that are being faced by families right across our nation.


I have a simple question that I have put to members opposite many times over the last 12 months when they have stood up and said: 'Oh the electricity prices are going up for a range of other reasons. The reason manufacturing is suffering at the moment is because of the high dollar.' I come back to them and ask them just one question: why make it harder? Why make it harder for Australian families? Why make it harder for Australian manufacturers? And the answer I get is the same answer I am getting now: complete silence—not a word. They have no explanation for why it is a good idea to make things harder for Australian people at an already difficult time. They have not a single answer as to why we should make it harder for Australian manufacturers to compete in very difficult world markets. They have no explanation as to why we should make it harder for families struggling with the cost of living—not a single explanation as to why we should make it harder. If the carbon tax is such a good idea, why not double it? If it is so good for Australia, double it! Why don't you double it?




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  They are intending to, actually.




Mr CHESTER:
  Is that the plan? The Australian people have a very clear choice and that choice is double or nothing. You can double it with the Labor Party, or have nothing with us. We are happy to get rid of the carbon tax.


It is a great pleasure to be here today discussing this issue of the increased cost of living. One of the other great myths—




Mr Zappia:
  You have said nothing about the motion!




Mr Ewen Jones:
  He has made it all the way through, Tony; you have been so good!




Mr CHESTER:
  Yes, the member for Makin has been very good! One of the other great myths of the carbon tax is the Prime Minister's repeated claims that the 500 so-called biggest polluters in Australia will be the only ones who will pay the carbon tax. That statement is every bit as misleading as the Prime Minister's promise that 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'. Everyone pays the carbon tax.


Our local football and netball clubs will pay through increased energy costs to run their lights and they will have to pass on those costs to their members. Local aged-care facilities—I am sure other members have been approached by local aged-care facility owners—come to me and say: 'How are we going to meet these extra energy costs? We are going to pass them on to our residents who are on very small or fixed incomes.' I have had hospital board members and chief executives come to me and say, 'Our increase in energy costs for the next financial year is in the order of $200,000 that is directly related to the carbon tax.' United Dairyfarmers of Victoria has indicated that the individual cost per dairy farm is going to be about $5,000 per year and that is a direct, added cost to these farming families, a cost they cannot recoup and they cannot pass on because they are price-takers. What concerns me is that this Prime Minister simply has no answers when it comes to the increased cost of living. I call on members opposite to do the decent thing, put this Prime Minister out of her agony, put the Australian people out of their— (Time expired)

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2012-08-22,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (16:43):  I am pleased to speak on this matter of public importance and to talk about the government's track record of assisting Australian people with living costs. Can I say before I get onto my other remarks that I was just listening to the member for Gippsland—and he spoke for 10 minutes—and he hardly referred to the motion at all. He spent all his time attacking the PM and talking about a carbon tax. There is a lot more to living than the matters that the member for Gippsland was referring to.


Contrary to the assertions of those opposite, the government does care about living costs. Whilst members opposite might selectively refer to matters to try and support their arguments, the fact of the matter is that the cost of living is about a total package of living costs. It is not about any one single item.


What is clear from today's MPI is that the opposition leader came into the chamber and spoke in relation to the MPI as a way of diverting attention away from himself, away from his dismal performance of late and away from the problems that he is undoubtedly facing. This is simply nothing more than an MPI to divert attention from the opposition leader and try to put the spotlight back onto the price of carbon.


If we are going to talk about the cost of living, then, quite frankly, let us stick to the facts. If we stick to the facts we will see an entirely different picture emerge to that that has been portrayed by opposition speakers today. Let me start by talking about inflation. When this government came to office at the end of 2007, headline inflation was three per cent. The last figure I have—June 2012—is 1.2 per cent, which is a significant drop. Inflation is usually the indicator that tells you whether costs are going up or not. Those costs are generally reflected in the cost of living in all sectors.


Let us also look at interest rates. When this government came to office interest rates were 6.75 per cent. A couple of months after the government took office the rates went to over seven per cent. Interest rates today are 3.5 per cent; that is the Reserve Bank cash rate. They are half of what they were when we came to office. Even if you look at the variable rate, it is significantly lower than it was when this government came to office. That, in my view, is doing something for families—bringing interest rates down—because in my electorate, for the 21,600 home owners who have a mortgage—and I assume most mortgages across the country sit at around a couple of hundred thousand dollars—that means something in the order of $6,000 or $7,000 less payments in interest being made each year. That is real money that families had to fork out which they are now able to reduce because interest rates have come down.


Let us also look at tax cuts because tax cuts are all about assisting families with real money in your pocket in order to meet the cost of living. Since this government has come to office, a person on around $50,000 a year is now paying around $2,000 a year less in tax. I put it to the House that that is substantial savings in the amount of tax being paid by wage earners around the country. That $2,000 will go a long way to offsetting some of the costs that householders have to meet. In fact, by increasing the tax threshold from $6,000 to $18,000, it has meant that just about every taxpayer has made a minimum of about $300—simply as a result of that move alone. Today there are about one million taxpayers around the country who do not even have to lodge a tax return—a tax return which, again, probably cost them money because they had to go to a tax accountant in order to lodge it.


One of the most significant areas where this government have acted to assist with the cost of living has been with respect to the support that we have provided pensioners. We have spoken in this House about this matter time and time again. After almost 12 years whilst the opposition were in government they did nothing to assist pensioners around this country. We came to office and have since increased the single pension by about $154 a fortnight and for couples combined by $156. We have increased the utilities allowance by around $400 and, today, a single pensioner gets an income of about $19,600 and couples combined get $29,600. In addition to that, we changed the pensioner cost-of-living index to better reflect the real costs of living—which is the matter we are talking about—for pensioners throughout this country. Further to that we have also increased the amount to $10,400 that pensioners can earn and still claim their maximum pensions.


Let us turn to families and have a look at what we have done. Paid parental leave was brought in by this government. It is all right for the Leader of the Opposition to come in now and say how he is going to do it one better. The reality is that they did nothing about it whilst they were in government and, in fact, my understanding is that the Leader of the Opposition personally opposed the introduction of paid parental leave. This government did bring it in and, today, that means $606 a week for someone who is on paid parental leave. I understand that, to date, about 160,000 families across the country have benefited from the government's 18 weeks of paid parental leave. As from 1 January 2013 there will be a dad and partner pay introduced to assist the partners and dads when children are born.


With respect to the childcare rebate, this is something that members opposite continually harp on about in regard to the fact that we have capped it at $7,500. Can I say that we increased the rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent, which is a much larger amount of money that families are entitled to than they ever were under the coalition. That means that families are now entitled to $7,500 in childcare rebate per child, which is almost $3,000 more than they would have been entitled to had this government not been elected.


Then there is the Teen Dental Plan worth $163 or thereabouts to each child to assist with preventive dental checks. These are real costs that real families meet on a regular basis. This government understands that and that is exactly why it has brought in a teen dental plan to assist those families. I understand that there has been something like 1.5 million check-ups funded under this program.


Lastly, in respect to children there is the Schoolkids Bonus; the $410 that we are providing to every primary school child and the $820 to secondary school children. That is real money that goes to the families of this country and will assist with meeting cost-of-living expenses. School fees are cost-of-living expenses and this government has, again, done something very specific about assisting families to meet those costs. In addition to that families have been supported by increasing family support by up to $4,200 per year for each teenager that continues to live at home. From July 2013 there will be $600 per year to family tax benefit part A payments also made available. In addition to that there is the $600 annual carer's supplement boost. I could go on about the payments and support payments that this government has provided since coming to office to assist families with the costs of living that they incur. I want to finish on a couple of other matters and the one I will touch on is jobs.



If you really want to support families, the best thing you can do for them is ensure that people have jobs, because if they have jobs they have income and if they have income they can meet their living costs. This government, since coming to office at a time when we have endured a global economic recession, has been able to create 800,000 new jobs and keep unemployment to just over five per cent. That speaks for itself. In my view, that does more to assist families than anything else I could refer to. At a time when other Western nations in most parts of the world are confronted with double-digit unemployment figures, this country is still on just over five per cent. While people are employed, they have got income and that is the most important thing we could do for them. (Time expired)

Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (17:06):  I rise to talk briefly on the Statute Law Revision Bill. This bill is to correct technical errors caused by drafting and clerical mistakes, to repeal obsolete provisions in acts, to modernise language and to make other technical amendments to the legislation. Bills of this nature are traditionally non-controversial and receive the support of parliament because they are regarded as an essential tool in the process of keeping the Commonwealth statute books accurate and up to date. The acts to be repealed are self-evidently obsolete and have been repealed by the legislation. Of the acts to be amended, most of the proposals relate to spelling, grammatical and technical errors and the removal of gender-specific language.


The amendments will replace specific legislative references with generic ones. This will make Commonwealth legislation easier to use. The bill also proposes amendments to ensure consistency of language and correct technical errors. A number of obsolete acts are also repealed. 


This parliament has a strong tradition of passing statute law revision bills in a bipartisan manner since they were introduced by the Fraser government in 1981. In a second reading speech to the Statute Law Revision Bill 1981 the then Liberal Party Attorney-General, Senator Durack, said: 


The government has decided to introduce statute law revision bills into the parliament on a regular basis—at least once a year and if required once in each sitting. This will enable the prompt correction of mistakes and errors and removal from the statute books of expired laws. 


Bills of this nature are regarded as an essential tool in the process of keeping the Commonwealth statute books accurate and up-to-date. It is self-evident that the opposition would not be opposing such a cleaning up exercise and I am therefore happy to highlight the opposition's support for this bill.

"Rowland, Michelle, MP",ALP,2012-08-22,"



Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (17:08):  I would like to start by declaring—some may say confessing—my fascination with bills of this nature, which I enjoy reading and analysing and about which I relish the opportunity to provide comment. While some may take the view that the process of typographical review, repealing defunct legislation and correcting referencing errors in statute law is a tedious yet necessary exercise, I think it epitomises a robust, best-practice approach to law-making, which is one of the foundations of the democratic processes of this parliament.


Members of parliament, legal practitioners, government agencies, regulators and the public generally have a right to assume that the law as printed is error-free, that it accurately reflects its legislative intention and that its ambiguity is minimised by factors such as the inaccurate placement of punctuation. Indeed, it was a year ago to the day that I rose in this place to extol the merits of the Legislative Instruments (Sunsetting) Bill 2011, which I described as dealing with a fundamental piece of statutory interpretation and rule making— namely, the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. It has certainly been a big year. Just to add to my form in bills of this nature, I was also pleased to add my support on 23 June last year to the Statute Stocktake Bill (No.1) 2011.


And so it is the case for this Statute Law Revision Bill. It is instructive to peruse the website of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel and learn about its functions and the principles which guide its practice for producing clearer laws. I would particularly like to mention the five points set out in its commentary on clearer Commonwealth law, which provide a concise statement of best-practice law-making. It states:


Policymakers, instructing agencies and drafters should apply the following general principles when developing Commonwealth legislation:


1.   Consider all implementation options—don't legislate if you don't have to.


2.   When developing policy, reducing complexity should be a core consideration.


3.   Laws should be no more complex than is necessary to give effect to policy.


4.   Legislation should enable those affected to understand how the law applies to them.


5.   The clarity of a proposed law should be continually assessed—from policy development through to consideration by Parliament (for Acts) or consideration by the rule-maker (for legislative instruments).


It is no wonder, then, that Australian legal drafting is recognised as some of the best in the world. Certainly, in our region, I am aware that Australia's overseas assistance through capacity-building projects to establish legal institutions and draft legislative instruments is first class. In my former life as a legal practitioner, I was fortunate to work on a number of such projects for overseas regulators, companies and governments—sometimes privately funded but in many cases facilitated by donor agencies, such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. 


The reputation for Australian law and legal drafting is indeed very high. Let me give some examples. Malaysia's Communi­cations and Multimedia Act has at its core an access regime whose drafting mirrors that of part XIC of the then Trade Practices Act. I was fortunate to work on a review and expansion of the access list determination, again providing a great opportunity to undertake a consultative process and the drafting of such instruments. 


In Samoa I was involved in drafting regulations regarding radio communications and telecommunications, and I assisted on what was known as the Mekong Project, headed by then partner of Gilbert + Tobin, Angus Henderson, who drafted a number of groundbreaking regulations for telecom­munications in the Lao PDR, Cambodia and Vietnam. 


Our piece de resistance was our work in Ramallah, drafting a new telecommunications law and establishing a regulator. I can say with great confidence that, whenever we did go to these areas of the world, we found that the reputation of Australian law-making and drafting was held in very high regard. 


Since I have the opportunity to talk about law drafting here, I would also like to mention a groundbreaking piece of law-making, which occurred recently in Hong Kong and on which I also had the pleasure of working. It was one of the last matters I worked on at Gilbert + Tobin and something that has come to fruition quite recently. I would like to pay tribute to the work of partner Peter Waters, who headed the team advising the Hong Kong government on its policy development, which formed the basis of Hong Kong's first cross-sector competition bill. It was gazetted shortly after I left the firm, and on 14 June this year it was finally enacted into Hong Kong law. 


I have placed on record before that Peter Waters is one of the great legal teachers I have had. In a similar vein to the best-practice drafting that I noted for the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, he said of the competition law:


The Bill is built around three principles. First, it should reflect modern economic thinking about competition and regulation—for example, it does not automatically outlaw any conduct (i.e. on a per se basis). Second, it should also reflect Hong Kong's unique characteristics as a small, open market, which is the reason for the law to have a modest scope. Third, it should be capable of delivering business certainty, which is reflected in the mechanisms for individual and block exemptions. 


I would like to pay tribute again to a great example of legislative drafting, consistent with Australia's drafting generally of statue law, which has had overseas influence and I am sure will continue to be the case. 


I took the opportunity to have a look at some of the statute law revision projects occurring around the world. One that I found very interesting—I know you will be interested in this, Madam Deputy Speaker O'Neill—is the case of Ireland. Ireland is undertaking a phased statute law revision project to ultimately lead to the codification of the Irish statute book. The project has undertaken an analysis of all legislation of the various Irish, English, British and UK parliaments which exercised authority over Ireland prior to Ireland becoming independent as well as legislation that was passed since 1922. 


It identified a staggering 63,000 statutes that came within its remit for examination. A number of acts on statute law revision have passed since the project commenced. The 2005 act repealed a total of 207 specifically identified pre-independence public general acts. In 2007 a similar act provided a list of no fewer than 1,364 statues which were to remain in force after enactment of the bill. Apart from those statutes, all other pre-independence public general acts were repealed. The office of the Attorney-General in Ireland states:


The effect of this was that more than 3,225 statutes were expressly repealed by the Act—


the 2007 act—


making it the largest statute law revision measure ever to apply in Ireland, and, so far as the Government is aware, the largest single repealing Act ever enacted anywhere. 


In 2009 a similar statute law revision act expressly repealed a total of 1,351 acts and a further 8,965 acts were implicitly repealed by the 2009 act. My understanding now is that the project is in the process of undertaking—or perhaps is close to completing—public consultation on a similar 2012 bill. This is the final phase of the review, which I will be following closely, as I am sure you will, Madam Deputy Speaker. Subject to consultation, the government has proposed to retain approximately 800 such acts enacted between 1750 and 1922. It will repeal about 2,900 acts and implicitly repeal approximately 19,000 acts which would no longer be deemed to apply to Ireland. That gives an indication of the scale and importance of statute law revision bills of this type. 


I talked about how this bill proposes to correct a number of typographical errors. I remember one celebrated case from 2006—maybe not celebrated by some—that gives an example of grammar gone wrong. As the headline in an article from the New York Times from 25 October 2006 very accurately describes it, it is a case of 'The comma that costs $1 million (Canadian)'. The issue at stake was a 14-page contract between Rogers Communications of Toronto, Canada's largest cable TV provider, and Bell Aliant, a telephone company in Atlantic Canada. The question of whether a single comma was placed in the right position led to a difference of Can$1 million. As the New York Times article states: 


Citing the “rules of punctuation,” Canada’s telecommunications regulator recently ruled that the comma allowed Bell Aliant to end its five-year agreement with Rogers—


about the use of telephone poles—


at any time with notice.


…      …   …


The dispute is over this sentence: “This agreement shall be effective from the date it is made and shall continue in force for a period of five (5) years from the date it is made, and thereafter for successive five (5) year terms, unless and until terminated by one year prior notice in writing by either party.”


The regulator concluded that the second comma—


after 'successive five (5) year terms'—


meant that the part of the sentence describing the one-year notice for cancellation applied to both the five-year term as well as its renewal. Therefore, the regulator found, the phone company could escape the contract after as little as one year.


This case is really interesting. Rogers commissioned a 69-page affidavit, mostly about commas, from Kenneth Adams, a lawyer from Garden City in New York, who is the author of two books on contract language. You can see how, again, the issue of punctuation can make an incredible difference to both contract interpretation and, in turn, statutory interpretation. 


I would like to conclude in the time left to me by congratulating Stephen Gageler on his recent appointment to the High Court, where I am sure he will do an absolutely exemplary job. I had some exposure to Stephen Gageler—he will not remember me at all; I was a mere minion—in my first year as a lawyer. He was giving an opinion on something to do with Hong Kong law—just by coincidence. It was the first barrister's opinion that I ever read. I remember coming back from his chambers and one of my colleagues asking me, 'What was it like going to his chambers and hearing him talk about his brief?' I remember saying something like, 'This man has an enormous brain.' It was quite something to be in his company. 


A lot has been written about Stephen Gageler recently and the Attorney-General and others have made very positive comments about the fact that he is a very highly regarded, very highly respected member of the legal profession. It is worth noting that Mr Gageler is a product of the public education system, which I think is a wonderful thing.


He attended Giants Creek Primary School and Muswellbrook High School in Muswellbrook. The fact that people such as Stephen Gageler are being elevated to the High Court demonstrates how important our public school system is. I have been speaking about Gonski to a lot of schools in my area recently, and, as I did in my maiden speech, I often tell the story of my own husband: this bloke who grew up in a public housing area of Mount Druitt and went to Shalvey Primary School and Shalvey High School. He could not even speak English when he started school, and it was thanks to teachers taking an interest in him, encouraging him at every step of the way and—even to this day—staying in contact with him and seeing how he was progressing that he was able to get into Sydney University and get first-class honours in not one but two degrees: economics and law. He is now a partner with Corrs Chambers Westgarth. Today, unfortunately for me, he is in Melbourne because he is now lecturing in a new superannuation course which Melbourne University is running.


It is a marvellous thing to reflect on people who come through our public school system and on their achievements. I congratulate Stephen Gageler on his appointment to the High Court.

Mr MELHAM
 (Banks) (17:24):  In the same spirit as the previous two speakers offered their congratulations, I congratulate Stephen Gageler on his appointment to the High Court. I know that there is rejoicing at the New South Wales bar. He is held in very high regard and will be an adornment to the High Court. I think that he is a wonderful replacement for Mr Justice Gummow, who will retire in October—and I will have something to say about Justice Gummow at a later date.


I rise also to speak in support of the Statute Law Revision Bill 2012. Bills of this type have been used regularly over the past 30 years as an essential tool in keeping the Commonwealth statute book accurate and up-to-date. Such bills do not make substantive change to the law or implement new government policy. As such, they are rarely controversial. Nonetheless, they fulfil a vital function.


This bill reflects the fact that the government is making sure that Commonwealth law is easy to follow and understand. The government is pursuing a comprehensive deregulation agenda, led by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation, to remove or reform unnecessary or poorly-designed regulation and reduce costs to business. This in turn will enhance productivity and competitiveness within Australia and allow Australian companies to expand overseas.


The OECD Review of Regulatory Reform in Australia for 2010 noted:


Australia is one of the front-running countries in the OECD in terms of its regulatory reform practices.


The government's focus is on ensuring that Australia's regulatory framework is fit for purpose, is developed in consultation with stakeholders and does not impose unnecessary compliance cost burdens on businesses and the not-for-profit sector. A good example of this focus is a bill—the Legislative Instruments Amendment (Sunsetting Measures) Bill 2012—which was brought forward by the Attorney-General and recently passed by this House. The sunsetting measures bill will remove thousands of redundant or ambiguous regulations from the federal register of legislative instruments over the coming years. Importantly, this will be done in close consultation with affected industries to avoid confusion or concern about wholesale removal of regulatory structures. Removals of this type would have occurred under the opposition's proposed structure.


The Statute Law Revision Bill 2012 includes amendments to repeal spent legislation and correct typographical errors, to improve the numbering of provisions and to ensure that cross-references remain accurate. Schedule 3 of the bill replaces references to specific civil aviation regulations concerning aircraft with generic references to the principal Civil Aviation Act 1988. Current drafting practice is to avoid referring to particular regulations by name in order to reduce the risk of reader confusion where the names of regulations change or the content of regulations alter. This change is an important step in ensuring that the regulations interact properly with the principal act and that users are able to clearly follow both the parent act and regulations underneath it.


This bill also makes consequential amendments to the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. This item of legislation is a cornerstone of Australian legislative interpretation—a fact that is drilled into all first-year law students. It must remain relevant and up-to-date so that it remains a strong, functional guide to other Commonwealth legislation.


The bill also replaces references to specific ministers and departments with definitions which identify ministers and departments by reference to the acts they administer. This will ensure that the references remain accurate even if any specific title changes. There has always been a risk that some references can be missed when ministers and departments change titles, which can lead to confusion or concern about the legal validity of action years down the track. This change is a practical, sensible step to avoid these potential risks in the future.


I take this opportunity to thank and commend the Office of Parliamentary Counsel for its hard work both on this legislation and over the term of this parliament. Drafting complex legislation within tight timeframes is often a thankless task, but the office has delivered the legislation necessary not only to this government's major reforms but also to reforms made by previous governments.


When I was the Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs from 1993 to 1996, I had a little bit to do with the Office of Legislative Drafting and the Office of Parliamentary Counsel. We are very fortunate that we have very professional public servants supporting this parliament, and we should not take their professionalism for granted. These are people who have dedicated themselves to their jobs, and we as a parliament are better off for it. I commend the bill to the House.

Ms BIRD
 (Cunningham—Parliamentary Secretary for Higher Education and Skills) (17:30):  On behalf of the Attorney-General, I thank members for their contribution to the debate on the Statute Law Revision Bill 2012. This bill may not be the most controversial to have been introduced in this term of parliament, but it is a testament to the dedication and attention to detail of government drafters to make sure that the Commonwealth statute book is free from error or ambiguity. I am encouraged that such bills continue to attract bipartisan support in this parliament and applaud the speakers for digging deep to find some interesting components of these largely technical changes.


The government is proud to facilitate and support the passage of statute law revision bills, which perform a vital service in improving the quality of Commonwealth legislation. The regular review of legislation by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel enables minor errors in the Commonwealth statute books to be efficiently addressed and improves the accuracy and usability of Commonwealth acts.


These improvements reflect the government's commitment to creating clearer and more accessible Commonwealth laws, an important component of our agenda to improve access to justice. We have seen this in other recent bills, including the Legislative Instruments Act (Sunsetting Measures) Bill, which will assist in the removal of thousands of redundant regulations over coming years, and the Access to Justice (Federal Jurisdiction) Amendment Bill, which will reform court discovery processes and better define and deal with vexatious litigants who clog up court time.


This bill also makes a small but useful amendment by removing specific references to the Civil Aviation Regulations, replacing them with references to the principal act, which are more generic and flexible. Current drafting practice is to avoid referring to particular regulations by name. This reduces the risk of reader confusion and error in cases where the names of the regulations change or the contents of the regulations alter.


Additionally, this bill amends references to specific ministers and departments, and in doing so will have a particular impact on the clarity and usability of a large number of Commonwealth laws. By inserting generic references to the names of ministers and departments, the bill will allow users of legislation to more easily identify the appropriate minister or department with relevant authority under an act, even after machinery-of-government changes occur.


The Office of Parliamentary Counsel works closely with the Attorney-General's Department and other agencies to obtain and assess possible amendments to include in statute law revision bills. I commend the office for the quality of this bill and for its commitment to maintaining the accuracy and clarity of Commonwealth laws. I therefore commend the bill to the House.

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2012-08-22,"



Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (17:06):  I rise to talk briefly on the Statute Law Revision Bill. This bill is to correct technical errors caused by drafting and clerical mistakes, to repeal obsolete provisions in acts, to modernise language and to make other technical amendments to the legislation. Bills of this nature are traditionally non-controversial and receive the support of parliament because they are regarded as an essential tool in the process of keeping the Commonwealth statute books accurate and up to date. The acts to be repealed are self-evidently obsolete and have been repealed by the legislation. Of the acts to be amended, most of the proposals relate to spelling, grammatical and technical errors and the removal of gender-specific language.


The amendments will replace specific legislative references with generic ones. This will make Commonwealth legislation easier to use. The bill also proposes amendments to ensure consistency of language and correct technical errors. A number of obsolete acts are also repealed. 


This parliament has a strong tradition of passing statute law revision bills in a bipartisan manner since they were introduced by the Fraser government in 1981. In a second reading speech to the Statute Law Revision Bill 1981 the then Liberal Party Attorney-General, Senator Durack, said: 


The government has decided to introduce statute law revision bills into the parliament on a regular basis—at least once a year and if required once in each sitting. This will enable the prompt correction of mistakes and errors and removal from the statute books of expired laws. 


Bills of this nature are regarded as an essential tool in the process of keeping the Commonwealth statute books accurate and up-to-date. It is self-evident that the opposition would not be opposing such a cleaning up exercise and I am therefore happy to highlight the opposition's support for this bill.

"Rowland, Michelle, MP",ALP,2012-08-22,"



Ms ROWLAND
 (Greenway) (17:08):  I would like to start by declaring—some may say confessing—my fascination with bills of this nature, which I enjoy reading and analysing and about which I relish the opportunity to provide comment. While some may take the view that the process of typographical review, repealing defunct legislation and correcting referencing errors in statute law is a tedious yet necessary exercise, I think it epitomises a robust, best-practice approach to law-making, which is one of the foundations of the democratic processes of this parliament.


Members of parliament, legal practitioners, government agencies, regulators and the public generally have a right to assume that the law as printed is error-free, that it accurately reflects its legislative intention and that its ambiguity is minimised by factors such as the inaccurate placement of punctuation. Indeed, it was a year ago to the day that I rose in this place to extol the merits of the Legislative Instruments (Sunsetting) Bill 2011, which I described as dealing with a fundamental piece of statutory interpretation and rule making— namely, the Legislative Instruments Act 2003. It has certainly been a big year. Just to add to my form in bills of this nature, I was also pleased to add my support on 23 June last year to the Statute Stocktake Bill (No.1) 2011.


And so it is the case for this Statute Law Revision Bill. It is instructive to peruse the website of the Office of Parliamentary Counsel and learn about its functions and the principles which guide its practice for producing clearer laws. I would particularly like to mention the five points set out in its commentary on clearer Commonwealth law, which provide a concise statement of best-practice law-making. It states:


Policymakers, instructing agencies and drafters should apply the following general principles when developing Commonwealth legislation:


1.   Consider all implementation options—don't legislate if you don't have to.


2.   When developing policy, reducing complexity should be a core consideration.


3.   Laws should be no more complex than is necessary to give effect to policy.


4.   Legislation should enable those affected to understand how the law applies to them.


5.   The clarity of a proposed law should be continually assessed—from policy development through to consideration by Parliament (for Acts) or consideration by the rule-maker (for legislative instruments).


It is no wonder, then, that Australian legal drafting is recognised as some of the best in the world. Certainly, in our region, I am aware that Australia's overseas assistance through capacity-building projects to establish legal institutions and draft legislative instruments is first class. In my former life as a legal practitioner, I was fortunate to work on a number of such projects for overseas regulators, companies and governments—sometimes privately funded but in many cases facilitated by donor agencies, such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. 


The reputation for Australian law and legal drafting is indeed very high. Let me give some examples. Malaysia's Communi­cations and Multimedia Act has at its core an access regime whose drafting mirrors that of part XIC of the then Trade Practices Act. I was fortunate to work on a review and expansion of the access list determination, again providing a great opportunity to undertake a consultative process and the drafting of such instruments. 


In Samoa I was involved in drafting regulations regarding radio communications and telecommunications, and I assisted on what was known as the Mekong Project, headed by then partner of Gilbert + Tobin, Angus Henderson, who drafted a number of groundbreaking regulations for telecom­munications in the Lao PDR, Cambodia and Vietnam. 


Our piece de resistance was our work in Ramallah, drafting a new telecommunications law and establishing a regulator. I can say with great confidence that, whenever we did go to these areas of the world, we found that the reputation of Australian law-making and drafting was held in very high regard. 


Since I have the opportunity to talk about law drafting here, I would also like to mention a groundbreaking piece of law-making, which occurred recently in Hong Kong and on which I also had the pleasure of working. It was one of the last matters I worked on at Gilbert + Tobin and something that has come to fruition quite recently. I would like to pay tribute to the work of partner Peter Waters, who headed the team advising the Hong Kong government on its policy development, which formed the basis of Hong Kong's first cross-sector competition bill. It was gazetted shortly after I left the firm, and on 14 June this year it was finally enacted into Hong Kong law. 


I have placed on record before that Peter Waters is one of the great legal teachers I have had. In a similar vein to the best-practice drafting that I noted for the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, he said of the competition law:


The Bill is built around three principles. First, it should reflect modern economic thinking about competition and regulation—for example, it does not automatically outlaw any conduct (i.e. on a per se basis). Second, it should also reflect Hong Kong's unique characteristics as a small, open market, which is the reason for the law to have a modest scope. Third, it should be capable of delivering business certainty, which is reflected in the mechanisms for individual and block exemptions. 


I would like to pay tribute again to a great example of legislative drafting, consistent with Australia's drafting generally of statue law, which has had overseas influence and I am sure will continue to be the case. 


I took the opportunity to have a look at some of the statute law revision projects occurring around the world. One that I found very interesting—I know you will be interested in this, Madam Deputy Speaker O'Neill—is the case of Ireland. Ireland is undertaking a phased statute law revision project to ultimately lead to the codification of the Irish statute book. The project has undertaken an analysis of all legislation of the various Irish, English, British and UK parliaments which exercised authority over Ireland prior to Ireland becoming independent as well as legislation that was passed since 1922.

Apart from those statutes, all other pre-independence public general acts were repealed. The office of the Attorney-General in Ireland states:

making it the largest statute law revision measure ever to apply in Ireland, and, so far as the Government is aware, the largest single repealing Act ever enacted anywhere. 


In 2009 a similar statute law revision act expressly repealed a total of 1,351 acts and a further 8,965 acts were implicitly repealed by the 2009 act. My understanding now is that the project is in the process of undertaking—or perhaps is close to completing—public consultation on a similar 2012 bill. This is the final phase of the review, which I will be following closely, as I am sure you will, Madam Deputy Speaker. Subject to consultation, the government has proposed to retain approximately 800 such acts enacted between 1750 and 1922. It will repeal about 2,900 acts and implicitly repeal approximately 19,000 acts which would no longer be deemed to apply to Ireland. That gives an indication of the scale and importance of statute law revision bills of this type. 


I talked about how this bill proposes to correct a number of typographical errors. I remember one celebrated case from 2006—maybe not celebrated by some—that gives an example of grammar gone wrong.

This bill may not be the most controversial to have been introduced in this term of parliament, but it is a testament to the dedication and attention to detail of government drafters to make sure that the Commonwealth statute book is free from error or ambiguity. I am encouraged that such bills continue to attract bipartisan support in this parliament and applaud the speakers for digging deep to find some interesting components of these largely technical changes.


The government is proud to facilitate and support the passage of statute law revision bills, which perform a vital service in improving the quality of Commonwealth legislation. The regular review of legislation by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel enables minor errors in the Commonwealth statute books to be efficiently addressed and improves the accuracy and usability of Commonwealth acts.


These improvements reflect the government's commitment to creating clearer and more accessible Commonwealth laws, an important component of our agenda to improve access to justice. We have seen this in other recent bills, including the Legislative Instruments Act (Sunsetting Measures) Bill, which will assist in the removal of thousands of redundant regulations over coming years, and the Access to Justice (Federal Jurisdiction) Amendment Bill, which will reform court discovery processes and better define and deal with vexatious litigants who clog up court time.


This bill also makes a small but useful amendment by removing specific references to the Civil Aviation Regulations, replacing them with references to the principal act, which are more generic and flexible. Current drafting practice is to avoid referring to particular regulations by name. This reduces the risk of reader confusion and error in cases where the names of the regulations change or the contents of the regulations alter.


Additionally, this bill amends references to specific ministers and departments, and in doing so will have a particular impact on the clarity and usability of a large number of Commonwealth laws. By inserting generic references to the names of ministers and departments, the bill will allow users of legislation to more easily identify the appropriate minister or department with relevant authority under an act, even after machinery-of-government changes occur.


The Office of Parliamentary Counsel works closely with the Attorney-General's Department and other agencies to obtain and assess possible amendments to include in statute law revision bills. I commend the office for the quality of this bill and for its commitment to maintaining the accuracy and clarity of Commonwealth laws. I therefore commend the bill to the House.


Question agreed to.

Mr FLETCHER
 (Bradfield) (18:59):  I am pleased to rise to discuss the question of governance standards in the superannuation sector with particular reference to Local Government Super, the fund with responsibility for over $5 billion of the retirement savings of some 90,000 local government employees in New South Wales. Local Government Super has delivered rather unimpressive returns in the most recent financial year. According to the most recent performance rankings from Chant West, the respected ratings firm, the LGSS Balanced Growth fund ranked 51st out of 62, with a return of minus 0.9 per cent for the year to 30 June 2012.


This raises a number of interesting questions. First, LG Super recently released a media release trumpeting that it had been awarded as Money magazine's Best Green Super Fund 2012. What priority does LG Super attach to green investing as opposed to generating good returns for its members? Next, LG Super is named as a member of Businesses for a Clean Economy, which ran full-page advertisements in national newspapers in early July expressing support for the carbon tax. Did LG Super contribute to the cost of this advertisement and, if so, how did this serve the interests of members in maximising their retirement savings?


Next, what is the approach being taken by the Investment Committee of LG Super, chaired by a Mr Ian Robertson, of the Development and Environmental Professionals' Association, and on which Mr Sam Byrne, a former Greens councillor on Marrickville Council, also serves? Mr Byrne, the ex Greens councillor, is supposedly an employer representative under the so-called 'equal representation model' under which LG Super unfortunately labours. How can this be meaningful when he is no longer actually on a council?


Next, how representative in reality is the current model for appointing directors, under which four are appointed by the Local Government Association of NSW and the Shires Association of NSW between them, two by the United Services Union, one by the Development and Environmental Professionals' Association and one by the Local Government Engineers' Association? How many of the over 90,000 members of LG Super are members of the Development and Environmental Professionals' Associa­tion, which is rather a small union? More broadly, how representative is such a model of the interests of employee members of the scheme, given that unionisation in the local government sector is declining and across the workforce at large stands at only around 18 per cent of employees?


Next, what is the expertise in investment management amongst the eight members of the LG Super board? How many of its eight directors have formal qualifications in, or extensive business experience in, managing large pools of financial assets? With directors receiving fees of between $40,000 and $60,000, do the union officials on this board, such as Mr Graeme Kelly, General Secretary of the United Services Union, and Mr Ian Robertson, Secretary of DEPA, pass on their fees to the union which appointed them, or do they regard the fee as a nice little supplement to their earnings as union officials?


LG Super formerly owned half of a company called FuturePlus Financial Services Pty Ltd, before selling it to the Energy Industries Superannuation Scheme. What is the price at which that sale occurred, and how successful an investment was FuturePlus for members of LG Super? For a number of years FuturePlus Financial Services was appointed to provide administ­ration services to LG Super. Was this appointment subject to a competitive market process to test whether the members of these funds were getting the best possible value?


Next, how much did LG Super pay in 2004 when it purchased Local Government Financial Services? Did LG Super inject funds into this company in 2009, and was this a wise use of members' funds and likely to maximise their retirement savings?


Next, why did APRA refuse to grant a freedom-of-information request made in 2011 by the Northern Sydney Regional Organisation of Councils seeking further information about the nature of reviews conducted by APRA into the operations of LG Super?


Next, why has the Minister for Financial Services and Superannuation, Minister Shorten, refused to act on the recommendations of his government's own Cooper review regarding governance standards in the superannuation sector, including a recommendation that the so-called equal representation model—which is code for unions having a privileged role in the governance of superannuation funds—should no longer be mandatory? The review also recommended that, where equal representation does apply, there should be at least one-third of directors on the board who are independent and that directors who want to sit on multiple boards must demonstrate to APRA that they do not have any foreseeable conflicts of interest. Has LG Super achieved standards of governance which are satisfactory, given its vital task of stewarding the retirement savings of its members, and would those standards be lifted if Minister Shorten had acted on the recommendations of the Cooper review?


All of these are important questions, and I believe they are questions that members of LG Super and others with an interest in public policy in this area would like to see answers to.

"Cobb, John, MP",Nats,2012-08-22,"



Mr JOHN COBB
 (Calare) (09:30):  I rise today to discuss how much this Labor government's toxic carbon tax is hurting local business and, in particular, local business in the Calare electorate.


The shadow Treasurer and I recently visited businesses in Calare to talk about the carbon tax. One was Village Meats in Bathurst, run by George Kusely and his family. They own three butcher shops in Bathurst and Lithgow, and a beef stud, Speckle Park, and they employ more than 30 local people. What George had to tell us about the impact of the carbon tax was horrendous. Electricity bills are up 18 per cent; killing costs at the abattoir are up five per cent; and everything from freight costs to the cost of cardboard boxes is increasing. In George's words, the cost of the carbon tax is 'never ending'. But worst of all, George says, is the increased cost of refrigeration and cold storage. For one of George's smaller coolrooms—he has six altogether—a recent refill of refrigerant gases cost $377. That is up from $108, an increase of more than 300 per cent.


Those opposite try to defend their toxic tax by saying people should report dramatic increases in bills to the ACCC. Well, that will not work this time. The incompetent lot opposite did not even think about the impact of the carbon tax on cold storage when they constructed this scheme. It never crossed their minds. This is what local newspaper the Central Western Daily reported when the Greens leader visited Calare in April this year:


The cost of cool storage, which growers estimate could rise by several thousand dollars per year under the carbon tax, was one aspect which Senator Milne admits may have been overlooked by the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee on which she sat.


That is the end of the quote, but I think it is worth repeating:


The cost of cool storage, which growers estimate could rise by several thousand dollars per year under the carbon tax, was one aspect which Senator Milne—


that is, the Leader of the Australian Greens—


admits may have been overlooked by the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee on which she sat.


The multiparty committee, as I recall, consisted of the government and the Greens, with a couple of Independents thrown in for good measure. For this Labor government to blame anyone but itself for the outrageous increase in refrigerant and cold storage costs is blatantly deceitful.

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2012-08-22,"



Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (10:00):  The coalition welcome the opportunity to support the Customs Amendment (Smuggled Tobacco) Bill 2012 but it is important to note that the bill has been debated in the wake of the Labor government's inconsistent and incompetent handling of this issue. While the Attorney-General is on a tobacco plain-packaging crusade and while her government introduced a rushed budget measure to ban duty-free tobacco, the Attorney is not willing to admit that tobacco smuggling is a problem in Australia, despite introducing a bill to that effect.


In the Attorney's second reading speech, she said that to date tobacco smuggling had not represented a major threat in Australia. It would seem contradictory to the opposition that we are debating this bill today if, according to the government, there is no particular threat posed by tobacco smuggling. This is clearly an issue the government is in denial on and it is refusing to address with any real conviction or action.


In the 2009-10 budget Labor cut funding for the Customs cargo screening program by $58.1 million. That is an enormous cut and the result is that the number of sea cargo inspections has been cut by 25 per cent and air cargo inspections reduced by a staggering 75 per cent. With less cargo being screened, there is a greater opportunity for illicit tobacco to be smuggled through our borders and indeed a greater opportunity for a lot of illicit materials, such as illicit guns, drugs and the precursors to drugs. The problem with these cuts is that they give criminals much better odds of being able to bring contraband into Australia. That should be condemned by everybody in this parliament. I note very strongly that the coalition will reverse this cut and make sure that Customs can screen cargo when it crosses our borders in a way that we would expect them to do to protect Australia from what might come over our borders.


The industry commissioned a report by Deloitte on the illicit trade of tobacco in Australia and it confirmed that illegal tobacco was a significant problem. The report found that the illicit market in Australia in 2011 was estimated to be a total of 2.26 million kilograms of tobacco, which is equivalent to 13.4 per cent of the estimated legal tobacco market. It is estimated that this represents forgone tobacco excise revenue of approximately $1 billion based on current excise rates.


While figures on the illegal tobacco market will vary and, clearly, it is difficult to find the appropriate methodology to assess how large this market is, we do have very strong indications that this is a problem and that illegal tobacco is smuggled through our borders. It is fair to say, as opposed to what the government is saying, that there is plenty of evidence to suggest that this is a significant problem, regardless of whether or not you accept the industry's findings holus bolus—and Deloitte is a respected firm. You can quibble about methodologies and the figures—it is nonsensical to say this is not an issue in Australia—but anyone who has been through a Customs warehouse will attest to the fact that they all smell of tobacco. Customs does intercept some illegal tobacco but, sadly, with the resourcing cuts that it has been subjected to, probably not enough.


The coalition supports measures that help reduce instances of smoking in Australia. But the government's duty-free tobacco ban, which is another one of those measures that is a good idea to the Labor Party but is completely bungled in its execution, has been handled in the Labor Party's typical bungled way. Sadly, this incompetence is characteristic of this government. Like most of the Labor Party's policies, the duty-free tobacco ban has been rushed and poorly planned. For example, the industry estimates the cost of emergency reprinting of landing cards will be $10 million. This has not been budgeted for and it is just a small example of the chaos that will ensue on 1 September when this ill-thought-out measure comes in.


The coalition is committed to preventative health measures; however, the Labor government needs to be committed to well-researched, targeted and planned measures.


Labor did not consult with the industry prior to announcing this budget measure and, despite promising that they would consult with industry on any substantive changes, the ban is due to come into effect on 1 September—that is, just over a week away. Yet if you talk to airports they have no idea how this is going to be implemented. This will be just another Labor bungle. Sadly, it is a great example of where this government can take a good idea, which is to try and take preventative health measures to reduce smoking, and completely bungle it in the execution to the point where it costs people money and is confounding for stakeholders who do not know what the government are doing. Clearly what happened is that when the government needed some revenue in framing the final parts of the budget in May this year, they came up with these sorts of measures. They did not have time to consult with industry and just implemented them without really understanding the consequences of what they were doing. Sadly, this is a hallmark of this incompetent government.


One of the reasons why the duty-free tobacco ban is going to be difficult is that the infrastructure in place at airports means that even things like storage and transportation of seized tobacco are not assured. Customs officers will be faced with angry passengers forced to dispose of their excess tobacco when they have not been warned of this change prior to coming to Australia. Notably the Australian Duty Free Association wrote to the Minister for Health and Ageing on 9 March 2012 asking if the rumours they had heard through the media were true and the government were planning to introduce the duty-free tobacco ban. The minister did not wish to engage with the association and has revealed that a handwritten note on the correspondence described the association as 'a minor organisation'. In her response, the minister referred the correspondence to the Treasurer, despite the measure being touted as health policy.


This is the peak body for the duty-free stores throughout Australia, not some minor organisation that should be treated with such contempt by this government. The Australian Duty Free Association wrote a letter to the Minister for Home Affairs on 30 March 2012 and noted: 


We would like to make you aware of all the ramifications arising from this proposed ban, including the severe impact it would place on Customs. These include: (1) increased compliance costs for Customs associated with searching travellers with illegal cigarettes entering Australia at all airports; (2) Treasury assumes a revenue gain of $200 million versus Deloitte Access Economics's conclusion of a maximum of $42.1 million revenue gain; (3) a reduction in tax revenue from duty-free operators, suppliers and airports as a result of reduced profits and reduced income tax paid by employees as a result of job losses which will inevitably occur; (4) major inconvenience to tourists due to longer queues in busy airports and greater congestion due to additional Customs searches for cigarettes which will need to be declared; and (5) the potential for increased black market activities.'


This is a letter from the Australian Duty Free Association, clearly people with expertise in this area, and yet none of these issue seem to have been adequately addressed by the government. We already have queues that are too long at our airports. These queues are too long because the Labor Party, again with an incredibly short-sighted measure, ripped money out of the budget for passenger facilitation for incoming and outgoing passengers in Australia. We already have big queues at our airports and we are now going to have bigger queues because of these new measures. Of course, there is no corresponding increase in funding or resources for Customs. Sadly, as I said, this bungled approach is a hallmark of this Labor government.


As the association noted, duty-free tobacco will have very real consequences for the Customs primary processing line for incoming passengers and on the illicit tobacco trade. The cut that I mentioned was $34 million to the passenger facilitation program, and Labor axed a further $10.4 million from this program. This is all happening at a time when passenger numbers to Australia are increasing. They are expected to increase from approximately 32 million to 38 million in just four years. The $34 million hit Customs took has already had the effect of a reduction of 70 staff across primary Customs lines at Australia's eight international airports in the past financial year. This further funding cut will only serve to make waiting times worse. Airports are already short staffed and need more Customs officers, not fewer. Estimates by Customs show that international visitors to Australia will increase by more than 150 per cent and international departures will increase by more than 500 per cent over the next two decades.


Customs staff numbers and resources have not increased in line with passenger numbers. The ever-growing lines will only worsen with this duty-free tobacco ban, as many who would normally linger in duty-free stores will go straight to the Customs processing line. At some airports, such as Melbourne Airport, the lines have grown so bad due to Customs staffing cuts that they sometimes have to keep passengers on the planes, sitting on the tarmac, longer than they ordinarily would so that the Customs primary line is not completely inundated with the ordinary flow of passengers. This is, quite frankly, unacceptable, and it should hardly be considered best practice when you consider how fast some of our regional competitors are able to process passengers through airports such as Hong Kong and Singapore.


I just want to labour that point a little more. You have a situation at one of our major gateways, Melbourne Airport, where passengers who fly in are forced to wait on the tarmac because Customs cannot process people. That means that the Customs hall is so full that they cannot put any more people into it, so they need to keep people on planes, waiting on the tarmac. When you have come on a trans-Pacific flight, you have perhaps already flown for 15 hours. You arrive in Melbourne and have to wait on the tarmac because of the incompetence of the Labor Party in slashing resources to Customs, who can no longer do their job properly because they just do not have the personnel available to do that.


I think that is disgraceful. It is not the sort of impression that we want to make when people arrive in Australia. The government are making these cuts at a time—and I think this is the most egregious part of it—when there is no shortage of money; it is just that they have wasted money in such an egregious way that they have needed to come back and make these cuts to agencies that are dealing with front-line services. We deeply oppose that and we will prioritise front-line services if we get a chance to govern in the future.


I will briefly outline the purposes of the bill, as outlined in the bill's explanatory memorandum.




A division having been called in the House of Representatives—




Sitting suspended from 
10:12 
to 
10:26





Mr KEENAN:
  I was just outlining to the House some of my concerns about the implementation of this measure, and I now move on to the purposes of this bill as outlined in the bill's EM. The explanatory memorandum reads:


1. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Customs Act 1901 (the Act) to create criminal offences for the smuggling of tobacco products and for the conveyance or possession of smuggled tobacco products where the person conveying or possessing the goods knows they were smuggled.


2. A smuggling offence currently exists in section 233 of the Act and is punishable by a pecuniary penalty of up to five times the duty evaded; however this offence is no longer considered an effective deterrent as many penalties currently imposed for tobacco smuggling are not paid.


I understand that this is because it is often the case that a company is involved, and it has proved to be difficult to pursue the people behind that company. Clearly, it makes sense to avoid that continuing. The EM continues:


3. On some occasions the investigation of the smuggling offence results in the identification of sufficient evidence to warrant the pursuit of fraud offences under the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). In these cases offences carry penalties of up to 10 years imprisonment.


4. These new offences combine the penalties of the existing smuggling and fraud offences by providing a pecuniary penalty of up to five times the duty evaded in addition to up to 10 years imprisonment. The inclusion of the imprisonment penalty will provide a strong deterrent to criminals and will demonstrate the seriousness of smuggling acts.


The government has touted this bill as introducing new measures, but the maximum term of 10 years imprisonment and penalty units already exist under general smuggling and fraud provisions within the Criminal Code. However, it is understood that they are difficult for Customs officers to use for prosecution. The new offences under the Customs Act make it easier for Customs officers to use and require less onerous proof of evidence for prosecution, which the coalition supports.


However, the government needs to answer why this measure has been introduced without any increases in resources for Customs to screen and inspect incoming cargo to stop the illegal tobacco from coming through our borders in the first place. The Labor government seems intent on making it harder for Customs officers to ensure the risk of detection is high and to enforce these penalties. Despite the Attorney-General refusing to acknowledge illicit tobacco smuggling as a problem, the statistics speak for themselves. During 2010-11 Customs made 55 detections in sea cargo arriving in Australia. This equalled 258 tonnes of tobacco and 82 million cigarettes, with a net worth of approximately $135 million. This is just a small indication of the problem considering many more cargo consignments would go unchecked. The potential is that there is a much larger amount of smuggled tobacco coming through our borders thanks to Labor's cuts to cargo inspection.


This bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, which held an inquiry into the bill and recommended that the bill be passed. The coalition takes the recommendations of parliamentary committees seriously and is very happy to accept the determination of this committee.


It is interesting to note the submission made by the Australian National Preventive Health Agency to the inquiry, where they stated:


Smuggling and illicit trade of tobacco undermines the effectiveness of these tax increases and price policies: resulting in cheaper prices and potential increases in tobacco use. This in turn has the potential to contribute to higher incidence of smoking related morbidity and mortality.


According to the agency:




… the use of loose tobacco … has been associated with illness over and above that caused by commercially produced cigarettes due to bulking agents used such as twigs, raw cotton and grass
 clippings.





They also state that mould, mycotoxins and bacteria have been detected in illicit loose tobacco. Given the Attorney-General's crusade against smoking, why hasn't there been a big push to educate people about the dangers of illicit tobacco?



The Customs and Border Protection Service, in their submission, informed the committee that tobacco smuggling is identified as a key border risk. According to Customs, the smuggling of tobacco endangers the community and the environment. As they said:


Smuggled tobacco products commonly contain dangerous contaminants and much higher levels of carcinogens than legitimate products.


Furthermore, they pointed out:


Smuggled tobacco products also circumvent quarantine controls, thereby increasing the potential for exotic pests and diseases to be introduced. 


In their submission, Customs also indicated:


Tobacco smuggling offences are often committed by organised criminal syndicates who view tobacco smuggling as a higher return and relatively low risk venture.


Of particular concern to the coalition is the following possibility noted by Customs:


The profits made by these syndicates can also potentially be used to fund other criminal activities.


The coalition agree with Customs that tobacco smuggling is a serious problem that only lines the pockets of organised crime. We believe it needs to be addressed, not ignored, as it has been for some time by this government. 


The coalition also strongly believe that Customs should be appropriately resourced to do their job, which is to protect Australia's borders from outside threats. I strongly urge the government to, at the very least, reinstate the funding they have cut from Customs cargo inspections so the legislative changes made in this bill will have a better chance of being enforced.

"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2012-08-22,"



Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh) (10:32):  I rise to support the Customs Amendment (Smuggled Tobacco) Bill 2012. The bill creates new offences for smuggling tobacco products and for conveying or possessing smuggled tobacco products. I was very pleased that the Attorney-General announced this on World No Tobacco Day, 31 May, this year. It is a very special day for me because eight years ago I gave up smoking on World No Tobacco Day. I try to get the message out as much as possible to friends, workmates and family that smoking actually kills. Every cigarette you have brings you closer to cancer and many other illnesses. The more we can get that message out, the better for all of us. I also note at the outset that this Labor government has done everything it possibly can to get that message out, putting in a 100 per cent effort to curb the uptake of smoking tobacco.


We know that young people are the only market left in Australia for the tobacco companies. If you look at people over the age of 50, you see there are not many who smoke. There are two reasons for that: either they have given up or they are dead. That is why you rarely see people over 50 smoking. Therefore, the tobacco companies have only one market left in Australia in which to continue to grow and sell their product—that is, young people who for whatever reason are attracted to smoking.


As I said, this government deserves praise for its efforts to curb the uptake of smoking tobacco products, especially by young Australians, and all those efforts have been challenged by the big tobacco companies, sometimes right up to the High Court. Just recently, the High Court made a determination in the government's favour.


I have spoken on many occasions in this place about tobacco and how damaging smoking is to our health, and how we should all be doing all we can to encourage Australians to quit. Better still, they should never start. It is very important to get the message out to young people that they should never start, because quitting is a battle that will stay with them forever. Even although I quit eight years ago, I still consider myself to be addicted to tobacco. Every day the thought of having a cigarette passes through your mind. That is how addictive this product is. You are better off not having that addiction at all than having to battle it continuously. 


Hence this government's well-founded but world-first plain-packaging legislation which diminishes the messaging of cigarette packets. As I have said, that is the only bastion of marketing to young people left—the marketing on the packet. I am very pleased that that will soon go, and so the reason to carry, show or 'sport' any cigarette packet and smoke its contents will be diminished.


We have heard from big tobacco representatives that plain packaging would be a bad thing because it would be easier for unscrupulous profiteers to take advantage of poor unsuspecting people with a propensity to form an addiction. This is what big tobacco say they fear. Their fear, of course, is that someone else will sell product instead of themselves; that their revenue will decrease. They know that plain packaging will reduce their revenue. They have said they fear an increase of counterfeit tobacco products smuggled into this country and sold to an unsuspecting population on the cheap, cutting their sales.


I would hope that most of us here would be more concerned with the number of Australians who put their lives in peril every day by smoking. I understand that around three million Australians continue to smoke around 22 billion cigarettes each year, and over 15,000 Australians are killed by smoking-related diseases, costing us all some $30 billion per year. So we have 15,000 dead and $30 billion up in smoke each and every year.


Dealing in tobacco products, in others' potential pain, misery and death, is utterly contemptible. Doing so shows utter contempt for the state. When you peddle that product, leading to misery for people because they get addicted, it costs the taxpayer billions of dollars when the state then has to pick up through the health system the pieces of shattered lives. I am speaking here of those who run illegal tobacco products.


There has long existed a difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion. Most of us are familiar with the basic distinction. All of us who submit a tax return each year know about using the rules to reduce tax by legal means such as negative gearing. We also know that misinformation, lying on your tax return, is something quite different. Tax evasion is theft from the Commonwealth, and that means theft from each and every one of us—our neighbours, our community, our workmates and the population of Australia as a whole. In a democracy where we are all notionally equal under the law, theft from the state, theft from every one of our fellow citizens, is, in my opinion, a very serious offence. This is what these illegal profiteers of tobacco are doing. Not only are they killing people; they are also committing a serious offence against the state by avoiding taxes.


Many would reason that, while theft from each other is wrong, theft by someone overseas or by a foreign company here in Australia may be even worse as no Australian benefits. This is what we are looking at in this bill today—theft on a grand scale, deliberate and highly calculated, by smugglers of overseas product which is doing damage to each and every one of us, especially to young people, through evasion of the taxes which must be paid by Australian companies who play by the rules.


This bill targets those who would seek to defraud the Australian public to the tune of over a hundred million dollars per year. In fact, in each of the last two years the amount stolen from the Australian public by people who smuggle tobacco into Australia has been as much as $135 million. This activity is illegal and punishable by a penalty equal to two to five times the amount stolen through tax evasion. I think we should throw the book at people or companies who know full well that they are breaking the law for substantial private gain. I do not think anyone would dispute that. I believe the financial penalty should be such that anyone would consider it madness to attempt to break laws through tax evasion and smuggling into Australia an addictive product which makes people ill and kills them.


I acknowledge that it can be difficult to extract these penalties from some criminals. In some cases, a guilty party may ensure he or she appears to have nothing to their name with which to pay the penalty. For this reason, this bill is very important. I support the added disincentive of a prison sentence of up to 10 years, which is applicable to this bill's new offence of smuggling tobacco products and applicable to any person who conveys or possesses tobacco products which the person knows were imported with the intent to defraud the Commonwealth of revenue. Jail time is not currently available as a deterrent for smuggling offences under the Customs Act. I think it is entirely appropriate that this bill carries that jail term.


During 2010-11, the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service made 55 seizures of smuggled tobacco products in sea cargo alone. That consisted of 258 tonnes of tobacco, which is 82 million cigarettes, representing $135 million, plus GST.  The reasons I support this bill are twofold—that smuggling defrauds the Commonwealth and that tobacco products will continue to kill people who are addicted to them. I commend the bill to the House.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Wannon might choose to address himself to the bill before the House.




Mr TEHAN:
  The member for Solomon is doing a great job. So it is fantastic to get that endorsement from her. I rise today to speak on the Customs Amendment (Smuggled Tobacco) Bill 2012, which, as stated by the shadow minister, the coalition supports. The process of the bill getting to this place sums up the Gillard government. There is a proper way to do things, there is a proper way to implement, there is a proper way to create laws; and then there is the Gillard government way. It is almost like a Marx brothers approach, like some bizarre sitcom where we are just going to create a story, create a mess, create a muddle and then we will come in and try to half fix it. This bill sums that up. 


In 2009-10, because of Labor's wasteful spending, they had to cut the budget for the Customs cargo screening program by $58.1 million. We also saw their incompetence in pink batts and the BER. They would say that they had a budgetary issue, they had wasted the taxpayers' money and they had wasted the surplus presented to them when the budget was in the black, and all of a sudden they say that they are in the red—they have some issues and they are going to have to cut the Customs screening program by $58.1 million. 


As a result there is less screening, and the smugglers think to themselves that there is an opportunity so they start bringing things through the borders, including tobacco. All of a sudden we have an issue with tobacco smuggling. It is quite an impact. Various surveys and reports have been done; one of which showed that in 2011 an estimated total of 2.26 million kilograms of tobacco might have been smuggled through our borders into the Australian market. That potentially was a forgone tobacco excise revenue of approximately $1 billion. So they say they will cut Customs screening to save $58 million, but the end result is that that has cost us revenue of $1 billion. Only the Gillard government could dream up such a scheme and implement it.




Mrs Griggs:
  The Midas touch in reverse.




Mr TEHAN:
  It is the Midas touch in reverse, as the member for Solomon says. It is quite remarkable. Then they think that they have to do something about this so they had better toughen up on the offences in this area, and they decide they had better implement some changes. So what do they do in implementing the changes? They decide that they will also broaden some of the issues that they are going to address in this bill and look at some modifications to how duty-free provisions for tobacco are handled. The main industry representative body for duty-free issues is the Australian Duty Free Association. As chief of staff to the former minister for tourism, I had dealings with ADFA. They are a wonderful organisation—they are very serious about what they do and very dedicated to the duty-free sector. They understand its importance to the tourism industry. They were always welcome in the office of the former minister for tourism. They were seen as a very sensible organisation, and if they had something to say they would say it properly and base it on facts.


The Australian Duty Free Association had some concerns about the changes and they wanted to bring those issues to the minister's attention. They wrote to the Minister for Health on 9 March 2012, asking if the rumours they had heard through the media, that the government was planning on introducing the duty-free tobacco ban, were true.


The Minister for Health, the member for Sydney, did not even want to engage with ADFA. So what did she write on the letter? She referred it—just flicked it over to the Treasurer—and then wrote on the letter 'a minor organisation'. With all due respect, I would like to give some advice to the member for Sydney, the Minister for Health. Maybe she should stop the personal attacks on people in this place and concentrate on her day job, and she might do it a little bit better. Rather than going out with malicious attacks in the media about members in this place, she should concentrate on doing her job. Doing her job might include, when ADFA write to you, raising some issues which they would like thought about, considered and maybe addressed, rather than rushing out to do some media interview where you are just going to make some rather baseless, crude attacks on people's character, that, instead, you might say, 'I might spend that half an hour seeing ADFA, listening to their point of view, considering their point of view.' You might not agree with it. You might dismiss it. But at least you should recognise that they are an important organisation. They represent a significant part of the tourism industry and they deserve to be heard, not dismissed out of hand with some sort of flick of a pen of 'a minor organisation' over to the Treasurer.


It does bell the cat a little bit that maybe the government's whole objective here has been revenue raising, rather than trying to address this issue. I go back to the first point I made, that maybe we would not be here in the first place if those original cuts had not been made from this 'comical Ali' government, but at least they should give reputable organisations the time of day, not just flick them, in particular when it has been demonstrated that you do have the time to see these organisations, because you have got time to run out to do these press conferences, which can probably only be described as grubby or offensive. Just quit that. There is no need for it—concentrate on doing the work that you should be doing as the Minister for Health.


In that letter, ADFA did raise some concerns which I think are worth placing on the record. The shadow minister did that, but I would just like to make sure that we get them heard, because there is an impact on the duty-free sector as a result of these changes. They wanted it known that there are increased compliance costs for Customs associated with searching travellers with illegal cigarettes entering Australia at all airports. Treasury assumes a revenue gain of $200 million, yet Deloitte Access Economics' conclusion is a maximum of $42.1 million of revenue gain. Once again we see some issues being raised here. Treasury has said $200 million, and we all know they are under pressure. They are under pressure to make sure the government gets its surplus. What we need to do, and what needs to be looked at seriously, is to ask is there credibility in the Deloitte Access Economics conclusion of a maximum $42.1 million revenue gain, and is the government going to relook at the Treasury modelling to ensure that it is right. Otherwise, we are being told one thing by the government to try to get its surplus, yet another by Deloitte that it is only going to generate about a quarter, or even a little bit less than a quarter, of that revenue. I would ask the government to look seriously at that issue and come back and inform the parliament that their modelling is, in fact, correct on this. 


There is going to be a reduction in tax revenue from duty-free operators, suppliers and airports as a result of the reduced profits and the reduced income tax paid by employees, as a result of the job losses that will inevitably occur. There will be a major inconvenience to tourists due to longer queues in busy airports and greater congestion due to additional Customs searches for cigarettes, which will need to be declared, and there is potential for increased black market activities. They are some of the serious concerns that ADFA wrote to the Minister for Health about. They are the concerns that she dismissed with the flick of a pen as coming from 'a minor organisation'. The Minister for Health should look again at the way she is going about running her portfolio if that is the attitude she is taking to these issues.


There are serious issues around the Customs Amendment (Smuggled Tobacco) Bill 2012. Once again, the way the government has gone about implementation leaves a lot to be desired. We do need to tackle the issue of the trade of illicit tobacco and the government has gone some way to doing that by changing the penalties, in particular the 10 years imprisonment. But the fact is that in the 2009-10 budget the Gillard government cut funding for the Customs cargo screening program by $58.1 million. At some stage, the government needs to understand the pressure that has been on Customs over the last three or four years and that Customs needs to be properly resourced. The government needs to come out and acknowledge that. 


We need to see the government place on the record that the $58.1 billion that it cut from the Customs budget was a mistake and that it erred. It would not hurt for the government to do that. There are plenty of other motions at the moment where people are being called on to apologise. I cannot see why the government, if it is serious about apologising, cannot say, 'Okay, we got this wrong.' We need to get proper screening back in place. We have to make sure that the processes are there and that Customs are properly resourced, so it can do its job properly. In conjunction with that, we also need to increase the penalty for being caught in this area and make the maximum penalty 10 years imprisonment. That would be the type of sensible action that would indicate that the government was seriously committed to doing something in this area, instead of just robbing Peter to pay Paul, which is where we are as a result of the government's handling of this issue.


The coalition support the bill. We need to do everything we can to make sure that the issue of smuggled tobacco is addressed and that there are penalties to make sure that this crime does not continue to occur. We also have to look at the lessons learnt in getting where we are today with this bill, because unfortunately at every step it has been a story of incompetence and bungled handling by the Gillard government. One does hope that after so many programs and so many bungled pieces of legislation, one day we might be able to praise the government for having done something properly. I will not hold my breath, but we do live in hope.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Lyons
):  Thank you. I trust the self-praise does not continue with the next speaker. That could happen between the member for Makin and the member for Fowler, but we probably should get on with the question, which is that the bill be now read a second time.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2012-08-22,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (10:59):  I also welcome the opportunity to briefly speak on the Customs Amendment (Smuggled Tobacco) Bill 2012. Firstly, I want to respond to some of the comments made by the member for Wannon. He asserted that as a result of the funding cuts to Customs, we have seen a spike in the sale of illicit tobacco and that that is why we have such a black market. 


Just for the record, the facts show that in the last three years there has been a decrease in the volume of illicit tobacco from the total amount of tobacco in this country. The statistics also show there has been an increase in detections by Customs as a result of their operations. It just highlights that the member for Wannon is incorrect with his assertion in respect to the role of Customs in this matter.


The bill amends the Customs Act 1901 to create new offences of smuggling tobacco products and for conveying or possessing smuggled tobacco products. The new offences carry a penalty of 10 years imprisonment and a fine of up to five times the amount of duty evaded. The tobacco industry is big business and, contrary to trends in some parts of the world, it is growing. In Australia, around three million people over the age of 14 years smoke. According to a 2011 Deloitte report, commissioned by British American Tobacco Australia Ltd, Philip Morris Ltd and Imperial Tobacco Australia Ltd, tobacco global sales in 2011 were estimated to be US$780 billion, having risen from around US$646 billion in 2006. That is more than 50 per cent of the total Australian economy.


Similar trends for tobacco sales occurred in Australia, with the 2011 Australian market value of $10.7 billion comparing with $9.4 billion in 2006. Of course, in Australia that increase is more due to price increases than an increase in sales volume. The same Deloitte report estimated that in 2011 there were 2.264 million kilograms of illicit tobacco sold in Australia, representing 13.4 per cent of the market, and that over the past four years almost $1 billion of tax revenue had been lost. I suspect, however, that the tobacco companies' concern is not for the government revenue lost but for their loss of market share. 


Regardless of their motivation, the fact remains that a black market trade in the order of $1 billion per annum raises serious concerns for government, including concerns about the formation of crime syndicates, bribery, theft, corruption, money laundering and violence. Of course, those figures are calculated estimates as no-one ever really knows what the value of the illicit market is, because there is no form of accurate statistics in respect to that sector of the market. 


Notwithstanding that, I note that in 2010-11 Customs and Border Protection made 55 seizures of smuggled tobacco products in sea cargo, consisting of 258 tonnes of tobacco and 82 million cigarettes, representing a potential revenue evasion of $135 million plus GST. A similar amount of potential lost revenue arose from seizures made in the first nine months of 2011-12, again highlighting that the point made by the member for Wannon is inaccurate.


How much tobacco illegally enters Australia will never be accurately known. But there is little doubt that it is big business run by large criminal networks. Tobacco companies argue that increasing the price of tobacco products encourages a black market in tobacco products. The companies argue that the higher value means there will be more demand for cheaper black market products and, in turn, more profits for illegal operators. I accept that there is some validity to that argument.


According to one report that I have read, the World Health Organization has predicted that by 2020 illegal tobacco consumption will outstrip legal tobacco use. In other words, by 2020 the illegal tobacco market, using today's figures as somewhat of a guide, will be in the order of $600 billion, $700 billion or $800 billion around the world. It is indeed big business. The concern is that when you are dealing with that kind of money then quite clearly you are also dealing with other criminal concerns that need to be addressed, if, for no other reason than the continuing use of tobacco in society presents societies around the world with some very, very serious concerns and problems in the years ahead.


Increasing the penalties for offences relating to tobacco products should be a deterrent. But penalties must be part of a suite of measures including pricing, packaging, advertising and health warnings. It seems, however, that the most effective counter-smoking strategy to date has been the campaign to make smoking socially unacceptable by banning smoking in public venues and public places. A good study in respect of the effects of making smoking socially unacceptable was carried out in the US. It was shown to be the most effective strategy in reducing tobacco consumption. Whilst warnings on packets have been useful and increasing the prices might have assisted, the reality is that the biggest inroads in reducing smoking across the world have been achieved by those places that have made smoking socially unacceptable. We have seen that here in Australia where we have prohibited smoking in workplaces and recreation places. In my view, that has been the most effective strategy applied by governments. It is those kinds of strategies that I believe we need to continue with. As I highlighted a moment ago, we are dealing with a major problem around the world.


I take this opportunity also to commend an initiative between SANE and the Australian government which was announced yesterday by the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing, Mark Butler. This initiative is designed to assist people with mental health issues to quit smoking. People with a mental health condition are more likely to be smokers, with as many as 30 per cent of Australians with a mental illness being smokers. I understand that the figures are much higher for severe mental health conditions. It is the case that those people who are the most stressed and quite often the most desperate are the ones that turn to smoking for some form of relief. The reality is unfortunately that it has the opposite effect—it just makes people more stressed. If you are down and out, it also means that you spend your money on cigarettes when you should be spending money on much healthier options. I particularly note that, in the fact sheet referred to in Minister Butler's media release yesterday, it was stated that diseases caused by smoking are the second-largest killer of people who have a mental illness. This is an interesting statistic. The fact sheet also showed that people with mental illness who quit smoking may need a lower dose of antipsychotic medication. Again, this is an interesting observation in the fact sheet.


Finally, I want to comment on the reaction of the tobacco companies to their loss in the High Court challenge to the Australian government's proposition to ensure that in the future cigarettes are sold in plain packaging. I note that the cigarette companies have now turned to the World Trade Organization and appealed to that body to try and prevent Australia from proceeding with plain packaging for cigarettes. This highlights how significant an issue this is for these companies. It is significant because of the profits being made from the sales of tobacco. It is clearly the case that their concern is not only for the losses that they might incur here in Australia but rather that they fear that other countries around the world might follow Australia's lead and also introduce plain packaging for cigarette products. These companies are prepared to go to the World Trade Organization claiming that this is a breach of some of the trade agreements that we have with other countries in an endeavour to stop the government from proceeding with this proposition. I certainly hope that appeal is also lost by these companies. I understand that it might take some years to resolve, and that will not stop the government from proceeding with the legislation that was passed this year. However, it is of concern to think that every attempt is being made by the tobacco companies to continue to sell their products which they know have serious consequences for users.


As members of this House would know, the effects of tobacco have been known by tobacco companies for decades. In fact, I understand that in the US—and perhaps in other parts of the world, including, I believe, even here in Australia—there have been some successful cases where action was taken against the tobacco companies. Even knowing that tobacco products have serious health effects on consumers, they continue to promote and sell their products wherever they can and in whatever way they can, and I have no doubt that they will stop at nothing to ensure that they are able to continue to do so.


This legislation, as I said from the outset, forms part of a package of measures which not only seeks to prevent the illegal and illicit marketing of cigarette products but is part of a more comprehensive strategy to try and reduce smoking throughout this country. I commend the legislation to the House.

"Entsch, Warren, MP",LP,2012-08-22,"



Mr ENTSCH
 (Leichhardt—Chief Opposition Whip) (11:10):  As the member for Leichhardt, I have taken a very keen interest in measures to control illegal tobacco. I actually grew up in Mareeba, which was one of the largest tobacco-producing regions in Australia. In fact, one of my first jobs was working on tobacco farms, suckering tobacco, at about the age of 12, so I have a reasonable understanding of the legitimate industry and how it functions.


I welcome the opportunity today to support the Customs Amendment (Smuggled Tobacco) Bill 2012. It gives me the opportunity to highlight the concerns raised particularly by tourism stakeholders and others, such as the Australian Airports Association, the Tourism and Transport Forum and the Australian Duty Free Association, about this government's slapdash approach to policy. Of course, tourism is very much the lifeblood of the area that I represent—about 40 per cent of our economy—so we need to be very conscious of any negative impacts that we are likely to have on that industry.


In reading this bill, we must look at it in the context of the recent cuts to the duty-free tobacco allowances, which mean that people arriving at Cairns airport can now bring in two packets per passenger—this is down from in the past, hen it was a carton—as well as successive cuts to the budget of the Customs and Border Protection Service. Both of these make Cairns, and Australia, much more susceptible to quarantine risk and less able to give tourists a good first impression as they are waiting to be processed; by taking what they see as their duty-free allowance and removing it from them or opening the carton and handing them back just two packets of cigarettes. Of course, they do not get any reimbursement for the money they have spent on the whole carton.


The purpose of this bill is to amend the Customs Act 1901 to create criminal offences for the smuggling of tobacco products and for the conveyance or possession of smuggled tobacco products where the person conveying or possessing the goods knows that they were smuggled. Although a smuggling offence already exists under the act which is punishable by a fine of up to five times the duty that was dodged, this is no longer considered to seriously deter smugglers, as many of the fines imposed just do not get paid. On rare occasions, if enough evidence is found to warrant fraud charges being laid under the Criminal Code Act 1995, smugglers can face up to 10 years imprisonment.


These new criminal offences will combine the penalties of the existing smuggling and fraud offences. This means that people who knowingly smuggle tobacco products will face not only the existing fine but also up to 10 years imprisonment. This will certainly provide a strong deterrent to criminals and illustrate the seriousness of these smuggling acts. In the 2009-10 budget, Labor cut funding for the Customs cargo screening program by $58.1 million. The result of these cuts is that the number of sea cargo inspections was cut by 25 per cent and air cargo inspections were reduced by 75 per cent.


With less cargo being screened, there is a greater opportunity for illicit tobacco to be smuggled through our borders. Just this year, an industry-commissioned report into the illicit trade of tobacco in Australia confirmed that illegal tobacco is a real and significant threat. It found that in 2001 our illicit market totalled around 2.26 million kilograms of tobacco, which is equivalent to 13.4 per cent of the estimated legal tobacco market. Illegal tobacco takes many forms: there is duty-free diverted product; there is the counterfeit product, normally originating in China; there are unbranded tailor-made cigarettes; and loose-leaf, or what we commonly know as chop-chop, that has been grown illegally in Australia. 


Tobacco is no longer grown legally in Australia. The Howard government was pleased to support efforts to close the legal growing market in Australia. They saw the buyout of many of the licences on farmers, and effectively paid out those licences in the northern area, in my area, and allowed them to diversify into other areas. A little later, the Victorian industry shut down as well. This was done to safeguard revenue and to reduce the toll from the more harmful and illegal chop-chop market. The illegal chop-chop market was only driven by a few rotten eggs in the tobacco-farming sector, those responsible for diverting products from legal channels. Farmers who shut down their crops were given two years profits by Australian manufacturers in return for cooperating with the authorities, and they were rightly given support as they worked to switch production into other crops.


I say this to highlight that, in its tobacco control reforms, the coalition acted with a great deal of engagement, planning and care to avoid unintended consequences; after all, the hallmark of creating good policy is that it is sensible, workable and evidence based. Our policy was driven by decision making at the Tobacco Industry Forum, which was established by the coalition and is made up of groups that have a keen interest in the tobacco industry. These included the Australian Taxation Office, the Customs and Border Protection Service, the Department of Health and Ageing and the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. Its purpose was to provide a forum for consultation and discussion on issues of mutual concern. By taking a planned approach, we made sure that we were not subject to the embarrassment that typifies this government's knee-jerk policy forays and flights of fantasy. By introducing measures such as the graphic health warnings on cigarettes, the Howard government achieved the lowest rates of smoking in the Western world. 


We are yet to measure the impacts of this government's plain packaging legislation that will see consumers downgrade to cheap unbranded cigarettes, but it is likely that this will see increased consumption of tobacco in the absence of minimum retail price for that tobacco. This legislation will also make detection of illegal tobacco more difficult. Brand colouring, embossing and other distinguishing features being replaced by a standard form of packaging is going to make counterfeiters' work much, much easier. 


At the same time, government is encouraging smuggling by taking the cops off the beat at airports, while restricting importation via duty-free stores. I have a media release from the Australian Duty Free Association issued after the May budget, when duty-free reform was introduced without any consultation with the Australian Duty Free Association or other important travel or tourism stakeholders. In her 8 May media release, the minister was gloating that this reform:


… reduces the number of tax free cigarettes that can be brought into the country and brings duty free tobacco into line with the Government’s tough stand on reducing tobacco consumption …


Yet, after buying into the issue and posturing over her tough stand, the minister has now run away from this issue—since it has become obvious that it was conceived without proper planning. This is the standard that was set by the previous Prime Minister—it was a reason he was removed from the front bench—yet the standard has been retained and if anything it has grown worse under this current government. 


 When ADFA wrote to the health minister, the member for Sydney, she did not bother to engage with them, describing them in a leaked handwritten note as 'minor stakeholders'. This is the peak body for the duty-free stores throughout Australia and certainly not a group that could be trivialised as a minor stakeholder that can or should be ignored. In recent media releases the director of the Australian Duty Free Association, Derek Larsen, states that this measure will radically slash the allowances for duty-free tobacco, with serious implications in the duty-free sector, and it represents a black hole that is approximately 7.5 per cent of the total budget surplus. He also highlights that the government has overstated the available revenue from the measure by around $110 million in 2013 and increasing to $140 million per year thereafter. He adds: 'The total sales revenue generated from duty-free tobacco is far less than the amount that the government estimates it can raise by ending the duty-free concession. It wants to reap more tax revenue from the sector than is generated in total sales.' Quite clearly this is absolutely impossible. 


Importantly as it relates to this bill, Mr Larsen warns that Customs are likely to be heavily impacted by the move and Customs officers will have to dedicate more time to policing the quantities of cigarettes being imported. This will put extra strain on frontline Customs services, which are already working hard to process arriving passengers in a timely manner. As you can appreciate, Mr Deputy Speaker, it will also have a very negative impact on visitors' experiences entering Australia, assuming they are doing the right thing and purchasing their duty-free products at the airport. This is on their arrival in many cases before they go through Customs, and they then find that the product that they have legitimately purchased is removed from them and they are given only two packs.


In my view it is also very much likely to lead to a very significant increase in the black market trade in tobacco. Now that the Australian tobacco industry is virtually shut down, the opportunities for illegal chop chop coming out of Australia have been significantly reduced and this is highly unlikely. But what we are going to see is much more illegal product being imported in larger quantities. We have seen that in recent times, coming probably through our docks.


It is in desperation for a headline and reaching for a measure to prop up a fake surplus that this government is doing untold harm and denying a voice to its collateral victims. Duty-free sales constitute about one per cent of the tobacco industry sales, yet tobacco represents up to 30 per cent of duty-free sales. In its attempt to hurt the tobacco industry, it is instead damaging those who sell it legally. It is also encouraging the illicit trade. 


In the absence of the health minister doing the job, the duty-free sector knocked on the door of Mr Ferguson, our minister for tourism. The duty-free sector informs me that that meeting lasted a total of seven minutes. This is a very clear message that if you are in tourism or tourism connected business and not with the resources and energy sector, the Minister for Resources, Energy and Tourism does not want to hear about your problems and is not available to assist in dealing with these serious issues for your sector. The minister for health, the minister for tourism or someone on the government side needs to come to the chamber in the course of this debate and answer some very serious questions as they impact on smuggling tobacco.


What is the progress on the reprinting of landing cards, at what cost, and why was the estimated cost of $10 million not included in the 2012 budget? What was the involvement of AQIS and what budget plans are in store to destroy the confiscated product? How will this product be treated and where was it purchased? Retail or abroad? What was the full price? What information program is planned for the tourism source markets and why has the government opted not to progress this policy idea without open lines of communication with the industry that has been so heavily impacted? What is the implication for increased waiting times additional to the impact of the Customs staff cuts, and when will these be reported to parliament? Now that crucial sentences will apply to tourists who hide extra cartons in their luggage, what assurance is there that this legislation will apply only to large-scale organised criminal gangs? Finally, when will the election be called— (Time expired)

"Livermore, Kirsten, MP",ALP,2012-08-22,"



Ms LIVERMORE
 (Capricornia) (11:26):  I am very pleased to speak on the Customs Amendment (Smuggled Tobacco) Bill 2012. In beginning my remarks I take issue with one of the opening remarks of the member for Leichhardt, in which he characterised the government's approach to this as a 'slapdash' approach to policy. That is the last criticism that could be made of the government's approach to these measures to reduce rates of smoking in Australia. In fact, this bill and the other measure that the member for Leichhardt spent a great deal of time on in his speech—the reduction in the number of tobacco products that people are allowed to bring into Australia duty free—are two measures that are part of a much larger, comprehensive suite of measures that this government has been pursuing since we first came to government. As speakers throughout this debate have made reference to, these are measures that were identified and recommended by the National Preventative Health Taskforce.


So not on any measure could you characterise this bill or, indeed, any of the other measures we have put into place as a slapdash approach. It has been very clear since we came to government that the Labor government was intent on continuing the efforts of previous governments to reduce the rates of smoking in Australia. There are very good reasons for doing that in terms of the health and lifestyle of our Australian citizens, but as a government we also have a responsibility to make sure that our health dollars are spent wisely and that we do what we can through regulation and support for people to have our rates of smoking as low as possible in Australia. The health effects of smoking are well known and create a very large burden on our health system if not addressed.


I talked about the Preventative Health Taskforce. It was one of the early acts of the Labor government to put in place a preventative health task force to look at this whole question of how to improve health outcomes in Australia and thereby improve people's life outlook, and also to make the best use of our health dollars. The Preventative Health Taskforce report is very interesting reading, and one of the lessons that it contains was very informative to me.


In Australia, we are used to being world leaders in tobacco control and in the regulation that applies to tobacco companies in marketing and selling their deadly products. While we can congratulate ourselves on our achievements to date—in 1988, roughly 30 per cent of Australian adults were smokers; we have brought that down to the current rate of below 20 per cent—one of the things that the Preventative Health Taskforce warn against is complacency by the government and in Australia generally because of what has already been achieved. In their report to the government, they warn against a loss of momentum in national efforts to lower rates of smoking. One thing that really caught my attention in the report was the following statement:


… there has been a 'flattening out' in the reduction in the prevalence of smoking rates in Australia …


It goes on to say:


Between 2004 and 2007 prevalence of weekly rates fell by only 1.1 percentage points (6%), compared to a drop of 2.1 percentage points (9%) over the previous three years.


So the very clear warning in the Preventative Health Taskforce report is that, while there is effective regulation and government efforts have had a very big influence on rates of smoking, we cannot take our eye off the ball. We cannot let up in our efforts in this regard. We cannot be complacent because, as has been demonstrated very clearly in the last couple of years as the government have stepped up efforts against the tobacco industry, we are up against a very powerful, well-resourced, ruthless and unscrupulous opponent in the tobacco industry, which will stop at nothing to protect its vested interest in keeping people smoking and especially in luring young people and others to take up smoking and therefore become addicted to the products that tobacco companies sell.


That warning from the Preventative Health Taskforce is very clear. Yes, we should recognise and applaud our previous achievements and results, and we should take from them the message that strong regulation can have a big influence on smoking rates, but we cannot rest on our laurels. We have to maintain our focus on what governments can do by way of regulation, by way of social marketing et cetera to reduce the rates of smoking.


As I said, I refute the member for Leichhardt's claim that the government have taken a slapdash approach to this policy. This bill, like all those before it, is part of a very comprehensive suite of measures that have all been recommended and backed up by the work of the Preventative Health Taskforce. 


The bill specifically amends the Customs Act 1901, creating new offences for smuggling tobacco products and for conveying or possessing smuggled tobacco products. Significantly, this bill adds a new penalty for those offences. Up till now, someone found guilty of smuggling tobacco products into Australia—bringing in tobacco products without declaring them properly and defrauding the Commonwealth of customs duties—had to pay a fine. But we found that those fines were not being paid. I think there is something like $45 million worth of unpaid fines at the moment. So the government are stepping up our efforts in this area—not only on the basis of common sense and the fact that we do not want people defrauding the Commonwealth of customs duties but also on the basis of advice given to us by the National Preventative Health Taskforce—to further reduce the rates of smoking. So we are adding a penalty of 10 years imprisonment for these offences and expanding the offences in the customs area.


As I said, this bill represents one more element of the government's approach to reducing rates of smoking. We cannot talk about this in parliament today without making reference to the decision by the High Court last week to back up the government's groundbreaking and world-first measure to introduce plain packaging. It is great to have the Attorney-General here in the chamber, as it allows me to congratulate her on the fight which, on our behalf, she took on, and for her very strong advocacy—advocacy which has been recognised right around the world and advocacy which has clearly spooked the tobacco industry. 


They know that our introduction of plain packaging in Australia has sent a very clear signal to other governments around the world who want to step up and implement similar measures. The Attorney-General has mentioned that governments in Norway, France, Uruguay, New Zealand, South Africa and even China are taking very close notice of what we have done in Australia. The efforts of the tobacco companies to keep finding markets for their lethal products are very transparent, as is their blatant pursuit of self-interest in continuing to try to get new people addicted to the smoking habit. There is just no excuse for their continued efforts to fight, in the WTO and through the actions taking place in Hong Kong, against the government's legitimate measures.


I applaud the government's efforts. As I say, this bill is just one of a whole range of measures. One of the most important measures was the 25 per cent increase in the tobacco excise back in April 2010. That has already seen a reduction in the smoking rate. We have also listed nicotine replacement therapies on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. On the one hand, through the excise increase, we are making it more expensive for people to buy tobacco products and, through that measure, we are discouraging smokers—especially young smokers—from taking up the habit. We are also generating a financial incentive to quit for people who are already habitual smokers. On the other hand, through the PBS measure, we are making it easier for people who want to make the decision to quit to take up therapies—giving them a better chance of successfully quitting.


In conclusion, I want to congratulate the Attorney-General and the government for these measures. It is obviously better for their own health outcomes if people do not take up smoking or, if they are already smokers, if they quit. But the government have a responsibility to spend our health dollars in the wisest way possible. Where we see a major cause of preventable death—and smoking is the biggest of those—we have to take every step we can to combat it. This bill is just one more of those measures.


The member for Leichhardt spent a lot of time on the question of duty-free cigarettes being brought into Australia. He characterised the government's steps to address that as 'slapdash measures'. It is actually specifically referred to in a recommendation from the National Preventative Health Taskforce. In fact, the National Preventative Health Taskforce said that we should get rid of it altogether. So taking the step that the government has elected to take, going from 250 grams down to 50 grams, is, on any measure, a reasonable response to a very considered recommendation from the National Preventative Health Taskforce. For the usual vested interests to jump up and down without taking a broader look at what is at stake, either in terms of people's health or the right of the government to improve health and spending outcomes in Australia, is extremely short-sighted and not one that the government is going to be swayed by.

Ms ROXON
 (Gellibrand—Attorney-General and Minister for Emergency Management) (11:40):  I would like to acknowledge the member for Capricornia and other speakers, the members for Hindmarsh and Makin, who talked about the Customs Amendment (Smuggled Tobacco) Bill 2012 in the context of the range of things the government is trying to do in tackling tobacco. I might note, before the member for Capricornia leaves, that I think the chair, the member for McEwen, might have been worrying in that discussion, as one of the few smokers in parliament. I know he has said at different times that he might think about whether he will try to give up what is a serious addiction and, of course, the chair and the member for Corangamite would know that they would have our support and encouragement. 


We acknowledge and understand that this is an incredibly addictive habit. I was interested that the Minister for Health, in her contributions recently to this debate, had some figures I had not heard previously that 80 per cent of current smokers were addicted before they were 19 and something like 95 per cent were addicted before they were 26. This is an active strategy from tobacco companies—to have people addicted early and often for life. We acknowledge and understand why this sometimes is an uncomfortable area for people who are smokers, but I have to say that the member for McEwen—and we have talked often about this—has been a big advocate of the measures we have been taking. I still have not met a smoker that wants their child to smoke, so we know that this is something on which we can make a difference over generations.


The Customs Amendment (Smuggled Tobacco) Bill 2012 is part of that. Obviously we want to make clear that the health risks are the same whether you smoke legal tobacco or illegal tobacco. We do not accept the tobacco industry's view that in Australia we have a large problem with illicit tobacco, but we do accept that measures should be taken to make sure that that does not grow over time. This is one of the odd occasions where the tobacco industry and the government agree that introducing these new penalties and offences is actually an important part of making sure we have a comprehensive response to tobacco related issues generally. The proposed amendments to the bill that are being debated here are about strengthening the offences, introducing for the first time a penalty with imprisonment attached to it for tobacco smuggling, more accurately reflecting the seriousness of the offence and providing a stronger deterrent to criminals, not to make them think this is an easy or a safer way to make money. It is, as members on this side of the chamber have mentioned, part of a much more comprehensive approach that the government is taking to tobacco generally. I would not like to miss the opportunity to say how pleased the government has been that the High Court last week upheld the decision that the government has taken to introduce plain packaging. It, our social marketing campaigns, our increase in excise and our targeting of the Indigenous community, where smoking rates are still very high, are all part of one package to make sure we do everything we can to reduce each and every year the number of people who lose a loved one to a tobacco related illness. 


It is another sign that the government is prepared to do what needs to be done, whether it is taking on tobacco and winning, whether it is pricing carbon, whether it is the National Broadband Network, whether it is the National Disability Insurance Scheme or the education reforms by my colleague the minister for education, who is in the chamber. All these reforms show the government's preparedness to get on with work that is important and I am proud that we are doing that.


We have, as I have said, made quite clear that we agree that any type of tobacco is dangerous and, if we can do anything to reduce the smoking of tobacco, we will obviously do that. As a number of speakers have pointed out, this bill aims to deliver the very strong message that serious jail time will ensue if people are involved in illegal tobacco smuggling into this country. And it makes sure that the offences are now not just general smuggling offences or serious fraud offences against the Commonwealth but are in line with those. They are drafted specifically for that purpose. The need for the bill was recognised by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee that considered the bill and recommended that it be passed. I thank the senators for consideration of the bill.


I would like to briefly address some issues raised by the members for Stirling and Wannon, referring to the reduction in duty-free concession from 1 September this year and the impact this will have on Customs. The government have committed over $11 million over the next two years to assist the Customs and Border Protection Service to implement this change. In their speeches, the members for Stirling, Wannon and Leichhardt were critical of the government for 'cutting funding to Customs'. The facts are that we have invested $4 billion in Customs over the past four years and we will invest another $4 billion over the next four years. We spend more than $1 billion every year on Customs and it is getting results. Briefly, and to not stray too far from the topic of this bill, last year we seized more heroin, cocaine and amphetamines than ever before. 


If people want to look at the different results: in 2007, the last year of the Howard government when untargeted and mass-screening systems were used, Customs detected 870 parcels containing drugs or other prohibited items; last financial year, using criminal intelligence and targeted screening, Customs detected over 1,800. So we have gotten smarter in the way that we do this Customs work. The member for Stirling asked why the government are not doing more to educate the public as to the dangers of illicit tobacco. It is a little rich to suggest that our government have not been doing enough to talk to people about the dangers of tobacco. It was a cheeky suggestion, I think, from someone who has been less than enthusiastic about the other steps we have taken in this tobacco control area.


The Customs Amendment (Smuggled Tobacco) Bill 2012 ensures that we have the right laws in place to continue the fight against illegal tobacco and is part of our ongoing commitment to combat smoking in all its forms. I commend the bill to the House.

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2012-08-22,"



Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (10:00):  The coalition welcome the opportunity to support the Customs Amendment (Smuggled Tobacco) Bill 2012 but it is important to note that the bill has been debated in the wake of the Labor government's inconsistent and incompetent handling of this issue. While the Attorney-General is on a tobacco plain-packaging crusade and while her government introduced a rushed budget measure to ban duty-free tobacco, the Attorney is not willing to admit that tobacco smuggling is a problem in Australia, despite introducing a bill to that effect.


In the Attorney's second reading speech, she said that to date tobacco smuggling had not represented a major threat in Australia. It would seem contradictory to the opposition that we are debating this bill today if, according to the government, there is no particular threat posed by tobacco smuggling. This is clearly an issue the government is in denial on and it is refusing to address with any real conviction or action.


In the 2009-10 budget Labor cut funding for the Customs cargo screening program by $58.1 million. That is an enormous cut and the result is that the number of sea cargo inspections has been cut by 25 per cent and air cargo inspections reduced by a staggering 75 per cent. With less cargo being screened, there is a greater opportunity for illicit tobacco to be smuggled through our borders and indeed a greater opportunity for a lot of illicit materials, such as illicit guns, drugs and the precursors to drugs. The problem with these cuts is that they give criminals much better odds of being able to bring contraband into Australia. That should be condemned by everybody in this parliament. I note very strongly that the coalition will reverse this cut and make sure that Customs can screen cargo when it crosses our borders in a way that we would expect them to do to protect Australia from what might come over our borders.


The industry commissioned a report by Deloitte on the illicit trade of tobacco in Australia and it confirmed that illegal tobacco was a significant problem. The report found that the illicit market in Australia in 2011 was estimated to be a total of 2.26 million kilograms of tobacco, which is equivalent to 13.4 per cent of the estimated legal tobacco market. It is estimated that this represents forgone tobacco excise revenue of approximately $1 billion based on current excise rates.


While figures on the illegal tobacco market will vary and, clearly, it is difficult to find the appropriate methodology to assess how large this market is, we do have very strong indications that this is a problem and that illegal tobacco is smuggled through our borders. It is fair to say, as opposed to what the government is saying, that there is plenty of evidence to suggest that this is a significant problem, regardless of whether or not you accept the industry's findings holus bolus—and Deloitte is a respected firm. You can quibble about methodologies and the figures—it is nonsensical to say this is not an issue in Australia—but anyone who has been through a Customs warehouse will attest to the fact that they all smell of tobacco. Customs does intercept some illegal tobacco but, sadly, with the resourcing cuts that it has been subjected to, probably not enough.


The coalition supports measures that help reduce instances of smoking in Australia. But the government's duty-free tobacco ban, which is another one of those measures that is a good idea to the Labor Party but is completely bungled in its execution, has been handled in the Labor Party's typical bungled way. Sadly, this incompetence is characteristic of this government. Like most of the Labor Party's policies, the duty-free tobacco ban has been rushed and poorly planned. For example, the industry estimates the cost of emergency reprinting of landing cards will be $10 million. This has not been budgeted for and it is just a small example of the chaos that will ensue on 1 September when this ill-thought-out measure comes in.


The coalition is committed to preventative health measures; however, the Labor government needs to be committed to well-researched, targeted and planned measures.


Labor did not consult with the industry prior to announcing this budget measure and, despite promising that they would consult with industry on any substantive changes, the ban is due to come into effect on 1 September—that is, just over a week away. Yet if you talk to airports they have no idea how this is going to be implemented. This will be just another Labor bungle. Sadly, it is a great example of where this government can take a good idea, which is to try and take preventative health measures to reduce smoking, and completely bungle it in the execution to the point where it costs people money and is confounding for stakeholders who do not know what the government are doing. Clearly what happened is that when the government needed some revenue in framing the final parts of the budget in May this year, they came up with these sorts of measures. They did not have time to consult with industry and just implemented them without really understanding the consequences of what they were doing. Sadly, this is a hallmark of this incompetent government.


One of the reasons why the duty-free tobacco ban is going to be difficult is that the infrastructure in place at airports means that even things like storage and transportation of seized tobacco are not assured. Customs officers will be faced with angry passengers forced to dispose of their excess tobacco when they have not been warned of this change prior to coming to Australia. Notably the Australian Duty Free Association wrote to the Minister for Health and Ageing on 9 March 2012 asking if the rumours they had heard through the media were true and the government were planning to introduce the duty-free tobacco ban. The minister did not wish to engage with the association and has revealed that a handwritten note on the correspondence described the association as 'a minor organisation'. In her response, the minister referred the correspondence to the Treasurer, despite the measure being touted as health policy.


This is the peak body for the duty-free stores throughout Australia, not some minor organisation that should be treated with such contempt by this government. The Australian Duty Free Association wrote a letter to the Minister for Home Affairs on 30 March 2012 and noted: 


We would like to make you aware of all the ramifications arising from this proposed ban, including the severe impact it would place on Customs. These include: (1) increased compliance costs for Customs associated with searching travellers with illegal cigarettes entering Australia at all airports; (2) Treasury assumes a revenue gain of $200 million versus Deloitte Access Economics's conclusion of a maximum of $42.1 million revenue gain; (3) a reduction in tax revenue from duty-free operators, suppliers and airports as a result of reduced profits and reduced income tax paid by employees as a result of job losses which will inevitably occur; (4) major inconvenience to tourists due to longer queues in busy airports and greater congestion due to additional Customs searches for cigarettes which will need to be declared; and (5) the potential for increased black market activities.'


This is a letter from the Australian Duty Free Association, clearly people with expertise in this area, and yet none of these issue seem to have been adequately addressed by the government. We already have queues that are too long at our airports. These queues are too long because the Labor Party, again with an incredibly short-sighted measure, ripped money out of the budget for passenger facilitation for incoming and outgoing passengers in Australia. We already have big queues at our airports and we are now going to have bigger queues because of these new measures. Of course, there is no corresponding increase in funding or resources for Customs. Sadly, as I said, this bungled approach is a hallmark of this Labor government.


As the association noted, duty-free tobacco will have very real consequences for the Customs primary processing line for incoming passengers and on the illicit tobacco trade. The cut that I mentioned was $34 million to the passenger facilitation program, and Labor axed a further $10.4 million from this program. This is all happening at a time when passenger numbers to Australia are increasing. They are expected to increase from approximately 32 million to 38 million in just four years. The $34 million hit Customs took has already had the effect of a reduction of 70 staff across primary Customs lines at Australia's eight international airports in the past financial year. This further funding cut will only serve to make waiting times worse. Airports are already short staffed and need more Customs officers, not fewer. Estimates by Customs show that international visitors to Australia will increase by more than 150 per cent and international departures will increase by more than 500 per cent over the next two decades.


Customs staff numbers and resources have not increased in line with passenger numbers. The ever-growing lines will only worsen with this duty-free tobacco ban, as many who would normally linger in duty-free stores will go straight to the Customs processing line. At some airports, such as Melbourne Airport, the lines have grown so bad due to Customs staffing cuts that they sometimes have to keep passengers on the planes, sitting on the tarmac, longer than they ordinarily would so that the Customs primary line is not completely inundated with the ordinary flow of passengers. This is, quite frankly, unacceptable, and it should hardly be considered best practice when you consider how fast some of our regional competitors are able to process passengers through airports such as Hong Kong and Singapore.


I just want to labour that point a little more. You have a situation at one of our major gateways, Melbourne Airport, where passengers who fly in are forced to wait on the tarmac because Customs cannot process people. That means that the Customs hall is so full that they cannot put any more people into it, so they need to keep people on planes, waiting on the tarmac. When you have come on a trans-Pacific flight, you have perhaps already flown for 15 hours. You arrive in Melbourne and have to wait on the tarmac because of the incompetence of the Labor Party in slashing resources to Customs, who can no longer do their job properly because they just do not have the personnel available to do that.


I think that is disgraceful. It is not the sort of impression that we want to make when people arrive in Australia. The government are making these cuts at a time—and I think this is the most egregious part of it—when there is no shortage of money; it is just that they have wasted money in such an egregious way that they have needed to come back and make these cuts to agencies that are dealing with front-line services. We deeply oppose that and we will prioritise front-line services if we get a chance to govern in the future.


I will briefly outline the purposes of the bill, as outlined in the bill's explanatory memorandum.




A division having been called in the House of Representatives—




Sitting suspended from 
10:12 
to 
10:26





Mr KEENAN:
  I was just outlining to the House some of my concerns about the implementation of this measure, and I now move on to the purposes of this bill as outlined in the bill's EM. The explanatory memorandum reads:


1. The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Customs Act 1901 (the Act) to create criminal offences for the smuggling of tobacco products and for the conveyance or possession of smuggled tobacco products where the person conveying or possessing the goods knows they were smuggled.


2. A smuggling offence currently exists in section 233 of the Act and is punishable by a pecuniary penalty of up to five times the duty evaded; however this offence is no longer considered an effective deterrent as many penalties currently imposed for tobacco smuggling are not paid.


I understand that this is because it is often the case that a company is involved, and it has proved to be difficult to pursue the people behind that company. Clearly, it makes sense to avoid that continuing. The EM continues:


3. On some occasions the investigation of the smuggling offence results in the identification of sufficient evidence to warrant the pursuit of fraud offences under the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). In these cases offences carry penalties of up to 10 years imprisonment.


4. These new offences combine the penalties of the existing smuggling and fraud offences by providing a pecuniary penalty of up to five times the duty evaded in addition to up to 10 years imprisonment. The inclusion of the imprisonment penalty will provide a strong deterrent to criminals and will demonstrate the seriousness of smuggling acts.


The government has touted this bill as introducing new measures, but the maximum term of 10 years imprisonment and penalty units already exist under general smuggling and fraud provisions within the Criminal Code. However, it is understood that they are difficult for Customs officers to use for prosecution. The new offences under the Customs Act make it easier for Customs officers to use and require less onerous proof of evidence for prosecution, which the coalition supports.


However, the government needs to answer why this measure has been introduced without any increases in resources for Customs to screen and inspect incoming cargo to stop the illegal tobacco from coming through our borders in the first place. The Labor government seems intent on making it harder for Customs officers to ensure the risk of detection is high and to enforce these penalties. Despite the Attorney-General refusing to acknowledge illicit tobacco smuggling as a problem, the statistics speak for themselves. During 2010-11 Customs made 55 detections in sea cargo arriving in Australia. This equalled 258 tonnes of tobacco and 82 million cigarettes, with a net worth of approximately $135 million. This is just a small indication of the problem considering many more cargo consignments would go unchecked. The potential is that there is a much larger amount of smuggled tobacco coming through our borders thanks to Labor's cuts to cargo inspection.


This bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Committee, which held an inquiry into the bill and recommended that the bill be passed. The coalition takes the recommendations of parliamentary committees seriously and is very happy to accept the determination of this committee.


It is interesting to note the submission made by the Australian National Preventive Health Agency to the inquiry, where they stated:


Smuggling and illicit trade of tobacco undermines the effectiveness of these tax increases and price policies: resulting in cheaper prices and potential increases in tobacco use. This in turn has the potential to contribute to higher incidence of smoking related morbidity and mortality.


According to the agency:




… the use of loose tobacco … has been associated with illness over and above that caused by commercially produced cigarettes due to bulking agents used such as twigs, raw cotton and grass
 clippings.





They also state that mould, mycotoxins and bacteria have been detected in illicit loose tobacco. Given the Attorney-General's crusade against smoking, why hasn't there been a big push to educate people about the dangers of illicit tobacco?



The Customs and Border Protection Service, in their submission, informed the committee that tobacco smuggling is identified as a key border risk. According to Customs, the smuggling of tobacco endangers the community and the environment. As they said:


Smuggled tobacco products commonly contain dangerous contaminants and much higher levels of carcinogens than legitimate products.


Furthermore, they pointed out:


Smuggled tobacco products also circumvent quarantine controls, thereby increasing the potential for exotic pests and diseases to be introduced. 


In their submission, Customs also indicated:


Tobacco smuggling offences are often committed by organised criminal syndicates who view tobacco smuggling as a higher return and relatively low risk venture.


Of particular concern to the coalition is the following possibility noted by Customs:


The profits made by these syndicates can also potentially be used to fund other criminal activities.


The coalition agree with Customs that tobacco smuggling is a serious problem that only lines the pockets of organised crime. We believe it needs to be addressed, not ignored, as it has been for some time by this government. 


The coalition also strongly believe that Customs should be appropriately resourced to do their job, which is to protect Australia's borders from outside threats. I strongly urge the government to, at the very least, reinstate the funding they have cut from Customs cargo inspections so the legislative changes made in this bill will have a better chance of being enforced.

"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2012-08-22,"



Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh) (10:32):  I rise to support the Customs Amendment (Smuggled Tobacco) Bill 2012. The bill creates new offences for smuggling tobacco products and for conveying or possessing smuggled tobacco products. I was very pleased that the Attorney-General announced this on World No Tobacco Day, 31 May, this year. It is a very special day for me because eight years ago I gave up smoking on World No Tobacco Day. I try to get the message out as much as possible to friends, workmates and family that smoking actually kills. Every cigarette you have brings you closer to cancer and many other illnesses. The more we can get that message out, the better for all of us. I also note at the outset that this Labor government has done everything it possibly can to get that message out, putting in a 100 per cent effort to curb the uptake of smoking tobacco.


We know that young people are the only market left in Australia for the tobacco companies. If you look at people over the age of 50, you see there are not many who smoke. There are two reasons for that: either they have given up or they are dead. That is why you rarely see people over 50 smoking. Therefore, the tobacco companies have only one market left in Australia in which to continue to grow and sell their product—that is, young people who for whatever reason are attracted to smoking.


As I said, this government deserves praise for its efforts to curb the uptake of smoking tobacco products, especially by young Australians, and all those efforts have been challenged by the big tobacco companies, sometimes right up to the High Court. Just recently, the High Court made a determination in the government's favour.


I have spoken on many occasions in this place about tobacco and how damaging smoking is to our health, and how we should all be doing all we can to encourage Australians to quit. Better still, they should never start. It is very important to get the message out to young people that they should never start, because quitting is a battle that will stay with them forever. Even although I quit eight years ago, I still consider myself to be addicted to tobacco. Every day the thought of having a cigarette passes through your mind. That is how addictive this product is. You are better off not having that addiction at all than having to battle it continuously. 


Hence this government's well-founded but world-first plain-packaging legislation which diminishes the messaging of cigarette packets. As I have said, that is the only bastion of marketing to young people left—the marketing on the packet. I am very pleased that that will soon go, and so the reason to carry, show or 'sport' any cigarette packet and smoke its contents will be diminished.


We have heard from big tobacco representatives that plain packaging would be a bad thing because it would be easier for unscrupulous profiteers to take advantage of poor unsuspecting people with a propensity to form an addiction. This is what big tobacco say they fear. Their fear, of course, is that someone else will sell product instead of themselves; that their revenue will decrease. They know that plain packaging will reduce their revenue. They have said they fear an increase of counterfeit tobacco products smuggled into this country and sold to an unsuspecting population on the cheap, cutting their sales.


I would hope that most of us here would be more concerned with the number of Australians who put their lives in peril every day by smoking. I understand that around three million Australians continue to smoke around 22 billion cigarettes each year, and over 15,000 Australians are killed by smoking-related diseases, costing us all some $30 billion per year. So we have 15,000 dead and $30 billion up in smoke each and every year.


Dealing in tobacco products, in others' potential pain, misery and death, is utterly contemptible. Doing so shows utter contempt for the state. When you peddle that product, leading to misery for people because they get addicted, it costs the taxpayer billions of dollars when the state then has to pick up through the health system the pieces of shattered lives. I am speaking here of those who run illegal tobacco products.


There has long existed a difference between tax avoidance and tax evasion. Most of us are familiar with the basic distinction. All of us who submit a tax return each year know about using the rules to reduce tax by legal means such as negative gearing. We also know that misinformation, lying on your tax return, is something quite different. Tax evasion is theft from the Commonwealth, and that means theft from each and every one of us—our neighbours, our community, our workmates and the population of Australia as a whole. In a democracy where we are all notionally equal under the law, theft from the state, theft from every one of our fellow citizens, is, in my opinion, a very serious offence. This is what these illegal profiteers of tobacco are doing. Not only are they killing people; they are also committing a serious offence against the state by avoiding taxes.


Many would reason that, while theft from each other is wrong, theft by someone overseas or by a foreign company here in Australia may be even worse as no Australian benefits. This is what we are looking at in this bill today—theft on a grand scale, deliberate and highly calculated, by smugglers of overseas product which is doing damage to each and every one of us, especially to young people, through evasion of the taxes which must be paid by Australian companies who play by the rules.


This bill targets those who would seek to defraud the Australian public to the tune of over a hundred million dollars per year. In fact, in each of the last two years the amount stolen from the Australian public by people who smuggle tobacco into Australia has been as much as $135 million. This activity is illegal and punishable by a penalty equal to two to five times the amount stolen through tax evasion. I think we should throw the book at people or companies who know full well that they are breaking the law for substantial private gain. I do not think anyone would dispute that. I believe the financial penalty should be such that anyone would consider it madness to attempt to break laws through tax evasion and smuggling into Australia an addictive product which makes people ill and kills them.


I acknowledge that it can be difficult to extract these penalties from some criminals. In some cases, a guilty party may ensure he or she appears to have nothing to their name with which to pay the penalty. For this reason, this bill is very important. I support the added disincentive of a prison sentence of up to 10 years, which is applicable to this bill's new offence of smuggling tobacco products and applicable to any person who conveys or possesses tobacco products which the person knows were imported with the intent to defraud the Commonwealth of revenue. Jail time is not currently available as a deterrent for smuggling offences under the Customs Act. I think it is entirely appropriate that this bill carries that jail term.


During 2010-11, the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service made 55 seizures of smuggled tobacco products in sea cargo alone. That consisted of 258 tonnes of tobacco, which is 82 million cigarettes, representing $135 million, plus GST.  The reasons I support this bill are twofold—that smuggling defrauds the Commonwealth and that tobacco products will continue to kill people who are addicted to them. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr TEHAN
 (Wannon) (10:43): No; I am the member for Wannon, Mr Deputy Speaker. I am sure the member for Aston is busy somewhere working on behalf of his constituents—he being a very dedicated, hardworking local member.




Mrs Griggs:
  He is, just like the member for Wannon.




Mr TEHAN:
  It is very kind of my dear friend the member for Solomon to say that I am a dedicated hardworking member. Thank you. Later in life I might be delighted to use that as a reference, because the member for Solomon does a fantastic job on behalf of her constituents. I do not think there has been a harder working local member for the Northern Territory in all the time of the federal parliament.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Wannon might choose to address himself to the bill before the House.




Mr TEHAN:
  The member for Solomon is doing a great job. So it is fantastic to get that endorsement from her. I rise today to speak on the Customs Amendment (Smuggled Tobacco) Bill 2012, which, as stated by the shadow minister, the coalition supports. The process of the bill getting to this place sums up the Gillard government. There is a proper way to do things, there is a proper way to implement, there is a proper way to create laws; and then there is the Gillard government way. It is almost like a Marx brothers approach, like some bizarre sitcom where we are just going to create a story, create a mess, create a muddle and then we will come in and try to half fix it. This bill sums that up. 


In 2009-10, because of Labor's wasteful spending, they had to cut the budget for the Customs cargo screening program by $58.1 million. We also saw their incompetence in pink batts and the BER. They would say that they had a budgetary issue, they had wasted the taxpayers' money and they had wasted the surplus presented to them when the budget was in the black, and all of a sudden they say that they are in the red—they have some issues and they are going to have to cut the Customs screening program by $58.1 million. 


As a result there is less screening, and the smugglers think to themselves that there is an opportunity so they start bringing things through the borders, including tobacco. All of a sudden we have an issue with tobacco smuggling. It is quite an impact. Various surveys and reports have been done; one of which showed that in 2011 an estimated total of 2.26 million kilograms of tobacco might have been smuggled through our borders into the Australian market. That potentially was a forgone tobacco excise revenue of approximately $1 billion. So they say they will cut Customs screening to save $58 million, but the end result is that that has cost us revenue of $1 billion. Only the Gillard government could dream up such a scheme and implement it.




Mrs Griggs:
  The Midas touch in reverse.




Mr TEHAN:
  It is the Midas touch in reverse, as the member for Solomon says. It is quite remarkable. Then they think that they have to do something about this so they had better toughen up on the offences in this area, and they decide they had better implement some changes. So what do they do in implementing the changes? They decide that they will also broaden some of the issues that they are going to address in this bill and look at some modifications to how duty-free provisions for tobacco are handled. The main industry representative body for duty-free issues is the Australian Duty Free Association. As chief of staff to the former minister for tourism, I had dealings with ADFA. They are a wonderful organisation—they are very serious about what they do and very dedicated to the duty-free sector. They understand its importance to the tourism industry. They were always welcome in the office of the former minister for tourism. They were seen as a very sensible organisation, and if they had something to say they would say it properly and base it on facts.


The Australian Duty Free Association had some concerns about the changes and they wanted to bring those issues to the minister's attention. They wrote to the Minister for Health on 9 March 2012, asking if the rumours they had heard through the media, that the government was planning on introducing the duty-free tobacco ban, were true.


The Minister for Health, the member for Sydney, did not even want to engage with ADFA. So what did she write on the letter? She referred it—just flicked it over to the Treasurer—and then wrote on the letter 'a minor organisation'. With all due respect, I would like to give some advice to the member for Sydney, the Minister for Health. Maybe she should stop the personal attacks on people in this place and concentrate on her day job, and she might do it a little bit better. Rather than going out with malicious attacks in the media about members in this place, she should concentrate on doing her job. Doing her job might include, when ADFA write to you, raising some issues which they would like thought about, considered and maybe addressed, rather than rushing out to do some media interview where you are just going to make some rather baseless, crude attacks on people's character, that, instead, you might say, 'I might spend that half an hour seeing ADFA, listening to their point of view, considering their point of view.' You might not agree with it. You might dismiss it. But at least you should recognise that they are an important organisation. They represent a significant part of the tourism industry and they deserve to be heard, not dismissed out of hand with some sort of flick of a pen of 'a minor organisation' over to the Treasurer.


It does bell the cat a little bit that maybe the government's whole objective here has been revenue raising, rather than trying to address this issue. I go back to the first point I made, that maybe we would not be here in the first place if those original cuts had not been made from this 'comical Ali' government, but at least they should give reputable organisations the time of day, not just flick them, in particular when it has been demonstrated that you do have the time to see these organisations, because you have got time to run out to do these press conferences, which can probably only be described as grubby or offensive. Just quit that. There is no need for it—concentrate on doing the work that you should be doing as the Minister for Health.


In that letter, ADFA did raise some concerns which I think are worth placing on the record. The shadow minister did that, but I would just like to make sure that we get them heard, because there is an impact on the duty-free sector as a result of these changes. They wanted it known that there are increased compliance costs for Customs associated with searching travellers with illegal cigarettes entering Australia at all airports. Treasury assumes a revenue gain of $200 million, yet Deloitte Access Economics' conclusion is a maximum of $42.1 million of revenue gain. Once again we see some issues being raised here. Treasury has said $200 million, and we all know they are under pressure. They are under pressure to make sure the government gets its surplus. What we need to do, and what needs to be looked at seriously, is to ask is there credibility in the Deloitte Access Economics conclusion of a maximum $42.1 million revenue gain, and is the government going to relook at the Treasury modelling to ensure that it is right. Otherwise, we are being told one thing by the government to try to get its surplus, yet another by Deloitte that it is only going to generate about a quarter, or even a little bit less than a quarter, of that revenue. I would ask the government to look seriously at that issue and come back and inform the parliament that their modelling is, in fact, correct on this. 


There is going to be a reduction in tax revenue from duty-free operators, suppliers and airports as a result of the reduced profits and the reduced income tax paid by employees, as a result of the job losses that will inevitably occur. There will be a major inconvenience to tourists due to longer queues in busy airports and greater congestion due to additional Customs searches for cigarettes, which will need to be declared, and there is potential for increased black market activities. They are some of the serious concerns that ADFA wrote to the Minister for Health about. They are the concerns that she dismissed with the flick of a pen as coming from 'a minor organisation'. The Minister for Health should look again at the way she is going about running her portfolio if that is the attitude she is taking to these issues.


There are serious issues around the Customs Amendment (Smuggled Tobacco) Bill 2012. Once again, the way the government has gone about implementation leaves a lot to be desired. We do need to tackle the issue of the trade of illicit tobacco and the government has gone some way to doing that by changing the penalties, in particular the 10 years imprisonment. But the fact is that in the 2009-10 budget the Gillard government cut funding for the Customs cargo screening program by $58.1 million. At some stage, the government needs to understand the pressure that has been on Customs over the last three or four years and that Customs needs to be properly resourced. The government needs to come out and acknowledge that. 


We need to see the government place on the record that the $58.1 billion that it cut from the Customs budget was a mistake and that it erred. It would not hurt for the government to do that. There are plenty of other motions at the moment where people are being called on to apologise. I cannot see why the government, if it is serious about apologising, cannot say, 'Okay, we got this wrong.' We need to get proper screening back in place. We have to make sure that the processes are there and that Customs are properly resourced, so it can do its job properly. In conjunction with that, we also need to increase the penalty for being caught in this area and make the maximum penalty 10 years imprisonment. That would be the type of sensible action that would indicate that the government was seriously committed to doing something in this area, instead of just robbing Peter to pay Paul, which is where we are as a result of the government's handling of this issue.


The coalition support the bill. We need to do everything we can to make sure that the issue of smuggled tobacco is addressed and that there are penalties to make sure that this crime does not continue to occur. We also have to look at the lessons learnt in getting where we are today with this bill, because unfortunately at every step it has been a story of incompetence and bungled handling by the Gillard government. One does hope that after so many programs and so many bungled pieces of legislation, one day we might be able to praise the government for having done something properly. I will not hold my breath, but we do live in hope.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Lyons
):  Thank you. I trust the self-praise does not continue with the next speaker. That could happen between the member for Makin and the member for Fowler, but we probably should get on with the question, which is that the bill be now read a second time.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2012-08-22,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (10:59):  I also welcome the opportunity to briefly speak on the Customs Amendment (Smuggled Tobacco) Bill 2012. Firstly, I want to respond to some of the comments made by the member for Wannon. He asserted that as a result of the funding cuts to Customs, we have seen a spike in the sale of illicit tobacco and that that is why we have such a black market. 


Just for the record, the facts show that in the last three years there has been a decrease in the volume of illicit tobacco from the total amount of tobacco in this country. The statistics also show there has been an increase in detections by Customs as a result of their operations. It just highlights that the member for Wannon is incorrect with his assertion in respect to the role of Customs in this matter.


The bill amends the Customs Act 1901 to create new offences of smuggling tobacco products and for conveying or possessing smuggled tobacco products. The new offences carry a penalty of 10 years imprisonment and a fine of up to five times the amount of duty evaded. The tobacco industry is big business and, contrary to trends in some parts of the world, it is growing. In Australia, around three million people over the age of 14 years smoke. According to a 2011 Deloitte report, commissioned by British American Tobacco Australia Ltd, Philip Morris Ltd and Imperial Tobacco Australia Ltd, tobacco global sales in 2011 were estimated to be US$780 billion, having risen from around US$646 billion in 2006. That is more than 50 per cent of the total Australian economy.


Similar trends for tobacco sales occurred in Australia, with the 2011 Australian market value of $10.7 billion comparing with $9.4 billion in 2006. Of course, in Australia that increase is more due to price increases than an increase in sales volume. The same Deloitte report estimated that in 2011 there were 2.264 million kilograms of illicit tobacco sold in Australia, representing 13.4 per cent of the market, and that over the past four years almost $1 billion of tax revenue had been lost. I suspect, however, that the tobacco companies' concern is not for the government revenue lost but for their loss of market share. 


Regardless of their motivation, the fact remains that a black market trade in the order of $1 billion per annum raises serious concerns for government, including concerns about the formation of crime syndicates, bribery, theft, corruption, money laundering and violence. Of course, those figures are calculated estimates as no-one ever really knows what the value of the illicit market is, because there is no form of accurate statistics in respect to that sector of the market. 


Notwithstanding that, I note that in 2010-11 Customs and Border Protection made 55 seizures of smuggled tobacco products in sea cargo, consisting of 258 tonnes of tobacco and 82 million cigarettes, representing a potential revenue evasion of $135 million plus GST. A similar amount of potential lost revenue arose from seizures made in the first nine months of 2011-12, again highlighting that the point made by the member for Wannon is inaccurate.


How much tobacco illegally enters Australia will never be accurately known. But there is little doubt that it is big business run by large criminal networks. Tobacco companies argue that increasing the price of tobacco products encourages a black market in tobacco products. The companies argue that the higher value means there will be more demand for cheaper black market products and, in turn, more profits for illegal operators. I accept that there is some validity to that argument.


According to one report that I have read, the World Health Organization has predicted that by 2020 illegal tobacco consumption will outstrip legal tobacco use. In other words, by 2020 the illegal tobacco market, using today's figures as somewhat of a guide, will be in the order of $600 billion, $700 billion or $800 billion around the world. It is indeed big business. The concern is that when you are dealing with that kind of money then quite clearly you are also dealing with other criminal concerns that need to be addressed, if, for no other reason than the continuing use of tobacco in society presents societies around the world with some very, very serious concerns and problems in the years ahead.


Increasing the penalties for offences relating to tobacco products should be a deterrent. But penalties must be part of a suite of measures including pricing, packaging, advertising and health warnings. It seems, however, that the most effective counter-smoking strategy to date has been the campaign to make smoking socially unacceptable by banning smoking in public venues and public places. A good study in respect of the effects of making smoking socially unacceptable was carried out in the US. It was shown to be the most effective strategy in reducing tobacco consumption. Whilst warnings on packets have been useful and increasing the prices might have assisted, the reality is that the biggest inroads in reducing smoking across the world have been achieved by those places that have made smoking socially unacceptable. We have seen that here in Australia where we have prohibited smoking in workplaces and recreation places. In my view, that has been the most effective strategy applied by governments. It is those kinds of strategies that I believe we need to continue with. As I highlighted a moment ago, we are dealing with a major problem around the world.


I take this opportunity also to commend an initiative between SANE and the Australian government which was announced yesterday by the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing, Mark Butler. This initiative is designed to assist people with mental health issues to quit smoking. People with a mental health condition are more likely to be smokers, with as many as 30 per cent of Australians with a mental illness being smokers. I understand that the figures are much higher for severe mental health conditions. It is the case that those people who are the most stressed and quite often the most desperate are the ones that turn to smoking for some form of relief. The reality is unfortunately that it has the opposite effect—it just makes people more stressed. If you are down and out, it also means that you spend your money on cigarettes when you should be spending money on much healthier options. I particularly note that, in the fact sheet referred to in Minister Butler's media release yesterday, it was stated that diseases caused by smoking are the second-largest killer of people who have a mental illness. This is an interesting statistic. The fact sheet also showed that people with mental illness who quit smoking may need a lower dose of antipsychotic medication. Again, this is an interesting observation in the fact sheet.


Finally, I want to comment on the reaction of the tobacco companies to their loss in the High Court challenge to the Australian government's proposition to ensure that in the future cigarettes are sold in plain packaging. I note that the cigarette companies have now turned to the World Trade Organization and appealed to that body to try and prevent Australia from proceeding with plain packaging for cigarettes. This highlights how significant an issue this is for these companies. It is significant because of the profits being made from the sales of tobacco. It is clearly the case that their concern is not only for the losses that they might incur here in Australia but rather that they fear that other countries around the world might follow Australia's lead and also introduce plain packaging for cigarette products. These companies are prepared to go to the World Trade Organization claiming that this is a breach of some of the trade agreements that we have with other countries in an endeavour to stop the government from proceeding with this proposition. I certainly hope that appeal is also lost by these companies. I understand that it might take some years to resolve, and that will not stop the government from proceeding with the legislation that was passed this year. However, it is of concern to think that every attempt is being made by the tobacco companies to continue to sell their products which they know have serious consequences for users.


As members of this House would know, the effects of tobacco have been known by tobacco companies for decades. In fact, I understand that in the US—and perhaps in other parts of the world, including, I believe, even here in Australia—there have been some successful cases where action was taken against the tobacco companies. Even knowing that tobacco products have serious health effects on consumers, they continue to promote and sell their products wherever they can and in whatever way they can, and I have no doubt that they will stop at nothing to ensure that they are able to continue to do so.


This legislation, as I said from the outset, forms part of a package of measures which not only seeks to prevent the illegal and illicit marketing of cigarette products but is part of a more comprehensive strategy to try and reduce smoking throughout this country. I commend the legislation to the House.

"Entsch, Warren, MP",LP,2012-08-22,"



Mr ENTSCH
 (Leichhardt—Chief Opposition Whip) (11:10):  As the member for Leichhardt, I have taken a very keen interest in measures to control illegal tobacco. I actually grew up in Mareeba, which was one of the largest tobacco-producing regions in Australia. In fact, one of my first jobs was working on tobacco farms, suckering tobacco, at about the age of 12, so I have a reasonable understanding of the legitimate industry and how it functions.


I welcome the opportunity today to support the Customs Amendment (Smuggled Tobacco) Bill 2012. It gives me the opportunity to highlight the concerns raised particularly by tourism stakeholders and others, such as the Australian Airports Association, the Tourism and Transport Forum and the Australian Duty Free Association, about this government's slapdash approach to policy. Of course, tourism is very much the lifeblood of the area that I represent—about 40 per cent of our economy—so we need to be very conscious of any negative impacts that we are likely to have on that industry.


In reading this bill, we must look at it in the context of the recent cuts to the duty-free tobacco allowances, which mean that people arriving at Cairns airport can now bring in two packets per passenger—this is down from in the past, hen it was a carton—as well as successive cuts to the budget of the Customs and Border Protection Service. Both of these make Cairns, and Australia, much more susceptible to quarantine risk and less able to give tourists a good first impression as they are waiting to be processed; by taking what they see as their duty-free allowance and removing it from them or opening the carton and handing them back just two packets of cigarettes. Of course, they do not get any reimbursement for the money they have spent on the whole carton.


The purpose of this bill is to amend the Customs Act 1901 to create criminal offences for the smuggling of tobacco products and for the conveyance or possession of smuggled tobacco products where the person conveying or possessing the goods knows that they were smuggled. Although a smuggling offence already exists under the act which is punishable by a fine of up to five times the duty that was dodged, this is no longer considered to seriously deter smugglers, as many of the fines imposed just do not get paid. On rare occasions, if enough evidence is found to warrant fraud charges being laid under the Criminal Code Act 1995, smugglers can face up to 10 years imprisonment.


These new criminal offences will combine the penalties of the existing smuggling and fraud offences. This means that people who knowingly smuggle tobacco products will face not only the existing fine but also up to 10 years imprisonment. This will certainly provide a strong deterrent to criminals and illustrate the seriousness of these smuggling acts. In the 2009-10 budget, Labor cut funding for the Customs cargo screening program by $58.1 million. The result of these cuts is that the number of sea cargo inspections was cut by 25 per cent and air cargo inspections were reduced by 75 per cent.


With less cargo being screened, there is a greater opportunity for illicit tobacco to be smuggled through our borders. Just this year, an industry-commissioned report into the illicit trade of tobacco in Australia confirmed that illegal tobacco is a real and significant threat. It found that in 2001 our illicit market totalled around 2.26 million kilograms of tobacco, which is equivalent to 13.4 per cent of the estimated legal tobacco market. Illegal tobacco takes many forms: there is duty-free diverted product; there is the counterfeit product, normally originating in China; there are unbranded tailor-made cigarettes; and loose-leaf, or what we commonly know as chop-chop, that has been grown illegally in Australia. 


Tobacco is no longer grown legally in Australia. The Howard government was pleased to support efforts to close the legal growing market in Australia. They saw the buyout of many of the licences on farmers, and effectively paid out those licences in the northern area, in my area, and allowed them to diversify into other areas. A little later, the Victorian industry shut down as well. This was done to safeguard revenue and to reduce the toll from the more harmful and illegal chop-chop market. The illegal chop-chop market was only driven by a few rotten eggs in the tobacco-farming sector, those responsible for diverting products from legal channels. Farmers who shut down their crops were given two years profits by Australian manufacturers in return for cooperating with the authorities, and they were rightly given support as they worked to switch production into other crops.


I say this to highlight that, in its tobacco control reforms, the coalition acted with a great deal of engagement, planning and care to avoid unintended consequences; after all, the hallmark of creating good policy is that it is sensible, workable and evidence based. Our policy was driven by decision making at the Tobacco Industry Forum, which was established by the coalition and is made up of groups that have a keen interest in the tobacco industry. These included the Australian Taxation Office, the Customs and Border Protection Service, the Department of Health and Ageing and the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. Its purpose was to provide a forum for consultation and discussion on issues of mutual concern. By taking a planned approach, we made sure that we were not subject to the embarrassment that typifies this government's knee-jerk policy forays and flights of fantasy. By introducing measures such as the graphic health warnings on cigarettes, the Howard government achieved the lowest rates of smoking in the Western world. 


We are yet to measure the impacts of this government's plain packaging legislation that will see consumers downgrade to cheap unbranded cigarettes, but it is likely that this will see increased consumption of tobacco in the absence of minimum retail price for that tobacco. This legislation will also make detection of illegal tobacco more difficult. Brand colouring, embossing and other distinguishing features being replaced by a standard form of packaging is going to make counterfeiters' work much, much easier. 


At the same time, government is encouraging smuggling by taking the cops off the beat at airports, while restricting importation via duty-free stores. I have a media release from the Australian Duty Free Association issued after the May budget, when duty-free reform was introduced without any consultation with the Australian Duty Free Association or other important travel or tourism stakeholders. In her 8 May media release, the minister was gloating that this reform:


… reduces the number of tax free cigarettes that can be brought into the country and brings duty free tobacco into line with the Government’s tough stand on reducing tobacco consumption …


Yet, after buying into the issue and posturing over her tough stand, the minister has now run away from this issue—since it has become obvious that it was conceived without proper planning. This is the standard that was set by the previous Prime Minister—it was a reason he was removed from the front bench—yet the standard has been retained and if anything it has grown worse under this current government. 


 When ADFA wrote to the health minister, the member for Sydney, she did not bother to engage with them, describing them in a leaked handwritten note as 'minor stakeholders'. This is the peak body for the duty-free stores throughout Australia and certainly not a group that could be trivialised as a minor stakeholder that can or should be ignored. In recent media releases the director of the Australian Duty Free Association, Derek Larsen, states that this measure will radically slash the allowances for duty-free tobacco, with serious implications in the duty-free sector, and it represents a black hole that is approximately 7.5 per cent of the total budget surplus. He also highlights that the government has overstated the available revenue from the measure by around $110 million in 2013 and increasing to $140 million per year thereafter. He adds: 'The total sales revenue generated from duty-free tobacco is far less than the amount that the government estimates it can raise by ending the duty-free concession. It wants to reap more tax revenue from the sector than is generated in total sales.' Quite clearly this is absolutely impossible. 


Importantly as it relates to this bill, Mr Larsen warns that Customs are likely to be heavily impacted by the move and Customs officers will have to dedicate more time to policing the quantities of cigarettes being imported. This will put extra strain on frontline Customs services, which are already working hard to process arriving passengers in a timely manner. As you can appreciate, Mr Deputy Speaker, it will also have a very negative impact on visitors' experiences entering Australia, assuming they are doing the right thing and purchasing their duty-free products at the airport. This is on their arrival in many cases before they go through Customs, and they then find that the product that they have legitimately purchased is removed from them and they are given only two packs.


In my view it is also very much likely to lead to a very significant increase in the black market trade in tobacco. Now that the Australian tobacco industry is virtually shut down, the opportunities for illegal chop chop coming out of Australia have been significantly reduced and this is highly unlikely. But what we are going to see is much more illegal product being imported in larger quantities. We have seen that in recent times, coming probably through our docks.


It is in desperation for a headline and reaching for a measure to prop up a fake surplus that this government is doing untold harm and denying a voice to its collateral victims. Duty-free sales constitute about one per cent of the tobacco industry sales, yet tobacco represents up to 30 per cent of duty-free sales. In its attempt to hurt the tobacco industry, it is instead damaging those who sell it legally. It is also encouraging the illicit trade. 


In the absence of the health minister doing the job, the duty-free sector knocked on the door of Mr Ferguson, our minister for tourism. The duty-free sector informs me that that meeting lasted a total of seven minutes. This is a very clear message that if you are in tourism or tourism connected business and not with the resources and energy sector, the Minister for Resources, Energy and Tourism does not want to hear about your problems and is not available to assist in dealing with these serious issues for your sector. The minister for health, the minister for tourism or someone on the government side needs to come to the chamber in the course of this debate and answer some very serious questions as they impact on smuggling tobacco.


What is the progress on the reprinting of landing cards, at what cost, and why was the estimated cost of $10 million not included in the 2012 budget? What was the involvement of AQIS and what budget plans are in store to destroy the confiscated product? How will this product be treated and where was it purchased? Retail or abroad? What was the full price? What information program is planned for the tourism source markets and why has the government opted not to progress this policy idea without open lines of communication with the industry that has been so heavily impacted? What is the implication for increased waiting times additional to the impact of the Customs staff cuts, and when will these be reported to parliament? Now that crucial sentences will apply to tourists who hide extra cartons in their luggage, what assurance is there that this legislation will apply only to large-scale organised criminal gangs? Finally, when will the election be called— (Time expired)

"Livermore, Kirsten, MP",ALP,2012-08-22,"



Ms LIVERMORE
 (Capricornia) (11:26):  I am very pleased to speak on the Customs Amendment (Smuggled Tobacco) Bill 2012. In beginning my remarks I take issue with one of the opening remarks of the member for Leichhardt, in which he characterised the government's approach to this as a 'slapdash' approach to policy. That is the last criticism that could be made of the government's approach to these measures to reduce rates of smoking in Australia. In fact, this bill and the other measure that the member for Leichhardt spent a great deal of time on in his speech—the reduction in the number of tobacco products that people are allowed to bring into Australia duty free—are two measures that are part of a much larger, comprehensive suite of measures that this government has been pursuing since we first came to government. As speakers throughout this debate have made reference to, these are measures that were identified and recommended by the National Preventative Health Taskforce.


So not on any measure could you characterise this bill or, indeed, any of the other measures we have put into place as a slapdash approach. It has been very clear since we came to government that the Labor government was intent on continuing the efforts of previous governments to reduce the rates of smoking in Australia. There are very good reasons for doing that in terms of the health and lifestyle of our Australian citizens, but as a government we also have a responsibility to make sure that our health dollars are spent wisely and that we do what we can through regulation and support for people to have our rates of smoking as low as possible in Australia. The health effects of smoking are well known and create a very large burden on our health system if not addressed.


I talked about the Preventative Health Taskforce. It was one of the early acts of the Labor government to put in place a preventative health task force to look at this whole question of how to improve health outcomes in Australia and thereby improve people's life outlook, and also to make the best use of our health dollars. The Preventative Health Taskforce report is very interesting reading, and one of the lessons that it contains was very informative to me.


In Australia, we are used to being world leaders in tobacco control and in the regulation that applies to tobacco companies in marketing and selling their deadly products. While we can congratulate ourselves on our achievements to date—in 1988, roughly 30 per cent of Australian adults were smokers; we have brought that down to the current rate of below 20 per cent—one of the things that the Preventative Health Taskforce warn against is complacency by the government and in Australia generally because of what has already been achieved. In their report to the government, they warn against a loss of momentum in national efforts to lower rates of smoking. One thing that really caught my attention in the report was the following statement:


… there has been a 'flattening out' in the reduction in the prevalence of smoking rates in Australia …


It goes on to say:


Between 2004 and 2007 prevalence of weekly rates fell by only 1.1 percentage points (6%), compared to a drop of 2.1 percentage points (9%) over the previous three years.


So the very clear warning in the Preventative Health Taskforce report is that, while there is effective regulation and government efforts have had a very big influence on rates of smoking, we cannot take our eye off the ball. We cannot let up in our efforts in this regard. We cannot be complacent because, as has been demonstrated very clearly in the last couple of years as the government have stepped up efforts against the tobacco industry, we are up against a very powerful, well-resourced, ruthless and unscrupulous opponent in the tobacco industry, which will stop at nothing to protect its vested interest in keeping people smoking and especially in luring young people and others to take up smoking and therefore become addicted to the products that tobacco companies sell.


That warning from the Preventative Health Taskforce is very clear. Yes, we should recognise and applaud our previous achievements and results, and we should take from them the message that strong regulation can have a big influence on smoking rates, but we cannot rest on our laurels. We have to maintain our focus on what governments can do by way of regulation, by way of social marketing et cetera to reduce the rates of smoking.


As I said, I refute the member for Leichhardt's claim that the government have taken a slapdash approach to this policy. This bill, like all those before it, is part of a very comprehensive suite of measures that have all been recommended and backed up by the work of the Preventative Health Taskforce. 


The bill specifically amends the Customs Act 1901, creating new offences for smuggling tobacco products and for conveying or possessing smuggled tobacco products. Significantly, this bill adds a new penalty for those offences. Up till now, someone found guilty of smuggling tobacco products into Australia—bringing in tobacco products without declaring them properly and defrauding the Commonwealth of customs duties—had to pay a fine. But we found that those fines were not being paid. I think there is something like $45 million worth of unpaid fines at the moment. So the government are stepping up our efforts in this area—not only on the basis of common sense and the fact that we do not want people defrauding the Commonwealth of customs duties but also on the basis of advice given to us by the National Preventative Health Taskforce—to further reduce the rates of smoking. So we are adding a penalty of 10 years imprisonment for these offences and expanding the offences in the customs area.


As I said, this bill represents one more element of the government's approach to reducing rates of smoking. We cannot talk about this in parliament today without making reference to the decision by the High Court last week to back up the government's groundbreaking and world-first measure to introduce plain packaging. It is great to have the Attorney-General here in the chamber, as it allows me to congratulate her on the fight which, on our behalf, she took on, and for her very strong advocacy—advocacy which has been recognised right around the world and advocacy which has clearly spooked the tobacco industry. 


They know that our introduction of plain packaging in Australia has sent a very clear signal to other governments around the world who want to step up and implement similar measures. The Attorney-General has mentioned that governments in Norway, France, Uruguay, New Zealand, South Africa and even China are taking very close notice of what we have done in Australia. The efforts of the tobacco companies to keep finding markets for their lethal products are very transparent, as is their blatant pursuit of self-interest in continuing to try to get new people addicted to the smoking habit. There is just no excuse for their continued efforts to fight, in the WTO and through the actions taking place in Hong Kong, against the government's legitimate measures.


I applaud the government's efforts. As I say, this bill is just one of a whole range of measures. One of the most important measures was the 25 per cent increase in the tobacco excise back in April 2010. That has already seen a reduction in the smoking rate. We have also listed nicotine replacement therapies on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. On the one hand, through the excise increase, we are making it more expensive for people to buy tobacco products and, through that measure, we are discouraging smokers—especially young smokers—from taking up the habit. We are also generating a financial incentive to quit for people who are already habitual smokers. On the other hand, through the PBS measure, we are making it easier for people who want to make the decision to quit to take up therapies—giving them a better chance of successfully quitting.


In conclusion, I want to congratulate the Attorney-General and the government for these measures. It is obviously better for their own health outcomes if people do not take up smoking or, if they are already smokers, if they quit. But the government have a responsibility to spend our health dollars in the wisest way possible. Where we see a major cause of preventable death—and smoking is the biggest of those—we have to take every step we can to combat it. This bill is just one more of those measures.


The member for Leichhardt spent a lot of time on the question of duty-free cigarettes being brought into Australia. He characterised the government's steps to address that as 'slapdash measures'. It is actually specifically referred to in a recommendation from the National Preventative Health Taskforce. In fact, the National Preventative Health Taskforce said that we should get rid of it altogether. So taking the step that the government has elected to take, going from 250 grams down to 50 grams, is, on any measure, a reasonable response to a very considered recommendation from the National Preventative Health Taskforce. For the usual vested interests to jump up and down without taking a broader look at what is at stake, either in terms of people's health or the right of the government to improve health and spending outcomes in Australia, is extremely short-sighted and not one that the government is going to be swayed by.

Ms ROXON
 (Gellibrand—Attorney-General and Minister for Emergency Management) (11:40):  I would like to acknowledge the member for Capricornia and other speakers, the members for Hindmarsh and Makin, who talked about the Customs Amendment (Smuggled Tobacco) Bill 2012 in the context of the range of things the government is trying to do in tackling tobacco. I might note, before the member for Capricornia leaves, that I think the chair, the member for McEwen, might have been worrying in that discussion, as one of the few smokers in parliament. I know he has said at different times that he might think about whether he will try to give up what is a serious addiction and, of course, the chair and the member for Corangamite would know that they would have our support and encouragement. 


We acknowledge and understand that this is an incredibly addictive habit. I was interested that the Minister for Health, in her contributions recently to this debate, had some figures I had not heard previously that 80 per cent of current smokers were addicted before they were 19 and something like 95 per cent were addicted before they were 26. This is an active strategy from tobacco companies—to have people addicted early and often for life. We acknowledge and understand why this sometimes is an uncomfortable area for people who are smokers, but I have to say that the member for McEwen—and we have talked often about this—has been a big advocate of the measures we have been taking. I still have not met a smoker that wants their child to smoke, so we know that this is something on which we can make a difference over generations.


The Customs Amendment (Smuggled Tobacco) Bill 2012 is part of that. Obviously we want to make clear that the health risks are the same whether you smoke legal tobacco or illegal tobacco. We do not accept the tobacco industry's view that in Australia we have a large problem with illicit tobacco, but we do accept that measures should be taken to make sure that that does not grow over time. This is one of the odd occasions where the tobacco industry and the government agree that introducing these new penalties and offences is actually an important part of making sure we have a comprehensive response to tobacco related issues generally. The proposed amendments to the bill that are being debated here are about strengthening the offences, introducing for the first time a penalty with imprisonment attached to it for tobacco smuggling, more accurately reflecting the seriousness of the offence and providing a stronger deterrent to criminals, not to make them think this is an easy or a safer way to make money. It is, as members on this side of the chamber have mentioned, part of a much more comprehensive approach that the government is taking to tobacco generally. I would not like to miss the opportunity to say how pleased the government has been that the High Court last week upheld the decision that the government has taken to introduce plain packaging. It, our social marketing campaigns, our increase in excise and our targeting of the Indigenous community, where smoking rates are still very high, are all part of one package to make sure we do everything we can to reduce each and every year the number of people who lose a loved one to a tobacco related illness. 


It is another sign that the government is prepared to do what needs to be done, whether it is taking on tobacco and winning, whether it is pricing carbon, whether it is the National Broadband Network, whether it is the National Disability Insurance Scheme or the education reforms by my colleague the minister for education, who is in the chamber. All these reforms show the government's preparedness to get on with work that is important and I am proud that we are doing that.


We have, as I have said, made quite clear that we agree that any type of tobacco is dangerous and, if we can do anything to reduce the smoking of tobacco, we will obviously do that. As a number of speakers have pointed out, this bill aims to deliver the very strong message that serious jail time will ensue if people are involved in illegal tobacco smuggling into this country. And it makes sure that the offences are now not just general smuggling offences or serious fraud offences against the Commonwealth but are in line with those. They are drafted specifically for that purpose. The need for the bill was recognised by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee that considered the bill and recommended that it be passed. I thank the senators for consideration of the bill.


I would like to briefly address some issues raised by the members for Stirling and Wannon, referring to the reduction in duty-free concession from 1 September this year and the impact this will have on Customs. The government have committed over $11 million over the next two years to assist the Customs and Border Protection Service to implement this change. In their speeches, the members for Stirling, Wannon and Leichhardt were critical of the government for 'cutting funding to Customs'. The facts are that we have invested $4 billion in Customs over the past four years and we will invest another $4 billion over the next four years. We spend more than $1 billion every year on Customs and it is getting results. Briefly, and to not stray too far from the topic of this bill, last year we seized more heroin, cocaine and amphetamines than ever before. 


If people want to look at the different results: in 2007, the last year of the Howard government when untargeted and mass-screening systems were used, Customs detected 870 parcels containing drugs or other prohibited items; last financial year, using criminal intelligence and targeted screening, Customs detected over 1,800. So we have gotten smarter in the way that we do this Customs work. The member for Stirling asked why the government are not doing more to educate the public as to the dangers of illicit tobacco. It is a little rich to suggest that our government have not been doing enough to talk to people about the dangers of tobacco. It was a cheeky suggestion, I think, from someone who has been less than enthusiastic about the other steps we have taken in this tobacco control area.


The Customs Amendment (Smuggled Tobacco) Bill 2012 ensures that we have the right laws in place to continue the fight against illegal tobacco and is part of our ongoing commitment to combat smoking in all its forms. I commend the bill to the House.


Question agreed to.


Bill read a second time.


Ordered that this bill be reported to the House without amendment.

Mrs MARKUS
 (Macquarie) (11:48):  I am honoured to rise today to commemorate the 70th anniversary of Bomber Command. Between 1940 and 1944, the Royal Air Force's Bomber Command provided the only Allied strategic attack capability against German forces on the Western Front and also the only means for disrupting German infrastructure and industry that supported the Third Reich's war machine across Europe. An estimated 10,000 of the roughly 40,000 Royal Australian Air Force personnel serving in World War II were part of the Bomber Command operations. In September 1940 following the Battle of Britain, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill said:


The fighters are our salvation but the bombers alone provide the means of victory.


This statement, although at the beginning of the Bomber Command, still rings true through the retelling of the history and camaraderie displayed throughout World War II. Australian historian Dr Alan Stephens wrote:


No single group of Australians from any service did more to help win World War II than the men who fought in Bomber Command.


The contribution and sacrifices that these men and women made for our nation and our freedoms will not be forgotten. They remain an extraordinary example of the true spirit of ANZAC.


These 10,000 Australians represented just over one per cent of Australian enlistments in all services during World War II; however, they accounted for nearly 10 per cent of all Australian combat deaths during that war period. These 10,000 men served as part of a combined Allied unit of more than 125,000 air crew, men that the then British empire recruited from Australia, New Zealand, Canada and South Africa as well as many countries which had fallen under Nazi occupation, such as France, Poland and Czechoslovakia. This group managed the night-time operations while the United States Air Force managed the day operations. A key part of the strategy was to have 24-hour coverage throughout the war.


At the peak of the bombing campaign over 1,000 heavy bombers would attack on any one night, but up to 10 per cent of aircraft and crews could fail to return. One RAAF veteran has said: 'Our skipper told us that every day we survived in Bomber Command was a bonus.' So high were the risks of the operations that between 1943 and 1944 crews had less than a 50 per cent chance of surviving a tour of 30 operations.


A wonderful Australian from the electorate of Macquarie, Air Commodore Geoffrey Michael, served in Bomber Command. As a part of the operations, Air Commodore Michael made a total of 32 trips and is proud to say that not one of his crew was lost—that is despite the fact that four trips needed to be aborted due to engine fire. I have often spoken with Air Commodore Michael about his experience during the war and have a deep respect for the contribution he has made to our nation, as well as the great contribution he made upon his return. He was commander of Richmond RAAF base for a number of years and later became mayor of our community. When I spoke with Air Commodore Geoffrey Michael recently, he humbly and, in quite an understated manner, described each of the 32 trips as a satisfactory experience, completed by a strong team effort where every member played an important role—the role being to finish the mission and then to get your mates back to Allied soil.


In June this year, 31 Australian men and women who served as a part of Bomber Command travelled back to London to commemorate the 70th anniversary of operations. Queen Elizabeth unveiled a bronze sculpture of seven aircrew to mark the occasion as a sign of respect to the contribution of the Bomber Command Allied Forces. The sculpture is representative of all the efforts from all of the countries and displays the bravery and mateship of the airmen returning from a mission. This is a fitting tribute to mark the 70th anniversary.


I am always humbled by the contribution made by the generations who have led us, who served to protect the Australian way of life and our freedoms. As stated by respected historians, the Australian participation in the Bomber Command operations went a long way to preserving that. It gives me great honour today to pay tribute to these ordinary men who did extraordinary things.

Mr Stephen Smith:
 The answer to the honourable member’s question is as follows:


(1) (a) The Government approved the acquisition of up to 214 additional Bushmasters on 26 June 2012. 


(b) The Defence Materiel Organisation executed a Contract Change Proposal for the additional Bushmasters on 13 July 2012.


(c) The decision has not slipped due to the 2012-13 federal budget.


(2) (a)The Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) has a total of 12 C-130H aircraft. Of these, four are currently in preservation maintenance. All 12 C-130H aircraft will be withdrawn from service. 


(b) The intended cease date for C-130H operations is 1 December 2012. C-130H aircraft will be progressively withdrawn from service as each aircraft falls due for its next planned maintenance servicing. 


(c) The C-130H planned withdrawal date previously was December 2013. 


(d) The disposal strategy for the C-130H is being prepared by Defence and will include the transfer of four C-130H aircraft to Indonesia as announced by the Government. 


(e) A total workforce of approximately 250 are employed in support of C-130H aircraft, including prime contracts with QANTAS Defence Services, Raytheon and CAE Ltd and Australian based sub-contractors including Rosebank Engineering, Marshall Aerospace and Kellstrom Australia. The largest segment of industry workforce supporting the C-130H aircraft is approximately 80 QANTAS Defence Services technicians employed at RAAF Base Richmond in airframe deeper maintenance. 


(f) Total RAAF personnel numbers at RAAF Base Richmond are expected to remain about the same as the C-130H aircraft is drawn down. RAAF personnel operating and supporting the C-130H aircraft will be progressively redeployed in 2012 and 2013 across other RAAF capabilities including the C-130J aircraft and C-27J aircraft transition. The C-27J aircraft Squadron will progressively ramp up to a Squadron of approximately 211 personnel, with most of these people drawn from the C-130H aircraft workforce. 


Contractor support requirements at RAAF Base Richmond for both C-130J and C-27J aircraft are currently under review.


(g) The Minister for Defence has not visited RAAF Base Richmond since the announcement to retire the C-130H fleet. However, the Chief of Air Force, Air Marshal Geoff Brown visited personnel working to support the C-130H aircraft fleet on 9 May 2012, the day following the Federal Budget announcement.
