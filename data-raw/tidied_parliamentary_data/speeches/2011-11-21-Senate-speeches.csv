Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (11:12):  I rise to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Family Participation Measures) Bill 2011. This bill establishes two pilots: one that requires teenage parents to complete their education and one that requires eligible parents in jobless families on income support to get themselves job ready. These reinforce the principle of mutual obligation, about which the coalition has always been serious. We do not believe in the welfare entitlement mentality. One of the core Liberal principles is mutual obligation:


… whereby those in receipt of government benefits make some form of contribution to the community in return, where this is appropriate.


Those words are part of the Liberal Party federal platform.


Encouraging people to take charge of their own lives and obtain the skills to be able to support themselves and their families is a good thing for the people involved and for society in general. Welfare dependency clearly has adverse effects. When people receive passive welfare payments with no obligations attached they fall in to a cycle of dependency that can be very difficult to get out of. I am sure that many senators in this place would bear witness to this occurrence in their own electorates. Individuals who are in this cycle of dependence have little opportunity to play their part in Australia's prosperity.


According to government figures, there are approximately 11,000 teenage parents in receipt of parenting payment. Of those 11,000, about 90 per cent have not completed year 12. Completing year 12 is not in itself the ultimate educational goal—there are many other opportunities such as work or apprenticeships—but it is a process of learning. We want to encourage these young parents to continue their education, whether it be in a formal academic setting or perhaps in on-the-job training processes. There are also about 257,000 jobless families who receive income support and who have reported no income in the last year, and these are families with dependent children. In 2007, according to the latest available international comparisons, Australia had the fourth highest rate of children living in jobless families within the OECD. 


One of the most dangerous outcomes of welfare dependency is the effect it can have on the next generation. Some kids grow up never knowing what it is like to have a parent with a steady job. There are children who are missing out on learning about the life skills and pride that come with earning for yourself and being able to support your family. That is why the coalition worked very hard to encourage people to move from welfare into work when we were in government.


In terms of the big economic picture, the coalition's record is one where, while in government, we got the budget back into the black, we got rid of billions of dollars of previous Labor government debt and we laid the framework for a secure economic future for the nation. This led to more jobs, lower taxes, more productive workplaces and better living standards, among many other things. In such a positive environment, more people were—and are—able to find work. The unemployment rate under the coalition fell from 8.2 per cent in 1996 to just 4.3 per cent in August 2007—the lowest unemployment level in 33 years.


More specifically, through programs like Work for the Dole, the coalition encouraged more Australians off welfare and into work. From 1997—when Work for the Dole commenced—to 2007, over 555,480 people took part in 32,826 Work for the Dole activities. This helped them to improve their work ethic. It is something that many of us can bear testament to. At the Work for the Dole programs that we attended during that time, the individuals who were involved in these programs often sought us out, came up and said how meaningful and valuable it had been in helping them get their lives back on track. It gave these individuals valuable work experience and helped to improve their self-esteem and sense of pride in making a contribution to the community.


I say these things to demonstrate to the Senate that the coalition does indeed have a proven track record of supporting mutual obligation. This is in stark contrast to many of the words that are used by the Labor government. Time and time again, we have seen that this government makes tokenistic attempts at meaningful action. We have seen repeated knee-jerk reactions to problems that are often of its own making. In many instances, as the saying goes, this govern­ment is all about spin and not about substance. There is a growing concern amongst others and by me that we see more tokenism again in this bill. I make the point that this bill establishes a pilot program—not a proper program. It begs the question: why doesn't the government commit to a proper program? One could draw the conclusion that it is concerned that it will once again make a mess of the program—like it has done with so many others—and by calling it a pilot it can say, 'We were just experimen­ting with this.'


The coalition has consistently pushed for better mutual obligation requirements. Whilst the government has embraced a small part of that with this bill, it is going only part of the way that it should. It raises a number of questions. The first one relates to the monitoring of the teenage parent pilot program. Whilst the coalition welcome the intent behind this bill—it aims to encourage engagement—we still clearly have some concerns. With the teenage parent pilot, we ask: how will the government monitor whether the parents have been complying with their participation plans and how will the government enforce the obligations of the parents? It is all very well to establish a pilot with good intentions, but we need to be able to monitor it effectively to ensure that it is working properly and for its intended purpose.


The coalition also supports attempts to have parents re-engage with the workforce early. However, the coalition is concerned that with the jobless family trial, as demonstrated in this bill, once again, there is no requirement to comply with the plan signed by the participants. So the coalition will be proposing some amendments to ensure that the parents do comply with their plan. Let me spell this out quite clearly: signing onto a plan is enough for the parents in this jobless family trial, but they do not actually have to comply with the plan that they have put forward. This does not pass the commonsense test. There should be a compliance regime that requires participants in each trial to comply and follow through with what they have promised to do in their plan. In addition, it appears that this bill completely removes the power from the secretary to intervene in extenuating circumstances. The coalition would like the secretary to be able to intervene in extenuating circumstances, and so I flag that we will be moving amendments to reflect that.


In conclusion, we know very well that this is a government that is big on talk and very short on delivery. We know that, unfortunately, this government has breached faith with the Australian people on many occasions, either by failing to keep its promises or, indeed, breaking its promises. While the coalition support the principle behind this bill, we believe it can be improved. We believe that, to encourage parents to improve their lives and those of their families, we need to make some amendments, and we will be doing that to seek to make this bill more effective in achieving its stated aims.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2011-11-21,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:21):  It will come as no surprise to the chamber or to Australia that the Greens oppose the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Family Participation Measures) Bill 2011. This is a continuation of the punitive approach that started with the Welfare to Work regime of the Howard government era that Senator Bernardi was just championing. Unfortun­ately, there is no evidence to show that the punitive approach works. Again, the government is choosing to suspend payments and take a punitive approach, in this instance, to jobless families. We particularly have concerns about the issues around teenage mothers. Instead of supporting these most vulnerable people in our community, the government is again seeking to take a punitive approach. We believe it is unnecessary and ineffective and that it stigmatises young parents who face a number of significant challenges. While we do agree that teenage parents need a lot of assistance and we are aware they have poor educational achievements, threatening them with a punitive approach, to our mind, does not work. We believe it could have grave ramifications for young parents and their children.


We should be aiming to encourage young people and jobless families to overcome the barriers that prevent their participation in employment and education. The barriers that prevent people from participating in employment and education are very significant. The government's own Social Inclusion Board has produced a number of papers that address this very issue. The government is addressing some of the key areas, but it is giving with one hand and taking with the other: 'Do this or else.' As I said, we do support the aim of encouraging young and long-term unemployed parents into education and work. Unfortunately, it is the compliance mechanisms that we have significant problems with.


We are deeply concerned that these measures will further marginalise young and long-term unemployed parents. As was articulated in the second reading speech, this is part of a process of 10 trials around the country. There are a series of measures, some of which include the further rollout of income management, which is being trialled in five sites. Other measures will be undertaken in other sites. The income management measures will be applied in Logan and Rockhampton in Queensland, Playford, Bankstown, Wyong, Shellharbour, Greater Shepparton, Hume, Burnie in Tasmania and Kwinana in my home state of Western Australia.


Despite all the rhetoric from this government and the previous government about Welfare to Work and the punitive approach, the government has provided little evidence that this punitive approach actually works. Yes, there is concern about barriers to education and work, but the government offers no research explanation as to why this particular approach will work. There are reasons why people miss appointments; they can be many and varied. People must overcome very significant barriers to completing their education and barriers to accessing workplaces, as has been articulated in the government's own documents.


This bill continues the pattern of punitive measures that the government insists on pursuing without any introspection. We see the same with the legislation that the government is going to be introducing to continue to roll out the Northern Territory emergency response. Don't let a little bit of evidence get in the way of rolling out a really good punitive scheme! We have consistently opposed the Welfare to Work measures. We do not believe this is the appropriate approach. As I said, the research indicates that in fact it is not the appropriate approach. We need to look at the barriers to education. Yes, we want to encourage young parents into the workforce and we need to address these barriers and not simply dock their income support when they fail to comply. If you are trying to work with people and encourage them to overcome barriers, simply taking a punitive approach and threatening them does not generate the trust that is needed to work in partnership with them.


Across this and many other budget measures, some of which are still to come and some of which we have already debated in this place, the government plans to make life harder for people on pensions and allowances. We believe measures such as the changes to the eligibility criteria for the disability support pension which we have debated in the place, as well as the failure to index thresholds and the failure to index supplements, all have cumulative effects on families. I have consistently asked in this chamber and also in estimates whether the government has done any work to assess the cumulative impacts of these measures on families and sole parents. To date this has not been adequately addressed. The approach the government is taking is simply continuing and extending measures that the previous government started. We continue to see the erosion of allowances for those on income support. It becomes worth less and less. The inequity between allowances and pensions gets worse. Those on Newstart are living on $132 less than those on the age pension, for example. This measure will make this issue even worse for those most vulnerable in our community, teenage parents.


A lot of these measures to get tough on people on income support—income management, for example—seem to us to have been imported from the US, where they denigrate and demonise people on income support. We now seem to be taking the same approach in Australia. Transplanting these measures from one country to another does not necessarily work, particularly as we have very different issues in Australia. As was pointed out in the second reading speech for this legislation, there are around 11,000 teenage mothers in this country—about 2.5 per cent of those who receive the parenting payment. This is a small percentage. While the Greens think teenage pregnancy is good for neither the parents nor the children—we do not advocate it—we believe that what we need to be doing is working out how we can help mothers in this situation. As has been articulated, most of these parents do not have a year 12 education, and of course we all know about the link between education and better job prospects but also life outcomes for both the parents and the children. But what impact does threatening to take away their income support and carrying it out have on the mother and the child?


We are particularly concerned about the impact of this heavy-handed approach on young women—some of the most vulnerable people in our community—who are dealing with very significant issues in their lives, not to mention the fact that they are mothers at such a young age. As well as that, they will have to deal with a punitive approach by Centrelink, the very organisation that they are now supposed to go to to access case management and to access support to participate in education—and the organisation that will threaten them if they do not turn up. Again, this is not the way to help young parents and teenagers to re-access education and re-engage with the system.


While it is true that once young parents comply they will get back pay, how are they going to afford their day-to-day living expenses? How will they survive? How will they feed their children and pay their utility bills? This policy assumes that parents have support networks, secure tenancy and enough money for basics. Of course they do not have those things. There is a high potential for them to not have support networks—they may be alienated from their parents. They certainly will not be in a position to have a secure tenancy and it is unlikely that they will have enough money for basics. Realistically, on top of all that, education is going to be at the very bottom of the list. As Welfare Rights Network and ACOSS write:


An initiative designed to support young parents should not involve any risk of increasing the levels of poverty or children being left without access to food, essential health care and shelter.


That is exactly what will happen if you take this to the final point of the legislation: children will not be guaranteed access to food, essential health care or shelter. 


What should an initiative look like that actually supports young and long-term unemployed parents? As we have already articulated, this group have the least education and are disenfranchised. They need encouragement, support and incentives to assist them to re-engage with the system and to assist them to access education and meaningful employment that suits their needs and improves their standard of living. We must offer as much support as possible—support in getting an education, learning life skills and helping them find employment that they can mix with their child-rearing responsibilities.


Yes, coordinated case management is essential and individualised, tailored engagement participation plans can make a real difference, but it must be done in a way that cultivates a young person's confidence and skills. If you take the punitive approach, that will create a very different relationship for that young person with the system that is supposedly trying to help them. We know that case management has proven effective in helping to improve social outcomes. We need to invest further in this rather than spending money on enforcing compliance processes. We need to help young families address obstacles and barriers to their participation, such as lack of child care and poor access to public transport. While there is some support offered for child care, we believe it is not enough. We also know that in most of the trial locations where this process is being rolled out public transport is poor. 


We believe the support incentives are not enough. We do not believe that this is the appropriate way to tackle this issue. We do not believe we need this legislation. We believe we need to be addressing these problems by putting more resources into engaging with families and empowering them to take control of their own lives rather than pursuing a punitive approach.


At this stage, should this legislation go through, it is unclear whether there is sufficient protection for young parents and consideration of their special needs. For example, when a teen appeals the suspension of their payment, will they receive an automatic payment pending review? They should. Will Centrelink staff receive specialised training in engaging with young parents? Will Centrelink address the specific issues that so strongly alienate young parents from the system and address the barriers to their participation in the system? Will they be able to understand the requests for special consideration or appeals, even if a young person does not use the correct terminology? In these instances, you are dealing with a group of people who have the least experience in dealing with the social security system. 


We are also concerned about the risk of domestic violence and the impact that this can have. We already know that there is a very poor application rate for exemptions due to domestic violence. I think it is around three per cent. We are concerned that in the broader community there is a lack of engagement with and understanding of how to apply for an exemption due to domestic violence. For this particular group of young people, knowledge of that particular exemption is guaranteed to be even poorer.


What will happen to participants if they move outside the trial sites? Will they continue to be subject to the requirements of the trial where there is no guarantee they will be able to access the various supports that this program purports to put in place? What will happen to those people? One of the trial sites for the income management process is Kwinana in Western Australia. We know that in that area the government could not get enough participants and had to expand it virtually across the whole of metropolitan Perth. Will we see teen mums moving away from the trial sites and further away from any family support that they may have? If the case management proves to be adequate and we see them moving away from that, will they still be subject to this? I am looking forward to these questions being addressed by the minister in the summing up.

"Thistlethwaite, Sen Matt",ALP,2011-11-21,"



Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (11:36):  The purpose of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Family Participation Measures) Bill 2011 is to allow for the conduct of participation pilots for teenage parents. The amendment delivers on a commitment made by the government in the last budget. During the budget, the government announced the introduction of these participation pilots for teenage parents. We did not simply announce this participation pilot; we have also backed it up with encouragement, support and incentives for greater education for teenage parents. The form of that support came in the budget through expenditure of $80 million over four years to provide additional training places for single and teenage parents in receipt of income support. I do not believe it is fair at all to characterise these reforms in isolation as punitive measures.


The bill will implement a commitment made by the government in the last budget. It will implement what is known as 'the teenage parents' trial from 1 January 2012 and what is known as 'the jobless families' trial from 1 July 2012. These trials, which will occur at 10 disadvantaged locations throughout the country, were announced in the budget as part of the Building Australia's Future Workforce package. The trials will provide for new services, opportunities and responsibilities to boost the educational attainment, job readiness, child wellbeing and functioning of families with young children in some of the most disadvantaged locations throughout the country. 


Specifically, the basic elements of the teenage parents' participation pilots are that parents on income support will be required to attend six-monthly interviews with Centrelink once their child turns six months of age. Once the child is 12 months old, the purpose of the interview with Centrelink will be to develop a participation plan aimed at improving the educational outcomes of the parent by focusing on their most basic needs. No. 1 amongst those needs is an adequate education. The plan will focus on school completion, on foundation skills or certificate level qualifications as well as the health, safety and education of the child. Support for the participation plan will continue until the parent achieves year 12 completion or the child turns six years of age.


The bill recognises that there is no greater benefit that we can give our kids in modern day society than an education. A basic year 12 education is a passport to employment and participation within society. We need to ensure that we do all we can to encourage and provide an incentive for teenage parents to ensure that they complete that basic passport to participation and employment in our society. Under the trial, teenage parents will need to work towards obtaining their year 12 qualification or its equivalent whilst continuing to engage in a range of activities focusing on the health and wellbeing of their child. Parents in the jobless families trial will need to develop a plan outlining how they will move towards being job ready once their youngest child starts school and how they will prepare their child to be ready to go to school.


The teenage parents trial is funded at $47.3 million over four years; the jobless families trial is funded at $71.1 million over four years. Currently, only parenting payment recipients with children aged six or seven years of age have participation requirements and can be required to comply with the terms of an employment pathway plan. A failure to meet some of those requirements can—not necessarily will—result in sanctions being imposed under the job seeker compliance framework. But, as I stressed earlier, it is important to note that these reforms are coupled with additional spending in this area to provide the necessary encouragement, support and incentive for those who may be subject to this trial to gain basic qualifications and a pathway to employment.


The amendments in the bill broaden the participation requirements and compliance sanctions for parenting payment recipients with children under six who are part of the 'teenage parent of jobless families' trials operating in those 10 disadvantaged locations throughout Australia. The bill is designed to create new opportunities for the 4,000 single parents who reside in those 10 trial locations. In my state those locations are Bankstown, Wyong and Shellharbour—areas where there are lower socioeconomic indicators and lower levels of educational attainment amongst certain age groups and areas where there are difficulties in some locations related to entrenched poverty and the cycle of poverty.


These reforms are aimed well and truly at trialling in these areas new ways to ensure that members of our community who otherwise may have been susceptible to being driven into that ongoing cycle of poverty—the poverty trap, intergenerational poverty—are provided with a circuit-breaker. That circuit-breaker comes in the form of support from Centrelink and government through those additional funds focusing on teenage mothers and ensuring that they continue to pursue basic educational outcomes.


For teenagers who do become parents, this bill will provide guidance and support to enable them to learn life skills, to get and finish a decent education and to give their child the best start in life. Being a parent is tough for anyone, and no-one disputes that. There are additional burdens and difficulties that come with being a teenage parent and that is why this government is committed to providing the support and guidance that these young parents need to develop their skills and work readiness, helping them to provide a better future for themselves and their children.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2011-11-21,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (11:44):  I thank all senators who have made a contribution to the debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Family Participation Measures) Bill 2011. This legislation delivers on the budget commitment for the teenage parents and jobless families measures under the government's Building Australia's Future Workforce package. These measures provide new services, opportunities and respon­sibilities to boost the educational attainment, job readiness, child wellbeing and function­ing of families with young children in some of the most disadvantaged locations in the country. 


We have a growing economy and a strong labour market but not all Australians are benefiting equally from this. Joblessness among families continues to be a significant, social and economic problem in Australia. It is associated with higher rates of poverty, poor health status and low educational attainment for parents and their children. There is a strong intergenerational tendency for joblessness in families. By taking steps to build family functioning and skills, this government aims to break the cycle of welfare reliance and give disadvantaged parents and their children a brighter future.


Through the teenage parents and jobless families measures, the government is providing greater opportunities for parents to build on the own skills and capabilities, providing a pathway to better life outcomes for themselves and their children. The government recognises the important role that parents play in caring for their young children. These measures are being introduced to enhance this role, not to reduce it. There are often many services available in local communities that can provide the support and assistance parents need to plan and move forward in a positive way. These measures encourage parents to make the most of the services they are entitled to in their local communities. By introducing requirements for teenage parents receiving parenting payment in 10 trial locations, the government is sending a clear message that having a child does not mean the end of your education. Teenage parents in the trial will be required to engage in activities to help them attain year 12 or an equivalent qualification. They will also be required to do activities with their child or children that will maximise their health and education outcomes. Children need good early childhood development opportunities to help them become school ready both socially and academically.


Parents in the jobless families trial will be required to attend interviews with Centrelink where they will develop a plan focusing on job preparation and future employment. They too will be asked to do activities in their local communities designed to get good early health and education outcomes for their children. These measures are about building on and enhancing family functioning, skills acquisition, community engagement and making sure that families are well equipped for the future. All Australians on income support should have the opportunity to access the full range of services available to improve the lives of their families, but with this opportunity comes responsibility. This bill strikes the right balance in ensuring that those opportunities are made available to parents who need them while clearly stating that parents need to meet their respon­sibilities to ensure that early health, education and well-being outcomes are achieved for their families.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2011-11-21,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (11:48):  Minister, as I outlined in my speech in the second reading debate, the bill has good intentions and in general and in principle the coalition are not opposed to these intentions. However, we do have some concerns about what the point is in introducing obligations where there is no effective penalty attached to them. Two of my amendments, which have been circulated in the chamber, go to this very fact. They deal with schedule 1 items 8 and 9, which is where some parenting payment over­payments are not considered debts to the Commonwealth. By way of brief explanation and so as not to delay the Senate longer than we need to: where someone has been paid on the basis that a person has qualified for parenting payment and then that person fails to meet one or more of the participation requirements, therefore being deemed ineligible, they have received funding or money inappropriately—to anyone who rationally considers that particularly issue—yet the Commonwealth is saying that they have no debt obligation. 


I can understand at one level that there must be some concern about attaching a debt to an individual who may already be in difficult financial circumstances, particularly where children are involved. If there is simply an obligation for someone to sign up to a plan and then not fulfil any commitment to that plan, however, I really feel that is more about tokenism than anything else. I would seek your response to my concerns in that area.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2011-11-21,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (11:51):  The government is mindful in this case, as I said in my summing-up contribution, to getting the balance right. Acknowledging some of the concerns raised by Senator Siewert, the government's intention is that the penalty provisions be utilised only as an absolute last resort and would indeed apply to only a very small element of the target population. This is what colours the government's mind when looking at the amendments proposed by the opposition. We certainly understand the point and highlight that compliance measures in relation to all income support arrange­ments are important but, on this occasion and with this particular targeted group, we think the provisions as they stand strike that right balance. In that respect, suggestions that this program is about token measures can, I think, be addressed simply by looking at all that has gone into the measures to ensure that these very young, vulnerable families—young women in particular—receive support, as I indicated, to highlight that being a teenager and having a young child is not the end of your education. This is a significant mind shift for many young girls contem­plating a future along with a pregnancy.


Whilst we have been very concerned to ensure that the balance is right and that penalties are absolutely a last possible resort—and, Senator Bernardi, I am not sure if we are dealing with all of your amend­ments at the moment or a particular grouping of them—the government's view is that the balance in this bill is the best we can address for a targeted trial type arrangement, although we certainly will be mindful of the issues that you have raised when we are looking at how effectively that trial has worked.




The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Moore
):  To clarify, Senator Bernardi, are you moving any of your amendments at this stage or are you into general questions?

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (11:53):  I am into general questions but they are going to my amendments, though I have not formally moved them.



The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN:   Particularly (3) and (4)?




Senator BERNARDI:
  Particularly amendments (3) and (4), which are about the debt due to the Commonwealth.


Minister, you spoke about the penalties for noncompliance. At one level, as it says in the bill's explanatory memorandum, 'parents who fail to attend appointments/workshops with Centrelink without a reasonable excuse' and who do not 'attend a rescheduled appointment/workshop' can have their income support payments suspended. I think that is under clause 17 of the bill. If they then fulfil their obligation they get those released with full back pay. That is for individuals. But those who come under the second clause of this bill, about families, do not, from my reading of this, have any penalties whatsoever attached to them. If they fail to comply with a plan, which is their only obligation, the only penalty attached is that they may be required to go more frequently to interviews where there is further noting that they have failed to comply with the plan. That is not really a penalty in any meaningful sense. At one part of this, a teenage mother—and I presume it applies just to teenage mothers, which may beg another question in a moment—can lose their payments until they comply, but when it is in regard to a family they may not. Indeed, there is no penalty attached to it once they have done their plan. Is my reading of this correct and, if not, could you please tell me what the penalties are if someone creates a plan and then fails to comply with it under the two different scenarios?

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2011-11-21,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (11:56):  Your reading of the bill is correct. However, it moves away from the intent of the bill, which is to target this specific audience and to focus more on generating opportunities rather than on pursuing penalties. If we, for instance, look at the opposition's amendments (3) and (4), which relate to debt accumulation of the parenting payment and supplements, not family payments, in that context the measure is about helping parents improve their lives and those of their children. Teen parents are one of the most vulnerable groups in society, and we believe we have already achieved the balance of creating opportunities requiring responsibility through the suspension model. Anything beyond that is too harsh and contrary to the policy intent.


If I go to the other proposed amendments (1), (2) and (5), relating to exemptions, I indicate that the trial is designed to assist vulnerable teenage parents. We will be providing new services, opportunities and responsibilities to boost educational attain­ment, job readiness, child wellbeing and the functioning of families with young children in some of the most disadvantaged locations in the country. We want everyone, especially the most vulnerable, to benefit from this assistance. Vulnerability in individual circumstances will be taken into account in the development of participation plans. The likelihood of teen parents falling into this category is relatively minimal. That said, the broader compliance issues remain important for the government and, through this trial, we will be monitoring the issues that you have raised.

 (South Australia) (11:58):  Thank you, Minister. I hear your words and I understand you have accepted some advice in respect of this but I have grave concerns that they are platitudes; they are just about implementing a pilot program that is going to be neither effective nor efficient.


That brings me to another question in respect of the suspension of income support payments where parents fail to attend appointments with Centrelink without a reasonable excuse or fail to sign an employment pathway form. I understand that, as part of this, when parents comply with the employment pathway plan after having had a failure they get full repayment of their benefits. But let us imagine a scenario in which a parent fails to comply for a period of weeks and thus has no income support coming through. Has the government considered the impact it would have on the child who is in the care of the parent if possibly the only form of income for supporting and sustaining the child were suspended?

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (11:59):  The government has taken into account the impact of any financial penalties on the wellbeing of the child. These participation plans have been designed to ensure that the child's interests are paramount. Family tax benefit is not affected by these measures, and that ensures that payments directly targeted at family members will continue. It is the income support component that is targeted on this occasion. It needs to be remembered that the whole objective of participation plans is to provide wraparound support for these very vulnerable families. To the extent that some families might continue to breach participation plans, the support and resources of the community associated with those plans will be drawn upon. The removal of income support is meant to be a very last resort. Presumably we would be looking at situations that may involve child protection or other arrangements, if we are talking about family circumstances of the nature Senator Bernardi mentions.

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (12:01):  We believe that this is neither a strong enough incentive for people to do the right thing nor a disincentive to stop them doing the wrong thing. To facilitate the government's guillotine, I will now indicate that the opposition formally opposes items 8 and 9 of schedule 1, as set out at amendments (3) and (4), as circulated, in the following terms: 


(3)   Schedule 1, item 8, page 4 (lines 8 to 21), TO BE OPPOSED.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:03):  I have several questions of the minister and I will also indicate the Greens' position on our amendments. Before moving them I wish to ask the government a few questions on some issues I articulated in my second reading contribution. What happens to participants if they move out of a trial area?

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (12:03):  If people are within a trial area and under participation arrangements and they move out of that trial area, their program will continue. There will be flexible Centrelink services to ensure that occurs—except if they move to a remote location.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2011-11-21,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:04):  You say there will be flexible services available. Does that mean when they go to their nearest Centrelink office they will have access to case management and the whole process we have been talking about?

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2011-11-21,"



Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (12:05):  The case management in those types of circumstances will not be quite the same as it is in a trial area, but Centrelink is developing remote arrangements to ensure that they have the appropriately qualified staff delivering post-management services. That may be over the phone or it may be online. These arrangements are still being developed to ensure that if people move out of the pilot areas case management support continues.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:05):  I do have some concerns about that. As I understand it, extra funding is being made available for these support services in the trial areas. If a number of people move out of the trial areas, there will be a group of people subject to these provisions that are not getting the support this process intends and they may suffer adverse consequences. I touched on appeals. Will people subject to these provisions be able to appeal suspension of payments through the usual appeal processes?

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:06):  I also raised the issue of specialised training for Centrelink staff.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (12:07):  Senator Siewert, I can indicate a response to some elements of your question, but you may need to be a bit more specific about the nature of the training when we get to that point. The people working within the pilot locations will receive specialist training. That training is not being rolled out across the board, as I am sure you will appreciate. However, those who will be responsible—for want of a better expression—in a centralised way for the people who move out of the area will also receive specialised training and will be dealing with the other caseworkers who have been working with the families in the pilot area as well.

We agree with and support the government's argument about that. As we opposed this bill in the first place, we certainly would not be seeking to support measures that would further penalise parents and take away any hope of accessing any income should the worst come to the worst under the these provisions. So we will not be supporting the removal of items 8 and 9. However, we are more persuaded, I will say now, by the other amendments that the opposition have indicated that they may be moving.

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (12:11):  Briefly, I would like to address the other amendments that we have proposed, which are in effect giving the secretary the flexibility to determine noncompliance and to consider extenuating circumstances in that respect. The Greens have indicated—for which I am grateful—that they are amenable to these amendments. I hope that that will be the case because the amendments simply bring this bill into line with the Social Security Act, whereby, for an individual who is deemed to be noncompliant and may indeed suffer a penalty—notwithstanding the fact that I am saying that some of the penalties are not that significant—the secretary should be able to consider their personal circumstances in making a determination. This is a flexible approach. It is entirely consistent with other legislation that has been through this chamber. I think it is an important initiative to ensure that this pilot can work as effectively as it possibly can, notwithstanding our concerns. With that—I am looking once again for that wonderful wording, and I will try to recreate it—the opposition opposes items 5, 6 and 22 in schedule 1 in the following terms:

(2) Schedule 1, item 6, page 4 (lines 1 to 5), TO BE OPPOSED.

That being said, we will of course accept the will of the Senate.

Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (12:13):  Just so that I am absolutely clear about what the Greens are not supporting and about our position: we are of a mind at this stage to support these amendments. We believe they maintain the secretary's discretion to be able to:


… make a determination under this section in relation to the person if the Secretary is satisfied that the person is the principal carer of one or more children, and that:


(a)  the person is a registered and active foster carer; or


(b)  the person is a home educator of that child, or one or more of those children; or


(c)  the person is a distance educator of that child, or one or more of those children; or


(d)  under a family law order that the person is complying with, a child, of whom the person is a relative (other than a parent), is to live with the person.


And then section 502D(3A), as I understand it—the other one—applies too: the secretary may make a determination under this section in relation to the person if the secretary is satisfied that the person is the principal carer for four or more children. I have questions of both Senator Bernardi, as the opposition is moving these amendments, and the government. Why does the government think it is appropriate that the secretary not have the power to make such a determination? These are very important categories, and I would have thought it would have been appropriate to exempt them. I must admit I am supporting this although we are not supporting the bill. If this bill goes through, as it is indicated to be highly likely to, we believe these exemptions should be kept in place. I ask Senator Bernardi whether it is your intention, by moving these amendments, to keep in place those exemptions for those particular categories? Am I correct in that understanding?

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (12:15):  I indicate that one of the concerns of the government in this matter is to keep the terms of the trial as broad as possible. For instance, families having four children is not, in the government's view, a reason for them to be exempted from the trial. We wanted to use this trial as an opportunity to look at what might be a reasonable basis for exemptions or arrangements on an ongoing basis. Leaving this capacity or authority with the secretary was not the government's view of how to proceed on a trial basis but rather that the government review the application of these circumstances and look at future program arrangements to deal with any of the inflexibilities or problems that might need to be managed in the future.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2011-11-21,"



Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (11:12):  I rise to speak on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Family Participation Measures) Bill 2011. This bill establishes two pilots: one that requires teenage parents to complete their education and one that requires eligible parents in jobless families on income support to get themselves job ready. These reinforce the principle of mutual obligation, about which the coalition has always been serious. We do not believe in the welfare entitlement mentality. One of the core Liberal principles is mutual obligation:


… whereby those in receipt of government benefits make some form of contribution to the community in return, where this is appropriate.


Those words are part of the Liberal Party federal platform.


Encouraging people to take charge of their own lives and obtain the skills to be able to support themselves and their families is a good thing for the people involved and for society in general. Welfare dependency clearly has adverse effects. When people receive passive welfare payments with no obligations attached they fall in to a cycle of dependency that can be very difficult to get out of. I am sure that many senators in this place would bear witness to this occurrence in their own electorates. Individuals who are in this cycle of dependence have little opportunity to play their part in Australia's prosperity.


According to government figures, there are approximately 11,000 teenage parents in receipt of parenting payment. Of those 11,000, about 90 per cent have not completed year 12. Completing year 12 is not in itself the ultimate educational goal—there are many other opportunities such as work or apprenticeships—but it is a process of learning. We want to encourage these young parents to continue their education, whether it be in a formal academic setting or perhaps in on-the-job training processes. There are also about 257,000 jobless families who receive income support and who have reported no income in the last year, and these are families with dependent children. In 2007, according to the latest available international comparisons, Australia had the fourth highest rate of children living in jobless families within the OECD. 


One of the most dangerous outcomes of welfare dependency is the effect it can have on the next generation. Some kids grow up never knowing what it is like to have a parent with a steady job. There are children who are missing out on learning about the life skills and pride that come with earning for yourself and being able to support your family. That is why the coalition worked very hard to encourage people to move from welfare into work when we were in government.


In terms of the big economic picture, the coalition's record is one where, while in government, we got the budget back into the black, we got rid of billions of dollars of previous Labor government debt and we laid the framework for a secure economic future for the nation. This led to more jobs, lower taxes, more productive workplaces and better living standards, among many other things. In such a positive environment, more people were—and are—able to find work. The unemployment rate under the coalition fell from 8.2 per cent in 1996 to just 4.3 per cent in August 2007—the lowest unemployment level in 33 years.


More specifically, through programs like Work for the Dole, the coalition encouraged more Australians off welfare and into work. From 1997—when Work for the Dole commenced—to 2007, over 555,480 people took part in 32,826 Work for the Dole activities. This helped them to improve their work ethic. It is something that many of us can bear testament to. At the Work for the Dole programs that we attended during that time, the individuals who were involved in these programs often sought us out, came up and said how meaningful and valuable it had been in helping them get their lives back on track. It gave these individuals valuable work experience and helped to improve their self-esteem and sense of pride in making a contribution to the community.


I say these things to demonstrate to the Senate that the coalition does indeed have a proven track record of supporting mutual obligation. This is in stark contrast to many of the words that are used by the Labor government. Time and time again, we have seen that this government makes tokenistic attempts at meaningful action. We have seen repeated knee-jerk reactions to problems that are often of its own making. In many instances, as the saying goes, this govern­ment is all about spin and not about substance. There is a growing concern amongst others and by me that we see more tokenism again in this bill. I make the point that this bill establishes a pilot program—not a proper program. It begs the question: why doesn't the government commit to a proper program? One could draw the conclusion that it is concerned that it will once again make a mess of the program—like it has done with so many others—and by calling it a pilot it can say, 'We were just experimen­ting with this.'


The coalition has consistently pushed for better mutual obligation requirements. Whilst the government has embraced a small part of that with this bill, it is going only part of the way that it should. It raises a number of questions. The first one relates to the monitoring of the teenage parent pilot program. Whilst the coalition welcome the intent behind this bill—it aims to encourage engagement—we still clearly have some concerns. With the teenage parent pilot, we ask: how will the government monitor whether the parents have been complying with their participation plans and how will the government enforce the obligations of the parents? It is all very well to establish a pilot with good intentions, but we need to be able to monitor it effectively to ensure that it is working properly and for its intended purpose.


The coalition also supports attempts to have parents re-engage with the workforce early. However, the coalition is concerned that with the jobless family trial, as demonstrated in this bill, once again, there is no requirement to comply with the plan signed by the participants. So the coalition will be proposing some amendments to ensure that the parents do comply with their plan. Let me spell this out quite clearly: signing onto a plan is enough for the parents in this jobless family trial, but they do not actually have to comply with the plan that they have put forward. This does not pass the commonsense test. There should be a compliance regime that requires participants in each trial to comply and follow through with what they have promised to do in their plan. In addition, it appears that this bill completely removes the power from the secretary to intervene in extenuating circumstances. The coalition would like the secretary to be able to intervene in extenuating circumstances, and so I flag that we will be moving amendments to reflect that.


In conclusion, we know very well that this is a government that is big on talk and very short on delivery. We know that, unfortunately, this government has breached faith with the Australian people on many occasions, either by failing to keep its promises or, indeed, breaking its promises. While the coalition support the principle behind this bill, we believe it can be improved. We believe that, to encourage parents to improve their lives and those of their families, we need to make some amendments, and we will be doing that to seek to make this bill more effective in achieving its stated aims. 

",Senate,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,2,2
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2011-11-21,"



Senator SIEWERT
 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (11:21):  It will come as no surprise to the chamber or to Australia that the Greens oppose the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Family Participation Measures) Bill 2011. This is a continuation of the punitive approach that started with the Welfare to Work regime of the Howard government era that Senator Bernardi was just championing. Unfortun­ately, there is no evidence to show that the punitive approach works. Again, the government is choosing to suspend payments and take a punitive approach, in this instance, to jobless families. We particularly have concerns about the issues around teenage mothers. Instead of supporting these most vulnerable people in our community, the government is again seeking to take a punitive approach. We believe it is unnecessary and ineffective and that it stigmatises young parents who face a number of significant challenges. While we do agree that teenage parents need a lot of assistance and we are aware they have poor educational achievements, threatening them with a punitive approach, to our mind, does not work. We believe it could have grave ramifications for young parents and their children.


We should be aiming to encourage young people and jobless families to overcome the barriers that prevent their participation in employment and education. The barriers that prevent people from participating in employment and education are very significant. The government's own Social Inclusion Board has produced a number of papers that address this very issue. The government is addressing some of the key areas, but it is giving with one hand and taking with the other: 'Do this or else.' As I said, we do support the aim of encouraging young and long-term unemployed parents into education and work. Unfortunately, it is the compliance mechanisms that we have significant problems with.


We are deeply concerned that these measures will further marginalise young and long-term unemployed parents. As was articulated in the second reading speech, this is part of a process of 10 trials around the country. There are a series of measures, some of which include the further rollout of income management, which is being trialled in five sites. Other measures will be undertaken in other sites. The income management measures will be applied in Logan and Rockhampton in Queensland, Playford, Bankstown, Wyong, Shellharbour, Greater Shepparton, Hume, Burnie in Tasmania and Kwinana in my home state of Western Australia.


Despite all the rhetoric from this government and the previous government about Welfare to Work and the punitive approach, the government has provided little evidence that this punitive approach actually works. Yes, there is concern about barriers to education and work, but the government offers no research explanation as to why this particular approach will work. There are reasons why people miss appointments; they can be many and varied. People must overcome very significant barriers to completing their education and barriers to accessing workplaces, as has been articulated in the government's own documents.


This bill continues the pattern of punitive measures that the government insists on pursuing without any introspection. We see the same with the legislation that the government is going to be introducing to continue to roll out the Northern Territory emergency response. Don't let a little bit of evidence get in the way of rolling out a really good punitive scheme! We have consistently opposed the Welfare to Work measures. We do not believe this is the appropriate approach. As I said, the research indicates that in fact it is not the appropriate approach. We need to look at the barriers to education. Yes, we want to encourage young parents into the workforce and we need to address these barriers and not simply dock their income support when they fail to comply. If you are trying to work with people and encourage them to overcome barriers, simply taking a punitive approach and threatening them does not generate the trust that is needed to work in partnership with them.


Across this and many other budget measures, some of which are still to come and some of which we have already debated in this place, the government plans to make life harder for people on pensions and allowances. We believe measures such as the changes to the eligibility criteria for the disability support pension which we have debated in the place, as well as the failure to index thresholds and the failure to index supplements, all have cumulative effects on families. I have consistently asked in this chamber and also in estimates whether the government has done any work to assess the cumulative impacts of these measures on families and sole parents. To date this has not been adequately addressed. The approach the government is taking is simply continuing and extending measures that the previous government started. We continue to see the erosion of allowances for those on income support. It becomes worth less and less. The inequity between allowances and pensions gets worse. Those on Newstart are living on $132 less than those on the age pension, for example. This measure will make this issue even worse for those most vulnerable in our community, teenage parents.


A lot of these measures to get tough on people on income support—income management, for example—seem to us to have been imported from the US, where they denigrate and demonise people on income support. We now seem to be taking the same approach in Australia. Transplanting these measures from one country to another does not necessarily work, particularly as we have very different issues in Australia. As was pointed out in the second reading speech for this legislation, there are around 11,000 teenage mothers in this country—about 2.5 per cent of those who receive the parenting payment. This is a small percentage. While the Greens think teenage pregnancy is good for neither the parents nor the children—we do not advocate it—we believe that what we need to be doing is working out how we can help mothers in this situation. As has been articulated, most of these parents do not have a year 12 education, and of course we all know about the link between education and better job prospects but also life outcomes for both the parents and the children. But what impact does threatening to take away their income support and carrying it out have on the mother and the child?


We are particularly concerned about the impact of this heavy-handed approach on young women—some of the most vulnerable people in our community—who are dealing with very significant issues in their lives, not to mention the fact that they are mothers at such a young age. As well as that, they will have to deal with a punitive approach by Centrelink, the very organisation that they are now supposed to go to to access case management and to access support to participate in education—and the organisation that will threaten them if they do not turn up. Again, this is not the way to help young parents and teenagers to re-access education and re-engage with the system.


While it is true that once young parents comply they will get back pay, how are they going to afford their day-to-day living expenses? How will they survive? How will they feed their children and pay their utility bills? This policy assumes that parents have support networks, secure tenancy and enough money for basics. Of course they do not have those things. There is a high potential for them to not have support networks—they may be alienated from their parents. They certainly will not be in a position to have a secure tenancy and it is unlikely that they will have enough money for basics. Realistically, on top of all that, education is going to be at the very bottom of the list. As Welfare Rights Network and ACOSS write:


An initiative designed to support young parents should not involve any risk of increasing the levels of poverty or children being left without access to food, essential health care and shelter.


That is exactly what will happen if you take this to the final point of the legislation: children will not be guaranteed access to food, essential health care or shelter. 


What should an initiative look like that actually supports young and long-term unemployed parents? As we have already articulated, this group have the least education and are disenfranchised. They need encouragement, support and incentives to assist them to re-engage with the system and to assist them to access education and meaningful employment that suits their needs and improves their standard of living. We must offer as much support as possible—support in getting an education, learning life skills and helping them find employment that they can mix with their child-rearing responsibilities.


Yes, coordinated case management is essential and individualised, tailored engagement participation plans can make a real difference, but it must be done in a way that cultivates a young person's confidence and skills. If you take the punitive approach, that will create a very different relationship for that young person with the system that is supposedly trying to help them. We know that case management has proven effective in helping to improve social outcomes. We need to invest further in this rather than spending money on enforcing compliance processes. We need to help young families address obstacles and barriers to their participation, such as lack of child care and poor access to public transport. While there is some support offered for child care, we believe it is not enough. We also know that in most of the trial locations where this process is being rolled out public transport is poor. 


We believe the support incentives are not enough. We do not believe that this is the appropriate way to tackle this issue. We do not believe we need this legislation. We believe we need to be addressing these problems by putting more resources into engaging with families and empowering them to take control of their own lives rather than pursuing a punitive approach.


At this stage, should this legislation go through, it is unclear whether there is sufficient protection for young parents and consideration of their special needs. For example, when a teen appeals the suspension of their payment, will they receive an automatic payment pending review? They should. Will Centrelink staff receive specialised training in engaging with young parents? Will Centrelink address the specific issues that so strongly alienate young parents from the system and address the barriers to their participation in the system? Will they be able to understand the requests for special consideration or appeals, even if a young person does not use the correct terminology? In these instances, you are dealing with a group of people who have the least experience in dealing with the social security system. 


We are also concerned about the risk of domestic violence and the impact that this can have. We already know that there is a very poor application rate for exemptions due to domestic violence. I think it is around three per cent. We are concerned that in the broader community there is a lack of engagement with and understanding of how to apply for an exemption due to domestic violence. For this particular group of young people, knowledge of that particular exemption is guaranteed to be even poorer.


What will happen to participants if they move outside the trial sites? Will they continue to be subject to the requirements of the trial where there is no guarantee they will be able to access the various supports that this program purports to put in place? What will happen to those people? One of the trial sites for the income management process is Kwinana in Western Australia. We know that in that area the government could not get enough participants and had to expand it virtually across the whole of metropolitan Perth. Will we see teen mums moving away from the trial sites and further away from any family support that they may have? If the case management proves to be adequate and we see them moving away from that, will they still be subject to this? I am looking forward to these questions being addressed by the minister in the summing up.

Senator THISTLETHWAITE
 (New South Wales) (11:36):  The purpose of the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Family Participation Measures) Bill 2011 is to allow for the conduct of participation pilots for teenage parents. The amendment delivers on a commitment made by the government in the last budget. During the budget, the government announced the introduction of these participation pilots for teenage parents. We did not simply announce this participation pilot; we have also backed it up with encouragement, support and incentives for greater education for teenage parents. The form of that support came in the budget through expenditure of $80 million over four years to provide additional training places for single and teenage parents in receipt of income support. I do not believe it is fair at all to characterise these reforms in isolation as punitive measures.


The bill will implement a commitment made by the government in the last budget. It will implement what is known as 'the teenage parents' trial from 1 January 2012 and what is known as 'the jobless families' trial from 1 July 2012. These trials, which will occur at 10 disadvantaged locations throughout the country, were announced in the budget as part of the Building Australia's Future Workforce package. The trials will provide for new services, opportunities and responsibilities to boost the educational attainment, job readiness, child wellbeing and functioning of families with young children in some of the most disadvantaged locations throughout the country. 


Specifically, the basic elements of the teenage parents' participation pilots are that parents on income support will be required to attend six-monthly interviews with Centrelink once their child turns six months of age. Once the child is 12 months old, the purpose of the interview with Centrelink will be to develop a participation plan aimed at improving the educational outcomes of the parent by focusing on their most basic needs. No. 1 amongst those needs is an adequate education. The plan will focus on school completion, on foundation skills or certificate level qualifications as well as the health, safety and education of the child. Support for the participation plan will continue until the parent achieves year 12 completion or the child turns six years of age.


The bill recognises that there is no greater benefit that we can give our kids in modern day society than an education. A basic year 12 education is a passport to employment and participation within society. We need to ensure that we do all we can to encourage and provide an incentive for teenage parents to ensure that they complete that basic passport to participation and employment in our society. Under the trial, teenage parents will need to work towards obtaining their year 12 qualification or its equivalent whilst continuing to engage in a range of activities focusing on the health and wellbeing of their child. Parents in the jobless families trial will need to develop a plan outlining how they will move towards being job ready once their youngest child starts school and how they will prepare their child to be ready to go to school.


The teenage parents trial is funded at $47.3 million over four years; the jobless families trial is funded at $71.1 million over four years. Currently, only parenting payment recipients with children aged six or seven years of age have participation requirements and can be required to comply with the terms of an employment pathway plan. A failure to meet some of those requirements can—not necessarily will—result in sanctions being imposed under the job seeker compliance framework. But, as I stressed earlier, it is important to note that these reforms are coupled with additional spending in this area to provide the necessary encouragement, support and incentive for those who may be subject to this trial to gain basic qualifications and a pathway to employment.


The amendments in the bill broaden the participation requirements and compliance sanctions for parenting payment recipients with children under six who are part of the 'teenage parent of jobless families' trials operating in those 10 disadvantaged locations throughout Australia. The bill is designed to create new opportunities for the 4,000 single parents who reside in those 10 trial locations. In my state those locations are Bankstown, Wyong and Shellharbour—areas where there are lower socioeconomic indicators and lower levels of educational attainment amongst certain age groups and areas where there are difficulties in some locations related to entrenched poverty and the cycle of poverty.


These reforms are aimed well and truly at trialling in these areas new ways to ensure that members of our community who otherwise may have been susceptible to being driven into that ongoing cycle of poverty—the poverty trap, intergenerational poverty—are provided with a circuit-breaker. That circuit-breaker comes in the form of support from Centrelink and government through those additional funds focusing on teenage mothers and ensuring that they continue to pursue basic educational outcomes.


For teenagers who do become parents, this bill will provide guidance and support to enable them to learn life skills, to get and finish a decent education and to give their child the best start in life. Being a parent is tough for anyone, and no-one disputes that. There are additional burdens and difficulties that come with being a teenage parent and that is why this government is committed to providing the support and guidance that these young parents need to develop their skills and work readiness, helping them to provide a better future for themselves and their children.

Senator JACINTA COLLINS
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for School Education and Workplace Relations) (11:44):  I thank all senators who have made a contribution to the debate on the Social Security Legislation Amendment (Family Participation Measures) Bill 2011. This legislation delivers on the budget commitment for the teenage parents and jobless families measures under the government's Building Australia's Future Workforce package. These measures provide new services, opportunities and respon­sibilities to boost the educational attainment, job readiness, child wellbeing and function­ing of families with young children in some of the most disadvantaged locations in the country. 


We have a growing economy and a strong labour market but not all Australians are benefiting equally from this. Joblessness among families continues to be a significant, social and economic problem in Australia. It is associated with higher rates of poverty, poor health status and low educational attainment for parents and their children. There is a strong intergenerational tendency for joblessness in families. By taking steps to build family functioning and skills, this government aims to break the cycle of welfare reliance and give disadvantaged parents and their children a brighter future.


Through the teenage parents and jobless families measures, the government is providing greater opportunities for parents to build on the own skills and capabilities, providing a pathway to better life outcomes for themselves and their children. The government recognises the important role that parents play in caring for their young children. These measures are being introduced to enhance this role, not to reduce it. There are often many services available in local communities that can provide the support and assistance parents need to plan and move forward in a positive way. These measures encourage parents to make the most of the services they are entitled to in their local communities. By introducing requirements for teenage parents receiving parenting payment in 10 trial locations, the government is sending a clear message that having a child does not mean the end of your education. Teenage parents in the trial will be required to engage in activities to help them attain year 12 or an equivalent qualification. They will also be required to do activities with their child or children that will maximise their health and education outcomes. Children need good early childhood development opportunities to help them become school ready both socially and academically.


Parents in the jobless families trial will be required to attend interviews with Centrelink where they will develop a plan focusing on job preparation and future employment. They too will be asked to do activities in their local communities designed to get good early health and education outcomes for their children. These measures are about building on and enhancing family functioning, skills acquisition, community engagement and making sure that families are well equipped for the future. All Australians on income support should have the opportunity to access the full range of services available to improve the lives of their families, but with this opportunity comes responsibility. This bill strikes the right balance in ensuring that those opportunities are made available to parents who need them while clearly stating that parents need to meet their respon­sibilities to ensure that early health, education and well-being outcomes are achieved for their families.


Question agreed to.

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales) (13:45):  The National Health Reform Amendment (Independent Hospital Pricing Authority) Bill 2011 establishes the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority by amending the National Health Reform Act 2011. This is another one of the bureaucra­cies being established as part of so-called health reform. This one is supposed to exist to promote improved efficiency in and access to hospital services by providing independent advice to Commonwealth, state and territory governments about the efficient cost of services and to develop and imple­ment systems to support activity based funding for those services. It is supposed to formulate the national efficient price for healthcare services that are provided in public hospitals and funded on an activity basis. The authority will aim to deal with the vexed issue of cost-shifting between various jurisdictions and with cross-border disputes, and will seek to make decisions about block funding for hospitals that are too small, remote or otherwise unable to be funded on an activity basis. As I said, this is another bureaucracy in the Rudd-Gillard-Roxon so-called health reforms.


The National Health Reform Amendment (Independent Hospital Pricing Authority) Bill 2011 amends the National Health Reform Act 2011 to establish this pricing authority. The bill provides for functions, powers, accountabilities and liabilities of the pricing authority as well as the establishment of committees and bodies to assist the authority. On 25 August, on the recommendation of the Selection of Bills Committee, this matter was referred to a Senate committee for inquiry and report by 15 September. This pricing authority is supposed to be the linchpin of the government's so-called health reforms and will operate alongside a raft of other bureaucracies, most notably the quality and safety commission and the national performance authority. 


The impact of the pricing authority on the nation's hospitals remains very unclear. An interim pricing authority commenced operations on 1 September. In the additional comments report to the Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee's inquiry into this bill, we noted:


Coalition Senators do not oppose the recommendation of the report that this bill should be passed. 


However, Coalition Senators strongly believe that the Government's so-called health reform package is more about creating the political illusion of health reform than any meaningful improvement or guarantees for patients. 


This is a 'reform' that represents an enormous backdown by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Ageing, who are absolutely desperate to create the impression of health reform. It establishes the third bureaucracy as part of this overall framework. Of course it comes with its own price tag: $100 million over the forward estimates; $31 million this year. There has already been legislation to establish the performance authority, which is supposed to monitor and publish reports on the performance of local hospital networks, public and private hospitals, primary healthcare organisations and other healthcare organisations providing health services. 


The first new bureaucracy we saw was the Australian Commission on Safety and Quality in Health Care. We may yet find ourselves suffering authority fatigue. The new bureaucracies come before the major changes in health, which are not due to be implemented until 2014-15—very conveniently long after the next election is due. Let me take the Senate back to Mr Rudd's commitment to scrap funding of 60 per cent of hospital costs, which was watered down to the Commonwealth providing 50 per cent of growth funding, and of course this will not occur before 2017. 


Let me not forget to put on the record again the bypassing of mental health and aged-care reform in all these changes. The Australian Labor Party only made mental healthcare announcements in the budget because it was shamed into doing so after the coalition released more detail of its commitment to reforming mental health with an additional $432 million and the $1.5 billion already outlined before the 2010 election. Aged care continues to be the subject of discussions and conversations following the myriad reviews. People are dying of old age while reform in the sector is still stalled. Activity based funding is due to take effect from 1 July 2012 but, as we heard at Senate estimates on 19 October, the intention of the bill may not be reflected in reality. Ms Halton told us on 19 October: 


Block funding will have to apply in particularly smaller country hospitals and we need the pricing authority to provide a view about that.


It is of great concern that the Department of Health and Ageing does not have a definition of a small hospital—not surprising since in previous estimates we were told that COAG still cannot make up its mind as to the definition of a 'bed'. Mr Broadhead, the acting First Assistant Secretary of the Health Reform Transition Office, told us:


We do not have a fixed definition of 'small hospital'. From our point of view, the discussions that we have had—and these are not settled—are really about the volatility of activities in hospitals.


As he explained, the process by which it would be decided is for the pricing authority to come up with what it believes are the appropriate criteria for hospitals to be block funded. Then, of course, all this has to go to COAG and COAG will agree or not agree, as it happens. Then, whatever criteria are established, the pricing authority looks at the level of funding that should be provided to these hospitals.


Is this a ringing endorsement of the process and a confidence-inspiring statement that all is on track for a 1 July start date? Hardly. The success of any reform should be on the ground and at the coalface of our hospital system. On that basis, I share with the Senate the recent AMA Public Hospital Report Card 2011, which is the AMA's analysis of Australia's public hospital system. I highlight some of the key points: only 378 new public hospital beds were opened across Australia in 2009-10 and in the previous year only 44 beds were opened. Remember Mr Rudd and the grand plan for over 1,300 hospital beds? That is certainly another broken promise from the Australian Labor Party.


Let us look at median waiting times for elective surgery—they are continuing to deteriorate. In 2009-10 the median waiting time was 35 days compared to 27 days eight years ago in 2001-02. Information about the real waiting time and demand for elective surgery is still hidden. People waiting to see a specialist to be assessed for surgery are not counted in waiting list data and over one-third of emergency patients who should be seen within 30 minutes were not seen within the recommended time. The list of inadequacies goes on. In the end, what will all these new bureaucracies do? Thus far, they are certainly not producing against the important yardstick of reform—that is, more beds in our hospital system.


As part of the coalition's proposals, I foreshadow an amendment which goes to the constitution and membership of the Pricing Authority and, most importantly, the inclusion of a representative from public hospitals. This is so typical of the Australian Labor Party. Its views on private health insurance and its ideological objection to it are well known; its views on private hospitals are no different. 


In the State of our Public Hospitals June 2010report, there are 756 public hospitals in Australia, with about 56,000 available beds. But we also have in Australia 561 private hospitals—that includes day surgery facilities—and these account for 43 per cent of the available beds. While there are 2.5 public hospital beds per thousand of population, there are 1.2 private hospital beds per thousand of population. So it is vitally important that legislation does contain representation from the non-government hospital sector. Not surprisingly, this was an omission by the government. I will return to the reasons for our amendments when we propose them.


It has taken almost four years in government; an 18-month independent inquiry into the health system; a prime ministerial listening tour of the nation's hospitals, complete with Minister Roxon and then Prime Minister Rudd parading in white coats daily at our hospitals for photo opportunities; several fraught COAG meetings; and one unsuccessful attempt for the federal Labor government to finally secure some form of deal with all the states and territories. As we heard during the Senate inquiry, there are considerable concerns about the possible duplication of effort following the creation of all these new authorities. Various submissions commented that there was no legislative requirement for the new authorities to cooperate with existing agencies so as to not simply duplicate existing work. While it may seem obvious that such cooperation is necessary and beneficial, the lack of a legislative direction in this regard is a concern.


Coalition senators believe that consideration should be given to an independent review of these agencies' and authorities' operations after their initial establishment and implementation. There are still plans for a national funding organisation with a national health fund administrator and, no doubt, more administration to distribute federal and state funding to hospital networks. This was going to be yet another independent authority that Minister Roxon and then Prime Minister Rudd said would ensure transparency about where every dollar came from and went to in relation to public hospitals. It was announced last year and then, surprisingly, on 17 June 2010—

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (15:02):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation (Senator Wong) to a question without notice asked by Senator Cormann today relating to the carbon tax.


I rise to take note of the answer given by Senator Wong to the question asked today by Senator Cormann. Today, in response to the question asked by Senator Cormann, the process of misleading the Australian community on the carbon tax continues. We know that this whole process began with the lie perpetrated by the Prime Minister that 'there will be no carbon tax under a government I lead'. Now we know that the modelling contained assumptions that a large number of our competitors around the globe would also have similar forms of process in place to deal with their CO2 emissions by 2016. So that assumption is put into the modelling much like the assumptions that were in the modelling under the CPRS that there would be no impact on employment. We know that that particular outcome turned out to be an input to the modelling, not an output. But in this circumstance, the input is that other countries will have similar methodologies in place to deal with their carbon dioxide emissions by 2016. But we now know, courtesy of the visit to this country last week by President Obama, that this will not be the case. The US will not be taking such action by 2016. President Obama described the move by Prime Minister Gillard and the Labor Party as a 'bold move'. Many of us have recollections of Sir Humphrey talking to Prime Minister Hacker undertaking a 'bold move' and the look on Prime Minister Hacker's face when that description was made to him about taking such a 'bold move'. We know that this carbon tax will take up to $9 billion a year out of this economy. We know that that is many times more than is being taken out of, say, the European Union on an annual basis by their current provisions. 


The government through this debate tried to convince the Australian people that Australia needed to do something to be part of the carbon reduction debate. But we know because of the Productivity Commission review that we are already about midfield without the carbon tax that the government promised not to put into place prior to the last election. We were already part of the process to reduce our carbon emissions; we had already taken action. Some of that action had been supported by the opposition, such as the Renewable Energy Target Scheme. So to imply that we are doing nothing is again part of the act of misleading the Australian community that this government has perpetrated since the election when Prime Minister Gillard, six days before the election, said to the Australian community, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' She repeated that statement the day before the election when votes were vital. That was the promise that Prime Minister Gillard made to the Australian people and yet, as soon as she was in a position of needing to negotiate with the Greens, she flipped. She was prepared to put aside her promise to the Australian people for power. She was not prepared to say to the Australian Greens: 'Let's just hang on a minute. I made a promise to the Australian people; I would like to keep it.' No, she was prepared to walk away from the promise she made to the Australian people and legislate—as we did last week—for this carbon tax which she said, six days before the election, would not happen under a government she led. But also, as we now have had revealed through the admission by President Obama, the United States will not be going down the same track we have—they will not be introducing a carbon tax. The Canadians said they will not be introducing a carbon tax.


What we would like to see is the modelling reworked to demonstrate the reality of the current worldwide situation. We have seen the complete debacle around the modelling as it stands. In the first instance the modelling was conducted on a carbon price of $20 a tonne, and yet the government then announced a price of $23. The complete mess that this government has been through in putting this tax into place, driven by their political masters in the Greens, needs to be condemned. The government should be condemned for taking us to a place where we now know that the rest of the world is not going to go.

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (15:07):  We have been over the issue of modelling in this chamber again and again and again—sigh. We have well and truly flogged the life out of this issue, and yet the coalition really had nothing to show for itself in this question time. We have been through the modelling again and again with Meghan Quinn in our Senate committees, and she has done an absolutely wonderful job of demonstrating the depth of that modelling. It is modelling that shows the economy will grow with a carbon price. It is modelling that shows jobs will grow.




Senator Ian Macdonald:
  Why did Julia promise not to bring it in if it's so good?




Senator PRATT:
  It is modelling that shows—sigh—that Western Australia will continue to grow. In fact, it will grow at a pace that outstrips that of other states.


Senator Cormann also seems to think that we should not do anything if the rest of the world is doing nothing. Well, the rest of the world is not doing nothing. Yes, there are diverse policies based on the assumption, but what we are basing our modelling on is the assumption that countries will meet their pledges. The most efficient thing for us to do is to price carbon. Every credible economic commentator has said that pricing carbon is the right way to go. In fact, there are many in the opposition who have made public statements over and over again to that effect.


This nation has let out a huge sigh of relief that we can now move on this issue, but those opposite fail to recognise this and are again flogging this dead horse. The modelling on this legislation, which has already been passed, has been done and it has been exhaustively debated. The Treasury modelling does not depend on the United States putting a price on carbon by 2010. It is a desperate response from those opposite. They cannot accept that their arguments simply do not stack up. Our assumptions are based on other nations honouring their pledges to manage their emissions as planned. We know that costs will be passed on through our economy. Indeed, it does not really matter how you manage your carbon; there are costs that will be passed on through the economy and that is what our modelling assumes.


This is real-world modelling, not simply a made-up policy from the coalition, who seem to want to deliver higher taxes to us. Those opposite argue that they do want to meet our climate obligations but they have no econo­mically efficient plan to do so. They are also driving uncertainty into the economy, but we need certainty for our investments in renewable energy and for investments in terms of electricity prices. Those opposite seem determined to have a vision for higher taxes for this nation—that is all. It would be economically irresponsible to overturn this policy.


This government has a clean energy plan that is comprehensive. It is a good plan for reducing Australia's carbon pollution and for promoting the clean energy technologies of the future. The coalition has no plan to price carbon and to do so in an economically efficient manner. A failure to price carbon is a big problem for our economy because it introduces uncertainty into our economic investments. If you assume that climate change is real, as I do and as those opposite seem not to, then you know that the sooner we act to price carbon the more econ­omically efficient it is. It will give our economy time to adjust. So I have great confidence in this nation's future when it comes to the issue of pricing carbon.

"Fawcett, Sen David",LP,2011-11-21,"



Senator FAWCETT
 (South Australia) (15:13):  I rise to take note of the answer of Minister Wong. Her answer was dreadful. She said that, just because the legislation has been passed, this Senate should not take note and be aware of the flaws in the logic in the modelling that led to it. When Senator Wong was a student at one of Adelaide's best colleges, Scotch College, I am sure they would have covered in her English classes Arthur Miller's book All My Sons, where Joe Keller was rightly condemned by people because he allowed faulty components to go into wartime service. That killed people and he was rightly condemned, and the whole book is based around his guilt and how he dealt with that. This government should hang its head in shame that it has forced faulty legislation based on faulty modelling based upon faulty logic upon the communities, the industries, the families and the individuals of Australia.


The fundamental questions—is it needed, will it work and what are the unintended consequences?—have not been addressed by this government. Individuals will be worse off. The carbon emissions of Australia will still go up. Electricity prices will increase by a certain amount, depending on who you believe—and I will cover the range of modelling, because there are many models that the government relies on for its facts and figures, although it does not acknowledge that there are a range of opinions out there. But the best case scenario, under its own modelling, is that there will be a 10 per cent increase in the price of electricity. The New South Wales Treasury says 15 per cent, the Electricity Supply Association of Australia says 20 per cent and the Centre for International Economics says 30 per cent by 2020. Take your pick: left or right, smallest or biggest. That is a huge impost on individuals, families and, most importantly, on business and on manufacturing.


There are media releases in South Australia today about OneSteel and the fact that their Whyalla plant may need to close because of the pressures on them. So what does this government do? It releases a policy that is not going to impact our climate beneficially, that will put OneSteel's operations and all those people who rely on it for employment that much more at risk. And there is the defence industry in South Australia. This government have gone on the public record time and time again boasting the fact that they are trying to position Australia's defence industry to be part of the global supply chain. They say that it needs to be competitive to be part of that global supply chain and that if it is not competitive it will not survive because the Australian market is not big enough. So what do the government do? They impose a carbon tax which means the industry will not be competitive. Using the government's own logic, this measure, which will not help the environment but will penalise people in Australia, is going to make our defence industry non-competitive. The defence industry is not just about jobs in Labor marginal seats; the defence industry is part of our national defence capability. 


This government should hang its head in shame that it is not prepared to revisit faulty modelling, faulty logic and faulty proof that has led to legislation that is going to deliver very negative, unintended consequences. The minister should hang her head in shame that she was not prepared to revisit this rather than just saying: 'The horse has bolted. Let's close the door.' Has she learnt nothing from the English studies I am sure she did about Joe Keller?


Even this week the draft IPCC report from Kampala in Uganda suggests very clearly that the evidence base used by this government had many political massages to arrive at the point where it believes that the tax is necessary. Look at things like renewable energy and comments that it can provide something like an 80 per cent reduction. It turns out that that is reliant upon a 40 per cent reduction in energy demand—the most optimistic of over 164 different submissions. Yet which one did they pick? They picked the one that makes their case the strongest. One of the most telling things to come out of this Kampala report from the IPCC is the fact that they are saying the very people whom we are trying to help—those who are poor and marginalised—are impacted by their poverty and by the standards of building and not so much by climate change. So this government stands condemned for continuing with this tax when the modelling is flawed and the reasoning is flawed, and the unintended consequences will damage Australians, families and businesses.

Senator POLLEY
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:18):  It is amazing how those on the other side will not let go of the issue of carbon pricing. We saw it again today in question time. Yet again, Senator Cormann asked the same questions of the minister which he has asked time and time again. He asked the same questions along the same lines through the estimates process, asserting that the modelling that we have adopted is reliant upon the US having a price on carbon by 2016. He knows that that is not correct. He knows what the facts are. But he thinks that if he comes into this chamber and is repetitive with this line of questioning somehow he will pull the wool over the eyes of the Australian public. But they are not that silly.


Let us put on the record what President Obama has made very clear about climate change. He says it is real and the US is committed to playing its part in cutting emissions. President Obama has acknow­ledged that climate change is a long-term issue and the US will be looking for further ways to reduce emissions in the coming years. The Gillard Labor government's carbon price will drive real, long-term change and will allow the market to find the best ways to reduce carbon pollution at the least cost. In contrast, Mr Abbott's direct action plan is a short-term, fig-leaf policy that will be incapable of meeting Australia's five per cent target by 2020 let alone more ambitious targets into the future. 


Let us talk about some of the places that have already acted on climate change. Let us talk about the 32 carbon trading schemes around the world. Let us list some of them. I know some of those on the other side do not like to hear the facts so that the record can be corrected. Let us talk about what is happening in the European Union. Let us talk about what has been happening in Norway since 2008. Let us talk about Switzerland and the action that they took in 2008. Let us talk about New Zealand. If I recall correctly, we had the New Zealand Prime Minister in the other place not so long ago. I think you will find that the New Zealand government is a conservative government.



Senator McEwen interjecting—




Senator POLLEY:
  Yes, I think you are right, Madam Whip. They are a conservative government and they have acknowledged climate change, unlike those on the other side who are still trying to deny that there has been any change at all in the climate. Some of those on the other side do not accept that there has been a change in the climate and the effects that that is having on the economy.


Let us also talk about the USA and the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative. Let us talk about the seven eastern states that have adopted it and taken action. Let us talk about California and the Western Climate Initiative. Seven western states and four Canadian provinces have taken action. In China, five provinces are undertaking a trial towards a national program. And there is South Korea, Japan, Taiwan and India. Shall I go on? I do not think I need to. I think the point has been made.


This government has taken the action that is needed. The Australian community appreciate the action that has been taken and they know that they are going to be compensated. Yes, there will be some costs involved. But this program is also about ensuring that the 500-odd biggest polluters are going to have to pay. But what those opposite are about is continuing, as I said, their scare campaign. The business community wants certainty. It wants to know that it is going to be able to operate in the best interests of not only their shareholders but also the Australian community. It wants some certainty for the future. Those opposite have been caught very short. It does not matter whether you are talking about a carbon price, the mining resource tax or even offshore processing of asylum seekers. We know from the record that Mr Abbott and those people opposite will dismiss any expert who does not fit in with their mantra. We know that the Australian community wants more detail about their policies, not just the $70 billion black hole that they made— (Time expired)

"Nash, Sen Fiona",Nats,2011-11-21,"



Senator NASH
 (New South Wales—Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (15:23):  Colleagues, if ever we needed further evidence that this government is indeed completely hopeless, today we have the living proof. Yet again, we have the government today trying to defend its carbon tax—very thinly, by those on the other side. It is extraordinary stuff. What we are talking about here now in taking note of answers is the fact that the United States President has said that the United States will not have a carbon tax or equivalent by 2016. Are you on the other side not listening? The United States is not going to have one.


Let us have a look at what we have here. As a nation, we produce 1.4 per cent of the world's emissions. That is not 14, not 24, not 64—it is 1.4 per cent only of the world's emissions. Guess how many countries other than Australia are moving to impose a carbon tax, as this government is moving to do, by the middle of next year? Some, several, dozens?




Senator Abetz:
  None.




Senator NASH:
  None. Not one other country in the entire world is moving to do what this Labor government is about to do with a carbon tax. To me, it seems curious that we are the only country that is going to do this. We now have confirmation from the President of the United States that they definitely are not going to do it. Let us have a look at what that actually means. The modelling is based on the fact that the US will join with Canada, Japan, India, Korea and China in an international carbon trading system by 2016. Gosh, colleagues, that is not going to happen. The entire modelling system that the government is using to base this on is flawed. Does it not just show, yet again, how hopeless this government is? It simply cannot apply any detail, any logic, any rational thought processes to policy development. It just comes up with these ideas on the run: 'This sounds like a pretty good idea.' Remember BER, pink batts, cash for clunkers, GroceryWatch, Fuelwatch? It is no surprise that the government simply cannot get this right. It gets worse and worse, day by day, for this government.


As we have seen now, with the confirmation by the President of the United States, they are not going to do it either. So there is just us. We are out there leading the world, according to the Prime Minister. Why? Why are we doing this when not one other country is moving to do what we are about to do with a carbon tax? That is just wrong. 


This carbon tax is going to create a huge financial impost for families, businesses and—my particular area of interest—farmers. It is going to create a huge financial burden for those families, farmers and businesses across this country. What is going to happen? Nothing. There is not going to be a reduction in emissions. In actuality, it gets worse. Emissions are going to increase from 578 million tonnes now to 621 million tonnes in 2020. It is just stupid. The government is clearly clueless. For whatever reason, it cannot get off this carbon tax train wreck it has put us on, and it is simply wrong. We have heard the United States say they are not going to do anything. So much of what this government has done over previous years with its talk about reducing emissions has hung off the United States doing something—and they are not going to do it.


This government's modelling is completely flawed. We know it has not even modelled properly the increase in electricity costs from a carbon tax. Despite Minister Ludwig's pathetic answer in question time today, we are still none the wiser about the real impact that is going to have. This government will have to answer to the Australian people. The Prime Minister lied to the Australian people before the last election when she said there would be no carbon tax. She is now giving the Australian people a carbon tax, one that no other country in the world is going to implement in the way that this Labor government is foisting its carbon tax on this country.

Senator BOB BROWN:
  i seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard.


Leave granted.




The speech read as follows—



In introducing this bill, the Protecting Children from Junk Food Advertising (Broadcasting and Telecommunications Amendment) Bill 2011, I note that this will be the third time that I have introduced a private senators' bill on this matter of critical importance to the Australian community.


In March this year the Senate debated Protecting Children from Junk Food Advertising (Broadcasting Amendment) Bill 2010, which was opposed by both the government and the Coalition. I had previously introduced the bill in 2008, which was also voted down by the Labor and Coalition senators, when the debate occurred in June 2009. I said at the time of those surprising and disappointing votes, I would continue to advocate legislative action in this area.


The bill I am introducing today reflects the broad recommendations of the paper on regulatory approaches to protect children from junk food advertising, released in May by the Obesity Policy Coalition. This highly credentialed group includes the Cancer Council Victoria, Diabetes Australia – Victoria, VicHealth and the World Health Organization Collaborating Centre on Obesity Prevention at Deakin University. Their work is backed by the Australian Chronic Disease Prevention Alliance (including Cancer Council Australia, Diabetes Australia and the National Heart Foundation), the Australian Medical Association, and the Coalition on Food Advertising to Children.


As the Obesity Policy Coalition state in making their recommendations for a regulatory approach to protecting children from junk food advertising, ""The aim of the legislation should be to minimise children's exposure to unhealthy food product and brand advertising to the greatest extent possible, as well as restrict unhealthy food product and brand advertising that specifically targets children.""


This bill extends the restrictions placed on junk food advertisers beyond children's free-to-air television to include subscription television, the internet and mobile phone advertising to reflect the rapid change in telecommunications tech­nologies and usage by children in recent years. For example, a study conducted by the Australian Communications and Media Authority in 2007 found that 33% of children aged 8–11 years watched subscription television. The bill also prohibits the promotion of unhealthy food to children via web pages and websites that are likely to appeal to children and via commercial electronic messages, for example email or SMS.


The bill also adopts the recommendations of the Obesity Policy Coalition on restricted viewing times. Weekdays from 6–9am and 4–9 pm, and weekends and public holidays from 6am–12pm and 4–9pm are identified as the key times when a significant number of children or a proportion of children are watching television. These restricted times incorporate G classification periods when material suitable for children is broadcast.


The need to address the growing crisis of childhood obesity has been well established. I will simply set out a few of the most compelling statistics to highlight the case.


Childhood obesity in the 5 – 15 years age group has almost doubled for boys and girls in the last 20 years. Comparing prevalence of obesity for boys and girls in 1985 and 2007, the increase is 11 percent to nearly 24 percent, and 12.2 percent to 21.5 percent respectively. The health impacts and costs of this rising tide of obesity include shorter life expectancy, increased risks of heart disease, diabetes, orthopaedic complica­tions, asthma and high blood pressure. Obese children are 25 – 50 percent more likely to become obese adults, thereby increasing their risk of cancer as well as other psycho-social problems. In addition to the burden of ill health for individuals, the economic and social costs of childhood obesity into the future will be sub­stantial and borne by all Australians. In a report commissioned by Diabetes Australia in 2008, Access Economics estimated that the costs of obesity were $58.2 billion when the indirect cost of loss of productivity and well-being are in­cluded. Access Economics estimated the costs of obesity to the health system to be $2 billion in 2008. This is a pressure on our health services which is preventable and there is no excuse for not taking the steps necessary to avoid this health crisis.


Restricting the advertising of unhealthy food to children is a preventative step that has long been supported by public health advocates and health professionals. One of the key recommendations of the National Preventative Health Taskforce to tackle obesity was to ""reduce the exposure of children and others to marketing, advertising, promotion and sponsorship of energy-dense nutrient-poor foods and beverages.""


There is overwhelming public support for this measure. The findings of the recent study released by the Obesity Policy Coalition were consistent with previous research. This study, Obesity Prevention Policy Proposals: Public Acceptability 2008 to 2010 surveyed a random sample of 1521 adults who were the main grocery buyer, residing in private households in metropolitan and regional areas across all Australian states and territories in 2010 by the Centre for Behavioural Research in Cancer at Cancer Council Victoria.


As I have said previously, and will say again, the World Health Organization has recognised that food marketing to children, particularly television advertising, is an important area for action to prevent obesity and has called upon governments to implement policies and strategies that reduce the impact of foods high in fat, sugar and salt and promote the responsible marketing of foods and beverages.


Critics of this approach have argued that the advertising of unhealthy food to children is a cultural and community issue; that it is a matter of parental accountability and responsibility. Governments of both persuasions have shirked their responsibility by accepting the advertising and food industries' promise of self-regulation and voluntary codes of practice. Let me quote here from the Obesity Policy Coalition summa­tion of this approach: ""These codes are effective in creating the appearance of responsible conduct and in achieving advertisers' aim in warding off intervention. However these codes fail to impose meaningful limits on the content of food advertising to children, or the level of children's exposure to this advertising."" According to the Obesity Policy Coalition, even the Australian Food and Grocery Council's (AFGC) own report in January 2011 found that one in five food advertisements in children's programs were for high fat, sugar and salt products. Simply, voluntary self-regulation by industry is not working. It is time for a legislative intervention.


No single intervention will combat the problem of childhood obesity. This issue requires a comprehensive approach, and government action is one essential component. In this regard, Norway, Quebec, and the United Kingdom have all banned exposing children to unhealthy food advertising to some degree. Adopting this legislation to restrict junk food advertising to children will provide an effective measure in the tool kit of the National Preventative Health Agency in its role of tackling the biggest public health issues facing our nation today.


There is bipartisan support in this parliament for tackling childhood obesity. This bill provides the opportunity to capitalise on this co-operative intention and demonstrate to Australian parents and children that we are committed to ending childhood obesity. Restricting the advertising of unhealthy food to children is one crucial step in the right direction.


I commend the bill to the Senate.

Senator HANSON-YOUNG
 (South Australia) (15:43):  At the request of Senator Siewert, I move:


That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:


The recognition that an increasing majority of the Australian community supports marriage equality and believes it is time for the federal parliament to amend the Marriage Act to provide for this.


This motion advocates true equality under Australian law for same-sex couples, a move that is well beyond its time, a move that we need to make in this country if we are to uphold basic standards of human rights, justice and fairness. Really, it should not be a big deal. We know that same-sex couples right around the world, in places such as Catholic Spain, Canada and now New York state, are able to celebrate their love for each other through having their marriage recognised under the laws of their state or country. It is an important step for Australia to take and it is something that has majority support amongst our Australian community. An increasing majority of Australians support marriage equality, support the idea of giving same-sex couples the same rights as every other couple in Australia, believe that consenting adults who desire to have their love recognised and respected under federal law should indeed have it so. It is not just a matter for these individual couples—their families, their friends and their work colleagues are passionate about this. They want to have the love of their mates recognised under law just as everyone else's love of their partners is recognised. Recent polls suggest that over 60 per cent of Australians support the idea of same-sex marriage and marriage equality, and over 70 per cent of Australians believe that this move is indeed inevitable. That is even amongst those who suggest that if it was their choice this type of change would not be happening. Progress is a wonderful thing, and progres­sive reform is important for any country but particularly for Australia. We have a wonderful history and a rich heritage to draw on, from giving women the right to vote to accepting, understanding and acknowledging Indigenous people as citizens in their own land and ensuring that Indigenous Australians can marry non-Indigenous Australians. These are progressive reforms that stand us in good stead not just in the current day and age but also for the future. 


This is change that needs to happen sooner rather than later. We see that 71 per cent of Labor voters support marriage equality, over 50 per cent of coalition voters support marriage equality and over 86 per cent of Greens voters support marriage equality. This is beyond doubt an important reform but we should not get caught up in debating it. It is simply part of becoming a fairer and more just Australia. We know that there is a debate both within this place and outside about how important this issue is and that it ruffles people's feathers, but let us have a think about what this means to same-sex couples and those who love them most of all—their friends and family. I always reflect on the desire of parents to have their adult children recognised as citizens with the same rights as everybody else's children. Parents who have a gay son and a heterosexual son will want both of their children to be recognised equally under Australian law. There is the famous quote from Shelley Argent, who asks why should one of her sons be treated as a second-class citizen. We in this place should not tolerate a situation where people are considered second-class citizens. In this day and age people should not continue to be discriminated against simply because of their sexuality. It would be wonderful for Australia to grab hold of this and prove itself to be a progressive country in the eyes of the rest of the world. In places like Spain, South Africa, Belgium and New York state, the sky has not fallen in. In fact, the sun is shining brighter. People in those places are proud of how open, accessible, compassionate and fair their laws are because they recognise same-sex couples as equals.


Another point I want to raise is the impact that not moving on this progressive reform would have particularly on young people. This issue is undoubtedly one of the biggest factors in young gay and lesbian Australians right around this country questioning their self-worth, whether they be in the urban cities of Sydney and Melbourne, the suburbs of Adelaide or Brisbane or indeed our regional areas of Tasmania or Victoria. They are young people who are struggling to work out who they are and come to grips with their sexuality. The Australian Bureau of Statistics National survey of mental health and wellbeing released in 2007 indicates that homosexual and bisexual people are four times more likely to be homeless, twice as likely to have no contact with family or friends or have no family to rely on if there are serious problems, twice as likely to have a high or very high level of psychological distress, three times more likely to have suicidal thoughts, five times more likely to have suicidal plans and four times more likely to have attempted suicide. These are the stark statistics that relate directly to the representation of equality under our federal law. We cannot fudge these figures. Young gay, lesbian and bisexual couples right around the country need to understand and feel that they are equal. They are not second-class citizens in this country—they are equal and they should be supported. This move to ensure that we have marriage equality under federal law will go some way towards helping those young people feel supported, not just by their friends and family but also by the governments that are there to look after them. 


With these statistics, with the public support for same-sex marriage and marriage equality right throughout the country, across electorates and across the electoral divides of the different political parties and across the different opinions and political persuasions, this issue is a real issue that concerns many Australians, either personally or because mums and dads want their kids to be considered as equal, grandparents want to see their grandchildren considered equally, and friends and colleagues, workmates, want to make sure that their friends and workmates are considered as equals. If two people are in love and they want to marry each other, let us bless that—let us not condemn it simply because of an outdated, archaic and backwards view of the world. We are better than that. We are a compassionate, fair and just country. We have taken progressive reform with both hands across different political issues and we have made a real difference to the lives of individuals. This is the next step by which this can be done. But it has to be done in this place. The Australian community is far ahead of our political leaders and particularly the Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister on this issue—streets ahead. I know there are people in this place on both sides, in the Labor Party and in the Liberal Party and the coalition—of course, the Greens have a policy for marriage equality—who want to see this change happen. There are individuals who know that this is the right thing to do. It is time for this place to step up to the challenge and ensure that progressive reform occurs, ensure that same-sex couples, their loved ones, their family, can all rest assured that under law, regardless of their sexuality, they will be seen as equal.


Let us not allow this to get caught up in the yuckiness of politics. This is about the love of two people. This is about two people who as consenting adults want to marry each other because they are deeply in love. They want that to be seen under the eyes of the law as legitimate. And so they should. If marriage is such an important institution, let us open it up. If Cupid does not discriminate, why should we? (Time expired)

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2011-11-21,"



Senator CAROL BROWN
 (Tasmania—Deputy Government Whip in the Senate) (15:53):  I am pleased to have the opportunity to contribute to this debate and to again put on record my support for marriage equality. A lot of what Senator Hanson-Young said in her contribution today I support. But for the Labor Party it is our national conference, not this debate today, which will determine our position on this issue. I hope the national conference of the Labor Party will bring an end to discrimination against same-sex couples, something many of us in this place have been supporting for many years. 


It is indeed heartening to see popular public opinion continuing to build in support of marriage equality. We are consistently receiving poll results and survey data from around Australia that indicate that the majority of Australians support a change to the Marriage Act to allow same-sex couples to marry. The national data from a Nielsen poll released on 15 November shows that 62 per cent of Australians believe that same-sex couples should be able to marry. This represents a five per cent increase in the figure from the 2010 Nielsen poll. The data also shows that 75 per cent of Australians believe that reform to the Marriage Act to allow same-sex couples to marry is inevitable. It is obvious that our support for marriage equality is growing and that Australians are ready to bring about change.


In my home state of Tasmania, a poll conducted in February this year by Enterprise Marketing and Research Services, EMRS, showed that 59 per cent of Tasmanians surveyed believe same-sex couples should be allowed to legally marry. The data I have personally collected also confirms that a majority of Tasmanians support marriage equality. In September I officially reported back to the Senate the views of the Tasmanian and Denison constituents who contacted me on the issue of marriage equality. As I reported then, I had 1,093 interactions on the issue of marriage equality, with 509 constituents from around Tasmania completing the online survey and a further 584 constituents contacting me to register their views on this issue. The data I collated indicates that 55.9 per cent of Tasmanians support marriage equality and an overwhelming 78.6 per cent of constituents in the electorate of Denison, where I live and where my office is located, support marriage equality and an amendment to the Marriage Act. It is significant that the constituent interactions on the issue of marriage equality in Denison show that 78.6 per cent of Denison constituents support marriage equality. Further, out of the 184 respondents to the survey, 83.1 per cent said they supported amending the Marriage Act so that same-sex couples can be married.


Whilst we continue to have this debate in the community and in the parliament, I am looking forward to the debate at the upcoming ALP national conference. As someone who has supported a change to the national platform on marriage equality, it is great to see the momentum growing in the lead-up to the Labor Party's national conference. It is also a huge boost, I believe, to the campaign to change the platform that the same Nielsen poll data I referred to earlier shows that an overwhelming majority of Labor voters support marriage equality. The poll indicated that 71 per cent of Labor voters supported the reform. 


Recently there has been some debate around a conscience vote on the issue of marriage equality rather than a change to the ALP platform. Whilst I accept that there is division within the Labor Party on the issue of marriage equality, I do not believe that the issue constitutes a matter of conscience. In the past, conscience votes have been granted on issues such as abortions, stem cell research and euthanasia. These have been matters which have been questions of life or death. Marriage equality is a question of political and civil rights and legislative reform that will give two people who love one another the freedom to celebrate and define their commitment in whatever way they choose. 


Labor has a proud history of championing change to remove discrimination against same-sex couples. We have amended over 85 pieces of Commonwealth legislation and executed reforms across Australia that have ensured that same-sex de facto couples have the right to receive fair access to assisted reproductive technology such as IVF and to adopt children. These historic reforms for greater recognition of equality of same-sex couples have all been achieved without a conscience vote. The issue of marriage equality is no different. If we acted to remove discrimination that riddled our legislation, we did so to ensure equality. The Marriage Act is no different. We need to amend the act to ensure that there is full equality. If we consider the context of the past debates on the institution of marriage, there was a time when inter-racial couples were not allowed to marry and when a wife was indeed seen as the property of her husband. Just as the institution of marriage has evolved over time, it is vital we legislate to represent the values of Australia today. The ALP National Conference will be the time for the Labor Party to take this final step towards full equality and recognition for Australians, and to allow two people who love each other to make that commitment public and official.


People of faith have nothing to fear from allowing same-sex marriage. Under any amendment to the Marriage Act all religious celebrants will remain free not to carry out same-sex marriages. Moreover, we have leading Christians, including Baptist and Uniting Church ministers, arguing in support of marriage equality. In my home state of Tasmania the public narrative of those opposed to marriage equality has been dominated by advocates in the Australian Christian Lobby. However, we also have some Christians, like Reverend David Hunnerup from the Uniting Church in Launceston, who have stepped forward as vocal supporters of same-sex marriage. Reverend Hunnerup has said that not amending the Marriage Act is dangerous and cancerous to social cohesion. (Time expired)

"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2011-11-21,"



Senator HUMPHRIES
 (Australian Capital Territory) (16:00): I am pleased to enter into this debate on this urgency motion on marriage equality. I preface my remarks by observing some of the dynamics behind the decision of the Australian Greens to bring forward this urgency motion today. Whatever the high-minded principles that might underpin the sentiments in this urgency motion, I think it is appropriate for the Senate to acknowledge that this motion also has some tactical advantage for the Australian Greens. The Greens will not be unaware of the fact that, at the present time, the Australian Labor Party has moved its policy into a state of some flux, as Senator Carol Brown's speech just indicated. As we know, Senator Bob Brown does not like to be outflanked in such matters and, I think, wants to put his stamp on this issue as one which, he feels, is very much his territory. That is fair enough. He is entitled to take some ownership of this issue if he wants it, but I think it is important for the Australian parliament, including the Senate, to resolve conflict and debate about these issues soberly and in light of all the arguments, not on the basis of what is in the short-term interests of either the Australian Greens or the Australian Labor Party.


I also note with interest the reliance in this urgency motion, in this move towards what the proponent of the motion calls 'marriage equality', on the argument that there is an increasing majority of the Australian community which supports this concept. It is something of a testament to the opportunism which so often characterises what the Greens do that they are very happy to rely on opinion polls when those polls tend to support what they want to do, and are equally happy to ignore opinion polls when those polls repudiate the Greens' position.




Senator Farrell:
  That's the same as the Liberal Party!




Senator HUMPHRIES:
  We tend not to rely on day-to-day polls. We always say that these are things we have to be very careful about. To see the Greens before the Senate promoting what they call marriage equality in this motion on the basis that it has a majority of support in the Australian community is ironic given that only a few days ago the Australian Greens voted to support a carbon tax which, according to the latest Newspoll, has the support of only 32 per cent of the Australian community—less than one in three.


However, this issue deserves to be addressed on a substantive basis, not just on the basis of the dynamics behind it. It is well known that in 2004 the coalition legislated to provide that marriage should be a union between a man and a woman, and a man and a woman only. That accorded with the traditional understanding of the institution and was consistent with the position that the coalition took to subsequent federal elections. The ALP also took this position to the last two elections, but this may not be consistent with the position that the Labor Party proceeds with in future.


There are a number of perspectives possible on same-sex marriage. As both a large-L Liberal and a small-l liberal, I believe that governments and parliaments should minimise their intervention in the personal behaviour of citizens. If Australians make choices about how they live, how they arrange their affairs, what relationships they enter into and who they love, provided that no harm is done to anybody by such choices then, as a general rule, governments and parliaments should stay clear of such personal arrangements. If governments and parliaments do get involved they should be involved to the extent of removing any forms of petty discrimination against people on the basis of how they have chosen to live their lives.


Indeed, I note that that has very much been the underlying principle which has educated the decision of the coalition in the last decade, both in government and in opposition, to remove any petty discrimina­tion which derogates on a person's right to make decisions about the course of their own life and the lives of others with whom they choose to form relationships. In 1999, for example, the coalition took steps to remove discrimination in superannuation legislation to provide that trustees of superannuation funds could, at their discretion, pay a member's accumulated benefits to the member's dependants or legal personal representatives if the member died. That would include anybody with whom the deceased person had been in an inter­dependent relationship. We also made amendments to permit funds to change their governing rules to provide for binding death benefit nominations. If a person is a member of a fund which provides for binding nominations that person can nominate a same-sex partner who is a dependant.


At about the same time we also agreed to extend certain conditions of service entitlements to members of the Australian Defence Force in interdependent relation­ships, which includes members in same-sex relationships. From early in the life of the Howard government steps were taken to provide that an employer could not terminate a person's employment on the ground of their sexual preference. There were a number of steps taken by the coalition in government and supported in opposition to achieve the same effect. So it needs to be put on the record very clearly that the coalition does not favour discrimination against people on the basis of their sexuality or the basis of the relationships that they form.


The question of whether or not the symbolism and the title of marriage ought to pertain to people in certain relationships is a different question from the question of the substance of the law as it affects people in such relationships. There is an argument, which I personally subscribe to, that the title and institution of marriage were essentially under the custodianship of the church or churches for many centuries. If the state no longer needs that institution or that title to convey or deliver certain rights to people, as was once the case, then the state should leave that institution in the hands of the church, possibly with other appropriate recognition of the rights of people in same-sex relationships so that they do not experience discrimination.


The federal parliament has a role to play in this debate because placitum (xxi) of section 51 of the Constitution entrusts the stewardship of this institution to the federal parliament, but it is not an excuse for us to make decisions without due regard to issues such as the history of this institution and the expectations of the Australian people. On that question, this urgency motion leaves a multitude of sins not properly addressed. (Time expired)

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2011-11-21,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (16:08):  I rise today to very strongly support the urgency motion that is before the chamber:


The recognition that an increasing majority of the Australian community supports marriage equality and believes it is time for the federal parliament to amend the Marriage Act to provide for this.


There is no justification for discrimination in Australia. That is the fact of the matter. If we are to be a modern democracy, if we are to live up to the ideals of our Constitution, there is no room for discrimination. As Justice Kirby once said, 'Equal justice under the law for all.' That is what the Australian Greens stand for: equal justice under the law for all.


I heard Senator Humphries talk a moment ago about cynical politics. It took at least five minutes of his speech to actually get to saying what his view was. It is a pathetic statement to suggest that the Greens moving on this is some sort of cynical politics. It has been our policy for a very long time. In fact for decades the Australian Greens have had a view that discrimination should be removed and that civil society ought to pride itself on equal participation and equal rights on all bases. We have argued it in terms of the rights of women. We have argued it in terms of racial equality and religious equality. We are now arguing it strongly in terms of equality under the law for people to marry. I am shocked to hear Senator Humphries say that, as far as he is concerned, the institution of marriage should be handed back to the church. I am assuming that he meant the only people who could be rightfully married as such are those who marry in a church. That would be the logical extension of that view. I find that an extraordinary thing.


I find it extraordinary because there is some suggestion that it is about symbolism and title and it is a bit obscure; so long as you have equal access to things like superannuation, equality under the law and various other matters, it does not matter whether or not people can marry. Nothing could be further from the truth. I think one of the best exposes of this occurred in South Africa, where a legal action was taken in 2002 by a couple to have their union recognised as a valid marriage. It went through the courts and on 1 December 2005 the Constitutional Court handed down its decision. The nine justices in South Africa agreed unanimously that:


… the common-law definition of marriage and the marriage formula in the Marriage Act, to the extent that they excluded same-sex partners from marriage, were unfairly discriminatory, unjustifiable, and therefore unconstitutional and invalid. 


In a widely quoted passage from the judgment, Justice Albie Sachs wrote:


The exclusion of same-sex couples from the benefits and responsibilities of marriage, accord­ingly, is not a small and tangential inconvenience resulting from a few surviving relics of societal prejudice destined to evaporate like the morning dew. It represents a harsh if oblique statement by the law that same-sex couples are outsiders, and that their need for affirmation and protection of their intimate relations as human beings is somehow less than that of heterosexual couples. It reinforces the wounding notion that they are to be treated as biological oddities, as failed or lapsed human beings who do not fit into normal society, and, as such, do not qualify for the full moral concern and respect that our Constitution seeks to secure for everyone. It signifies that their capacity for love, commitment and accepting respon­sibility is by definition less worthy of regard than that of heterosexual couples.


That is the state of play in Australia for every single person who stands up and says they do not support removing discrimination against same-sex couples. That is exactly what they are saying to those people in Australian civil society and it is completely unacceptable.


In terms of the emotional scars of people who are discriminated against, it is interesting when you look back to see the justifications that went on for years about the reasons why people thought it was appropriate to discriminate against people on the basis of race and the reasons that people had to discriminate against people on the basis of their gender. When my mother started teaching it was a part of the accepted practice that once a woman married they could not teach in schools. It was not until the 1970s that you had equal pay for female teachers. We would not have had Prime Minister Gillard standing up saying that it should be a conscience vote as to whether you might remove discrimination against women under the law in Australia. We would have had an argument that it was totally inappropriate to discriminate against women in spite of, as Senator Humphries just said, the traditional understanding. The traditional understanding in Australia was that women were their husband's possessions and they could not work after they were married and they did not deserve to have equal pay. We got rid of that traditional understanding because it was plain wrong.


There is the traditional understanding that is not being spoken here that somehow same-sex couples are not equal and do not deserve to be recognised as equal. As the judgment in South Africa from Justice Albie Sachs said, if you object to the notion of marriage equality for some reason, what you are saying is that a gay couple do not have the same capacity for love, commitment and accepting responsibility and that their relationship is less worthy of regard than those of heterosexual couples. What an insult and an affront to people in our civil society. Australia is a big-hearted country. The community has recognised that these so-called traditional understandings are discriminatory and hurtful and that we would be a better society if we actually celebrated the fact that people who love one another want be able to be recognised in a marriage relationship in exactly the same way as everybody else. And why shouldn't they? Why shouldn't parents be able to have that same expectation for their children regardless of their sexuality?


I think it is a complete cop-out to be suggesting some idea of a conscience vote on an issue of removing discrimination. Removing discrimination ought to be the aspiration of everyone in this parliament and it should be something we aspire to at every level and for every reason that people discriminate. We should remove it, and we try to do so. This is not a matter of conscience; it is a matter of civil rights. In Australia we want, as Justice Kirby mentioned, equal justice under the law for all. I would ask senators to ask themselves whether they think it would be appropriate to look one of their own children or siblings in the eye and say to them, 'You do not deserve the same civil rights as other people because of your sexuality. As much as I love you as my child or brother or sister, you deserve to be discriminated against because somehow you are not up to it in the way the rest of the community is.' I put that to my colleagues. I put to them as well to ask themselves whether that is a matter of conscience or a matter of civil rights. It is a matter of equality, justice, fairness and love. That is what this is about. It is longstanding Greens policy. It is something that the Australian community wants and, frankly, some of the arguments that are being put forward against it are an anachronism.


In terms of religious argument, religions are able to maintain whatever laws they wish to govern themselves and people do not discriminate on that basis. But we are talking about equal rights under the law of the civil society in Australia, which is a fair society in which we do not tolerate discrimination of any kind.

"Furner, Sen Mark",ALP,2011-11-21,"



Senator FURNER
 (Queensland) (16:18):  I rise this afternoon to contribute to the debate on this urgency motion of the Greens. I do so to support the position of our Prime Minister, Prime Minister Gillard, in opposing any changes to the Marriage Act and also to reiterate her position as indicated recently in the Age of 15 November. She said:


My position flows from my strong conviction that the institution of marriage has come to have a particular meaning and standing in our culture and nation and that should continue unchanged.


We will continue with that position and we will not amend the Marriage Act. We moved decisively in 2007 when we came to office to amend many of the discriminatory positions that related to same-sex couples. We moved to eliminate discrimination on these grounds in superannuation, social security, taxation, Medicare, veterans affairs, workers compensation and educational assistance—reforms that were significant in those times to eliminate discrimination.


One thing that has been indicated today is that this is a diverse discussion and debate. Certainly in the Labor Party we will have a diverse debate at our soon-to-be national conference where as a democratic party we have the right to have that debate with speakers for and against this particular issue. I think that right needs to be extended to people in the other various parties that are in this chamber as well. Even Senator Joyce has indicated that the coalition should not oppose a conscience vote, should it come to that.


The other part of the motion, however, I really need to challenge—and that is this notion of this being the majority view of Australians. You only need to look at the emails you receive from people who are pro and anti gay marriage to see that is not the case. I have a particular email that I received recently not from a constituent of mine but from a constituent from Western Australia actually. She indicated that:


Australian human rights lawyer Frank Brennan AO, former Chairman of the National Human Rights Consultative Committee, is an expert on discrimination. He says: “In considering whether to advocate a change to the definition of marriage, citizens need to consider not only the right of same sex couples to equality but even more so the rights of future children. I think we can ensure non-discrimination against same sex couples while at the same time maintaining a commitment to children of future generations being born of and being reared by a father and a mother. To date, international human rights law has appreciated this rational distinction.


Those are the words, as I indicated, of a constituent from Western Australia and not from my state of Queensland. It is fine for us to listen to polls—they have some value at times—but we should not be ruled by polls. Regardless of whether it be a poll on this issue, a poll on how well a party is travelling in government or a poll on how well a party is travelling in opposition, we should govern based on what is the right thing to do. To give another example, I have met with a variety of people, both pro and anti gay marriage, from churches from my area. It is important to listen to their views and to appreciate their concerns. Unless we appreciate the views of a variety of people we will not know where we are heading with this particular issue. Just yesterday, I attended a gathering of people of the Islamic faith who have strong concerns about gay marriage. In fact, one of the young gentle­men at the barbecue, Abdul, approached me wanting to know our position on gay marriage. He indicated to me their overwhelming position on this issue.


There are a diverse range of views in our communities. They are views we as a government need to listen to and decide upon. We need to continue to press the position that we have indicated overwhelmingly: that we will not amend the Marriage Act. We will consistently put across our view, particularly at national conference, to support marriage between a man and a woman.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",Nats,2011-11-21,"



Senator JOYCE
 (Queensland—Leader of The Nationals in the Senate) (16:24):  Quite obviously, this is an emotionally loaded subject. I have to say at the start that it is another of those Green wedges where they jump onto an issue and try to hijack it without any concern for the consequences. Once you redefine the nature of the relationship, you affect not just the person for whom you are redefining it but for all people who have seen themselves in that kind of relationship. Those people also have their position redefined.



Senator Hanson-Young interjecting—




Senator JOYCE:
  I listened to you, Senator Hanson-Young; do you want to just be quiet? By redefining marriage you not only redefine for everybody now; you also redefine it historically. You redefine how people see their parents' marriage, their grandparents' marriages. All of this is part and parcel of the process.


People quite naturally come to this chamber with a sense of great emotional attachment to the term 'marriage'. It seems that this is being portrayed as an issue of Christian edict. It goes way beyond that. It is as much a Christian edict as it is a Buddhist edict, a Hindu edict or an Islamic edict. We live in a society that holds to certain tenets, including a belief in a multicultural society. For all these people we should also give thought to what this chamber puts forward, because we are defining it for them. We want to make sure that they have a right, and a strong attachment, to marriage as being between a man and a woman.


Another very important point is that both sides promised that the definition of marriage as being between a man and a woman was never going to be challenged in this term of parliament. That promise was made by both sides. We should honour those promises. Those promises were made because people feel so strongly about this issue. When we broaden a term we do not just broaden it; we water it down. The broader it gets, the more its meaning is diminished. That is something that people feel so strongly about.


Why is this issue before the parliament? It is here because under section 51(xxi) of the Constitution the Commonwealth parliament has the power to make laws in relation to marriage.. That is why we are having a discussion about it. It has become a political issue. Because it is a political issue, people have political positions. They have every right to express their position. We are absolutely overwhelmed by emails with messages supporting the institution of marriage as it currently stands—they literally come in their thousands. When breakfasts and other functions are held in this place they are packed out with people who respect the institution of marriage as it currently stands. We have a right to represent their views.


This issue ultimately becomes drawn into the complex tapestry that is the issue of discrimination. I do not think that this is an issue of discrimination. By reason of everything we are, there are certain things that we are and there are certain things that we are not. As much as I might like to call myself short, I am not short; I am taller than average. I might like to call myself olive. I am not; I am fair. You are either a man or woman. Things are defined by reason of what they are, and they always have been. To say that a definition holds true is not to be discriminatory; it is a statement of fact. The historical statement of fact about a marriage is that it is between a man and a woman. That is how it was defined. That is how history has defined it. That is the historical reflection of the history of every family in this chamber.


Not every marriage is successful. I understand that nearly half, unfortunately, are not, but nobody goes into a marriage with the idea of it falling apart. Everybody realises that not every marriage is a statement of love. There are some marriages that certainly lack love, but they are most certainly a marriage. That saying, 'I love someone,' can somehow equate to marriage and that marriage is love and love is marriage is not necessarily correct. A marriage is an arduous sea that people try to navigate. Whether we like it or not, marriage is by definition, historically and through the structure of society, an institution between a man and a woman. Whether we like it or not, whether it is politically correct or politically incorrect, it is the cornerstone on which our nation stands and on which our society stands. If we keep pulling the rug out from under each section of that which makes a society stand up society will ultimately fall over, because we will have reached the point of making everything meaningless.


In this debate, and I am sure this debate will go on, there has to be respect for the different views held by people throughout the chamber. On behalf of my colleagues in the National Party, with whom I have spoken, I am very much of the view that, while not every marriage is perfect, marriage is a statement between a man and a woman. It must stay that way not because of what we want but because of what society needs.

Senator PRATT
 (Western Australia) (16:29):  I am on record in my first speech to this chamber declaring my support for marriage equality in this nation. I do believe it is time to move forward on this issue. Notwithstanding that, though, clearly it is a question that is currently being debated within the Australian Labor Party. I am very pleased with the progress that the ALP has made on so many issues confronting GLBTI Australians—issues that we have acted on and addressed. But we have an important opportunity at our national Labor Party conference to move forward on this question. Labor has a very proud record of removing discrimination against GLBTI Australians, and I believe we will move forward on this question also. 


I have been very proud to work with Rainbow Labor, which is a grassroots organisation for GLBTI, which stands for Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, Transgender and Intersex Labor Party members and supporters. The aim of this organisation is full equality for the GLBTI community. We are keenly calling on the national conference to move forward on the question of marriage. The national conference is the federal ALP's highest decision-making forum and approves the national platform, which outlines our policies and principles. Because of that, I am bound by our party's current platform and policy. It is important to recognise that we have made progress on so many of the issues confronting GLBTI Australians because of the binding nature of our agenda and because we have historically viewed that these issues of rights and equality are not a matter of conscience but a matter of substantive rights that all Australians should enjoy. That is why this conference is so important.


As someone who has been denied the right to marry, I know how disappointing it feels and I, like many thousands of other Australians, was deeply disappointed when in 2004 the Marriage Act was amended. There are a great many people in the Labor Party, Labor supporters and people right across the community who feel the same way. I would like to share with you some quotes from some of these people:


My parents are married, my brothers are all married, we have a large happy extended family. My partner and I have been together for over seven years, we have a beautiful daughter Matilda and we would like marriage equality. 


…   …   …


It's time for marriage equality. It's time for same sex relationships to be respected and acknowledged as equal in society and in law. It's time to end this discrimination.


Another quote:


My parents are in their 60s and still married. I am a divorced father of 1, having been married for 13 years. 


…   …   …


It's time for marriage equality because we're Australia! Lesser countries have had marriage equality for years. I mean, are we *really* sure that we want to be behind South Africa on social policies like this?! If the land of the apartheid can do it, we certainly should. Arguments such as 'traditional marriage' that my local (Liberal) MP has is nonsense.


And another quote from a couple:


My partner of 19.5 years Mal and I are treated in every other respect, by our families friends and colleagues, as a couple. But we can't marry.


…   …   …


Put simply—we are behind the time with the rest of the civilised world, the choice should at least be available to us …


This quote from two women who have lived together for 18 years is particularly touching:


We own our own home, work for Queensland Health, and pay our taxes. Our son is 21 years old and gainfully employed and has a steady girlfriend. During our time in Queensland we opened our home to children in foster care and have done voluntary work with disabled young adults. Our belief is that everybody is born equal and should have equal rights. 


Why do I think it is time for equal marriage? It is time to climb out of the Dark Ages; it is time for change. I feel that more energy should be put into promoting safe, happy and loving environments for our future generations. The gender of parents should not be an issue. It is about love, it is about commitment and it is about basic human rights.


Full equality under the law is something that any progressive society should strive for. In a secular society, the right to marry one another as consenting adults should be a right without restriction. Marriage is a deep seated ritual in the public consciousness that confirms the community's acceptance of the union between two individuals. In the end, all that GLBTI people want is to feel accepted. 


I challenge some of Senator Joyce's remarks about the determination of gender and how absolute such things are. I ask this chamber, through you, Madam Acting Deputy President: what if you are of indeterminate gender—of no gender at all? Does that mean you have no right to marry anyone? That is the current situation in this nation. It is an appalling thing. It is also an appalling thing for those married couples with children where one partner wants to change their gender. Because of the Commonwealth's discrimination, such people are denied the right under state laws to change their gender. They are denied protection under state anti-discrimination acts because of the Commonwealth's discrimination. As a result, you are pretty much asking committed, functional families to divorce in order that someone be entitled to get their gender recognised. So when you talk about the absolute nature of a man and a woman for the purposes of marriage you are actually talking a nonsense because gender is a far more fluid thing than is generally understood by people in this chamber. So it is an important time for this nation to be discussing and confronting this question of marriage equality. It is not simply an issue of same-sex marriage; it is an issue of equality for all adult couples in terms of who they seek to form a committed and loving union with. I for one am very much looking forward to our national conference in December, where I will have the opportunity to call on my party to change its position on this question. It is a question I think we will be able to move forward on. Why? Because the Labor Party is a party that has always stood for progress, for equality and for the future.

Senator BERNARDI
 (South Australia) (16:37):  Recently a number of parliamentarians reported back on their electorate-wide consultation about the issue of gay marriage. It was heartening to read that an overwhelming majority, and some say as many as two-thirds, maintained their constituents broadly supported preserving marriage as being between a man and a woman. Of course, when Greens MP Adam Bandt suggested a system of consulting and reporting back, he never thought this would be the outcome. Given the Greens advocacy for almost everything that undermines the bedrock institutions of Western civilisation, it is a safe bet that he was expecting the response to vindicate his world view. Unfortunately for Mr Bandt, but fortunately for many of us, the innate wisdom of the electorate has recognised the importance of one of the most enduring institutions of society: traditional marriage.


Marriage has historically been the union of a man and a woman for life with the intention of raising a family. It has proven itself as the most sustainable and effective social support and training environment for our future generations. Within this ideal, children benefit from having both a male and a female role model. Of course, despite such a circumstance being the ideal for the nurturing of our children, we cannot ignore the fact that families today come in many different forms. Whatever their construct, we must also acknowledge that where children are protected and nurtured by a caregiver or caregivers who love them unequivocally they are better off than millions of other children around the world. That said, simply because families take many different forms, and some with a measure of success, does not mean we should stop recognising that what is best for children is living with a mother and father who have a strong, respectful and enduring love for one another.


That is one reason I think we need to preserve marriage as the gold standard of relationships and not allow the term to be applied to unions other than those between a man and a woman. To describe other types of relationships as being 'marriage' would reduce the important role that traditional marriage plays in one of the most important building blocks of our society, the family.


This motion is part of the current push within our parliament to broaden the definition of marriage. Once again, this demonstrates the salami-slicing encroach­ment by some on our important institutions. Only two years ago the progressive Left pushed and were successful in granting to all relationships the legal status and benefits accruing to married couples. This was well received by many within our community. However, there were some who voiced concerns that this was simply another step on the road to undermining the institution of marriage itself. To assuage these concerns there were assurances given by some in this chamber, and Senator Joyce referred to the bipartisan commitment that marriage being between a man and a woman would not be challenged during this parliament. Perhaps it will, but I hope it is not. But those assurances have not stopped the continual push to claim yet another of our social and cultural mores in the name of progress.


Leading the charge against our social institutions, in this case marriage, is the Greens party and some willing accomplices within the Labor Party. They, like many others, claim to represent the majority of people on this issue and yet find it hard to deal with the fact that their pursuit of these matters is not in keeping with the outlook or priorities of mainstream Australia. This motion is symbolic of the true agenda of the Australian Greens and it also highlights their priorities. Since the Greens first used their political clout to drive the direction of the Gillard government, we have seen their version of the national debate rotate around gay marriage, euthanasia and a massive green tax that will not be of any environ­mental benefit. These are not the priorities of mainstream Australia, and anyone with a true understanding of their concerns would know that.


However, the Greens led government insists through this motion and others like it that mainstream Australia supports the Greens social agenda, in this case the suggestion being that a growing majority of Australians want to change the definition of marriage as being between a man and a woman. I would dispute that claim, not only because it serves my personal views but because I dispute the Greens' continuing claim that a majority of people want Australia to become a republic. They have been maintaining that position from before the 1999 referendum. The fact they were wrong then, evidenced by the massive defeat of that referendum, has been entirely lost on those who live in a virtual green dream world.


In respect of the particular statement made in this motion from Senator Siewert, I realise that some members in this place have very strong opinions on this subject—strong opinions that lie on both sides of the argument. Indeed, I have a strong opinion on this myself. In many respects that was recognised when MPs in the other place consulted their electorates at the behest of the Greens and reported back to the parliament. According to the Greens, if you don't like the outcome, you just make claims like they have in this motion and you soldier on.


Those who advocate along the lines that the Greens do talk about 'marriage equality'. I believe we already have equality between couples in a committed relationship, according to our laws. In fact, that is what we passed two years ago. The fact that the term 'marriage' is applied to the union of a man and a woman with the permanent intent to maintain that union is not inequality but the recognition of the important role, both real and symbolic, that marriage has in our society. Accordingly, I will not stop advocating for the preservation of marriage as being between a man and woman. As Senator Joyce said, it is not just a contract between two people; it is a contract within society itself.

Senator BOB BROWN:
  I note the Prime Minister's statement and that of the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives today. What both leaders did was ignore the headline news that the brigadier general of the Afghan National Army in charge of the forces in Oruzgan province has said, effectively, to the Australian government about the Australian forces, 'Give us your equipment and go home.' The remarkable statement by the Afghan brigadier-general includes a direct asseveration that the Australian forces should not stay three years longer in Oruzgan province. There has been a deafening silence from the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, but to any reasonable person that statement is effectively a shockwave to our courageous defence force personnel working in collaboration with this brigadier-general and his forces in Afghanistan. Of itself, it demands a parliamentary debate here in Australia.


The Australian Greens stand for bringing our troops home. We salute their loyalty; we salute their dedication. But they are in harm's way with a corrupt government and now the senior people most related to them in the defence forces in Afghanistan are saying, effectively, 'Go home'. This should be the matter of a full debate in this parliament. We owe that to our loyal defence force personnel.

Senator COLBECK
 (Tasmania) (16:54):  by leave—I move:


That the Senate take note of the government response to the Senate Rural Affairs and Transport References Committee inquiry's report Science underpinning the inability to eradicate the Asian honey bee.


This is a very sad and ongoing saga and it is something that the Senate Rural Affairs and Transport References Committee spent a considerable amount of time on, working very hard to try to get to the bottom of the process behind the decision that the Asian honey bee could not be eradicated from where it has established itself in an area around Cairns. It is reasonable to suggest that members of the committee still have considerable concerns about the process, the way it was managed and the way the decision was made. Unfortunately, events since then do not change the view of many of us who have followed this issue closely.


We do acknowledge, though, that following the hearings that were held and the concerns that were expressed by the committee, the government provided $2 million to support a national pilot program to facilitate management of the Asian bee. But, again, the processes that the government undertook and the way that this issue has been managed have continued to raise concerns. As part of the process, and as part of the funding for this $2 million that was allocated by the government towards the study of the Asian bee, the government was supposed to provide a document to support a national pilot program—a plan—put into place by June.


We hear that just this morning—months, obviously, after the target date of June—members of the industry have been offered and provided with a copy of that plan. This continues the process that we saw during the decision-making discussion around whether or not the Asian bee might be eradicable. The farce continues. During the management of a key meeting in January on whether or not the bee might be eradicable, one of the pre-eminent scientists in this country had his name disappear off the email list, so he was not available to speak and advise the industry at the meeting. We hear now that, through the development of this plan which is five months late, scientists sitting around the panel are only allowed to speak if they are asked a direct question. They are not allowed to have general input. The process has been held confidential to three members of the industry.


It is a great way to manage dissent—that only three members of the industry who are on the panel developing the plan are able to have access to the information. There has been no effective consultation with the industry, no capacity for the development of the plan to be canvassed broadly within the beekeeping and honey industry in Australia. Three people have been allowed to be part of the process. The scientists sitting on the panel are allowed to comment only if they are asked a direct question. The complete farce that is this process continues. Further, we have a number of members of the beekeeping community, about 50 volunteers, working in and around Cairns on the potential eradication of the bee. One of the key assumptions made as part of the process was that the bees would move into the dense rainforest in and around Cairns and that it would be very hard to find them. That was one of the key elements in the decision-making process as put to us, as senators on the Senate inquiry, by departmental representatives. So dense forest was an issue for the potential eradication of the bee.


The observations coming out of that region now are that the bees are in fact not taking up residence in the dense rainforest. There is no food for them in the rainforest, so they might be going in but they are coming back out. One of the criticisms committee members had of this process during the inquiry was that at a critical point for the decision-making process the funding ran out, even though a decision had been made to collect more data. The fact that funding was not available meant that the data was not collected. Now the volunteer beekeepers operating around Cairns are finding a contradiction to what was the accepted wisdom at the time—that the bees would establish in the rainforest. They are telling us that the bees are not establishing in the rainforest, so the reality of the decision made earlier this year may be very different. 


I know that Senator Milne has also been quite concerned about ensuring that this process continues. We acknowledge that the government put additional money on the table and we appreciate that. Let us not criticise the fact that there has been a positive move made in that area. But then the report on how to manage the process was five months late, continuing the complete debacle which has been the process right from the outset—when a key member of the committee did not attend a meeting because their email address had slipped off the invitation list. I do not know whether you call it being accident prone, careless or incompetent. I really do not know how to describe this. 


Then we saw in the development of a management plan that only three people have been allowed to be part of the process. The key scientists, the people who really understand the Asian honey bee and its characteristics, who might have known what to do, were sitting around the table and could speak only when they were directly asked a question. This process has been so intensely controlled to manage against dissent or discussion that it is just absolutely absurd. For the government to control and restrict it to three people and not allow effective discussion throughout the rest of the industry is completely outrageous.


We appreciate that the government has accepted a number of our recom­mendations—they have stepped away from a couple of elements of what we asked them to do—but the practical processes they have undertaken right throughout the incursion of Asian bees into Australia really has been a comedy of errors. We questioned the decision that the bee was not eradicable and we questioned it based on advice from scientists who said there was not enough data to properly make that decision. We questioned the fact that the scientists were allowed to sit around the table but not be part of the discussion and that the key scientist was not at the meeting where the decision was made. 


It now appears, through observations being made by beekeepers and the volunteers who have taken it upon themselves to continue the work in and around Cairns—and we know that is by the agreement of the government—that their observations are indicating that the bees still may be eradicable. Yet the government persists with the line that it does not believe this bee can be eradicated even though the basic premise we saw during the inquiry was that there was not enough information to make that decision. While I acknowledge the tabling of the government's response, I still question their management of this overall process because it appears to me, with the key report being five months late, there is still a lot to be desired as far as the process is concerned.

"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2011-11-21,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (17:05):  I rise to note the government's response to the inquiry report Science underpinning the inability to eradicate the Asian honey bee. While I acknowledge the $2 million which the government provided to support a national pilot program, the whole point of the Senate report was that senators from all political parties wanted to make sure that eradication was reviewed. We wanted a review of the decision not to eradicate the Asian honey bee. The $2 million has been put into facilitation of the transition from eradication to the ongoing management of the Asian honey bee. In other words, the money has gone into upholding the decision that you cannot eradicate the Asian honeybee. There is no evidence to say that you can eradicate it or that you cannot eradicate it. That is the problem. That is why, after taking a lot of evidence, we recognised that the big problem was the lack of data that was collected on the incursion of the Asian honey bee—where it had spread, how it had spread, what it was feeding on, what the impact of the cyclone was and so forth. We wanted data collection and the beekeepers wanted data collection, and they had indicated they were prepared to put in a big voluntary effort to go up there, collect the data and see what was going on. In fact, as Senator Colbeck just mentioned, data coming out of the effort of those volunteers has shown that the expectation that the bees would get lost in the rainforest and breed up there, making them impossible to eradicate, was in fact quite wrong. The evidence is showing that they go in but then come out of the rainforest.


The issue I have with all of this is that a decision made by the management group not to eradicate was not based on evidence but based on an assumption that the bee would not spread. Therefore it became a cost decision of state governments. The state government representatives on the management group voted not to go for eradication because of the additional costs, the Commonwealth did not want to take on the additional costs, and the upshot was: 'Pull up the ladder, Jack. We're all right. It will spread in the tropics but it won't spread further south than that.' My big concern has always been that not only is it going to be a major problem in tropical Australia but the fact that it has spread throughout the highlands in PNG suggests that it is only a matter of time before it spreads to more temperate regions in Australia.


One of the real concerns I had with all of this was that nobody but nobody had taken into account the impact on Australia's biodiversity of the Asian honey bee incur­sion, which is why one of the recom­mendations of the committee was that biodiversity be taken into account and written reports be made on the likely impact. There is a high expectation that it will displace native bees—and again I come back to the fact that evidence based research is just not there.


Throughout it was: yes, it is going to have a major adverse impact on the beekeepers; yes, it is going to have a major adverse impact on wiping out European honey bees, reducing their production levels; it will also have an impact on the cross-pollination services that the European honey bee makes in horticulture. But nobody was talking about what the impact would be on Australia's biodiversity—what the impact would be on native bees, nectar-feeding insects, bats et cetera. Nobody could say because the work had not been done. I was horrified when I found out that the representative of the department of the environment who appeared at these talks was there as an observer and did not speak. Whether they knew nothing, whether they chose not to speak or whether they had no questions directed to them really does not matter, because the upshot is that biodiversity was not taken into account.


The government, in its response, has said:


The Government notes that as part of the decision making process, National Management Group members already consider biodiversity conse­quences of the establishment and spread of a pest or disease.


Really? I think that is misleading the Senate and I am now very motivated to find out, under FOI, exactly what the management group took into account in relation to the spread of the Asian honey bee. I can tell you, Madam Acting Deputy President, they did not take into account the biodiversity consequences.


Subsequent to the decision to allow the Asian honey bee to spread and to manage it, the Wet Tropics Management Authority has said that the adverse consequences on the wet tropics are likely to be considerable as a result of the spread of this Asian honey bee. Where was that in the consideration? It was nowhere. It was not raised once by anybody in the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry. It was not raised once by anybody from Biosecurity Australia. I do not believe the impact on the wet tropics was considered at any point, nor do I believe that the Wet Tropics Management Authority was actually asked for its view, just as I do not believe CSIRO was asked for its view on biodiversity. But I intend to find out, since the government has said quite clearly, in black and white:


The Government notes that as part of the decision making process, National Management Group members already consider biodiversity consequences …


I do not think anybody could tell you right now what the biodiversity consequences of the Asian honey bee incursion are likely to be, because very few people are out there doing the research. The one officer at CSIRO who has done 20 years of research in this field was not asked for his views on the impact on biodiversity.


The government refuses to take into account the second recommendation that relevant scientific agencies be asked to provide written advice through the national management group or consultative com­mittees with regard to biodiversity. The excuse for not taking that up is that it 'may hinder action being taken in a timely manner'. I have never heard so much rubbish in my life. If you want to take action in a timely manner you need to find out quickly what the likely consequences are so that you can design the action to make sure you protect that which needs protecting from a pest incursion.


I believe the spread of the Asian honey bee is going to be an absolutely huge natural disaster for Australia's biodiversity. The Asian honey bee takes up small cavities. Small cavities are known to be the breeding places of birds and insects. We are going to see a major consequence in the loss of native bee populations and impacts on insects. I can assert that. I do not have an evidence base for that, but nor do these people have an evidence base to suggest that there will not be impacts on biodiversity. The impacts I am talking about have been put to me by experts in the field. The point that Senator Colbeck was making and that I am now making is that senators across all political parties asked that the money go into an evidence based campaign to get up there and find out exactly what is going on so as to make an informed judgment. After the senators asked that that happen, there was a meeting convened and we now get the answer that the group:


… reconvened on 12 May 2011 to consider the impact of the Consultative Committee delibera­tions on the original decision on eradicability. Although consensus was not reached, the Group determined that it is not technically feasible to achieve eradication.


They have no basis for that. Either it is or it is not, but there is no evidence to support either case. The point the experts were making ad infinitum was: we need to collect the data before we can make an informed decision about whether we can eradicate or whether we cannot. That is what the Senate was asking the government to do—not to put $2 million into switching from eradication to management, running up the white flag and saying that is it, the Asian honey bee is here so we will just have to live with it. 


The consequences of this incursion of the Asian honey bee will be huge. Whilst I accept there will be a huge impact on honey bee production, on cross-pollination services across Australia and on amenity in the community—they nest all over the place—the main issue that has not been considered is biodiversity consequences. I am very unhappy with the government's response on that particular recommendation.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2011-11-21,"



Senator IAN MACDONALD
 (Queensland) (17:15):  I thank the Senate for the opportunity to speak on the government response to the report of the Rural Affairs and Transport References Committee. The spread of the Asian honey bee has been worrying me for some time. I come from North Queensland and I look after northern and remote Australia issues for the coalition. This is simply another case of the government's out of sight, out of mind approach. We have a minister who is completely out of his depth when it comes to anything to do with agriculture, fisheries and forestry. This is the first government for a long time that has had only one minister covering this portfolio. Whether the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry is interested or not, I am sure he does not have time to give to this particular issue, as with many issues in this portfolio, the attention that it demands. Agriculture, fisheries and forestry issues sit in the rural and regional parts of Australia, the more remote parts of Australia, including Northern Australia. There are no votes there and the minister has clearly shown on a number of occasions he has made decisions that he has no interest in—as I say, it is the out of sight, out of mind approach.


I congratulate Senator Colbeck on the great work he has done and on the issues he has raised, and I acknowledge that other senators have been very concerned about this matter as well. This response by the government deserves much fuller debate but again I despair—because of a motion supported by the Greens and the Australian Labor Party this morning we are not going to have an opportunity, apart from today, to discuss government responses to committee reports or to discuss the literally hundreds and hundreds of government documents that have been tabled in this parliament for scrutiny. Because of this guillotine decision earlier today, for the rest of this parliamentary year—for the rest of this calendar year—there will be absolutely no opportunity for senators to hold the government accountable for all these government documents and government reports that are brought into this parliament every week. 


We hear about the new paradigm of open accountability, but where has it gone? The Senate's ability to look at government documents and committee reports at the appropriate times on Wednesday and Thursday afternoons is an essential part of a parliament keeping a government accountable. I think this is about the fourth or fifth week running that the government has done away with that opportunity for senators to look at these matters. This government response deserves much greater attention but it is not going to get it. By the time the Senate gets back to this report, the Asian honey bee could be anywhere. As Senator Colbeck points out, this is an issue which should be subject to intense scrutiny. Senator Milne is talking about a freedom of information request because she is unhappy with the response of the government. Senator Colbeck raises some issues about the conduct of this inquiry which really bring the honesty of this government to account. We know this government is led by a Prime Minister who told a deliberate lie before the last election, but you would think there would be a certain basic governmental honesty in relation to all of these documents.




Senator McLucas:
  Madam Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order. I request that you ask Senator Macdonald to withdraw his comment about the Prime Minister. It was not parliamentary.




The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT 

(
Senator Crossin
):  Senator Macdonald, I remind you that you cannot impugn another member of the parliament.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  I withdraw my comment—I simply say that before the last election the Prime Minister promised there would be no carbon tax under a government she led, and we have just had guillotined through the Senate 18 bills introducing a carbon tax. Senator McLucas can assess that how she likes, but it does not seem to me to be terribly truthful or terribly honest when you promise not to do something before an election to get yourself elected and, immediately you are elected, you completely break the promise. If it disturbs her when I say the Prime Minister deliberately lied, I withdraw. But, as I say, I will leave it to the listeners to work out what it means when you promise a day before an election that you will not do something and then immediately you get into government you do it. 


By the same token, the Australian people were promised with this deal with so-called rural Independents that there would be this whole new paradigm of accountability. Where are we in the Senate? All of these government documents and important responses to reports like this report of the Rural Affairs and Transport References Committee are not being considered. There is no scrutiny because the Greens and the Labor Party have chopped off the opportunity for the Senate to do its job and look at these documents. The carbon tax was guillotined, and for the whole week that was set aside for the carbon tax debate we could not look at government documents and could not look at these reports. Then we had an extra week. We all came back for an extra week, just for the Senate, so that we could debate the carbon tax. After one and a bit days of that week, the government and the Greens again guillotined it. But they did not uplift the ability to hold the government to account on many of these documents. And here the first motion for what is supposed to be the final two weeks of parliament this year is the government saying, 'Again this week we'll do away with any ability for senators to do their duty and look at these government responses.'


You will not get any of the media writing about this because it is a left-wing government doing it, but this should be a headline outrage: taking away from this parliament the ability to do its duty and to follow the 'new paradigm' of accountability. There is no accountability here. The government and the Greens—




Senator Mason:
  No scrutiny.




Senator IAN MACDONALD:
  There is no accountability and no scrutiny of that accountability because the government and the Greens continue to deny senators the opportunity to discuss this. Whilst I appreciate that Senator Milne has something to say on this Asian honey bee business, it does seem a little trite to me that she then gets up and takes 10 minutes of the Senate's time in debating this issue, preventing other speakers apart from Senator Colbeck and me from having a say on this, when she is one of those who supported the motion this morning to make it impossible to properly scrutinise all of these documents and reports such as this. I get very angry about that. One of the real roles of the Senate is to look at all of the government documents, to hold the government accountable, but how can you do that when the Greens and the Australian Labor Party take away those opportunities with what is becoming monotonous regularity?


As Senator Colbeck says, this needs a lot more investigation. It should be debated much more fully in the parliament, but it will be February before anyone else gets a chance to make a comment on this issue. This shows a government that have no interest in these issues. It is the out of sight, out of mind approach: 'Oh, the Asian honey bee will only come to tropical North Queensland. Who cares what happens up there?' Little did they think that it could destroy the horticulture industry by destroying the honey bee. And, as Senator Milne rightly says, little did anyone bother about the fact that it could have a real impact on our biodiversity. Those things just went over the minister's head. For a lousy couple of million dollars, research was stopped. What is worse, as Senator Colbeck points out, when the committee inquired into it, it seems—I was not on the committee, but it seems—that some of the witnesses might have even been gagged, and that in itself should be a reason for a full-scale debate on this in the Senate. But are we going to get that opportunity? Not this year. And, by the time next year comes around, it will be clearly too late.


There is the other issue raised in the debate about the Wet Tropics Management Authority. I would like to say a few words about how their funding has been cut back over the years, and perhaps that is why they did not get the opportunity to alert people to this beforehand.


For all of these reasons, we should have more time to investigate this report. I am just disappointed that the guillotining stops that.

 (Western Australia—Australian Greens Whip) (17:44):  I seek leave to take note of the answers from the Tasmanian Minister for Health, Ms O'Byrne, and the Chief Minister of the Australian Capital Territory, Ms Gallagher, on the hearing health of Indigenous Australians.

  I move:


That the Senate take note of the document.


These letters are in response to the motion that was passed by the chamber in September which dealt with issues of hearing health for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. Last session we had a response from Ms Bligh, the Queensland Premier, outlining the Deadly Ears program and we have since had these two subsequent responses. I am really pleased to see that the states and territories are responding to this motion because this is a particularly important issue. It is fairly unusual to get such a speedy response and I am really pleased that they are taking this issue very seriously. But I would urge the states that are responding and also those that are yet to respond to this to seek to raise this issue with the Commonwealth and suggest that it be an issue that is taken up through COAG, because it is only through coordinated national state and territory responses that we are going to see this issue being seriously addressed.


I have outlined to the chamber on numerous occasions the pandemic that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities face through otitis media and the subsequent impact this is having on their hearing health and the subsequent impact that that hearing impairment is having on people's educational outcomes, their interactions with the educational system and, unfortunately, the subsequent interactions they are having with the criminal justice system. I am in no doubt about the statistics that we are starting to see in the criminal justice system. A recent survey showed that 90 per cent of Aboriginal prisoners in the Darwin Correctional Centre had some form of hearing loss or hearing impairment. We also had anecdotal evidence to the Senate inquiry that articulated the poor interaction that people with hearing loss or hearing impairment are having with police and, once in the justice system, within the justice system and, once in the prison system, in the prison system. It is absolutely imperative that this issue is dealt with.


Unfortunately, I cannot let this opportunity pass without commenting on the flawed approach the government is taking to educational outcomes in the Northern Territory and the legislation that I understand, judging by media reports, will be introduced any day into the House of Representatives extending the Northern Territory Emergency Response and in particular seeking to expand the SEAM trials, which are the school attendance trials, and then to cut income support if we do not increase school attendance.


Getting a child into school is not the end of this process. Unfortunately, the government seems to be forgetting that. You cannot tick the box because the child is at school. We need to be providing an education system that provides educational outcomes. We need to be dealing with hearing health. Once the child is in school we obviously need to be making sure we have a program in place dealing with otitis media. That requires a coordinated approach from all other states and the Commonwealth. When we have a child in school, we need to make sure, for example, that we have sound fields in not just some but all classrooms. One of the simple recommendations that the Senate Community Affairs References Committee made in its Hear us report into hearing health in Australia is that, under the act that governs the provision of services, Australian Hearing be enabled to spend some of their resources on the provision of sound fields, because at the moment they cannot. We believe it would be a fairly simple amendment to make that would have a very significant impact. We need to be making sure that schools do not have to just apply for that money, combined with the money that the government has assigned to the disabilities in schools program—which is a good program, I have to say—and that we have a rollout of investment in sound field systems and make sure that classrooms have proper acoustics. We need to make sure that that money is being well targeted.


We need to be making sure that we are screening schoolchildren as they enter the school system, because we are not picking up hearing loss in classrooms. We need to be investing in making sure that we are really addressing this pandemic of otitis media across Australia because Australia has the highest rate of this in the world. That is an indictment of our health systems. That is an indictment of living conditions, particularly in remote and regional Australia, although we still find that we have these problems in metropolitan Perth.


The Telethon Speech and Hearing Centre has done marvellous work with an ear bus that has been going out to schools and diagnosing and treating children straightaway. We are seeing that program being rolled out across virtually the rest of the Pilbara, but further north in the Kimberley we still need resources for that. There is the Deadly Ears program in Queensland. There are various bits and pieces of programs, as the ministers here are articulating, but we need a much more coordinated approach. We need a national program; we need a national plan as to how we are going to have a sustained effort and not a piecemeal effort to address these points.


I note that the tabling of these letters is fortuitous because some of the experts that were mentioned in the original motion happen to be here meeting in Parliament House this week. They are talking about how to further progress issues addressing Aboriginal children's health. I wish them good luck in their deliberations. If they come to meet with you, senators and members of the House of Representatives, I encourage you to talk to them because it is essential that we target our resources effectively and efficiently to deal with this issue. It is a preventable tragedy that is happening in our country today in 2011. This pandemic is happening in our country. We should be ashamed of it and we need to do more to address it.

That the Senate take note of the document.


As an Australian observer to the 32nd General Assembly of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, it was a privilege to witness the goodwill between the countries involved in ASEAN and to see that they are committed to advancing their economies. While the powerhouse of China looms large over its neighbouring nations, it became clear that the 10—as it was, and now 11 with Myanmar—have the potential themselves to become an influential economic force. They have a population of some 600 million, there are some already powerful economies within the association and they are all going down the road to economic prosperity. Free trade agreements between the member nations have already given them a competitive edge as a production base in the world market and helped to attract more foreign investment.


It was very pleasing to see that Australia is regarded very much as a respected friend whose aid over the years has been much appreciated. Australia was the first non-South-East Asian country to become an associate of ASEAN. This was noted as an indication of the sincerity of our support for the group. A highlight of the meeting I attended was the admission of Myanmar to full membership. The dialogue which occurred between the Australian delegation and the other delegations was very interesting and wide ranging and again showed how well regarded Australia is within the area. Cambodia of course has come out of a very unhappy past. I did see some evidence of that at S21, the school where the Khmer Rouge murdered so many people. The Cambodians are seeking to move on, and I think they have a very good prospect of having a bright and rosy future. They are certainly great friends of Australia. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Abetz, Sen Eric",LP,2011-11-21,"



Senator ABETZ
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Opposition in the Senate) (19:30):  I move:


That the Senate take note of the ministerial statement.


September 11, 2011 was the tenth anniversary, if we can call it that, of the horrific and cowardly attacks on the twin towers in which, along with 2,977 people from 90 different nations, 11 Australians were killed. In October 2002 at Kuta in Bali, 88 Australians were killed. In September 2004 at the Australian embassy in Jakarta, nine Indonesians were killed and over 150 injured. In July 2005, one Australian was killed and 11 were injured in the London train and bus bombings. In October 2005 at Jimbaran beach and Kuta in Bali, four Australians were killed and 19 injured. In July 2009 at the Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotels in Jakarta, three Australians were killed. Fortunately, attacks closer to home have been thwarted, notably an attack on Holsworthy Army base, planned for 4 August 2009, to be carried out by Australian based Islamic militants linked to the terrorist group al-Shabaab. The perpetrators planned on infiltrating the base and shooting as many Army personnel and others as possible until they were killed or captured.


These are some of the reasons that Australia is in Afghanistan fighting the scourge of terrorism which had its base in Afghanistan. Afghanistan had long been a training ground for terrorists, including those responsible for the attacks in Bali and Jakarta and against our embassy in Indonesia. Over the past decade, close on 100 Australians have been killed by terrorist attacks that were planned and executed from terrorist safe havens in Afghanistan. So, in the first instance, our presence denies Afghanistan as a training ground and operating base for al-Qaeda and other terrorist organisations. Secondly, our presence helps stabilise the Afghan state through civil, police and military training for local Afghans which will enable them to achieve self-determination within a reasonable time frame.


There are an annual average of 1,550 Australian Defence Force personnel deployed within Afghanistan as part of Australia's military contribution to the International Security Assistance Force, ISAF. Our military, civilian and develop­ment assistance is directed towards mentoring the Afghan National Army 4th Brigade in Oruzgan province to eventually take on responsibility for the province's security, building the capacity of the Afghan National Police to assist with civil policing functions in Oruzgan, improving the Afghan government's capacity to deliver core services and generate economic oppor­tunities and disrupting insurgent operations and supply routes utilising the Special Operations Task Group.


On occasions such as this it is worthwhile looking at the progress that has been made. The International Council on Security and Development, an organisation long critical of US policy in Afghanistan, is echoing the US sentiment that, as a result of the surge and refined strategy, many of the Taliban's long-time safe havens in Helmand and Kandahar have been destroyed. Mid-level Taliban commanders and their networks have been disrupted, dismantled or destroyed by special forces. In March 2011, General Petraeus told the US Armed Services Committee that in a typical three-month period 360 insurgent leaders were either killed or captured. This has had a marked effect on the average age of Taliban commanders, which, according to observers, has dropped from 35 to 25 in the past year.


The standing up of the Afghan National Army, the ANA, is taking time but it is progressing. The ANA has assumed security responsibility for Bamyan province, the first of 48 provinces, and over half of the patrol bases within the Oruzgan province. Another six provinces were handed over to the ANA and ANP authority in recent times. We talk of the Kabul province, Panjshir province, Herat city, Mazar-e Sharif city, Lashkar Gah city and Mehtar lam town. Real progress is being made. Retention rates for the ANA are slowly rising. 


In addition to all those military gains and security gains in Afghanistan, it is worthwhile noting the improvements that have been made to the quality of living of the Afghan population. Let us go back 10 years. In 2001, Kabul was a ghost town and a home to 500,000 repressed, cold—cold because none of the heating worked—and depressed people. It is now a thriving city of three million, with shops, cafes, cinemas, music and girls and boys schools. In 2001, nine per cent of Afghans had access to basic medical care. Today that is at 85 per cent. In 2001 less than one million boys went to school. Today seven million young Afghans go to school, one-third of whom are girls. In 2001, you would struggle to find a phone. Today, one in three Afghans has a mobile phone. In 2001, only the Taliban's Voice of Shariat hit the airwaves. Today, there are over 100 active press outlets. So you can see the great progress that has been made.


Regrettably, previous moves to strike a deal with the Taliban have proved fruitless. I recall some 13 months ago, when we were considering this matter in this place, I was suggesting that peace should be given a chance and there should be discussions with the Taliban. Nevertheless, despite them being fruitless, I am encouraged to learn that negotiations with the Taliban continue in the hope of a breakthrough deal.


Just over a year ago, the top NATO commander in Afghanistan, General Petraeus, said that progress in the war was sometimes as slow as 'watching grass grow or paint dry' but that American and coalition troops were nevertheless making headway with 'hard fought gains' against insurgents, but that it remained tough going. Recently, General Petraeus's successor, General John Allen, said:


Each day, Afghans are learning new skills, working to provide for their families, standing up for their communities, and labouring to build a new, more hopeful Afghanistan. With each step of progress, our shared enemy has come to realise that they cannot tear down what the Afghan people are building up. The enemies of peace are not mujahidin or martyrs, but murderers, and their violence, assassinations and attacks will not frighten the Afghan people into submission. Taliban fighters, too, are growing weary of their leaders—who stay off the battlefield, deciding instead to issue orders from the comforts of foreign lands. Because they have lost territory, support, morale, and the will to fight, many of these fighters are considering reintegration and choosing a future of hope and promise for themselves, their families, and their communities.


The current surge is witnessing success, with a large number of insurgents being killed and forced to retreat from areas formerly under strict Taliban control. More and more Taliban are now being forced into areas where they have not previously been dominant. So, in Oruzgan and neighbouring provinces, NATO and Australian forces are being called upon to engage in even more encounters with the Taliban. Unfortunately, this is resulting in further casualties for our troops.


Just last week, the alternative Prime Minister Mr Abbott visited our troops in Afghanistan. This was about a fortnight after three heroic Australian members of the Mentoring Task Force were killed by a rogue Afghan army member and about a week after another three were wounded by another Afghan soldier. Obviously, incidents like these cause people to question our mission. However, the Australians Mr Abbott met spoke highly of their Afghan allies, the vast majority of whom they regarded as worthy comrades. Mr Abbott's take-out was that there was little doubt that the security situation there is improving.


The insurgency still has the capacity to inflict casualties, using roadside bombs to carry out civilian massacres and to assassinate officials of the Karzai govern­ment. However, the military advice is that the Taliban's ability to engage in direct combat has been seriously degraded. Mr Abbott found that in Oruzgan more schools and clinics are open and many girls are getting an education for the very first time. The road between Tarin Kowt and Chora has been sealed and local villagers are reported to be increasingly turning on the Taliban. The ADF's Mentoring Task Force has helped make the 4th Brigade among the best in the Afghan army.


The transition from largely Western to largely Afghan security forces will take time and the Afghan government will almost certainly need military and financial support for some years to come. Still, it is important that we assist with the establishment of a more humane Afghan government and it is also in our own interests to ensure Afghanistan never again becomes a safe haven for terrorism. Our troops are doing an amazing job in difficult circumstances. The terrain is rugged, the climate harsh, the dust oppressive, the enemy dangerous and our rules for engagement restrictive. Yet, despite all of this, our forces are doing well, exceptionally well.


When last the Senate debated the war in Afghanistan 13 months ago, we had lost 21 brave young Australians and had sustained 150 injured. The toll now stands, regrettably, at 32 while 213 have been wounded in action. We are thinking of them and their families and their friends as we debate this matter. Each death is a tragedy but we should not expect war to be without sacrifice. The important thing is that this sacrifice is not in vain. Over the past decade, close on 100 Australians have been killed and many injured by terrorist attacks that were planned and executed from terrorist safe havens in the mountains of Afghanistan. Our commit­ment of troops in Afghanistan has disrupted such attacks. Our continued commitment is necessary to ensure that our gains are consolidated.


On the eve of Remembrance Day, the fiancee of Corporal Richard Atkinson, a soldier killed in Afghanistan, spoke of the challenges she has faced dealing with his death. Corporal Atkinson, a Tasmanian, was killed by a roadside bomb in February. It was his first deployment. He was part of an operation trying to drive the Taliban out of the Deh Rahwod area, west of the Australian base at Tarin Kowt, a vital strategic area in the war against the insurgency. Dannielle Kitchen, the fiancee, spoke of how she and Richard met, how she coped with his deployment in Afghanistan, how she heard the news of his passing and how she was coping with being a war widow at age 23. It is hard not to feel incredible sorrow about a young man, his life full of promise, on the cusp of marriage and starting his own family, being cut down in a foreign land and for his widow left behind to carry on. We will never know the sorrow of Richard's fiancée and family but we feel intensely for them as they carry their loss. It is some consolation that Richard was convinced that we were doing the right thing and that he was doing good in Afghanistan. It is important that his sacrifice and that of his fiancée not be in vain.


Unfortunately of late there has been an opportunistic element entering into the debate on the war in Afghanistan. It is unfortunate that the tragic deaths of Australian soldiers are used to call for withdrawal of our forces. That opportunism reached a low point with the regrettable question here in the Senate on the eve of Remembrance Day. The Leader of the Government in the Senate was asked whether the government was receiving letters from relatives concerned about the safety of their loved ones serving in Afghanistan, like that from a relative of the soldier which allegedly said, 'Everyone you speak to wants the boys home because no-one believes in this cause any more.' Well, Richard Atkinson did. But such self-serving tactics and seeking to capitalise on the media which follows the death of the digger dishonours our soldiers' sacrifice and, might I suggest, this place.


To withdraw from Afghanistan now would be potentially to give up the good progress which has been made. It would leave parts of Afghanistan vulnerable to return to Taliban control. It would lead to Afghanistan potentially again becoming a safe haven for terrorists to launch attacks on Australians. It would send a message to the locals for them to hedge their bets and stop full cooperation with us because they may have to live with the return of the Taliban. We all hope and pray for peace, especially in Afghanistan. But peace is not the absence of war, as some so simplistically seek to portray; peace is the true, unencumbered exercise of freedom. Many have engaged in war and died to defend or gain those freedoms and that is why we are in Afghanistan. When we lose a soldier, we as a nation mourn and share the pain. When our soldiers make huge gains and root out Taliban strongholds, build schools and allow girls to go to school, our media, for some reason, becomes less excited.


The Senate rightly salutes and pays respects to our fallen heroes. Might I suggest that it could also be appropriate for us to salute the freedoms like girls being allowed to go to school for this first time, the new roads, the new schools and the new hospitals which are being developed in Afghanistan as we speak on a daily basis by our troops. This imbalance in reporting regrettably impacts public sentiment. However, it should not deter us from the task. Having said that, we need to 'give peace a chance'. Of course we should seek to conclude our presence in Afghanistan. To broadcast a precipitous withdrawal will only embolden the Taliban and disenchant the locals.


As we embark on the Christmas period remembering the purpose of Christ's birth was sacrifice for our common good, let us remember those who will be away from their family over this period of goodwill, who are willing to serve our nation and, if need be, follow the example of sacrifice for the greater good. The coalition salutes the work of our troops in Afghanistan.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2011-11-21,"



Senator BOB BROWN
 (Tasmania—Leader of the Australian Greens) (19:50):  This issue is hugely important to Australians, particularly to the good and true members of our defence forces, their families and their communities. It is a debate that this parliament has not represented well or fairly. It is one the Greens have pursued throughout the Howard years and through the last four years of Labor government. We are tonight debating the deployment of our troops in Afghanistan and the legitimate question that any parliament, any administration or any leadership must ask as to whether that deployment serves the nation's interests and whether the risk of life and limb and the risk to future happiness of defence force personnel are warranted, because we must never ever have such deployment treated lightly or without due scrutiny.


It is the job of this parliament to scrutinise the deployment of our defence force personnel to Afghanistan. I take issue with some of the comments of Senator Abetz before he left the chamber relating to the ability of parliamentarians to speak up on this issue.


I have never resiled from the Greens position of having our troops brought home from Afghanistan, nor have I ever raised the issue except in the wake of the leaders of the government and the opposition reaffirming the need for our troops to stay in Afghanistan. Let me quote from Major General Alan Stretton (Rtd) in a recent letter to the press in which he said:


The spectacle of politicians from both parties agreeing to send our finest Australians to their deaths and then appearing on television offering their condolences to grieving widows and relatives is sickening.


The policy that we can train the Afghan army to take over security in Afghanistan is laughable. The Afghan government is corrupt, and its army has been penetrated by Taliban forces whose main activity is killing allied forces operating in their country.


Elements of the Australian Defence Force have now been in Afghanistan for over 10 years—surely this is long enough.


They are very trying sentiments from a good and long-serving, but now retired, member of our defence forces and they are not alone, certainly in dispatches I have received.


Let me put the need for this debate another way. It has been as a result of quite extraordinarily high profile debates in the Netherlands and Canada that they have withdrawn their troops from Afghanistan. These are countries very similar to Australia, both of whom deployed more troops than Australia but whose parliaments have been committed to the very difficult debate—because it is complex—about retaining their armies in Afghanistan. In the case of the Netherlands, the government fell over the issue but their troops were withdrawn. Indeed, it is those troops whom our wonderful service men and women are now replacing in Oruzgan province. In Canada it was the very conservative government of Prime Minister Harper, faced with opposition from other parties in the Canadian parliament, who finally made the decision to have the Canadian contingents withdrawn, after more than 100 deaths, and that process has now been completed in Afghanistan.


Last week the President of the United States, Barack Obama, spoke in our parlia­ment and asked us to maintain our troops in Afghanistan. Let us look at the relative deployment. The American deployment of some 100,000 is currently being reduced to 68,000. Ten thousand US troops are in the process of being withdrawn before Christmas. There is no such withdrawal of a relative component of Australian Defence Force personnel from Afghanistan. Next year the United States is withdrawing another 20,000 of its troops. There is no plan to withdraw—or lessen by one—the number of Australian troops in Afghanistan. The Cameron government in Britain is going to withdraw 400 to 500 troops by February. There is no similar commitment by the government or opposition in this parliament to have our troop numbers reduced in Afghanistan. President Sarkozy of France has said that there will be a continuous wind-down, from now through next year and into 2014, of French troops. There is no comparable commitment to withdraw Australian troops from Afghanistan.


It seems, on the basis of two similar countries having withdrawn their forces altogether, after a full parliamentary debate in rich, functioning democracies like ours, and a decision in similar but larger democracies to withdraw troops—starting in 2011, not in 2014—that Australia alone has decided to keep its full troop commitment operating in Afghanistan. There is a difference here. President Obama may make his call to our parliament to retain our troops while he is withdrawing 10,000 troops, but would it not be appropriate for our parliament to discuss the deployment of our 1,550 good and true Australian Defence Force personnel to some of the most dangerous situations in Afghanistan at a time when the US is bringing home 10,000 of its troops? I think so.


I heard Senator Abetz again go through the list of things going right in Afghanistan, but there is a lot going wrong as well. Corruption is rampant. Senator Milne tells me that a report in Congress today indicates a vast amount of money for the people of Afghanistan and the war against the Taliban is being siphoned off by people related to the Karzai regime or otherwise in positions of power in Afghanistan. We have the position where there is an increasing voice in Afghanistan itself calling for the withdrawal of our troops and of course today the news in Australia, completely ignored by the Prime Minister, the Leader of the Opposition and, indeed, Senator Abetz in his contribution to this chamber, of a call by the commander of the Afghan troops with whom the Australians are serving in Oruzgan province, Brigadier General Mohammed Zafar Khan, for Australia's troops, effectively, to leave. 'Give us your equipment and leave' is effectively what the Afghan leader our troops are working with said. He said:


Three years is too much time for the Australians to stay here …


We, as responsible guardians of the welfare of our troops committed in Afghanistan and with a huge obligation on our shoulders to defend the interests of their families and our communities, surely should be debating such a remarkable statement from such a leader in the Afghan forces. It is time our troops were brought home to Australia.

"Faulkner, Sen John",ALP,2011-11-21,"



Senator FAULKNER
 (New South Wales) (19:59):  I am certainly pleased to have the opportunity—albeit brief—to contribute to this debate on Australia's involvement in Afghanistan. I still believe, as I have said before in the Senate, that in the post 9-11 world Australia cannot afford to ignore its national security interests in corners of the globe beyond our territorial borders and outside of our region. I still believe Australia as a member of the international community must not shirk its responsibilities in Afghanistan.


Let us not forget that we operate in Afghanistan under a United Nations mandate that is renewed annually. Let us not forget that we operate in Afghanistan as a member of the International Security Assistance Force, along with partners from 48 nations. Let us not forget that we are not an invasion force in Afghanistan, but that we are there at the invitation of the government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. Let us not forget that we are there for the most important and legitimate of reasons—to ensure that Afghanistan is no longer a place where terrorists are trained and find safe haven. We must not forget that we have a clear operational military objective—to train the 4th Brigade of the Afghan National Army so it can take full responsibility for security and stability in Oruzgan province. The less secure Afghanistan is, the less secure Australia and Australians are.


There is a human cost to our involve­ment—and it is a very heavy human cost. As we all know, the risks to our personnel are serious—32 Australians have died, 11 this year, and 213 Australians have been wounded in action, 48 this year. This is a terrible, terrible toll. So many families have suffered pain and loss. So many have had their lives changed forever as a result of those Australian casualties. But I for one do not want the effort and sacrifice of our troops in Afghanistan to be in vain. I want to see Australia finish the job in Afghanistan and go.

"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2011-11-21,"



Senator JOHNSTON
 (Western Australia) (20:04):  I am surprised that the Leader of the Government in the Senate is not here for this very important debate this evening. That we have lost 32 fine Australians in Afghanistan is a measure of both the commitment of our soldiers and more broadly our national resolve to complete our mission there. It is not often appreciated that a safe haven for al-Qaeda in Afghanistan was the launch pad of the 9-11 attacks on the twin towers of the World Trade Centre, the Pentagon and the passenger aircraft on that fateful day. 


Closer to home, over the past decade close on 100 Australians have been killed by terrorist attacks that were planned and executed from safe havens in the mountains of Afghanistan. On 12 October 2002 in Bali, 88 Australians were killed, and, in a bombing on 9 September 2004 at the Australian embassy, nine Indonesians were killed and 150-plus injured. In the 7 July 2005 London train bombings, one Australian was killed and 11 injured, with 56 killed and 700-plus injured overall. At Jimbaran Beach in Kuta, Bali, on 1 October 2005, four Australians were killed and 19 injured, with a total of 26 killed and 100 injured. In the Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotels in Jakarta, three Australians were killed out of a total of seven, with 53 people injured.


The Vice-President of the United States in 2006 said:


Hambali (the planner of the Australian Embassy attack and also the 2002 bombing—currently held in Guantanamo Bay) went to the training camps in Afghanistan that they ran back in the '90s, subsequently received funding from al Qaeda, went back then to Indonesia, and was behind some of the major attacks there. So you've got this sort of home-grown, but nonetheless affiliated, extremist operation going now in Indonesia. You'll find the same thing if you go to Morocco, where they had the attack in Casablanca; in Turkey, Istanbul, and so forth.


So Afghanistan was more than just a safe haven. It was a training ground. It was where they honed their terrorist skills.


Our mission was therefore originally the denial of Afghanistan as a training ground and an operational base for al-Qaeda from which to project its global terrorist activities. It was then to stabilise the Afghan state through the enhancement of security through military, police and civilian consolidation. More particularly, such work for Australia was to focus on Oruzgan province. As a necessary adjunct to the mission, those who gave that safe haven to al-Qaeda, namely the Taliban, had to be dealt with.


This was an organisation which, apart from providing that safe haven to al-Qaeda and all the terror that that caused around the world, imposed upon the Afghan people a number of atrocious, strict edicts. Women were banished from the workforce. Schools were closed to girls and women, and women were expelled from universities. Women were prohibited from leaving their homes unless accompanied by a close male relative—and so on and so forth. Women and girls in Afghanistan and the wider society were treated to atrocities by the Taliban. Women were beaten, publicly flogged and killed for violating Taliban decrees.


Today our work is ongoing and carried out under a United Nations mandate, renewed annually, through the participation of some 48 partner countries spread throughout Afghanistan, each in particular areas and provinces and each doing particular tasks and particular work. Our soldiers and their extended families should take some considerable comfort and great confidence from the fact that the Australian parliament is virtually unanimously supportive and committed to them and their sons and daughters engaged in our cause in Afghanistan. This is a most noble and legitimate cause and one which is and continues to be supported by both sides of the political divide in this country. It is a subject matter which is above partisan political politics, and I for one am greatly gratified by that and maintain that it should remain so.


There are extraordinarily large challenges for us in this particular theatre. The execution of this mandate is uniquely difficult in Afghanistan, and it was never for one single minute going to be easy. Afghanistan has a troubled and volatile history, with a disparate, semitribal society, geographically separated by an impossible natural topography of very, very high mountains running into deep, fertile valleys. It is a land of rough and underdeveloped roads, very limited communications infra­structure and few developed governmental administrative institutions. It was, in short, an ideal country for a safe haven for an international terrorist network.


Our mission there is an evolving one as we improve the capability of the Afghan National Army and the Afghan security forces, including police. As we assist in the establishment of governance of various qualities in each of the provinces, we are providing mentoring that is moving towards self-reliance and towards Afghan command. Indeed, I pause to say that some 10 of our forward operating bases in Afghanistan are now under exclusive Afghan command. That is a significant step forward, a step in the right direction.


We have participated in the preparation and training of the Afghan National Army in the removal of IEDs, improvised explosive devices, and in the location and destruction of caches of weapons, ammunition and bomb-making equipment. Further to all of this is training in the disruption of the narcotics trade and the cutting of the flow of money from such trade. As part of our commitment we have also deployed some 20 officers of the Australian Federal Police to mentor and train police officers for Afghanistan. I congratulate each and every one of those 20 Australian Federal Police officers on the fabulous work they are doing in our name.


Progress has been slow and not without difficulty, but there has been some signifi­cant progress. In education there are seven million students, of whom approximately three million are girls. There are now more children receiving an education than ever before in the country's history—and, importantly, more girls than ever before. The Australian Greens might see this as a positive.


Since 2001 there has been a 26 per cent decline in mortality in children under five years of age. The Australian Greens might see this as a positive. Millions of Afghans have benefited from ISAF water and sanitation programs. Again, the Greens might see this as a positive.


There have been two recent national elections. There was a presidential ballot with a voter turnout of 1.26 million voters, some 30 per cent of the voting population. The next was a general election on 18 September 2010, with 406 candidates out of 3,000 being women—16 per cent were females—and with a turnout of 4.33 million people, of whom 1.77 million were women. The Greens might see that as a positive.


In recent years, the economic growth of Afghanistan has been averaging, year in, year out, about 11 per cent. There has been the construction of around 10,000 kilometres of paved roads within the country. People can move around the country, and there are an ever-increasing number of cars on the roads. These are positive, positive things happening in the country due to our role and the role of our ISAF partners. The Australian Defence Force has provided reconstruction teams of engineers and other technical skills to build schools, to construct and run health clinics and for trade training. There have been many, many successes, with local markets and other commerce beginning to flourish.


I pause to mention the most recent success—that is, our great ally the United States firstly locating the architect of so much of the world's recent terrorist history and then bringing Osama bin Laden to the justice he charted for himself in his own evil. This was a very successful operation which was executed with professionalism and great skill. I am someone who believes that, following the demise of this man, the world can rest just a little bit easier in terms of the terrorist threat. A great blow has been struck against terrorism, with no casualties. This event is truly one of the successes that ISAF and, particularly, the United States have had in Afghanistan, and I for one want to thank the Navy Seals and all of the personnel involved in this achievement. It was a wonderful victory and a wonderful symbol for justice, given what we have seen, particularly in the last decade, in terms of international terrorism.


I turn now to Pakistan. Pakistan has had significant issues with the Taliban following their flight from Afghanistan into the Swat Valley in particular. It is trite to say but it is obvious there can be no regional security around Afghanistan without the commitment of its neighbours to peace and stability. Pakistan must do more to isolate the Taliban in the region. Counter-terrorism in this region must be at the very forefront of priority policy considerations. Pakistan would serve its own best interests if it were to do more to secure its border with Afghanistan and prevent the supply of weapons, ammunition and explosive material to the Taliban. Pakistan has been through a lot. It feels threatened, but it must do more to arrest the flow of weapons and explosives to the Taliban and into Afghanistan.


To put Australia's contribution into context, 1,550 Australian Defence Force personnel have been deployed into Afghanistan. Currently, the United States has more than 90,000 troops in Afghanistan and the United Kingdom has 9,500 out of a total of 130,638 ISAF troops. We rely upon our partners and particularly the United States for capability, enablers, air support, heli­copters and logistics generally. To that extent, our destiny in Afghanistan is subject to the timing and resolve of ISAF member states with a greater commitment than ours, particularly the United States. All of us agree that our people should not be there for one minute longer than is necessary. There is, however, no capacity for us to be half-committed to this mission. We have paid too high a price to be half-hearted or wavering. Having said that, there is no blank cheque here. All ISAF members want to see the job done and an appropriate level of self-reliance in indigenous capacity as soon as possible. Everyone is diligently pursuing that end. We want to get out as soon as possible.


I turn to the men and women of our Australian Defence Force. They have performed in this theatre magnificently, as difficult as it has been. They have been totally committed to the task, a task that we all have agreed is in the national interest. There have been extreme hardships and great tragedies, immense loss and miraculous survivals. Through it all, our soldiers have achieved great success, often in the most difficult of circumstances, from searing heat to subzero temperatures in remote locations for extended periods on combat rations. We at home have all become familiar with the Bushmaster—an Australian made and designed vehicle that has seen over 50 destroyed through IEDs and mine detonations, with not one loss of life. This is a truly great achievement for the Australian Defence Force and for the Australian manufacturing industry. Over 50 have been blown up, each with a number of personnel inside, and no-one has died. Our special forces, who have been called upon to conduct operations right around Afghanistan, have done so with great distinction. In this place previously I have cited many of their achievements, commendations and medals that have been awarded. We have been relatively small in number in Afghanistan but have made a significant contribution to making things better for the population of that country. The Australian Defence Force can take great pride in its achievement in Afghanistan.


While we have achieved much, the parliament continues to reserve the right to raise issues about combat clothing and equipment, about the quality of food and about the quality of flights to and from the MEAO. It is not too much to ask that our soldiers in Tarin Kowt have good food, that their combat clothing is fit for purpose and that when we fly them from Brisbane, Townsville, Sydney or Darwin into the MEAO we do so in quality aircraft. To that end, it is clear that we have an issue with the time that we are permitted to retain prisoners—96 hours is obviously insuffi­cient, particularly in comparison to the practice of the United States and the United Kingdom. It appears that we secure these suspects or combatants, as the case may be, at considerable risk to our own personnel, only to see them released in that 96-hour period to rejoin the fight. This is unacceptable. I call upon the Minister for Defence to fix this in line with the wishes of our people. When we travel to the MEAO our people tell us this is not working. So I say: come on, Minister, fix this—it is not difficult.


We have sustained, as I have said, 32 losses, and I have attended more than 20 funerals. No words suffice in talking of those killed in action or of those wounded in action. To the families, the wives, the girlfriends, the mothers and fathers, brothers and sisters and sons and daughters: I am in admiration of the selfless sacrifice of their loved ones and of themselves. Those that we have lost shall never be forgotten. It is inadequate but I shall simply say a sincere thankyou to them.

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2011-11-21,"



Senator LUDLAM
 (Western Australia) (20:22):  I would also like to add my comments to those of my colleagues and acknowledge the 32 Australian soldiers who travelled to Afghanistan and did not return; the 213 wounded Australian service men and women who, unlike those who died in the line of duty in Afghanistan, are acknow­ledged in this place too rarely and have become the forgotten victims of the war; the more than 2,700 coalition casualties in this war that has now lasted longer than the first and second world wars combined; the nearly 9,000 civilian dead in Afghanistan over the last four years alone; and the 320,000 Afghan civilians displaced because of a war that they did not ask for. In particular I want to pay tribute to those who flee, those who take the extraordinarily risky and dangerous journey that was not of their choosing and those who manage after a difficult journey filled with many dangers to reach Australian shores. I hope that we can acknowledge in the course of this debate that the least we can do to cope with the consequences of a war that we helped initiate on the other side of the world is look after those who flee from it.


We heard Senator Abetz, when he opened the debate, say real progress is being made. I wonder how many government and coalition senators in the course of this debate simply dusted off the same speeches that they gave earlier this year or speeches that they might have given five years ago and just read them in again, because the justifications do not appear to have changed and the platitudes do not appear to have changed—'real progress is being made'. Perhaps we can add that 2011 is going to be the decisive year in the conduct of this war, until we go back and look at what military officials have been saying about the Afghan conflict since the beginning. In 2004 General Barno said 'Without question this is a decisive year in Afghanistan.' In 2005 General Abuzaid said, 'I think this can be the decisive year.' In 2006 General Richards said, 'This will be the crunch year for the Taliban.' Guido Westerwelle, who is the German Minister for Foreign Affairs, said '2011 will be the decisive year.' David Miliband, the UK foreign minister, said it last year. General McChrystal said in 2008, 'We are knee deep in the decisive year.' When exactly will this conflict be decided?


It is good for the MPs who speak in favour of this war because you will find, as I and my colleagues on the crossbenches have discovered, that if you oppose this war as an elected Australian parliamentarian there is nothing you can do about it in here. These decisions are made by the executive, not by the parliamentarians. It is wonderful that Senator Johnston, who has taken a keen interest as shadow spokesperson in these issues for many years, is dealing with the issues of clothing, food, airlift and so on. But if he one day realises that this war is pure folly, as we believe it is, there will not be a thing that he can do about it because these parliamentarians, our colleagues on both sides of this house, do not have the power. The decision is made by the Prime Minister and the executive.


I believe, as many of my colleagues do and as the Australian Democrats before us did, that that needs to change, as it has in most other modern democracies. The parliament is not called on to make the strategic decisions about the conduct of the war or the tactical decisions that govern the fighting from day to day, but the political decision about whether we should be there in the first place and when is an appropriate time to leave should be made by those who have to look our constituents in the eye. I wonder how politicians who have spoken so far in both chambers in this debate look in the eye the 64 per cent or thereabouts of Australians who think they have had enough and that this should in fact be concluded. Sixty-four per cent of Australians—twice as many as it was over the last couple of years—have realised as this war simmered away in the background that in fact the death toll is higher every year. If things are going so well, as we have heard this evening, how come the death toll and the toll of wounded, in particular the toll of injury and death from those who we are meant to be supporting, is now much greater than before? Why are our allies killing us in Afghanistan? It is because we are not wanted there. When I hear Senator Abetz or others say that real progress is being made, I cannot help but wonder: progress towards what? Senator Abetz talks about the importance of sacrifices being made and I wonder: sacrifices by who exactly?


The context is that the Dutch have left and many other countries with whom we shared the enormous burdens of our service men and women in Afghanistan have either gone or have had debates that had more teeth than the one we are experiencing tonight, and have experienced over the course of the last year or two in this parliament, and chosen to go. They have had enough. We realise of course that perhaps you could be forgiven for thinking that Oruzgan is the whole of the country and that, if Australia takes care of our little patch, continues to build trust, continues to build schools and infrastructure and continues to do the best we can to keep people safe, somehow the situation is unfolding in a like way around the country. Of course, that is not the case. The United States government is in the process now of contemplating a major shift of posture which will take them exactly to where the Soviets were. They will be moving people out of Oruzgan and they will be concentrating on population centres and major road and transport corridors in Helmand, Kandahar and in Kabul, which is what the Soviet Union did—try and hold the big cities, try and hold the infrastructure and let the country cope as best it can. That is what is happening here. As Australian parliamen­tarians we need to realise that the war is about to enter an extremely dangerous phase. This talk of progress being made is illusory.


Why, you might wonder, 2014? That is the date we heard when President Obama addressed this parliament last week. It was a remarkably uncritical address that canvassed the fact that, with Afghanistan and Iraq out of the way, the United States can shift its assets to the Asia-Pacific region and continue peace-building initiatives in our corner of the world. But really, why 2014? I have not heard any analysis in any corner of the debate here in Australia. There has certainly been no mention of it tonight. I wonder whether it has anything at all to do with the fact that it is the year the trans-Afghanistan pipeline is due to be completed, which for the first time will get gas from Central Asia to India and to the coast without recourse to Russia or former Soviet satellite states. That was something that the US government was in the middle of negotiating with the Taliban before the Taliban hitched their wagon to Osama bin Laden. Before the horrific attacks on New York City and Washington the US government was quite happily negotiating with the Taliban over access rights for that pipeline. That appears to have suffered a 10-year hiatus, but I am informed that everything is now on track for completion in 2014. Isn't that an extraordinary coincidence? What are we really there for?


We discover again the enormous value of the whistleblowers, publishers and journalists involved in the WikiLeaks organisation and those news organisations around the world that have chosen to publish material that shows what our leaders really think is very different to what we hear in contexts like this—that is, that there is enormous pessimism in NATO forces and Western capitals around the world. But of course this is not allowed to seep through to the public because the polls are bad enough as it is.


A number of MPs have mentioned women, Senator Johnston in particular. It is wonderful to hear the plight of women used as the justification for a military invasion and it is good that people care about such things. But we know that Afghanistan is now the most dangerous place in the world to be a woman because that survey has been done. The aid agencies working inside Afghanistan know this very well. In June this year a Trust Law report found that violence, dismal health care and brutal poverty make Afghanistan the world's most dangerous country for women. Ten years after the first bombers and the first ground forces went in it is the most dangerous country for women overall and the worst in three of six risk categories of health, non-sexual violence and lack of access to economic resources. I am dusting off some older material from a speech that I read earlier this year because it does not seem to be getting through.


I do not want hear these justifications or these extraordinary platitudes by people on the other side of the world in safe offices that if we just stay the job will get done. An extraordinary American peace activist, Kathy Kelly, who put herself on the front line—she was in Baghdad for 'shock and awe' and she has spent a huge amount of time in Afghanistan talking to people—has said:


One way to stop the next war is to continue to tell the truth about this one.


That is what the Australian Greens will continue to do until it is over.

"Feeney, Sen David",ALP,2011-11-21,"



Senator FEENEY
 (Victoria—Parliamentary Secretary for Defence) (20:31):  It is appropriate that as Parliamen­tary Secretary for Defence I make some comments in this very important debate. This morning the Prime Minister made a very forthright statement about our commitment in Afghanistan in the House of Repre­sentatives. She set out very clearly our mission in that country and why it is necessary that we complete that mission before we withdraw our forces. She also spoke frankly about the high price that we as a nation are paying as part of that commitment, of the 32 members of our defence forces who have given their lives in Afghanistan and of the now over 200 personnel who have been wounded there. She said with great feeling—and that is, of course, a feeling that all of us in this place share—it is a grave thing for a government to ask the young men and women of a nation's armed forces to put their lives at risk and no government should do so without a just objective, a clear objective and an attainable objective.


Those of us who hold government office need to examine our consciences before we make any such commitment. War is evil, but sometimes war is the lesser of two evils. A war that meets certain conditions can perhaps be regarded as a just war. To my mind, on reflecting on this, I think these conditions are: firstly, that the damage inflicted by the aggressor is lasting, grave and certain; secondly, that all other means of putting an end to aggression have been ineffective; thirdly, that there are serious prospects of success; and, fourthly, that the use of arms will not produce evils worse than the evil that is to be eliminated. I believe that our commitment in Afghanistan meets all four of these conditions.


The war in Afghanistan results from the complicity of the Taliban regime with the terrorist attacks of September 11 in 2001. The damage caused by the Taliban and al-Qaeda both to the international community and to the people of Afghanistan certainly has been lasting, grave and certain. The decision of the US and its allies to intervene in Afghanistan was taken only after the refusal of the Taliban, under the regime of Mullah Omar, to hand over those responsible for those attacks. They were, of course, being harboured in Afghanistan. We have heard from Senator Faulkner about how it is that this conflict in Afghanistan as a consequence of those beginnings has been a UN mandated activity.


The prospects for success in Afghanistan are, in my opinion, very good, although the government has never pretended that achieving success would be quick or easy. We need to ask ourselves what we mean by success. I would define success not in the simple military sense of defeating the enemy but as the creation of a situation in which the people of Afghanistan can defend themselves against attempts by the Taliban to regain power. That means that there must, in the end, be a political settlement. But a settlement is a very different thing to a surrender. Whilst the use of arms always produces evils, such as death, injury and destruction, I have no doubt that even greater evils would result if we were to withdraw now and expose the people of Afghanistan to the heightened risk of the Taliban returning to power and Afghanistan once again becoming a safe haven for al-Qaeda and similar terrorist groups.


While the task of achieving our mission in Afghanistan is certainly an arduous one and fraught with moral hazards, I have a clear conscience about advocating that we stick to the task we have set ourselves, which is working with our allies and the people of Oruzgan province to create a situation where they can live in peace and provide for their own security in a reasonable period of time. But I do wonder about how some other members of the Senate square their consciences with the positions they have taken in this debate and in similar debates in this place over the past few years. I think that those who have advocated our immediate withdrawal from Afghanistan either have failed to fully appreciate what the consequences of that would be for the people of Afghanistan or have somehow decided that their own political righteousness and their persistent hostility to the United States are more important than the fate of 29 million Afghans.


I noticed that in his remarks only a few moments ago Senator Ludlam again alluded to US conspiracy theories and the eternal search of US multinationals for greater resources. But of course Senator Bob Brown regularly points out to this Senate—and rightly so—that gay men are oppressed and victimised in various countries. Let us remember what is the fate of gay men in Afghanistan. I quote from a news story from 1998:


Two men were executed for sodomy in the western Afghanistan province of Herat, the Taleban-controlled Voice of Sharia announced March 23. Bismellah, age 22, and Abdul Sami, 18, had a wall bulldozed onto them in a traditional Islamic method of executions used only for sodomy convictions.


Those are the people who will return to power in Afghanistan if the Greens have their wish that we withdraw from there prematurely.


Senator Milne and Senator Hanson-Young both have strong views on the rights of women in various countries—again, rightly so. But have they really given thought to what would happen to the women and girls of Afghanistan if the Taliban were to return to power? Let me give them some idea. Under the Taliban, women were forced to wear the burqa in public, were not allowed to work and were not allowed to be educated after the age of eight. Women were not allowed to be treated by male doctors unless accompanied by a chaperone, which of course led to many illnesses remaining untreated or being inadequately treated. They faced public flogging and execution for violations of the Taliban's laws. The Taliban encouraged child marriage and forced marriage: Amnesty International has reported that 80 per cent of Afghan marriages were considered to be by force. Women were forbidden to ride bicycles or to ride in a taxi without a chaperone. Do Senator Milne and Senator Hanson-Young really want to return 10 million Afghan women and girls to such a regime? I recommend to them Time magazine of 29 July 2010, which featured on its cover a shocking photo of Aisha, an 18-year-old Afghan woman, who was sentenced by a Taliban commander to have her nose and ears cut off for fleeing her abusive in-laws, a consequence of one of the forced marriages which the Taliban mandate.


Senator Ludlam frequently brings cases of human rights violations in various countries to the attention of the Senate—and a good thing too. Perhaps he is not aware that under the Taliban advocating any religion other than Islam, even in a private conversation, was punishable by death, that Islamic prayer was compulsory and that those found not praying at appointed times or who were late attending prayer were punished by severe beatings. Perhaps he does not know that the Taliban outlawed music of all kinds, secular publishing of any kind, television sets, video cassettes, audio cassettes, satellite dishes and movies.


I do not pretend that all of these evils have been eradicated from Afghanistan in the 10 years since the Taliban were removed. As I said in my last remarks on this subject, in October, no-one ever said that Afghanistan would become a second Switzerland. Afghanistan is a poor country with a long and enduring history of violence and arbitrary government. (Quorum formed) There are of course wide cultural differences between Afghanistan and the Western world, and no doubt there always will be, but it is completely false to assert, as Senator Ludlam did in a speech here just last month, that there has been no progress in Afghanistan since the Taliban was removed from power.


Let me once again list some of the examples of that progress; I hope that those senators who think we should abandon the people of Afghanistan to their fate will take note. GDP growth has averaged 11 per cent since 2002 and was 22 per cent in 2009. This is the longest period of sustained economic growth in Afghanistan's modern history. Afghanistan of course is still a poor country, but it now has a functioning economy and good prospects for future development. Afghanistan had no effective financial system in 1991; today there are 14 banks in operation. As a result, Afghan expatriates can safely send money back to their families. In 2007 Afghanistan received some $3.3 billion in remissions income. School enrolment is at its highest in Afghanistan's history. Currently, there are approximately six million students in school, including two million girls. By contrast, under the Taliban there were 900,000 students enrolled in school, none of whom were girls. Basic health services, which were available to less than 10 per cent of the population under the Taliban, are now extended to around 85 per cent of Afghanistan's people. There has been a 22 per cent drop in infant mortality, which means that there are now 40,000 fewer infants dying than there were in the Taliban era. Ninety per cent of children were not inoculated against polio; today, that has changed. Almost 10,000 kilometres of rural roads have been rehabilitated, supporting the employment of hundreds of thousands of local workers. Under the Taliban there were virtually no private telephones in Afghanistan; today over two million people have mobile phones and that number is growing by an extraordinary 150,000 a month.


All of these things have brought real, concrete, measurable improvements to the lives of the ordinary people of Afghanistan. They did not happen by magic. They happened because the new government of Afghanistan, for all its many and very obvious failings, has worked with its international partners and donors to make them happen. These gains were made possible only by the continuing presence of the ISAF forces, including our own forces in Oruzgan province, and future gains are dependent on that presence to maintain security. That is why I do not think we should take the advice of Brigadier General Mohammad Zafar Khan and depart now, leaving our equipment behind. Putting aside the various questions that arise about maintenance, technical capacity and sustainment of such equipment, we must also remember that Australian forces in Afghanistan comprise less than one per cent of the total ISAF forces in the country. At 1,550 personnel, the Australian commitment is a small one. When we withdraw it will be in agreement with the Afghan government and with our ISAF partners. We do not need to understand that the Taliban have not changed their policies or their priorities. If they return to power they would reimpose the same barbaric reign of ignorance and fear that they imposed when they were in power from 1996 to 2001—a period that ended with the bombing of the World Trade towers in New York and the unleashing of a global conflict. 


I would like to think that it is not senators who argue we should withdraw from Afghanistan and then have to ask, 'Now what?' But I have to say that I have not heard any of them utter a word of concern for what would happen to the people of Afghanistan, and particularly the women of Afghanistan, if they had their way. All their considerable capacity for moral outrage seems to be focused on the US and its allies with none on the forces of reaction that we are fighting against. For them it seems the war in Afghanistan is 'a quarrel in a faraway country between people of whom we know nothing'. That is a quote from Neville Chamberlain and, yes, I do compare those who seek to appease the Taliban and al-Qaeda now to those who sought to appease fascism in the 1930s. I do not claim to understand this mentality, but I do understand its moral bankruptcy.

",Senate,<title>MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS</title>,<title>Afghanistan</title>,MINISTERIAL STATEMENTS,27,1
"Milne, Sen Christine",AG,2011-11-21,"



Senator MILNE
 (Tasmania—Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens) (20:46):  I rise tonight to make some comment as to why we should be withdrawing our troops from Afghanistan as a matter of urgency. The question that needs to be asked here is this: is it morally justifiable to lose more Australian lives in a military campaign that is unwinnable, in a situation where Afghanistan is likely to look much as it does today when, in a few years time, we eventually do as the Americans intend to do, and that is withdraw in 2014? Is it morally justifiable to lose more Australian lives in these circumstances?


I have been listening tonight to the kinds of contributions that just do not go to the detail of what is going on in Afghanistan. I have just heard Senator Feeney say that other people are not concerned as he is about Afghani lives. Is that so? I can tell you that there are currently 1.7 million to two million Afghani refugees in Pakistan. Next year, in 2012, they will lose their refugee status in Pakistan. That figure of 1.7 million to two million is probably an underestimate. Senator Feeney, who has just contributed in this debate, of course would not have those refugees come to Australia. Australia is quite happy to be engaged in a war in Afghanistan for all the reasons that he cites, but millions who are over the border will lose their status as refugees next year—and what then? What then about those Afghani people who have been forced to leave because of the dislocation, the war—all of the things that have been discussed and the atrocities that have gone on over many years? I heard from Senator Johnston tonight that this is a most noble and legitimate cause. Really, a noble and legitimate cause! And from the Prime Minister we have heard, 'We will complete our mission of training and transition.' What transition? I think it is about time we talked about what is really going on in Afghanistan as we speak.


I have heard Senator Abetz and now Senator Feeney both talk about the fact that there has been a whole explosion in cell phones in Afghanistan. According to the Washington Post, every evening the cell phone signals disappear in some portion of more than half the provinces in Afghanistan as the major carriers, under pressure from the Taliban, turn off their signal towers, effectively severing most of the connections to the rest of the world. Tactics like the cell phone offensive have allowed the Taliban to project their presence in far more insidious and sophisticated ways in 2011 using the instruments of modernity that they once shunned. The shut off sends a daily reminder to hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of Afghans that the Taliban still holds substantial sway over their future. It is just one part of a broader shift in Taliban strategy that is focused on intimidation, carefully chosen assassinations and limited, but spectacular, assaults. While often avoiding large-scale combat with NATO forces, the Taliban and their allies in the Haqqani network have effectively undermined peace talks and sought to pave the way for a gradual return to power as the American led forces begin scaling back military operations in the country. That is the fact of the matter. 


There is no way that Afghanistan is going to be significantly different in a few years time from what it is now. I go to the Haqqani network because we are told that the mission is to stop terrorism in Afghanistan—there must be no safe haven for terrorists in Afghanistan. That is quite right, except that we have got the Haqqani network now operative in Pakistan, with safe havens there, who come across the border into Afghanistan and are currently working with the Taliban in Afghanistan. The US Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, was there recently saying that we need a peace process that brings together the Taliban, the Haqqani network and the Karzai regime. Somehow, we are going to bring about peace in that regard. 


In addition to that, according to the Washington Post, we now have 'uncertainty gnawing at Afghans about the looming American withdrawal, while making the most of the insurgency's limited resources'. It goes on to talk about the recent United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan reporting on torture. Senator Feeney talked about the torture of children. Let me tell you: the torture of children is currently going on in facilities in Afghanistan with the allies we are working with, overseen by President Karzai's regime. We know from the United Nations report that suspects are hung by their hands, beaten with cables and in some cases their genitals are twisted until they lose consciousness in detention facilities run by the Afghan intelligence service and the Afghan National Police. This is according to a UN study released in October, as I said. The report found evidence of a 'compelling pattern and practice of systematic torture and ill-treatment' during interrogation in the accounts of nearly half of the detainees of the intelligence service known as the national directorate of intelligence who were interviewed by the UN researchers. The national police's ill-treatment of detainees was somewhat less severe and widespread, the report found.


The report pointed out that, even though the abusive practices are entrenched, the Afghan government does not condone torture and has explicitly said the abuses found by the United Nations are not government policy. They may not be government policy, but from the point of view of Afghani people what they can see is young people being rounded up, put into these centres and then tortured by the people who are supposed to be on the side of the Afghan people against the Taliban. It is no wonder that the Afghan people see an occupying force working with a corrupt Afghani government. And so we get to this point: is it true that training the Afghan army in Oruzgan will help build a stable, pro-Western Afghanistan? No, it will not.


I heard Senator Johnston talking about the elections that were held in Afghanistan, holding that up as some kind of progress in Afghanistan. But you just have to look at Transparency International's report that tracks government corruption around the globe. It ranks Afghanistan as the world's third most corrupt country, behind Somalia and Myanmar, or Burma. In the hundreds of diplomatic cables obtained by WikiLeaks and released in December 2010, Afghanistan emerges as a looking-glass land where bribery, extortion and embezzlement are the norm and the honest official is a distinct outlier. The widespread corruption is made possible in part by the largely unregulated banking infrastructure and the ancient system of money transfer that is the method of choice for politicians, insurgents and drug traffickers to move cash around the Muslim world. Mr Karzai won re-election in 2009, but he did it by completely rigging the election and the results were overturned not long after. Of course, then there was the assassination of his younger half-brother, who was assassinated by a person working with the US special forces and the CIA.


There is also graft and corruption from the opium trade. We have a situation where the report to congress only a month ago stated that millions of dollars have been siphoned out of Afghanistan from US aid—and no doubt Australian aid. I will be very interested to know what tracking we have for the aid money that we are spending and how much of it is leaving Afghanistan through illegal sources and going elsewhere. In fact, in the US case they are saying that people associated with the Karzai government have used the money to buy luxury mansions in Dubai, for example.


So the Afghan people see a force that is working with the corrupt Karzai government against their interests and their own young people are detained and tortured in centres run by the very people we are mentoring and working with. It is time we set a date to come out of Afghanistan. It is time we recognise that the situation is unwinnable. Other countries have withdrawn. Australia should be withdrawing its troops because it is unlikely that there will be significant shifts in such a corrupt regime. The question here is: how much better would it be if we were not an occupying force but rather assisting in a capacity other than as an occupier?

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2011-11-21,"



Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales) (20:57):  Before the break I was speaking on this amendment and the parliamentary secretary was making comments in relation to the current Leader of the Opposition during his time as Minister for Health and Ageing. She made some misleading comments and I want to correct the record. She was clearly reading from a script that had been written for her by Minister Roxon in what I can only describe as the usual spiteful and vitriolic diatribe we know Minister Roxon for. I will correct and refute the misleading comments that those opposite keep parroting about Tony Abbott's record when he was health minister.


The claim that funding for public hospitals decreased by $1 billion under the coalition government is false. It is wrong, it is misleading and it is a lie. The Australian government's funding for health, including public hospitals, increased significantly under the coalition government. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, Australian government expenditure on public hospitals increased every year, from approximately $5.2 billion in 1995-96 to over $12 billion in 2007-08. Annual spending on health and aged care by the Australian government more than doubled, from $19.5 billion in 1995-96 to $51.8 billion in 2007-08. Australian government funding to the states under the Australian Health Care Agreements was $42 billion between 2003 and 2008 compared to $31.7 billion between 1998 and 2003, and $23.4 billion between 1993 and 1998. The 2003-08 Australian Health Care Agreements provided a 17 per cent real increase in funding compared to the previous agreement.


The constant misrepresentation of this point by the Australian Labor Party is the sort of thing one expects from a government with a Prime Minister who went to the last election saying to the Australian public, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' That was an outright lie to the Australian public, so what else would one expect from this sort of government? It is not surprising that the parliamentary secretary was parroting misleading and wrong information. The government's claims are untrue.


In 2003, the coalition government provided an extra $10 billion for public hospitals in the Australian Health Care Agreements. Funding for public hospitals from 2003 was 83 per cent higher than under the previous Keating Labor government. A change in the growth rate of the Australian Health Care Agreements due to higher private health insurance coverage and other demographic changes was reflected in the forward estimates of 2003. However, public hospital expenditure continued to increase by 17 per cent in real terms in the 2003-08 Australian Health Care Agreements, contrary to the constant false accusations made by this government.


In relation to this, Parliamentary Secretary, I am correcting the record with respect to your misleading comments about Mr Abbott's record. If the parliamentary secretary does not believe what has been put on the record, I refer her to the statistics provided by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare to me and to other senators during the estimates process both at additional estimates in 2009 and on 10 February 2010. I particularly refer the parliamentary secretary to question E10-407, which provided information to me which I have already put on the record, and question E10-408, whereby documents in relation to this data were provided to me. Those documents have also been put on the record.


I really thought I should correct this situation, because it is typical of this government to constantly trumpet false and misleading information in relation to the time when Mr Abbott was health minister. Parliamentary Secretary, if you are going to come in here and give us this sort of diatribe, get your facts right. Your facts are drawn from what your government has put on the record and they are as I have stated—that is, your claims are absolutely and totally false, misleading and wrong, and it is a lie that funding for public hospitals decreased by $1 billion under the coalition government.


I now return to the coalition's amendment. I was talking about some of the evidence that Catholic Health Australia provided in relation to this. In his evidence to the committee, Mr Laverty pointed out issues pertinent to non-government owned providers of public hospital services and he stated:


... we have to account for capital, depreciation, insurances, council rates, long-service leave and information technology, even down to whether or not a Microsoft licence per user is applied to each cost of patient admission. Different states and territories use different accounting systems, which affects whether or not these various components will ultimately make their way into what is an efficient price. For an NGO provider of hospital services, all of these form the component of what is the price or the cost of delivering a service. Some states and territories account for these things differently; indeed, within states different areas at present can account for them differently.


Coalition senators believe that this experience and perspective should be reflected in the pricing authority legislation. In further evidence to the committee, Mr Laverty stated:


... we argue that the governance of this new authority should allow for the appointment to its board of someone who has experience in the delivery of NGO hospital services.


Just as clause 144 of the bill requires that at least one member of the authority has substantial knowledge or experience in the provision of health care in regional or rural areas, coalition senators support the submission of Catholic Health Australia that non-government hospitals should also be guaranteed representation.


I will now highlight in general terms some other aspects of this bill. Clearly, this bill does not match the rhetoric of the health minister and the former Prime Minister from the time the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority was first mooted. Whilst this new authority is supposed to set the national efficient price for each activity conducted in hospitals, that price will only be a guide to the Commonwealth's contribution to growth funding for public hospitals. As was pointed out in one of the submissions to the Senate inquiry, the bill needs to be understood for what it does not do. It does not set a nationally agreed public hospital payment. As Catholic Health stated:


It is therefore understood that whereas the authority will determine a national efficient price, it will remain a responsibility of state and territory governments to determine the actual amounts paid for hospital services. There may not be certainty on how much the states or territories will actually contribute.


So, as far as the states are concerned, the national efficient price that will be set by the pricing authority will only be advice. It will not be binding on them. The payments that the states make to their local hospital networks could be above or below that price—it is at their discretion—which will mean that all that rhetoric about ending the blame game means absolutely nothing. Australians were told that this grand hospital reform would end the blame game, but I point the Senate to the Bills Digest which says:


It is likely that debates about the adequacy of public hospital funding by each level of government will continue for some time.


That means all the hollow rhetoric about ending the blame game means absolutely nothing.


The COAG communique of April last year also had another commitment about the pricing authority that was to end the blame game. The communique makes reference to that, not that it is unexpected—another commitment that appears to have disappeared when this bill was finally brought before the parliament. I refer to the Bills Digest's assessment on this particular point. The digest says the bill empowers the pricing authority to investigate and define cost shifting and cross-border disputes, but then the digest says:


It is silent, however, on what actions jurisdictions must take if they are found to be complicit in either cost shifting or in a cross border dispute. In the event of a cross border dispute, the IHPA may provide advice to the Commonwealth about funding adjustments to relevant jurisdictions.


It goes on to say:


The Commonwealth has limited powers with regard to the operation and management of public hospitals and is unable to compel a jurisdiction to make payments to other jurisdictions or to alter their policy settings.


As the digest correctly points out, this would appear to undermine transparency and the extent to which these disputes can be resolved.


There we have it—empty rhetoric. The blame game will continue and there is nothing that can be done in relation to price shifting. Throughout this odyssey of grand reforms under both the Rudd and Gillard governments, all these measures have been trumpeted to the public as increasing transparency, accountability and all sorts of things. It is very clear that the stakeholders do not agree with this. Throughout the submissions this perceived lack of both transparency and accountability of the pricing authority was very evident. For example, the Australian Private Hospitals Association in its submission says:


APHA believes these provisions fall a long way short of the practice of the board of the Reserve Bank of releasing its decisions and its monthly minutes publicly with no prior commitment by the executive.


So, when making the comparison with other disclosure regimes, it is very clear that this authority falls short.


The other main concern in the submissions was the burden of compliance on hospitals. The Heath Care and Hospitals Association—the peak body of public hospitals, which will be affected by the pricing authority—warned in its submission that the government must take care because the authority's decisions would have immediate and wide impacts on hospital services. In my previous comments, I mentioned duplication or even triplication. As the Australian Institute for Primary Care and Ageing stated:


There is very little integration between the statutory bodies. There is a risk of duplication or even triplication, which could create a significant burden for health services. Their isolation from each other is counterproductive.


These are comments which the coalition certainly agrees with. (Time expired)

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2011-11-21,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria) (21:12):  I rise to speak against the coalition amendment to the National Health Reform Amendment (Independent Hospital Pricing Authority) Bill 2011. The Australian Greens certainly understand the reasons for the coalition suggesting that someone of significant standing, experience or knowledge in the provision of services in non-government hospitals be included as a member of the pricing authority. We also accept that the regional and rural health community has been acknowledged as another area of expertise. In fact, there is a requirement for someone with that background to be included as a member of the pricing authority.


We are worried that with this amendment we are starting to become very prescriptive about the make-up of the pricing authority. There are a number of other groups that could potentially be included. We know that there are people with clinical expertise—surgeons, anaesthetists, nurses and so on—who would have a legitimate claim to be included to make sure that we have somebody with clinical experience as part of the pricing authority. We could go further and suggest that somebody who has significant experience in the field of health economics be included as well.


For that reason, we believe that the regional and rural health community, which has already been acknowledged, be the limit to which we prescribe the particular expertise, skills and experience on the pricing authority. It should be restricted to that group only. We certainly understand the reasons for wanting to include additional groups. It is reasonable, when determining the make-up of the authority, that consideration be given to people with experience in the non-government hospital sector, but we do not think it is the role of this bill to list those specific areas. As I said earlier, there are a number of other areas that we would also need to consider if we were going to go down that track. For that reason we have decided that we will not support the coalition's amendment.

It makes good sense to support the amendment moved by Senator Fierravanti-Wells on behalf of the coalition. I think it is quite reasonable that there should be at least one person at the pricing authority who has substantial experience and knowledge and significant standing in the private hospital system.


Some time ago in relation to the Medicare levy surcharge—three years ago, although it seems longer—the government, as part of the negotiations for my support, agreed to a comprehensive study by the Productivity Commission on the comparative efficiencies between private and public hospitals systems. That was a very good exercise and the Productivity Commission produced a lot of useful information. It underscored where there would be unanimity in relation to that report and it underscored the importance of having both a robust public health system and a robust private health system, and the interaction between the two, to get the best possible outcome for health consumers, for the people of Australia. I note the figures given by Senator Fierravanti-Wells. Some 43 per cent of hospital beds relate to the private system. I think it would be remiss of us not to have a representative of the private hospital sector on such a pricing authority. If it is to be truly independent, truly inclusive and truly representative, this amendment ought to be supported and I do so.

Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers) (21:17):  The government do not support the amendment proposed by the opposition, as we do not believe that it would enhance the provisions of the bill. Currently there is a provision for one member to have rural and regional experience with flexibility for other members agreed between the states and territories and the Commonwealth to ensure a variety of experience and expertise for the membership. The Council of Australian Governments has already announced the chair and the deputy chair of the IHPA. The chair will be Mr Shane Solomon, who gained experience in the provision of public hospital services from non-government operators when he was the group chief executive officer of Mercy Health and Aged Care Victoria.


While other appointments are under consideration by COAG, the government expects at least one other member to have the experience the opposition seeks. That has been explained to the office of the shadow health minister. While we agree with the outcome the opposition is seeking, we see no reason to diverge from the National Health Reform Agreement in this case. The way the amendment is drafted would potentially include a person with purely private hospital experience in the definition of membership, even though they are not covered by the authority and have very different pricing models from public hospitals. Private and NGO operated public hospitals will be able to and will be encouraged to direct their recommendations direct to the authority during the public consultation.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2011-11-21,"



Senator EGGLESTON
 (Western Australia) (21:19):  It is very important that we recognise the need for different kinds of experienced people on this pricing authority board. We have heard already in the course of this debate that there will be somebody with regional and rural experience. People who have anything to do with medicine know that regional and rural hospitals are different kinds of places from the big metropolitan hospitals, especially the big public hospitals. If recognition has been given to the fact that there is a need for somebody with regional and rural experience on this pricing authority board, we really have to think also about the need, as the Catholic Health Australia spokesman Martin Laverty has said, for someone who has operating experience in the private hospital sector.


Private hospitals are very different from public hospitals. Public hospitals work on public money, obviously, which is not accounted for in the same way as is money in a private hospital. Martin Laverty, CEO of Catholic Health Australia, made the point that the Catholic hospital system represents about 10 per cent of hospital beds in Australia, amounting to something like 2,700 Catholic hospital beds, mostly on the east coast but very strongly represented in Western Australia where we have two St John of God hospitals which are major, very large private hospitals in the metropolitan area, one in Subiaco and a new one south of the river in Murdoch. There is also St Anne's hospital, formerly the Mercy Hospital and another big Catholic hospital. St John of God has hospitals in the major regional centres of Western Australia in Bunbury, Geraldton and Kalgoorlie. So St John of God is a major hospital provider. Its funding models and business models are quite different to those of the public hospital system, where there is obviously a bigger flow of money coming in.


Private hospitals have to account for capital depreciation, insurance, council rates, long service leave, information technology—even down to whether or not a Microsoft licence per user is applied to the cost of each patient's admission—because the private hospital system requires cost accountability, which really is not an issue in a government run system. There are very different considerations when you come to the private system and, given that, the case for having a person on the board with private hospital, private sector, experience is very hard to argue with. In the end, in the private sector every cost has to be recovered. You have to work out each individual item of cost within the whole system because in the end that cost has to be recovered in the fees charged to the patients. That requires a different approach altogether. You cannot just assume that some things will be 'given', that some services will be provided because they always are in a big government hospital. In the private system they are not. You have to think of the cost of every towel by a basin, every needle and every syringe, the cost of electricity for the use of electrical goods within a hospital—it all has to be accounted for.


The entire approach in a private sector operation is very different to that in a government sector operation, where people are less concerned about costs. They probably should be more concerned but, because it is a government operation, nobody bothers too much about the use of power or the provision of drugs, dressings and supplies, which can be done in a fairly easygoing way. The cost of the nursing staff required to support a surgeon in an operation is not taken into consideration as much, in the sense that the cost is borne by the government and it does not have to be accounted for in the same way. In the private sector, just as in any other private business, every item of cost has to be considered in terms of the ultimate unit cost to the patient. It is a very different approach.


For that reason the coalition's proposition that there be a person on this board who has private sector experience is one that, in terms of simple common sense, is very hard to argue against. These hospitals are major organisations incurring, day by day, very high costs, and in the end it has to be brought down to a unit cost for an individual patient for their day in the hospital. I strongly support this coalition amendment and trust that the committee will find it does as well.

Senator XENOPHON:
  I will not engage in a debate, because time is incredibly short. Can I indicate that I have an amendment on file, one that has been recirculated, that I propose to move in two parts. There are two parts to the amendment. One says that the pricing authority must not report publicly unless a period of 30 days has elapsed since a report has been given to the minister or, if the report has not been given to the minister and each state and territory health minister, a period of three months has elapsed since the report was completed. I will not seek to divide on that. I understand I do not have support for it.


The other part, which I will be dividing on, says that, if a report is given to the minister, the report contains one or more recommendations and the minister does not agree to adopt one or more of the recommendations, the minister must publish on the internet his or her reasons for not adopting the recommendation or recommendations. The reason I will move this is that the minister, in the second reading speech to the bill, said:


The Authority will have strong independent powers: it will be for public hospitals what the independent Reserve Bank is for monetary policy. This is unprecedented for the public hospital system. 


The result will be a thorough and rigorous determination without fear or favour to Governments. The Government is confident that the Authority will provide the health system with the stability and robustness that the Reserve Bank has provided for monetary policy for decades.


If that is the case, let it be truly independent; let it be properly transparent. If the minister does not agree with any or all of the recommendations, the minister ought to give the reasons for doing so, given that we are setting up this truly independent body akin to the Reserve Bank in its robust independence. This amendment relates to transparency. The reasons for a recommendation not being supported, not being adopted by the minister, ought to be given by the minister. I think what I am proposing is an important transparency and accountability mechanism.


I do note that both the coalition and the Australian Greens supported an amendment to the Australian National Preventive Health Agency Bill 2010 which said the CEO of that organisation:


… must cause a copy of any advice given or recommendations made in undertaking the CEO’s functions … to be published on the … web site within 12 months of providing the advice or making the recommendations.


That is not quite the same as this recommendation but is similar in spirit and similar in terms of the process of transparency and accountability. I think that if we are setting up these bodies there ought to be some transparency and accountability. The minister of the day ought to give reasons why any recommendations are not followed through. That is why I urge my colleagues to seriously consider this amendment. It is consistent with the amendment supported by the coalition and the Greens on 17 November 2010, just over a year ago.

Senator FIERRAVANTI-WELLS
 (New South Wales) (20:57):  Before the break I was speaking on this amendment and the parliamentary secretary was making comments in relation to the current Leader of the Opposition during his time as Minister for Health and Ageing. She made some misleading comments and I want to correct the record. She was clearly reading from a script that had been written for her by Minister Roxon in what I can only describe as the usual spiteful and vitriolic diatribe we know Minister Roxon for. I will correct and refute the misleading comments that those opposite keep parroting about Tony Abbott's record when he was health minister.


The claim that funding for public hospitals decreased by $1 billion under the coalition government is false. It is wrong, it is misleading and it is a lie. The Australian government's funding for health, including public hospitals, increased significantly under the coalition government. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, Australian government expenditure on public hospitals increased every year, from approximately $5.2 billion in 1995-96 to over $12 billion in 2007-08. Annual spending on health and aged care by the Australian government more than doubled, from $19.5 billion in 1995-96 to $51.8 billion in 2007-08. Australian government funding to the states under the Australian Health Care Agreements was $42 billion between 2003 and 2008 compared to $31.7 billion between 1998 and 2003, and $23.4 billion between 1993 and 1998. The 2003-08 Australian Health Care Agreements provided a 17 per cent real increase in funding compared to the previous agreement.


The constant misrepresentation of this point by the Australian Labor Party is the sort of thing one expects from a government with a Prime Minister who went to the last election saying to the Australian public, 'There will be no carbon tax under a government I lead.' That was an outright lie to the Australian public, so what else would one expect from this sort of government? It is not surprising that the parliamentary secretary was parroting misleading and wrong information. The government's claims are untrue.


In 2003, the coalition government provided an extra $10 billion for public hospitals in the Australian Health Care Agreements. Funding for public hospitals from 2003 was 83 per cent higher than under the previous Keating Labor government. A change in the growth rate of the Australian Health Care Agreements due to higher private health insurance coverage and other demographic changes was reflected in the forward estimates of 2003. However, public hospital expenditure continued to increase by 17 per cent in real terms in the 2003-08 Australian Health Care Agreements, contrary to the constant false accusations made by this government.


In relation to this, Parliamentary Secretary, I am correcting the record with respect to your misleading comments about Mr Abbott's record. If the parliamentary secretary does not believe what has been put on the record, I refer her to the statistics provided by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare to me and to other senators during the estimates process both at additional estimates in 2009 and on 10 February 2010. I particularly refer the parliamentary secretary to question E10-407, which provided information to me which I have already put on the record, and question E10-408, whereby documents in relation to this data were provided to me. Those documents have also been put on the record.


I really thought I should correct this situation, because it is typical of this government to constantly trumpet false and misleading information in relation to the time when Mr Abbott was health minister. Parliamentary Secretary, if you are going to come in here and give us this sort of diatribe, get your facts right. Your facts are drawn from what your government has put on the record and they are as I have stated—that is, your claims are absolutely and totally false, misleading and wrong, and it is a lie that funding for public hospitals decreased by $1 billion under the coalition government.


I now return to the coalition's amendment. I was talking about some of the evidence that Catholic Health Australia provided in relation to this. In his evidence to the committee, Mr Laverty pointed out issues pertinent to non-government owned providers of public hospital services and he stated:


... we have to account for capital, depreciation, insurances, council rates, long-service leave and information technology, even down to whether or not a Microsoft licence per user is applied to each cost of patient admission. Different states and territories use different accounting systems, which affects whether or not these various components will ultimately make their way into what is an efficient price. For an NGO provider of hospital services, all of these form the component of what is the price or the cost of delivering a service. Some states and territories account for these things differently; indeed, within states different areas at present can account for them differently.


Coalition senators believe that this experience and perspective should be reflected in the pricing authority legislation. In further evidence to the committee, Mr Laverty stated:


... we argue that the governance of this new authority should allow for the appointment to its board of someone who has experience in the delivery of NGO hospital services.


Just as clause 144 of the bill requires that at least one member of the authority has substantial knowledge or experience in the provision of health care in regional or rural areas, coalition senators support the submission of Catholic Health Australia that non-government hospitals should also be guaranteed representation.


I will now highlight in general terms some other aspects of this bill. Clearly, this bill does not match the rhetoric of the health minister and the former Prime Minister from the time the Independent Hospital Pricing Authority was first mooted. Whilst this new authority is supposed to set the national efficient price for each activity conducted in hospitals, that price will only be a guide to the Commonwealth's contribution to growth funding for public hospitals. As was pointed out in one of the submissions to the Senate inquiry, the bill needs to be understood for what it does not do. It does not set a nationally agreed public hospital payment. As Catholic Health stated:


It is therefore understood that whereas the authority will determine a national efficient price, it will remain a responsibility of state and territory governments to determine the actual amounts paid for hospital services. There may not be certainty on how much the states or territories will actually contribute.


So, as far as the states are concerned, the national efficient price that will be set by the pricing authority will only be advice. It will not be binding on them. The payments that the states make to their local hospital networks could be above or below that price—it is at their discretion—which will mean that all that rhetoric about ending the blame game means absolutely nothing. Australians were told that this grand hospital reform would end the blame game, but I point the Senate to the Bills Digest which says:


It is likely that debates about the adequacy of public hospital funding by each level of government will continue for some time.


That means all the hollow rhetoric about ending the blame game means absolutely nothing.


The COAG communique of April last year also had another commitment about the pricing authority that was to end the blame game. The communique makes reference to that, not that it is unexpected—another commitment that appears to have disappeared when this bill was finally brought before the parliament. I refer to the Bills Digest's assessment on this particular point. The digest says the bill empowers the pricing authority to investigate and define cost shifting and cross-border disputes, but then the digest says:


It is silent, however, on what actions jurisdictions must take if they are found to be complicit in either cost shifting or in a cross border dispute. In the event of a cross border dispute, the IHPA may provide advice to the Commonwealth about funding adjustments to relevant jurisdictions.


It goes on to say:


The Commonwealth has limited powers with regard to the operation and management of public hospitals and is unable to compel a jurisdiction to make payments to other jurisdictions or to alter their policy settings.


As the digest correctly points out, this would appear to undermine transparency and the extent to which these disputes can be resolved.


There we have it—empty rhetoric. The blame game will continue and there is nothing that can be done in relation to price shifting. Throughout this odyssey of grand reforms under both the Rudd and Gillard governments, all these measures have been trumpeted to the public as increasing transparency, accountability and all sorts of things. It is very clear that the stakeholders do not agree with this. Throughout the submissions this perceived lack of both transparency and accountability of the pricing authority was very evident. For example, the Australian Private Hospitals Association in its submission says:


APHA believes these provisions fall a long way short of the practice of the board of the Reserve Bank of releasing its decisions and its monthly minutes publicly with no prior commitment by the executive.


So, when making the comparison with other disclosure regimes, it is very clear that this authority falls short.


The other main concern in the submissions was the burden of compliance on hospitals. The Heath Care and Hospitals Association—the peak body of public hospitals, which will be affected by the pricing authority—warned in its submission that the government must take care because the authority's decisions would have immediate and wide impacts on hospital services. In my previous comments, I mentioned duplication or even triplication. As the Australian Institute for Primary Care and Ageing stated:


There is very little integration between the statutory bodies. There is a risk of duplication or even triplication, which could create a significant burden for health services. Their isolation from each other is counterproductive.


These are comments which the coalition certainly agrees with. (Time expired)

"Di Natale, Sen Richard",AG,2011-11-21,"



Senator DI NATALE
 (Victoria) (21:12):  I rise to speak against the coalition amendment to the National Health Reform Amendment (Independent Hospital Pricing Authority) Bill 2011. The Australian Greens certainly understand the reasons for the coalition suggesting that someone of significant standing, experience or knowledge in the provision of services in non-government hospitals be included as a member of the pricing authority. We also accept that the regional and rural health community has been acknowledged as another area of expertise. In fact, there is a requirement for someone with that background to be included as a member of the pricing authority.


We are worried that with this amendment we are starting to become very prescriptive about the make-up of the pricing authority. There are a number of other groups that could potentially be included. We know that there are people with clinical expertise—surgeons, anaesthetists, nurses and so on—who would have a legitimate claim to be included to make sure that we have somebody with clinical experience as part of the pricing authority. We could go further and suggest that somebody who has significant experience in the field of health economics be included as well.


For that reason, we believe that the regional and rural health community, which has already been acknowledged, be the limit to which we prescribe the particular expertise, skills and experience on the pricing authority. It should be restricted to that group only. We certainly understand the reasons for wanting to include additional groups. It is reasonable, when determining the make-up of the authority, that consideration be given to people with experience in the non-government hospital sector, but we do not think it is the role of this bill to list those specific areas. As I said earlier, there are a number of other areas that we would also need to consider if we were going to go down that track. For that reason we have decided that we will not support the coalition's amendment.

Senator XENOPHON
 (South Australia) (21:15):  I indicate that I will be supporting the coalition's amendment. It makes good sense to support the amendment moved by Senator Fierravanti-Wells on behalf of the coalition. I think it is quite reasonable that there should be at least one person at the pricing authority who has substantial experience and knowledge and significant standing in the private hospital system.


Some time ago in relation to the Medicare levy surcharge—three years ago, although it seems longer—the government, as part of the negotiations for my support, agreed to a comprehensive study by the Productivity Commission on the comparative efficiencies between private and public hospitals systems. That was a very good exercise and the Productivity Commission produced a lot of useful information. It underscored where there would be unanimity in relation to that report and it underscored the importance of having both a robust public health system and a robust private health system, and the interaction between the two, to get the best possible outcome for health consumers, for the people of Australia. I note the figures given by Senator Fierravanti-Wells. Some 43 per cent of hospital beds relate to the private system. I think it would be remiss of us not to have a representative of the private hospital sector on such a pricing authority. If it is to be truly independent, truly inclusive and truly representative, this amendment ought to be supported and I do so.

"McLucas, Sen Jan",ALP,2011-11-21,"



Senator McLUCAS
 (Queensland—Parliamentary Secretary for Disabilities and Carers) (21:17):  The government do not support the amendment proposed by the opposition, as we do not believe that it would enhance the provisions of the bill. Currently there is a provision for one member to have rural and regional experience with flexibility for other members agreed between the states and territories and the Commonwealth to ensure a variety of experience and expertise for the membership. The Council of Australian Governments has already announced the chair and the deputy chair of the IHPA. The chair will be Mr Shane Solomon, who gained experience in the provision of public hospital services from non-government operators when he was the group chief executive officer of Mercy Health and Aged Care Victoria.


While other appointments are under consideration by COAG, the government expects at least one other member to have the experience the opposition seeks. That has been explained to the office of the shadow health minister. While we agree with the outcome the opposition is seeking, we see no reason to diverge from the National Health Reform Agreement in this case. The way the amendment is drafted would potentially include a person with purely private hospital experience in the definition of membership, even though they are not covered by the authority and have very different pricing models from public hospitals. Private and NGO operated public hospitals will be able to and will be encouraged to direct their recommendations direct to the authority during the public consultation.

"Eggleston, Sen Alan",LP,2011-11-21,"



Senator EGGLESTON
 (Western Australia) (21:19):  It is very important that we recognise the need for different kinds of experienced people on this pricing authority board. We have heard already in the course of this debate that there will be somebody with regional and rural experience. People who have anything to do with medicine know that regional and rural hospitals are different kinds of places from the big metropolitan hospitals, especially the big public hospitals. If recognition has been given to the fact that there is a need for somebody with regional and rural experience on this pricing authority board, we really have to think also about the need, as the Catholic Health Australia spokesman Martin Laverty has said, for someone who has operating experience in the private hospital sector.


Private hospitals are very different from public hospitals. Public hospitals work on public money, obviously, which is not accounted for in the same way as is money in a private hospital. Martin Laverty, CEO of Catholic Health Australia, made the point that the Catholic hospital system represents about 10 per cent of hospital beds in Australia, amounting to something like 2,700 Catholic hospital beds, mostly on the east coast but very strongly represented in Western Australia where we have two St John of God hospitals which are major, very large private hospitals in the metropolitan area, one in Subiaco and a new one south of the river in Murdoch. There is also St Anne's hospital, formerly the Mercy Hospital and another big Catholic hospital. St John of God has hospitals in the major regional centres of Western Australia in Bunbury, Geraldton and Kalgoorlie. So St John of God is a major hospital provider. Its funding models and business models are quite different to those of the public hospital system, where there is obviously a bigger flow of money coming in.


Private hospitals have to account for capital depreciation, insurance, council rates, long service leave, information technology—even down to whether or not a Microsoft licence per user is applied to the cost of each patient's admission—because the private hospital system requires cost accountability, which really is not an issue in a government run system. There are very different considerations when you come to the private system and, given that, the case for having a person on the board with private hospital, private sector, experience is very hard to argue with. In the end, in the private sector every cost has to be recovered. You have to work out each individual item of cost within the whole system because in the end that cost has to be recovered in the fees charged to the patients. That requires a different approach altogether. You cannot just assume that some things will be 'given', that some services will be provided because they always are in a big government hospital. In the private system they are not. You have to think of the cost of every towel by a basin, every needle and every syringe, the cost of electricity for the use of electrical goods within a hospital—it all has to be accounted for.


The entire approach in a private sector operation is very different to that in a government sector operation, where people are less concerned about costs. They probably should be more concerned but, because it is a government operation, nobody bothers too much about the use of power or the provision of drugs, dressings and supplies, which can be done in a fairly easygoing way. The cost of the nursing staff required to support a surgeon in an operation is not taken into consideration as much, in the sense that the cost is borne by the government and it does not have to be accounted for in the same way. In the private sector, just as in any other private business, every item of cost has to be considered in terms of the ultimate unit cost to the patient. It is a very different approach.


For that reason the coalition's proposition that there be a person on this board who has private sector experience is one that, in terms of simple common sense, is very hard to argue against. These hospitals are major organisations incurring, day by day, very high costs, and in the end it has to be brought down to a unit cost for an individual patient for their day in the hospital. I strongly support this coalition amendment and trust that the committee will find it does as well.

The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN 

(
Senator Cameron
):  Senator Xenophon, I would be pleased if you did not engage in a debate with Senator Cormann.




Senator XENOPHON:
  I will not engage in a debate, because time is incredibly short. Can I indicate that I have an amendment on file, one that has been recirculated, that I propose to move in two parts. There are two parts to the amendment. One says that the pricing authority must not report publicly unless a period of 30 days has elapsed since a report has been given to the minister or, if the report has not been given to the minister and each state and territory health minister, a period of three months has elapsed since the report was completed. I will not seek to divide on that. I understand I do not have support for it.


The other part, which I will be dividing on, says that, if a report is given to the minister, the report contains one or more recommendations and the minister does not agree to adopt one or more of the recommendations, the minister must publish on the internet his or her reasons for not adopting the recommendation or recommendations. The reason I will move this is that the minister, in the second reading speech to the bill, said:


The Authority will have strong independent powers: it will be for public hospitals what the independent Reserve Bank is for monetary policy. This is unprecedented for the public hospital system. 


The result will be a thorough and rigorous determination without fear or favour to Governments. The Government is confident that the Authority will provide the health system with the stability and robustness that the Reserve Bank has provided for monetary policy for decades.


If that is the case, let it be truly independent; let it be properly transparent. If the minister does not agree with any or all of the recommendations, the minister ought to give the reasons for doing so, given that we are setting up this truly independent body akin to the Reserve Bank in its robust independence. This amendment relates to transparency. The reasons for a recommendation not being supported, not being adopted by the minister, ought to be given by the minister. I think what I am proposing is an important transparency and accountability mechanism.


I do note that both the coalition and the Australian Greens supported an amendment to the Australian National Preventive Health Agency Bill 2010 which said the CEO of that organisation:


… must cause a copy of any advice given or recommendations made in undertaking the CEO’s functions … to be published on the … web site within 12 months of providing the advice or making the recommendations.


That is not quite the same as this recommendation but is similar in spirit and similar in terms of the process of transparency and accountability. I think that if we are setting up these bodies there ought to be some transparency and accountability. The minister of the day ought to give reasons why any recommendations are not followed through. That is why I urge my colleagues to seriously consider this amendment. It is consistent with the amendment supported by the coalition and the Greens on 17 November 2010, just over a year ago.

"Urquhart, Sen Anne",ALP,2011-11-21,"



Senator URQUHART
 (Tasmania) (21:46):  In this the week before the Australian Labor Party's national conference I rise to express my full support for marriage equality. The momentum is building to change this anachronistic policy, which cements the last pillar of legalised discrimination and, I believe, fuels homophobia. I stand together with a clear majority of Australians in calling for the Australian Labor Party national conference and the members of this place to take the necessary steps to amend the Marriage Act to allow any two adults, regardless of sex, sexuality or gender identity, the honour and privilege of standing in front of their family and friends and making a commitment to each other; to allow the children of people in same-sex relationships the stability of knowing that their family is just as special in this country as are all other families; and to allow the community to celebrate the love and commitment of two Australians that no doubt are good citizens, pay their taxes and abide by the laws of the land.


Tonight I will share a few stories told to me by Tasmanians about why marriage equality is so important to them. I optimistically hope that their struggles may assist those sitting on the fence in this debate to realise that marriage equality will strengthen the institution of marriage and our communities. I begin with the story of a child that does not tell his friends about his mum's relationship. Although this nine-year-old boy should be worried about what games he will play with his mates and how to pass his tests at school, he is burdened with a fear that he will be bullied if his mates find out about his mum, who is in a loving relationship and does everything for him. Not being able to marry is very sad for her, but what is sadder is that her son cannot tell his peers about her relationship because, even at his young age, he realises that he will be bullied. He does so many amazing and exciting things with his mum and her partner, like camping, bird watching, hiking and boating—like any other family—but it concerns him that he has to censor his life.


It is so sad that a little boy already knows, and has to live with, discrimination. Marriage equality can help to put an end to this for this boy and many others in his situation. This is a boy whose childhood should be about instilling in him the skills and dreams that will see him become a good Australian. This is a boy who should be worried about what games to play with his friends, what he needs to do for his next school assignment and whether he got a few kicks in his last footy game. This boy should not be burdened with the fear of bullying if he shares stories of his weekend with his mum and her partner. Opponents of marriage equality use the pretence of protecting children as one of their major arguments. I challenge them to look a child like this brave boy in the eyes and say that the current laws are protecting him. I challenge them to move beyond their belief of what they see as a traditional family unit.


We must accept that our society is comprised of many family structures and we must enshrine in our laws a safe environment for all. That includes people whose anatomic gender is different to the gender they identify with. I move to share the story of a transsexual Tasmanian. If this woman was not honest with herself, she would be allowed to marry. She told me that she has twice been in love—once as a man and once, since transitioning, as a woman. Both relationships were exactly the same. Both had highs and lows. Both were founded on love. The first of these relationships was able to be celebrated publicly. They married, and thus the relationship gained society's blessing. After the death of his wife, who was the only person he had previously told of his struggles with his gender, he decided to transition. Since transitioning, she found love again, and again with a woman, but no matter how this relationship is valued by her family, friends, colleagues and community it is somehow less valued.


She explained that she is still the same person she was when married many years ago but that she is more honest now, with herself and with her community. If the first relationship deserved recognition as a marriage, it is only just that the second one does too. The only difference is her gender. In her current life, she has chosen to be more honest with society about who she is. Remarkably, if she had not undergone transitioning therapy and legally changed her sex, she would be legally allowed to marry. This great country rewards people for their honesty. We must remove this barrier that prevents decent people from being fully honest with themselves and their community.


As Australians we pride ourselves on our abilities on the sporting field. I recently learnt of the discrimination a Tasmanian couple faced at their local golf club, which is always looking for new members, when they decided to join as partners. One was a successful golfer, having represented Tasmania on a number of occasions. Her new partner was also keen to join as she knew quite a number of the members and thought it would be fun. The behaviour from some of the club members, who had previously known her partner when she was a married straight woman, was extremely hurtful to them both. Although they acted no differently to any other couple at the club, her partner was never welcomed as a new member. The club has a membership discount for married couples and of course these women could not qualify for it. They told me that it was not the money that hurt; it was the attitude that they were lesser members of the club even though one had been a champion many times and the other was known and liked by many members outside of this setting. As you might expect, the burden of continual exclusion and snide remarks resulted in the women resigning from the club. This provides another example of how continuing to deny marriage equality instils discrimination within our society.


But attitudes change with time. At the Tasmanian Labor state conference there was a contribution in support of marriage equality from a man who formerly looked upon homosexuality as wrong. He spoke of his struggle when his son came out, a struggle to comprehend his son's sexuality that soon turned to how he could best support his son. As his son is now in a loving relationship, he spoke of his wish for his son to be able to marry the partner that he loves in front of his family and friends. We must remember that it was only in 1997 that sodomy was decriminalised in Tasmania. But only seven years later Tasmania became the first state in Australia to recognise same-sex couples. The state continues to lead the country with support for same-sex couples. Now, in Senator Carol Brown's recent survey of over 1,000 Tasmanians, over 55 per cent of respondents were in favour of marriage equality.


In Australian law there has always been a clear distinction between civil and religious marriages. People are able to be wed in a civil ceremony. A religious body is able to choose not to wed a couple and should remain free to have this choice. People of different religions are able to be wed and not all forms of marriage are permissible under law even if they are allowed under a religious text. In recent years two-thirds of marriages have been conducted in a civil ceremony with no involvement or mention of religion. However, people are currently not free to have a wedding without discrimina­tion. A marriage celebrant must, regardless of the wishes of the bride and groom, include in the monitum the Marriage Act's current definition of marriage. Without these words a marriage cannot be solemnised. A marriage celebrant recently highlighted to me the growing dissatisfaction of brides and grooms that these words must be used on their special day. That a phrase a majority of our society feel is discriminatory and should be repealed must be recited for a marriage to be solemnised is so unfortunate. Is it not enough that same-sex attracted people are prohibited from marriage in this country?


I acknowledge that this debate is difficult, that the community is divided and that, for many, overcoming long-held prejudices is tough. But that is why we need strong leadership from the Labor Party at our national conference next week. We need the government to stand united on this issue, recognising that one of the Labor Party's great strengths is its unity in fighting to promote equality, fairness and dignity for all. This is the time to remove the last piece of legislation that fuels that discrimination in this country.


I thank Jenny, Jen, Peter, Martine and Maxine for sharing their stories with me. I hope that this place will do our little bit to make their lives that bit better. Let us finish the great work done in 2008 when this parliament removed discrimination against same-sex de facto couples in over 85 pieces of Commonwealth legislation. Let us change the Marriage Act to support equality for all and to give Jen, Jenny, Peter, Martine and Maxine that equality that they long for and so richly deserve.
