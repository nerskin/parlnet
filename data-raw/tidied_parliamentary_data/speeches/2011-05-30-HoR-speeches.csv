Mr BANDT

 (
Melbourne
) (
10:10
):


I 
move
:





That this House:





(1) condemns the Gillard Government's deal with Malaysia that would see 800 asylum seekers intercepted in Australian waters and sent to Malaysia; and





(2) calls on the Government to immediately abandon this proposal.




The government's deal to expel asylum seekers from Australia to Malaysia is wrong and should be condemned by this parliament. The deal, like the now-defunct East Timor plan, is a rushed political fix designed to paper over the failure of the government and the opposition's mandatory detention policy. The deal will mean asylum seekers are expelled to Malaysia. The deal violates Australia's international obligations and is an abuse of human rights. That is why today I am moving a motion that is also being moved and supported in the Senate. The motion reads that this House: 'condemns the Gillard Government's deal with Malaysia that would see 800 asylum seekers intercepted in Australian waters and sent to Malaysia; and … calls on the Government to immediately abandon this proposal.'




I understand the significance of moving this motion, and I have not taken the decision to do so lightly. If passed, this motion will mean that for the first time in the life of this parliament both houses of parliament will have condemned a government policy. The government will need to take this matter very seriously because it will have received a very clear message from parliament rejecting the Malaysia deal and a very strong request that the deal be abandoned.





We all know why we are at this low point in this country's treatment of asylum seekers and refugees. For more than a decade we have had a political race to the bottom between the old parties, as they have chased votes that they think exist in certain marginal seats around the country. On the one side you have the coalition, the party of razor wire and children overboard, peddling fear and stoking resentment in the community; and on the other you have Labor, the party of mandatory detention, promising a new direction at the election but then again giving into fear and refusing to lead public opinion on this issue. It is almost like the old parties are locked in an arms race on refugees, competing to be tough and lacking in compassion. So now, instead of winding back mandatory detention, we have a 
government expanding offshore detention and now adopting the Howard government policy, so roundly condemned, of expelling asylum seekers to another country—a country that has not signed the convention on refugees, a country that has a history of caning asylum seekers and engaging in other abuses of human rights and a country that has not yet guaranteed any protections of the people which our government intends to expel there. Why do we sign up to international conventions if we are not going to abide by them? Why do we seek to contract out our obligations? We cannot send fairness offshore. It is for this reason that this deal has been widely condemned, including by the United Nations High Commissioner on Human Rights when she visited Australia last week. 





The government will say that this deal is good because, in return for accepting those expelled, Malaysia will send others to Australia. Let me be clear that the Greens' position is that our humanitarian refugee intake should be significantly expanded. But an expansion of our refugee intake should not be bought at the violation of the rights of others or by swapping one person for another. Refugees and asylum seekers are human beings, not a card in a political game. It is a reflection of how low the political debate in this country has sunk that there is willingness in some quarters to accept this as a legitimate approach to immigration policy.




I was elected by the people of Melbourne in part to bring a value of compassion and represent it in this parliament. My electorate of Melbourne thrives in part because of the decades of migrants and refugees who have chosen to settle there. The people of Melbourne do not give in to the fear and hysteria promoted by the old parties. They value diversity and the multicultural 
community in which they live. They know that there is an alternative. We can do what happens in most parts of the world—that is, allowing people, regardless of how they come to this country, to seek asylum.

Detention is a last resort, and even then should only be for the minimum possible period—a period of days, for health and security checks. The people of Melbourne also know that at a time when the country is facing a skills shortage and a mandatory detention bill of over $1 billion there are good economic reasons for a policy of fairness.


I say to the members in this place that I know moving a motion condemning the Malaysian deal is very confronting for the government and the passage of this motion will be a significant event in the life of this parliament. But there are times when, regardless of the implications, enough is enough. The Malaysia deal is wrong. It violates human rights and Australia's international obligations. It should be scrapped and I urge all members to add their voice to this call.




The SPEAKER:
  Is the motion seconded?

"Wilkie, Andrew, MP",Ind.,2011-05-30,"



Mr WILKIE
 (Denison) (10:15):  I second the motion. If someone comes to Australia seeking asylum we have a responsibility enshrined in the refugee convention, to which we are a signatory, to give them protection, to quickly assess their claim and to provide refuge if that claim is upheld. This legal responsibility applies regardless of how asylum seekers reach our shores and should be applied equally to those who arrive by boat as to those who come here by aeroplane.


Our real responsibility goes much deeper than our legal obligation as a signatory to the refugee convention, because we also have a pressing moral obligation to render all possible assistance to asylum seekers in a genuine spirit of goodwill. It is regarding this moral obligation that the federal government is doing the wrong thing by planning on trading asylum seekers with Malaysia, so much so in fact that the Labor Party has now lost the moral superiority it once had regarding Australia's response to irregular immigration. This troubles me because the Labor Party's approach to asylum seekers was a not insignificant consideration some nine months ago when I was struggling with the decision of who to give limited support to in this place.


Frankly, to establish a trade in people fleeing violence and persecution is an abomination. Yes, it may well help to deter asylum seekers from attempting the risky voyage to Australia, but it is wrong, so wrong in fact that I detest it even more than the so-called Pacific solution engineered by the Howard government and still favoured by the opposition. At least on Nauru and Manus Island there were Australian officials to ensure that some safeguards were maintained.


How on earth can conditions in Malaysia be tough enough to deter asylum seekers to Australia but safe enough for the Australian government to claim that refugees' human rights will be protected? They cannot. For a start Malaysia has not signed the refugee convention and nor has it ratified the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment. It has not even signed the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. As the United Nations human rights commissioner has pointed out, any deal with Malaysia simply offers no protection if the refugee and torture conventions have not been ratified by that country.


The government has a political problem, not an immigration problem. Rather than joining the opposition in singling out asylum seekers who arrive by boat for special punishment, the government should have the courage to inform the community about the facts. Asylum seekers are not breaking any rules. The majority are genuine refugees. And far from being swamped, the number of people arriving by boat in Australia is small compared with the much more worrying number of these overstayers arriving daily by air.


So I call again on the government and the opposition to stop, take a deep breath and focus instead on developing sophisticated responses to irregular immigration into Australia that much more effectively address the conditions in source, first asylum and transit countries. Remember, this is first and foremost a humanitarian crisis and not a border protection problem.


Australia receives just two per cent of the industrialised world's asylum claims. These are some of the most disadvantaged and vulnerable human beings on the face of the planet. Let us not sacrifice the modest advances made in our treatment of asylum seekers in the last few years in the pursuit of political self interest. In particular, let us not start trading asylum seekers with a country that often treats such people as criminals, forcibly returns them to danger, routinely relies on the lash of the cane and even resorts to the barbaric death penalty.


The bottom line is that this deal with Malaysia is a shameful public policy that is inconsistent with our international obligations. It must be abandoned. That is why I have seconded the motion condemning the deal put forward by the member for Melbourne and that is why I will vote in support of it.

"Owens, Julie, MP",ALP,2011-05-30,"



Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (10:20):  The member for Denison talks about abomination. I start by saying that the abomination in the world at the moment is that there are some 50 million people who are displaced. Around 15 million of those people are already classified as refugees and of those only about one per cent will be resettled in a third country. So for every one that Australia takes, there are many hundreds that we do not. It is an abomination that people make choices about who to assist and who not to assist. The best that decent people can do in a world like this is try to find answers that are less bad than the answers if we do not help at all. These are very real ethical issues in this, as both members who have already spoken would know, as we try to find answers that provide the most good and the least harm. Whatever we do in this particular circumstance does leave some people in real harm—many more than we actually help.


The government has been talking to our neighbours about a regional solution for some time, and before the tragic events at Christmas Island that saw many people lose their lives. There is no doubt that another tragedy is inevitable if the boats keep coming. But stopping people making the dangerous journey to Australia by boat does require a genuine breakthrough. Much of the talk in the last year or so about people smuggling has centred around Indonesia, because that is where the boats usually come from. But Malaysia is the key. Most boat arrivals in Australia pay people smugglers about $15,000 to get to Australia. They fly to Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia and then start their boat journey, first to Indonesia and then on to Australia. So the logic of the Malaysian arrangement is actually very simply. Why would you pay a substantial amount of money and risk your life on a boat only to be returned to where you began your boat journey?


I would expect that an announcement like this would come in for flak from both sides of the debate because, as I said, it is a problem where there is no perfect outcome and where, whatever a government does, there is room for criticism. There will always be a way to criticise. Frankly, if our politicians and the media are not mature enough to lift their commentary above mere criticism and consider the complexities of the world of refugees then it is very difficult, if not impossible, for the community at large to find a path through what are very difficult issues for us all.


I am not going to accuse the member for Melbourne of chasing votes on this—although he has accused us of chasing votes on this—but I will say that the Greens supporters probably share a very similar position on this to his so it is easy and politically expedient to espouse the same view. In the interest of good government and not just good politics, it is incumbent upon those who criticise this deal to suggest an alternative that increases Australia's role in resettling refugees while breaking the business role of the people smugglers.


Australia's role in resettling refugees, from my perspective, is perhaps one of the most important things that we do. Of the 50 million displaced people and 15 million people already classified as refugees, only one per cent are resettled in third countries. Australia is one of only about a dozen countries that resettle refugees from third countries and one of only three—the US, Canada and Australia—that do it on a reasonable scale. So we have a very important role to play in providing homes for people who really have nowhere else to go and are likely to spend many years in camps without the support of Australia.


I am very pleased that, in the deal we have done with Malaysia, we are increasing the humanitarian intake from Malaysia by 4,000 people. Malaysia currently has around 92,000 people who are registered as refugees and in total around 270,000 displaced people living in the community. So Malaysia has a very large number of people. I am incredibly pleased to see that Australia is increasing its intake by 4,000. I would very much like to see a world in which we could concentrate more on that aspect of the important work that we do, particularly since we are one of the few countries that do that. I am glad to see us begin to change the debate towards the importance of that resettlement role for Australia by the taking of this additional 4,000 people.

"Morrison, Scott, MP",LP,2011-05-30,"



Mr MORRISON
 (Cook) (10:25):  I am not going to cast aspersions on other members of this House. This is an incredibly complex and difficult issue and we all have to make choices about how we think we are going to address it. So I would not for a second seek to question the motives or morals of anybody in this place in how they seek to approach this very difficult issue. But I would also note that no-one would be happier than I if we could stop the boats. This is something I have campaigned for in this portfolio now for some years. It is not a slogan for the coalition; it was our record in government. For more than two years we have argued with this government that its policies are the reason we have seen this unprecedented rate of illegal boat arrivals to Australia. I now notice that the government finally agrees with us and has sought to change its policy because it knows it is the policies that are at fault in causing the chaos that we now see. But this government does not understand that when you implement policy in this area you must think it through.


This five for one people swap deal with Malaysia is a proposal conceived in denial and negotiated in desperation. Five for one speaks for itself. It was rushed out prior to the budget before it was finalised. Confusion still reigns over when it starts, who goes there and who does not. Confusion still reigns about who will decide who goes to Malaysia and the circumstances in which they go. The Prime Minister claims she is making the decision, but the Malaysian government says the opposite. It is quite clear that the Malaysian government will have a right of veto over who goes to their country under this arrangement, and the Prime Minister should be honest with the people about that. Confusion reigns about whether the 21 children and eight women who have arrived since 7 May will be sent to Malaysia. The Prime Minister should answer the question of whether she is going to send those women and children to Malaysia. Confusion continues to reign about the level of support and funding, almost $70 million of which will be paid to international agencies. We do not know what that will pay will for. Will it feed people? Will it send their kids to school and give them health care? If it does any of those things, for how long will it do those things—the entire time they are there or just a little while? We do not have answers to any of the detail because this policy sits in a twilight zone of confusion which is characterised by the way the government deals with this issue and constantly fails to think things through.


Irregular maritime arrivals will be held on Christmas Island indefinitely because this agreement has not yet been concluded and the government has no other agreement with any other country anywhere in the world to send people. As a result, those who are arriving at Christmas Island are being held in indefinite detention in strict contradiction of the government's own stated and legislated detention values.


The government has also failed to address our international obligations here, which others have noted. It is not enough just to get a commitment from Asia not to refoule, as is required under the UN convention on refugees. I understand that the government needs to get that requirement and I accept that they have received that undertaking from the Malaysia government. But what they have not got is an undertaking when it comes to the United Nations convention against torture. The Prime Minister's statement says that those sent to Malaysia will not receive preferential treatment to those who are already in Malaysia awaiting assessment of their asylum claims.


There are laws in Malaysia—actual laws—permitting fines, imprisonment and whipping of people who illegally reside in Malaysia. That is the law in Malaysia. Unless this government has an absolutely rock-solid guarantee that these laws will not apply to people sent to Malaysia then clearly they can give no guarantee about the human rights and welfare of those sent. In fact, the complementary protection law, which was introduced into and passed this House last week and is now before the Senate, may even provide an opportunity for those who are coming by boat to seek asylum from the government's own transfer laws under its own new asylum laws that it introduced into this parliament. As a result, we will see this thing potentially being wholly unwound by the government's failure to think it through. Then there is the commitment that is required in terms of the act itself, which says that human rights need to be protected and that people also are provided protection while they await asylum claims in Malaysia. That is the requirement of our Migration Act, and I learnt in estimates that the government is seeking to work its way around that requirement in the Migration Act in order to send people to Malaysia without giving that undertaking. This deal just simply does not stack up at the end of the day, and the government has options in Nauru. They only have to pick up the phone. (Time expired)

"Thomson, Craig, MP",ALP,2011-05-30,"



Mr CRAIG THOMSON
 (Dobell) (10:30):  I think that the contribution just made by the member for Cook and those of the members for Denison and Melbourne highlight the difficulties of these issues. It is probably best summed up in terms of the contribution the member for Mayo made the other day when talking about detention. He said that you cannot be tough and humane at the same time in relation to asylum seekers. On one side, we have the member for Cook telling us that we are not tough enough; on the other side, we have the contributions from the members for Melbourne and Denison telling us that we are not being humane enough.


I believe we can be both tough and humane, and this Malaysian solution is an attempt to be both—humane in the way in which we treat asylum seekers in terms of the numbers of additional people that we will be bringing here as well as being tough in trying to break the people-smuggling model that is so insidious and terrible in the way in which it treats human beings. Let us not just take that from members of the government; let us actually have a look at what the UNHCR has said. We have had some rhetoric here about how bad this solution is, but that is does not stack up with what has been said by the experts in the area.


Yante Ismail in the West Australian on 16 May, the UNHCR spokesman said:


We don't see it in terms of a swap or a bargain ...


We see this as a commitment by the Australian Government to provide resettlement for 4000 people in need of an opportunity to rebuild their lives safely.


To us, it's a real commitment by Australia in burden-sharing with a country like Malaysia that is now coping with a large number of refugees and asylum seekers.


We think the agreement has the potential to enhance the protection for refugees in Malaysia, as well as the region as a whole.


If it realises more resettlement opportunities for refugees, this would be a positive outcome.""


The member for Denison was the one who said that he found the swapping of people abhorrent. As I said, the UNHCR has said that they do not see it in those terms at all; they see it as a breakthrough in this area. We have to understand that with 92,000 registered refugees in Malaysia—270,000 there in total—we need to be doing our bit in making sure that we bring more people here.


It is not just one isolated UNHCR spokesman; it is many. Adrian Edwards said:


As we understand the MOU, Australia's obligations under the refugee convention are not compromised provided that the fundamental rights of asylum seekers and refugees are assured in Malaysia.


Richard Towle, the UNHCR regional representative says:


I think in that sense it has the potential to... make a significant practical contribution to what we're trying to achieve in the region.


And if it's a good experience other countries can look at it and say 'yes, that's a positive way of managing these issues. Perhaps we want to embark on similar or other initiatives under a regional cooperation framework.


The UNHCR Malaysian representative, Alan Vernon said:


… under this agreement, to the extent to which we have all the details— and of course we know that it's a work in progress which is still being discussed...we see that there are opportunities for better protection for refugees here in Malaysia, and more broadly in the region.


What the UNHCR is saying is that they see the Malaysian solution not as abhorrent but as a positive move both for asylum seekers in Malaysia and also in the region. 


Most importantly, the contrast needs to made in terms of what the opposition are saying. The opposition's model is to put asylum seekers in Nauru. It does not attempt to break the people-smuggling process at all. This particular Malaysian solution does that: it goes to the source country from where the boats first leave and makes sure there are incentives for people to be treated fairly, humanely. Australia takes more refugees, but we do it in such a way that we discourage the vile trade of people smuggling.


For those on the left and on the right to criticise only shows what a difficult and tight balance this is, but I believe the government has got this right in relation to the Malaysian solution and this is something that should be supported by all members of this parliament.

"Christensen, George, MP",Nats,2011-05-30,"



Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson) (10:35):  I rise to speak to this motion by the member for Melbourne this morning and, in doing so, question the motives behind this proposed Malaysian deal for asylum seekers and the outcomes. This government's border protection frenzy has become excruciating to watch—like a cross between a bizarre episode of The Amazing Race and a chicken with its head cut off.


There are stark similarities with the reality TV program. Just like The Amazing Race, this government jet sets its policy from one country to the next. We have seen the bungled attempt at using East Timor. We have seen Manus Island and PNG brought into the equation very briefly. Then we jumped on a jet to see if Malaysia could help get this Labor government's border protection right. Then Thailand and the South Sea islands have chimed in wanting a piece of the action, so bad for Australia was the proposed deal with Malaysia.


The key difference is that contestants on The Amazing Race do not know where they are going to finish, and it is not in Malaysia. The Malaysian deal is not a solution. Manus Island was not a solution. East Timor was not a solution. What we are seeing in Australian detention centres is not a solution. They are all just carriages on this train wreck that is the government's avoidance of the real solution to border protection. The Australian people know what the solution looks like. They have seen the Howard government effectively control our borders and achieve results. I believe, 'If it ain't broke don't fix it.' Unfortunately, that is not this government's approach to this policy. They tried to fix the perfectly-working solution and have been running around like headless chooks ever since in a desperate bid to find another solution that does not look like the old one. They cannot go back to the solution that worked; that would be to admit that they got it wrong.


If a real deal with Malaysia ever eventuates—and there is not yet a deal, according to Malaysia—it will be one of the greatest injustices ever thrust upon the Australian people and the asylum seekers at the centre of this malaise. To pack up the asylum seekers and transport them to a country that not only allows but regularly practices caning, contravenes the government's own stance. Malaysia is not a signatory to the UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees. Even if a caning ban was written into this alleged agreement that would be no guarantee because caning is permissible under local laws in Malaysia. The PM cannot guarantee that asylum seekers would not be caned, mistreated or even tortured in Malaysia. She cannot make that guarantee. She might promise but we have seen how much a promise from the Prime Minister is worth with the carbon tax. 


With a processing centre at Nauru, on the other hand, the Australian government can make that guarantee. Nauru may not be a signatory to the United Nations convention on refugees but it is willing to be. And, unlike Malaysia, it is a signatory to the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the International Covenant on Civic and Political Rights. The solution was working at Nauru. The question is: why will the Prime Minister not pick up the phone to the President of Nauru? The answer to that is very simple: that would be an admission that this government got it wrong. 


It was a wrong call on East Timor and a wrong call on Manus Island. It is a wrong call on Malaysia, unless you are on the Malaysian end of the deal. That is a deal of a lifetime. All Malaysia has to do is take in 800 asylum seekers from Australia and they can offload 4,000 of theirs. It is a great solution for Malaysia. What is more, the Australian government has kindly offered to pay for the whole deal. That makes it an even better solution for Malaysia. But for Australia it is a deal that stinks. It is a deal that is going to cost us an additional $1.7 billion, according to the budget papers. Malaysia is still holding the cards, because the Prime Minister is desperate to find some sort of solution. Malaysia will be holding all the aces in this deal. They will pick and choose which 800 asylum seekers they will take in. They will pick and choose which 4000 they send. 


Our current detention centres are in a mess. We have violent riots and a cost blow-out of more than $3 billion. Our detention population is at record levels, more than 60 per cent of detainees having been there for more than six months and the average time spent in detention increasing from 61 days to more than 170 in that past three years. This is a government desperate for a deal.

Labor's denial and failure over three years has created chaos, cost and misery in our detention network. As I said earlier in this House, no-one will be more pleased than I if the boats stop but this will not erase the havoc caused by Labor and their denial and their failed policies. In November 2007 there were just four people who had arrived illegally by boat in our detention network. Under Labor that number has risen to over 6,500—almost double the peak that was recorded under the coalition government. Over the last several years we have seen a litany of chaos, abuse and cost blow-outs in this detention network, which defy imagination.


It was all started by this government's failure to address their own policy measures introduced to soften the border protection regime that they inherited from the coalition government. When they softened those laws, over 11,100 people came to our shores. We had an increase in our detention population, as I have mentioned, to over 6,800. The time spent in detention increased from just over 60 days to almost 180 days. More than 60 per cent of the people who are in our detention network now have been there for more than six months.


We have had incidents of abuse, not only amongst detainees, but in particular against those Australians who are working in those centres. There have been over 70 incidents and allegations of abuse have been levelled against those in detention centres in just this financial year alone.


This is a network that is in absolute crisis. It has been in a rolling crisis since there was what was reported as a bloody fight breaking out on 21 November 2009 on Christmas Island involving 150 Afghans and Sri Lankans. That matter was over a year ago, and we have seen chorus of incidents, from further rooftop protests on 20 to 22 September 2010, 90 detainees breaking out of the Northern Immigration Detention Facility in September of last year and, on 15 November a violent brawl at Broadmeadows. On 17 November there was a rooftop protest at Villawood and at the Airport Lodge between 7 to 10 February 1l people were hospitalised and a further 11 taken to the watch house after another disturbance and riot. On 27 and 28 February there was a riot at Christmas Island in the family compound, where 13 people were injured, windows were smashed, three asylum seekers were arrested and 15 young males were moved off the island. On 16 March there was a breakout at the Asti Motel.


On 17 March there was a protest at Curtin and also on 17 March a young Afghan man died at Sherga. On 28 March a 20 year-old Afghan asylum seeker died at the Curtin detention centre and on 12 and 13 March there were mass breakouts at Christmas Island followed by the horrendous riots which saw Commonwealth officers having to retake a Commonwealth facility by force. There were the Villawood riots that were proceeded by an improvised explosive device being found in that detention centre some four weeks before that whole area of the compound was torched—something the minister did not even know about. We have an average of more than three critical incidents of the types I have been referring to—of self-abuse, assaults and escapes—occurring in our detention network every single day. This is something that demands an inquiry of this House. The terms of reference I have circulated for that inquiry are there for all to see and go in some detail into the matters that we should be looking at. We should be looking at how the riots occurred and what steps were taken by the government to avoid them. We should be looking at the procedures in place in our detention network to ensure that staff are safe, can be catered for, can be looked after and can defend and protect themselves in the course of what can often be incredibly dangerous duties. There should be codes of conduct that are enforceable so that Serco officers and other Australians working in this environment can ensure good public order.


Australians were horrified and appalled by the behaviour we saw in our detention network over these last months. They were shaking their heads; many of them said, 'Enough is enough.' Enough is enough of the rolling crisis in our detention network and the government's attempt to not have these matters exposed to full public scrutiny.


There are also issues in the detention network around the welfare of those who are being held within detention itself. As I said, when the coalition government left office there were just four people in detention who had arrived by boat. That is how you avoid having more than three critical incidents every day in your detention network—when there is actually no-one in them. That is our objective. That is why we have always said we wanted to stop the boats, because when you do you do not have the havoc that is caused. I am amazed that the current government took almost three years to realise that their failed policies were the problem. Their policies were the reason that our detention network was filling up, causing the tension, the stress and the pressures that have led to this appalling series of incidents right across the detention network, including self-harm.


It took almost two years for the government to decide to use the powers that were created in 2005 in the Migration Act by the coalition government to enable children to be released into the community under residence determination orders. Why did it take so long? Why did it take so long for more than 1,000 children to be held within the detention network and not released into the community under residence determination orders? The minister has had that power ever since he took up his oath and the minister before him had that power when he took up his oath. But as 1,000 children got onto boats under this government's policies and made their way to our shores and into our detention network, where they have largely stayed till this day, this government sat there for almost two years and did absolutely nothing, not using any of the powers it had under the act to deal with this very serious issue.


Then, last year, they made this grand announcement implying that they would take children out from behind razor wire. They have not been behind razor wire since 2005, when just 59 children were in detention and were released into the community by the coalition government under the reforms that we made at that time.


All of these matters need to be ventilated. I do not seek to muzzle any member of this chamber—or in the other chamber if we sought to make this a joint parliamentary inquiry. It is important that we ask all the questions and put it all under the microscope, and that is why I gave my commitment to the crossbenchers and the Greens to amend the motion. All of the specific issues that they have asked to be raised in our discussions over the last week have now been included in the terms of reference for this inquiry. In my discussions with all of the crossbenchers whom I have had the opportunity to speak with personally, I have sought to include the matters they have raised in these terms of reference, because no member of this parliament should be muzzled in seeking to ask the questions and get the answers as to what is happening in our detention network.


In the motion before the House earlier today, we had debated the government's Malaysian five-for-one people swap. As I mentioned in my remarks on that matter, this is a deal which is fraught with difficulty, is far from completed and, most significantly, fails to provide the guarantees required under our Migration Act for the welfare of those people who will be sent to Malaysia under this arrangement.


When we consider these matters, it is important that we get the policies right. We will see whether the measure that the government is introducing stops the boats or not. We will wait. No-one will be happier than me if boats stop coming, but it has to be done the right way. The policies that the coalition put in place when we were in government not only stopped the boats but reduced the detention population of those who came by boat to just four. That is the outcome that we dearly seek.


So I implore members of this House to take up the opportunity for an inquiry that will be able to ask witnesses to give evidence in camera, to travel and to hear from people who have experience of the immigration network about how they work in and operate it and the resources and other things that they need; and to look into the cost, which has blown out to more than $3 billion over the last couple of years through the waste and mismanagement and failures of this government's policies. Whether the boats stop coming or not, the mess this government has created in our detention network is a national disgrace. It is a blight on our budget and it is a blight on our record for one simple reason: this government's policies failed. We need to have an inquiry to look into the mess it has created.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2011-05-30,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (10:51):  This motion submitted by the member for Cook is sold to the parliament and the public as a sincere effort to shine a light on the way the nation's detention network is run, demanding of the parliament and, principally, the government transparency and a willingness to critically examine the management of this network. In short, this is not a call for a serious examination. It is not a move to provide genuine recommendations for the way detention centres are managed to enhance their operation. I imagine it is not even a real attempt to reconsider the model of detention. This is simply a political stunt by the opposition, who, incapable of putting forward a viable, workable alternative, seek to flex their intellectual muscle by calling for—wait for it—a parliamentary inquiry. With the opposition deprived of attention and having an inability to breathe life back into a shabby approach to the issue of asylum seekers, we are now meant to believe that the member for Cook is seeking to pursue serious policy outcomes. An opposition that refuses to join other multi-party committees tasked with dealing with the gravest policy issue confronting our generation and those that follow—climate change—now calls on the parliament to join with it in a political exercise designed to generate advantage for the coalition, not for the nation. A member who just a few short months ago could not allow grieving families the peace to bury their own and who instead, with his public remarks, poured shame onto a period of intense grief, has now struck within himself a vein of compassion. He saunters into the chamber showing us his confected concern that masks a ruptured conscience.


What has prompted this motion by the member for Cook? What in the last two or so weeks has prompted the member for Cook into this sudden push for a parliamentary inquiry? What has changed that has made this so important for the member for Cook to bring this on now is simple: the announcement made by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship on Saturday, 7 May. The member for Cook fears that the government is putting in place its election commitment for a regional cooperation network to help end the people-smuggling model. The member for Cook, like many opposite, is afraid that the government's policies will have the desired effect of putting in place a sharp disincentive for people smugglers and those contemplating taking the dangerous journey by boat to Australia. What we have is simply the member for Cook trying to squeeze every last drop of political capital out of the human misery of irregular migration and people smuggling. If he were genuinely concerned with the events in part (a) of his motion, we would have heard about this proposed inquiry more than a month ago. The reason we did not hear about it is because the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship responded quickly and effectively to the events on Christmas Island and at Villawood by announcing an arms-length independent inquiry led by experienced public servants Helen Williams and Dr Allan Hawke. This is the right and proper place for a sober examination of what occurred and what needs to be done to help avoid these terrible scenes happening again.


Even if we accepted that the proper place for examination of the events on Christmas Island and Villawood was a parliamentary inquiry, what is this proposed inquiry supposed to achieve? Parliamentary inquiries are supposed to be vehicles to get to the bottom of a particular event or to challenge policy settings. Is the member for Cook seriously suggesting that we should end mandatory detention—a policy that has enjoyed bipartisan support for over 15 years? The government has a policy of mandatory detention of unauthorised arrivals for the purpose of health, identity and security checks—which I thought were things that the member for Cook supported. The terms of reference put forward by the member for Cook have no real focus or desired outcome. Why? For the coalition, it is more important to continue to talk about asylum seekers or boat people than to come up with real policy solutions to tackle major challenges like people smuggling in our region.


The gall and hypocrisy embedded in this motion should drive the House away from it. The opposition would ask that the government be judged when they have shunned judgment themselves, knowing that judgment of their performance would yield little to be proud of and much to be ashamed of. The rollcall of infamous incidents stands out with innocent people caught by the fractures and flaws of their system. Vivian Alvarez Solon was unlawfully removed to the Philippines in July 2001. Four years later it emerged that she had been deported, although the government had known of the mistake two years earlier. Cornelia Rau, an Australian permanent resident, was unlawfully detained for a period of 10 months back in 2004-05. Peter Qasim was held in detention for seven years. Then there were mother and daughter Virginia and Naomi Leong. Virginia Leong, a Malaysian citizen, was arrested and placed under mandatory detention in 2001 for attempting to leave Australia without the correct papers. She was two months pregnant at the time of her detention.


What of the coalition's own efforts to reach regional understanding to tackle people smuggling? The former government, headed by a Prime Minister who was the self-appointed deputy sheriff of the Asia-Pacific, were able to muster only an island state to form the basis of their Pacific solution. Of the 13 or so independent states within the Pacific, only one agreed to their Pacific solution. And then they told us that they could bring their own regional solution, no doubt through their boat phone—with only one other country on the other end of the line—while in the background, under their watch, there were fires, breakouts and violence at Woomera and Baxter. In terms of transparency and openness, one only needs to compare our record to theirs, and we are quite prepared to do so. This government is open and accountable about its immigration detention system, unlike those opposite when they were last in office.


As I have mentioned, we have already announced independent reviews into the incidents at Christmas Island and Villawood detention centre, and the Ombudsman consistently investigates the detention system. I also understand that the minister has fielded more than 1,200 questions on notice as part of the Senate estimates process. We are prepared to consider genuine proposals for changes to improve the operation of the detention network and the safety and security of those who live or work within it. We are building regional solutions to the regional problem of irregular migration and people smuggling. We have secured the agreement of more than 30 countries to a sustainable regional cooperation framework for dealing with asylum seekers. We are implementing that framework through cooperative arrangements with interested countries in the region, beginning with a landmark transfer arrangement with Malaysia.


In October last year, the Prime Minister and the immigration minister announced that the government would move the majority of children and vulnerable family groups out of immigration detention facilities and into community based accommodation by the end of June this year, and we are well on track to meet that commitment. We also committed to ensuring that asylum seekers within the immigration detention facilities are housed in humane, appropriate conditions and are provided with appropriate services and care. We have long acknowledged the pressures on our detention system and we are working hard to relieve that pressure by improving processing times for asylum claims and delivering a regional solution to the problem of irregular migration.


I noticed that the member for Cook in his proposed motion has again revisited the issue of the costs of damage caused by the fires at Villawood detention centre. This is an issue that was particularly embarrassing for him when he raised it during question time during budget week. His question suggested a great big cover-up by the government. The response by the minister for immigration left the member for Cook red-faced. The Commonwealth is not liable for the damage to detention centres at Christmas Island and Villawood; that is covered by Serco's insurance.


Minister Bowen has announced a range of measures to strengthen the consequences of criminal behaviour in immigration detention, including the amendments to the character test which are currently before the House. I am told the member for Cook received written advice from the department's senior legal team as well as a briefing on the legislation weeks ago—and, still, I do not believe we are any wiser on whether or not the coalition will support the reform. The changes send a strong and clear message that criminal behaviour in detention centres will not be tolerated. Will the member for Cook step up and support these changes—or is it all talk yet again?


There is no question that the government's policy of detention will have its costs. This is something that the Liberal Party know about—they were, after all, the party that spent hundreds of millions of dollars building the facility on Christmas Island. Our costs in the budget for asylum seeker management cover the new measures the government is taking to break the business model of the people smugglers, the building of a regional solution and the costs of processing. When taking into account all the measures considered here today by the government and our record of being open and transparent on this sensitive issue, the contrasts are clear for all to see in the newfound commitment to openness and transparency that those opposite refused to embrace when they were in government.

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2011-05-30,"



Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (11:01):  I rise to support this motion moved by the member for Cook. If the member for Chifley, the government member who just spoke on this motion, is the sum total of the government's defence as to why this parliament should not look into the government's detention network debacle, I hope that this parliament can see through such transparently naive and, quite frankly, petty and silly arguments.


We are sent here to this parliament to do many things in representing our constituents but, very importantly, this parliament should hold the executive to account. This is what this motion is really about. It is framed around the detention network, but the decision this parliament makes on it will be about what role the parliament should legitimately play. And it is vital that this parliament hold the executive to account on this issue.


This is a parliament that was supposed to be different. This is a parliament that was supposed to be more muscular and was going to assert its independence from the executive. The Labor Party when they came into government were going to 'allow sunlight in on government decisions'; yet we just heard the one contribution to this debate from the government slamming the reasons that we should have this detention network inquiry.


Our detention network does need parliamentary scrutiny. It has been gripped by a rolling crisis that culminated in March and April this year with the riots and the violent incidences that we saw at Christmas Island and Villawood. A lot has been said about those riots but beyond those we know that there are three critical incidents a day within our detention network. These can range from assaults on officers through to self-harm, riots, the setting of fires, homemade bombs and, sadly, even deaths. The incident of the improvised explosive device at Villawood was not even considered important enough to report to the minister—who was notified on talkback radio about what was occurring within his own network.


There has been a collapse of our detention network, and it is not the result of bad luck or happenstance and it is certainly not the result of international conditions; it is the direct result of failed government policies. When the Labor Party came to office there were four people in our detention network who had arrived illegally by boat. Then Labor took these fateful decisions in August 2008 that resulted in the people-smuggling model being reinvigorated. And, of course, we know what has happened since then: 227 illegal boat arrivals carrying over 11,000 people. Julia Gillard as Prime Minister has presided over 86 boat arrivals and over 4,800 people being smuggled here illegally.


If the government could kill the people-smuggling model and show some resolve and do something to stop these arrivals, we would not have the need for this inquiry into our detention network. Because there has been this massive influx of people and a massive expansion of the network, we have had the situation where people have been detained for much longer as government agencies struggle to deal with the consequences of Labor's failure. Because is it so hard to process such a large number of people, 60 per cent of detainees have now been detained for over six months. Average processing time has blown out from 61 days to over 170 days. Taxpayers' money has been squandered at an astonishing rate. An extra $3 million of taxpayers' money has been expended on our detention network. If these are not things that this parliament should be looking into, it is hard to imagine what MPs are doing here.


We need to know what happened at Christmas Island; we need to know what happened at Villawood; we need to know what is happening in an ongoing way within our detention network; we need to know what can be done better; and we need to understand how our detention network got to this stage in the first place and what the government's plans are to do something about it. When you are seeing Commonwealth property destroyed, taxpayers' money squandered, Commonwealth employees assaulted, criminal acts committed, explosive devices being detected, mass breakouts, suicides and self-harm—and when you are seeing all this as a direct result of the failure of government policy—this parliament must take action. I urge all members to support this motion.

"Wilkie, Andrew, MP",Ind.,2011-05-30,"



Mr WILKIE
 (Denison) (11:06):  You do not have to search far for evidence that Australia's mandatory detention system is in crisis. Most nights on the news we see graphic images of the failure: people caged like criminals, riots, fires, suicide, women and children mourning their dead. And who can forget the gut-wrenching images of a boat laden with people seeking asylum smashing into Christmas Island. Yet still they come—men, women and children risking their lives to seek asylum in the country with a national anthem that boasts of golden soil and wealth for toil and, for those who have come across the seas, boundless plains to share.


These people do not come here by jumping some queue. There is no queue when you are fleeing for your life in the middle of the night or rotting in some displaced persons camp. Nor do they risk the hazardous and expensive journey to Australia because they want to be locked up for God knows how long. No, asylum seekers make their treacherous journeys because their situations are so dire. That is why they are willing to split up their families, leave behind all their possessions and risk their lives as they do. Imagine being in that position where your best option is to put your life and probably all your cash in the hands of some dodgy people smuggler.


How does Australia greet these desperate people who are committing no crime? By locking them up for months and years in circumstances the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights noted last week are 'arbitrary', 'in breach of international law' and which have 'for many years cast a shadow over Australia's human rights record.' If we needed more proof that this is a broken system, we have also got the report from the Australian Human Rights Commission on Sydney's Villawood detention centre. Commission President Catherine Branson describes ghost-like people covered in emotional and physical scars thinking constantly of suicide and self-harm. She told the ABC last week:


You get the sense, walking in, of disturbed people, depressed people, agitated people. There is not a sense of normality around you.


Moreover she said:


I think the average Australian would be disturbed if required to spend even a short period of time living there.


Not only is mandatory detention cruel and inhumane, it simply does not work. It is a failed and costly experiment that has gone on for much too long. Yet next year the government will spend more than $700 million on asylum seeker detention and related costs, equating to about $90,000 a year for every asylum seeker who makes it to Australia. The federal government cannot keep kidding itself that its irregular immigration policy is working and just keep building new detention centres. In Tasmania, for instance, the government is about to spend $15 million on a temporary detention centre at Pontville to house asylum seekers for just six months. Putting the humanitarian dimension to one side, is this the best use of taxpayer dollars? Of course not.


I have long opposed mandatory detention anywhere and these latest facilities will be no different. These are people who have knocked on Australia's door seeking asylum and it is simply wrong to cage them behind wire, whether it be in Pontville or on Christmas Island. We must accept that mandatory detention does not deter asylum seekers and we must find a better solution. We must acknowledge that the proliferation of detention centres in Australia is proof the federal government's asylum seeker policy is broken.


I make the point again, and I will keep making it until the government and the opposition start listening, that this is not a border security problem. It is much more complex than that and it needs a sophisticated solution that deals genuinely with source, first-asylum and transit countries. No wonder I support the establishment of a parliamentary committee on Australia's immigration detention system. I trust it will not be a political circus, but instead the first step to Australia adopting a more humane and effective approach to dealing with the wretched souls risking all to carve out a better life here in our lucky country. Indeed, for those who have come across the seas, we do in fact have boundless plains to share.

"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2011-05-30,"



Mrs MOYLAN
 (Pearce) (11:11):  The issue of mandatory detention for asylum seekers has been much debated and much criticised since it was first implemented by the Labor government in 1992. It is a negative and punitive system of dealing with those who come to our shores seeking asylum. Apart from the all-too-apparent negative effects on people incarcerated in detention prisons, the system is administratively demanding and extremely costly. The original intention when mandatory detention was introduced by the Labor government in 1992 was to act as a deterrent to those seeking to come to our shores. Originally it was aimed at a very small number of people arriving by boat. Ten years after the implementation of the policy there were 5,000 boat arrivals—so much for its deterrent capacity. Similarly, the policy of temporary protection visas was introduced as a deterrent. In the five years prior to temporary protection visas being introduced there were 3,103 boat arrivals. In the five years following the introduction of temporary protection visas there were over 11,000 arrivals. It is time we looked at these policies in the cold light of day and worked toward a durable solution—like my colleague the member for Denison has just outlined—so that we can deal with the problem of people fleeing the threat of death and oppression in their own countries without imposing further punitive measures on them.


Examining the operation of detention centres may have the positive impact of demonstrating the futility of locking people up for long periods of time in a prison-like system that leaves them further traumatised and does little or nothing to resolve the bigger issues of asylum seekers in our region. From 2001 to 2005 I worked with others in this place for hard-won changes that were made to the system of mandatory detention, including an agreement that 12,000 refugees living in the purgatory of the temporary protection visa system would be given permanent visas, the Ombudsman would regularly report to this parliament on why people continued to be held in immigration detention and families with children would not be placed in immigration detention centres except as a last resort.


Those policies were implemented and then we saw the Labor government come in on the promise of a New Directions in Detention policy. The government acknowledged that 'detention that is indefinite or otherwise arbitrary is not acceptable'. We had this promise, but according to the most recent Australian Human Rights Commission report, 2011 Immigration detention at Villawood, they say that there are:


… 6819 people, including 1030 children, in immigration detention in Australia – 4304 on the mainland and 2515 on Christmas Island. More than half of those people had been detained for longer than six months, and more than 750 people had been detained for longer than a year.


This parliament should ask questions about why these practices are still continuing today. There is no justification for holding asylum seekers in detention centres once basic health and security checks are completed. It is clear that the checks are not being completed in a timely manner, and this has led to overcrowding in detention centres with all the attendant problems.


I support this motion in the hope that it will publicly air and stop the cruel and odious practice of indefinite arbitrary detention of asylum seekers. The government appears to have completely abandoned its New Directions in Detention policy. We simply cannot continue to support a policy of indefinite mandatory detention with its terrible human cost to this nation and to our reputation in this parliament. Instead of resourcing the Department Of Immigration and Citizenship to carry out health and security checks, what do we see the government doing? As my colleague the member for Denison said, we see them spending huge amounts of money to build new detention centres and, of course, to refurbish other facilities such as Northam in my electorate to hold increasing numbers of detention detainees.

Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (11:16):  It is clear, for reasons that other members have made clear in this House and as I raised earlier, that mandatory detention has failed. I welcome anything we can do to shed light on the effects of the policy of mandatory detention in this country. I hope that mandatory detention is treated as sufficiently serious an issue that we can move to establishing a joint select committee on it so that both houses of parliament can take the opportunity of the composition of the current parliament to have, once and for all, a comprehensive inquiry into the merits or otherwise of our mandatory detention system. I thank the member for Cook for including in his amendment to his motion calling for a select committee on Australia's immigration detention network some of the terms of reference that we think would be necessary to give that kind of breadth and impetus to the committee. I do hope that, over coming days, we can reach agreement that this ought to be a joint select committee.


It is clear that mandatory detention has failed. We know it has failed from psychiatrist after psychiatrist, mental health expert after mental health expert and human rights commissioner after human rights commissioner coming before us, the media and the Australian people to tell us about the appalling effects on an individual's mental health and wellbeing from being locked up behind razor wire indefinitely without knowing their fate. Most particularly, we know and can no longer close our eyes to the horrible life-ruining effects it has on children—children of families who have members in detention and children who are in detention themselves. There can be no excuse for the continued incarceration of children whose parents have fled to Australia. They have fled some of the most appalling persecution conditions—conditions that we send our soldiers overseas to fight against—but we then take them and lock them up. Mandatory detention has failed because it treats them as unlawful people who have committed no crime. It treats them worse than criminals. At least criminals know when they are going to be released; people in detention do not.


We know that the system of mandatory detention has failed because it is now being prosecuted for purely political reasons. It has become an issue of who can be toughest on this issue in the hope that it will win some votes somewhere. We have lost any defining policy behind our immigration system. We know that mandatory detention has failed because it is the most costly alternative available to us, with at least a billion dollars a year being spent on a so-called border protection policy which has nothing to do with national security issues but has everything to do with attempts to win votes domestically.


My colleague on the crossbench the member for Denison made a point about people smugglers. I have no doubt that there are some very unsavoury people who are people smugglers, but for this somehow to be made an issue not of protecting the rights of asylum seekers but of breaking the model of people smugglers is completely the wrong approach. If I, and I suspect most Australians, were in the position where I or my family were being threatened, where there was war around me or where I or people I knew were being persecuted I would do anything I could to get out of my country, including paying some money to someone to get me out. I think most fair-minded people would feel the same way. The more we talk about people smugglers, the more we ignore the fact that we are talking about individuals seeking assistance to flee appalling conditions. I am reminded that it was not always like this in Australia.

Labor's denial and failure over three years has created chaos, cost and misery in our detention network. As I said earlier in this House, no-one will be more pleased than I if the boats stop but this will not erase the havoc caused by Labor and their denial and their failed policies. In November 2007 there were just four people who had arrived illegally by boat in our detention network. Under Labor that number has risen to over 6,500—almost double the peak that was recorded under the coalition government. Over the last several years we have seen a litany of chaos, abuse and cost blow-outs in this detention network, which defy imagination.


It was all started by this government's failure to address their own policy measures introduced to soften the border protection regime that they inherited from the coalition government. When they softened those laws, over 11,100 people came to our shores. We had an increase in our detention population, as I have mentioned, to over 6,800. The time spent in detention increased from just over 60 days to almost 180 days. More than 60 per cent of the people who are in our detention network now have been there for more than six months.


We have had incidents of abuse, not only amongst detainees, but in particular against those Australians who are working in those centres. There have been over 70 incidents and allegations of abuse have been levelled against those in detention centres in just this financial year alone.


This is a network that is in absolute crisis. It has been in a rolling crisis since there was what was reported as a bloody fight breaking out on 21 November 2009 on Christmas Island involving 150 Afghans and Sri Lankans. That matter was over a year ago, and we have seen chorus of incidents, from further rooftop protests on 20 to 22 September 2010, 90 detainees breaking out of the Northern Immigration Detention Facility in September of last year and, on 15 November a violent brawl at Broadmeadows. On 17 November there was a rooftop protest at Villawood and at the Airport Lodge between 7 to 10 February 1l people were hospitalised and a further 11 taken to the watch house after another disturbance and riot. On 27 and 28 February there was a riot at Christmas Island in the family compound, where 13 people were injured, windows were smashed, three asylum seekers were arrested and 15 young males were moved off the island. On 16 March there was a breakout at the Asti Motel.


On 17 March there was a protest at Curtin and also on 17 March a young Afghan man died at Sherga. On 28 March a 20 year-old Afghan asylum seeker died at the Curtin detention centre and on 12 and 13 March there were mass breakouts at Christmas Island followed by the horrendous riots which saw Commonwealth officers having to retake a Commonwealth facility by force. There were the Villawood riots that were proceeded by an improvised explosive device being found in that detention centre some four weeks before that whole area of the compound was torched—something the minister did not even know about. We have an average of more than three critical incidents of the types I have been referring to—of self-abuse, assaults and escapes—occurring in our detention network every single day. This is something that demands an inquiry of this House. The terms of reference I have circulated for that inquiry are there for all to see and go in some detail into the matters that we should be looking at. We should be looking at how the riots occurred and what steps were taken by the government to avoid them. We should be looking at the procedures in place in our detention network to ensure that staff are safe, can be catered for, can be looked after and can defend and protect themselves in the course of what can often be incredibly dangerous duties. There should be codes of conduct that are enforceable so that Serco officers and other Australians working in this environment can ensure good public order.


Australians were horrified and appalled by the behaviour we saw in our detention network over these last months. They were shaking their heads; many of them said, 'Enough is enough.' Enough is enough of the rolling crisis in our detention network and the government's attempt to not have these matters exposed to full public scrutiny.


There are also issues in the detention network around the welfare of those who are being held within detention itself. As I said, when the coalition government left office there were just four people in detention who had arrived by boat. That is how you avoid having more than three critical incidents every day in your detention network—when there is actually no-one in them. That is our objective. That is why we have always said we wanted to stop the boats, because when you do you do not have the havoc that is caused. I am amazed that the current government took almost three years to realise that their failed policies were the problem. Their policies were the reason that our detention network was filling up, causing the tension, the stress and the pressures that have led to this appalling series of incidents right across the detention network, including self-harm.


It took almost two years for the government to decide to use the powers that were created in 2005 in the Migration Act by the coalition government to enable children to be released into the community under residence determination orders. Why did it take so long? Why did it take so long for more than 1,000 children to be held within the detention network and not released into the community under residence determination orders? The minister has had that power ever since he took up his oath and the minister before him had that power when he took up his oath. But as 1,000 children got onto boats under this government's policies and made their way to our shores and into our detention network, where they have largely stayed till this day, this government sat there for almost two years and did absolutely nothing, not using any of the powers it had under the act to deal with this very serious issue.


Then, last year, they made this grand announcement implying that they would take children out from behind razor wire. They have not been behind razor wire since 2005, when just 59 children were in detention and were released into the community by the coalition government under the reforms that we made at that time.


All of these matters need to be ventilated. I do not seek to muzzle any member of this chamber—or in the other chamber if we sought to make this a joint parliamentary inquiry. It is important that we ask all the questions and put it all under the microscope, and that is why I gave my commitment to the crossbenchers and the Greens to amend the motion. All of the specific issues that they have asked to be raised in our discussions over the last week have now been included in the terms of reference for this inquiry. In my discussions with all of the crossbenchers whom I have had the opportunity to speak with personally, I have sought to include the matters they have raised in these terms of reference, because no member of this parliament should be muzzled in seeking to ask the questions and get the answers as to what is happening in our detention network.


In the motion before the House earlier today, we had debated the government's Malaysian five-for-one people swap. As I mentioned in my remarks on that matter, this is a deal which is fraught with difficulty, is far from completed and, most significantly, fails to provide the guarantees required under our Migration Act for the welfare of those people who will be sent to Malaysia under this arrangement.


When we consider these matters, it is important that we get the policies right. We will see whether the measure that the government is introducing stops the boats or not. We will wait. No-one will be happier than me if boats stop coming, but it has to be done the right way. The policies that the coalition put in place when we were in government not only stopped the boats but reduced the detention population of those who came by boat to just four. That is the outcome that we dearly seek.


So I implore members of this House to take up the opportunity for an inquiry that will be able to ask witnesses to give evidence in camera, to travel and to hear from people who have experience of the immigration network about how they work in and operate it and the resources and other things that they need; and to look into the cost, which has blown out to more than $3 billion over the last couple of years through the waste and mismanagement and failures of this government's policies. Whether the boats stop coming or not, the mess this government has created in our detention network is a national disgrace. It is a blight on our budget and it is a blight on our record for one simple reason: this government's policies failed. We need to have an inquiry to look into the mess it has created.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2011-05-30,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (10:51):  This motion submitted by the member for Cook is sold to the parliament and the public as a sincere effort to shine a light on the way the nation's detention network is run, demanding of the parliament and, principally, the government transparency and a willingness to critically examine the management of this network. In short, this is not a call for a serious examination. It is not a move to provide genuine recommendations for the way detention centres are managed to enhance their operation. I imagine it is not even a real attempt to reconsider the model of detention. This is simply a political stunt by the opposition, who, incapable of putting forward a viable, workable alternative, seek to flex their intellectual muscle by calling for—wait for it—a parliamentary inquiry. With the opposition deprived of attention and having an inability to breathe life back into a shabby approach to the issue of asylum seekers, we are now meant to believe that the member for Cook is seeking to pursue serious policy outcomes. An opposition that refuses to join other multi-party committees tasked with dealing with the gravest policy issue confronting our generation and those that follow—climate change—now calls on the parliament to join with it in a political exercise designed to generate advantage for the coalition, not for the nation. A member who just a few short months ago could not allow grieving families the peace to bury their own and who instead, with his public remarks, poured shame onto a period of intense grief, has now struck within himself a vein of compassion. He saunters into the chamber showing us his confected concern that masks a ruptured conscience.


What has prompted this motion by the member for Cook? What in the last two or so weeks has prompted the member for Cook into this sudden push for a parliamentary inquiry? What has changed that has made this so important for the member for Cook to bring this on now is simple: the announcement made by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship on Saturday, 7 May. The member for Cook fears that the government is putting in place its election commitment for a regional cooperation network to help end the people-smuggling model. The member for Cook, like many opposite, is afraid that the government's policies will have the desired effect of putting in place a sharp disincentive for people smugglers and those contemplating taking the dangerous journey by boat to Australia. What we have is simply the member for Cook trying to squeeze every last drop of political capital out of the human misery of irregular migration and people smuggling. If he were genuinely concerned with the events in part (a) of his motion, we would have heard about this proposed inquiry more than a month ago. The reason we did not hear about it is because the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship responded quickly and effectively to the events on Christmas Island and at Villawood by announcing an arms-length independent inquiry led by experienced public servants Helen Williams and Dr Allan Hawke. This is the right and proper place for a sober examination of what occurred and what needs to be done to help avoid these terrible scenes happening again.


Even if we accepted that the proper place for examination of the events on Christmas Island and Villawood was a parliamentary inquiry, what is this proposed inquiry supposed to achieve? Parliamentary inquiries are supposed to be vehicles to get to the bottom of a particular event or to challenge policy settings. Is the member for Cook seriously suggesting that we should end mandatory detention—a policy that has enjoyed bipartisan support for over 15 years? The government has a policy of mandatory detention of unauthorised arrivals for the purpose of health, identity and security checks—which I thought were things that the member for Cook supported. The terms of reference put forward by the member for Cook have no real focus or desired outcome. Why? For the coalition, it is more important to continue to talk about asylum seekers or boat people than to come up with real policy solutions to tackle major challenges like people smuggling in our region.


The gall and hypocrisy embedded in this motion should drive the House away from it. The opposition would ask that the government be judged when they have shunned judgment themselves, knowing that judgment of their performance would yield little to be proud of and much to be ashamed of. The rollcall of infamous incidents stands out with innocent people caught by the fractures and flaws of their system. Vivian Alvarez Solon was unlawfully removed to the Philippines in July 2001. Four years later it emerged that she had been deported, although the government had known of the mistake two years earlier. Cornelia Rau, an Australian permanent resident, was unlawfully detained for a period of 10 months back in 2004-05. Peter Qasim was held in detention for seven years. Then there were mother and daughter Virginia and Naomi Leong. Virginia Leong, a Malaysian citizen, was arrested and placed under mandatory detention in 2001 for attempting to leave Australia without the correct papers. She was two months pregnant at the time of her detention.


What of the coalition's own efforts to reach regional understanding to tackle people smuggling? The former government, headed by a Prime Minister who was the self-appointed deputy sheriff of the Asia-Pacific, were able to muster only an island state to form the basis of their Pacific solution. Of the 13 or so independent states within the Pacific, only one agreed to their Pacific solution. And then they told us that they could bring their own regional solution, no doubt through their boat phone—with only one other country on the other end of the line—while in the background, under their watch, there were fires, breakouts and violence at Woomera and Baxter. In terms of transparency and openness, one only needs to compare our record to theirs, and we are quite prepared to do so. This government is open and accountable about its immigration detention system, unlike those opposite when they were last in office.


As I have mentioned, we have already announced independent reviews into the incidents at Christmas Island and Villawood detention centre, and the Ombudsman consistently investigates the detention system. I also understand that the minister has fielded more than 1,200 questions on notice as part of the Senate estimates process. We are prepared to consider genuine proposals for changes to improve the operation of the detention network and the safety and security of those who live or work within it. We are building regional solutions to the regional problem of irregular migration and people smuggling. We have secured the agreement of more than 30 countries to a sustainable regional cooperation framework for dealing with asylum seekers. We are implementing that framework through cooperative arrangements with interested countries in the region, beginning with a landmark transfer arrangement with Malaysia.


In October last year, the Prime Minister and the immigration minister announced that the government would move the majority of children and vulnerable family groups out of immigration detention facilities and into community based accommodation by the end of June this year, and we are well on track to meet that commitment. We also committed to ensuring that asylum seekers within the immigration detention facilities are housed in humane, appropriate conditions and are provided with appropriate services and care. We have long acknowledged the pressures on our detention system and we are working hard to relieve that pressure by improving processing times for asylum claims and delivering a regional solution to the problem of irregular migration.


I noticed that the member for Cook in his proposed motion has again revisited the issue of the costs of damage caused by the fires at Villawood detention centre. This is an issue that was particularly embarrassing for him when he raised it during question time during budget week. His question suggested a great big cover-up by the government. The response by the minister for immigration left the member for Cook red-faced. The Commonwealth is not liable for the damage to detention centres at Christmas Island and Villawood; that is covered by Serco's insurance.


Minister Bowen has announced a range of measures to strengthen the consequences of criminal behaviour in immigration detention, including the amendments to the character test which are currently before the House. I am told the member for Cook received written advice from the department's senior legal team as well as a briefing on the legislation weeks ago—and, still, I do not believe we are any wiser on whether or not the coalition will support the reform. The changes send a strong and clear message that criminal behaviour in detention centres will not be tolerated. Will the member for Cook step up and support these changes—or is it all talk yet again?


There is no question that the government's policy of detention will have its costs. This is something that the Liberal Party know about—they were, after all, the party that spent hundreds of millions of dollars building the facility on Christmas Island. Our costs in the budget for asylum seeker management cover the new measures the government is taking to break the business model of the people smugglers, the building of a regional solution and the costs of processing. When taking into account all the measures considered here today by the government and our record of being open and transparent on this sensitive issue, the contrasts are clear for all to see in the newfound commitment to openness and transparency that those opposite refused to embrace when they were in government.

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2011-05-30,"



Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (11:01):  I rise to support this motion moved by the member for Cook. If the member for Chifley, the government member who just spoke on this motion, is the sum total of the government's defence as to why this parliament should not look into the government's detention network debacle, I hope that this parliament can see through such transparently naive and, quite frankly, petty and silly arguments.


We are sent here to this parliament to do many things in representing our constituents but, very importantly, this parliament should hold the executive to account. This is what this motion is really about. It is framed around the detention network, but the decision this parliament makes on it will be about what role the parliament should legitimately play. And it is vital that this parliament hold the executive to account on this issue.


This is a parliament that was supposed to be different. This is a parliament that was supposed to be more muscular and was going to assert its independence from the executive. The Labor Party when they came into government were going to 'allow sunlight in on government decisions'; yet we just heard the one contribution to this debate from the government slamming the reasons that we should have this detention network inquiry.


Our detention network does need parliamentary scrutiny. It has been gripped by a rolling crisis that culminated in March and April this year with the riots and the violent incidences that we saw at Christmas Island and Villawood. A lot has been said about those riots but beyond those we know that there are three critical incidents a day within our detention network. These can range from assaults on officers through to self-harm, riots, the setting of fires, homemade bombs and, sadly, even deaths. The incident of the improvised explosive device at Villawood was not even considered important enough to report to the minister—who was notified on talkback radio about what was occurring within his own network.


There has been a collapse of our detention network, and it is not the result of bad luck or happenstance and it is certainly not the result of international conditions; it is the direct result of failed government policies. When the Labor Party came to office there were four people in our detention network who had arrived illegally by boat. Then Labor took these fateful decisions in August 2008 that resulted in the people-smuggling model being reinvigorated. And, of course, we know what has happened since then: 227 illegal boat arrivals carrying over 11,000 people. Julia Gillard as Prime Minister has presided over 86 boat arrivals and over 4,800 people being smuggled here illegally.


If the government could kill the people-smuggling model and show some resolve and do something to stop these arrivals, we would not have the need for this inquiry into our detention network. Because there has been this massive influx of people and a massive expansion of the network, we have had the situation where people have been detained for much longer as government agencies struggle to deal with the consequences of Labor's failure. Because is it so hard to process such a large number of people, 60 per cent of detainees have now been detained for over six months. Average processing time has blown out from 61 days to over 170 days. Taxpayers' money has been squandered at an astonishing rate. An extra $3 million of taxpayers' money has been expended on our detention network. If these are not things that this parliament should be looking into, it is hard to imagine what MPs are doing here.


We need to know what happened at Christmas Island; we need to know what happened at Villawood; we need to know what is happening in an ongoing way within our detention network; we need to know what can be done better; and we need to understand how our detention network got to this stage in the first place and what the government's plans are to do something about it. When you are seeing Commonwealth property destroyed, taxpayers' money squandered, Commonwealth employees assaulted, criminal acts committed, explosive devices being detected, mass breakouts, suicides and self-harm—and when you are seeing all this as a direct result of the failure of government policy—this parliament must take action. I urge all members to support this motion.

"Wilkie, Andrew, MP",Ind.,2011-05-30,"



Mr WILKIE
 (Denison) (11:06):  You do not have to search far for evidence that Australia's mandatory detention system is in crisis. Most nights on the news we see graphic images of the failure: people caged like criminals, riots, fires, suicide, women and children mourning their dead. And who can forget the gut-wrenching images of a boat laden with people seeking asylum smashing into Christmas Island. Yet still they come—men, women and children risking their lives to seek asylum in the country with a national anthem that boasts of golden soil and wealth for toil and, for those who have come across the seas, boundless plains to share.


These people do not come here by jumping some queue. There is no queue when you are fleeing for your life in the middle of the night or rotting in some displaced persons camp. Nor do they risk the hazardous and expensive journey to Australia because they want to be locked up for God knows how long. No, asylum seekers make their treacherous journeys because their situations are so dire. That is why they are willing to split up their families, leave behind all their possessions and risk their lives as they do. Imagine being in that position where your best option is to put your life and probably all your cash in the hands of some dodgy people smuggler.


How does Australia greet these desperate people who are committing no crime? By locking them up for months and years in circumstances the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights noted last week are 'arbitrary', 'in breach of international law' and which have 'for many years cast a shadow over Australia's human rights record.' If we needed more proof that this is a broken system, we have also got the report from the Australian Human Rights Commission on Sydney's Villawood detention centre. Commission President Catherine Branson describes ghost-like people covered in emotional and physical scars thinking constantly of suicide and self-harm. She told the ABC last week:


You get the sense, walking in, of disturbed people, depressed people, agitated people. There is not a sense of normality around you.


Moreover she said:


I think the average Australian would be disturbed if required to spend even a short period of time living there.


Not only is mandatory detention cruel and inhumane, it simply does not work. It is a failed and costly experiment that has gone on for much too long. Yet next year the government will spend more than $700 million on asylum seeker detention and related costs, equating to about $90,000 a year for every asylum seeker who makes it to Australia. The federal government cannot keep kidding itself that its irregular immigration policy is working and just keep building new detention centres. In Tasmania, for instance, the government is about to spend $15 million on a temporary detention centre at Pontville to house asylum seekers for just six months. Putting the humanitarian dimension to one side, is this the best use of taxpayer dollars? Of course not.


I have long opposed mandatory detention anywhere and these latest facilities will be no different. These are people who have knocked on Australia's door seeking asylum and it is simply wrong to cage them behind wire, whether it be in Pontville or on Christmas Island. We must accept that mandatory detention does not deter asylum seekers and we must find a better solution. We must acknowledge that the proliferation of detention centres in Australia is proof the federal government's asylum seeker policy is broken.


I make the point again, and I will keep making it until the government and the opposition start listening, that this is not a border security problem. It is much more complex than that and it needs a sophisticated solution that deals genuinely with source, first-asylum and transit countries. No wonder I support the establishment of a parliamentary committee on Australia's immigration detention system. I trust it will not be a political circus, but instead the first step to Australia adopting a more humane and effective approach to dealing with the wretched souls risking all to carve out a better life here in our lucky country. Indeed, for those who have come across the seas, we do in fact have boundless plains to share.

"Moylan, Judi, MP",LP,2011-05-30,"



Mrs MOYLAN
 (Pearce) (11:11):  The issue of mandatory detention for asylum seekers has been much debated and much criticised since it was first implemented by the Labor government in 1992. It is a negative and punitive system of dealing with those who come to our shores seeking asylum. Apart from the all-too-apparent negative effects on people incarcerated in detention prisons, the system is administratively demanding and extremely costly. The original intention when mandatory detention was introduced by the Labor government in 1992 was to act as a deterrent to those seeking to come to our shores. Originally it was aimed at a very small number of people arriving by boat. Ten years after the implementation of the policy there were 5,000 boat arrivals—so much for its deterrent capacity. Similarly, the policy of temporary protection visas was introduced as a deterrent. In the five years prior to temporary protection visas being introduced there were 3,103 boat arrivals. In the five years following the introduction of temporary protection visas there were over 11,000 arrivals. It is time we looked at these policies in the cold light of day and worked toward a durable solution—like my colleague the member for Denison has just outlined—so that we can deal with the problem of people fleeing the threat of death and oppression in their own countries without imposing further punitive measures on them.


Examining the operation of detention centres may have the positive impact of demonstrating the futility of locking people up for long periods of time in a prison-like system that leaves them further traumatised and does little or nothing to resolve the bigger issues of asylum seekers in our region. From 2001 to 2005 I worked with others in this place for hard-won changes that were made to the system of mandatory detention, including an agreement that 12,000 refugees living in the purgatory of the temporary protection visa system would be given permanent visas, the Ombudsman would regularly report to this parliament on why people continued to be held in immigration detention and families with children would not be placed in immigration detention centres except as a last resort.


Those policies were implemented and then we saw the Labor government come in on the promise of a New Directions in Detention policy. The government acknowledged that 'detention that is indefinite or otherwise arbitrary is not acceptable'. We had this promise, but according to the most recent Australian Human Rights Commission report, 2011 Immigration detention at Villawood, they say that there are:


… 6819 people, including 1030 children, in immigration detention in Australia – 4304 on the mainland and 2515 on Christmas Island. More than half of those people had been detained for longer than six months, and more than 750 people had been detained for longer than a year.


This parliament should ask questions about why these practices are still continuing today. There is no justification for holding asylum seekers in detention centres once basic health and security checks are completed. It is clear that the checks are not being completed in a timely manner, and this has led to overcrowding in detention centres with all the attendant problems.


I support this motion in the hope that it will publicly air and stop the cruel and odious practice of indefinite arbitrary detention of asylum seekers. The government appears to have completely abandoned its New Directions in Detention policy. We simply cannot continue to support a policy of indefinite mandatory detention with its terrible human cost to this nation and to our reputation in this parliament. Instead of resourcing the Department Of Immigration and Citizenship to carry out health and security checks, what do we see the government doing? As my colleague the member for Denison said, we see them spending huge amounts of money to build new detention centres and, of course, to refurbish other facilities such as Northam in my electorate to hold increasing numbers of detention detainees.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2011-05-30,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (11:16):  It is clear, for reasons that other members have made clear in this House and as I raised earlier, that mandatory detention has failed. I welcome anything we can do to shed light on the effects of the policy of mandatory detention in this country. I hope that mandatory detention is treated as sufficiently serious an issue that we can move to establishing a joint select committee on it so that both houses of parliament can take the opportunity of the composition of the current parliament to have, once and for all, a comprehensive inquiry into the merits or otherwise of our mandatory detention system. I thank the member for Cook for including in his amendment to his motion calling for a select committee on Australia's immigration detention network some of the terms of reference that we think would be necessary to give that kind of breadth and impetus to the committee. I do hope that, over coming days, we can reach agreement that this ought to be a joint select committee.


It is clear that mandatory detention has failed. We know it has failed from psychiatrist after psychiatrist, mental health expert after mental health expert and human rights commissioner after human rights commissioner coming before us, the media and the Australian people to tell us about the appalling effects on an individual's mental health and wellbeing from being locked up behind razor wire indefinitely without knowing their fate. Most particularly, we know and can no longer close our eyes to the horrible life-ruining effects it has on children—children of families who have members in detention and children who are in detention themselves. There can be no excuse for the continued incarceration of children whose parents have fled to Australia. They have fled some of the most appalling persecution conditions—conditions that we send our soldiers overseas to fight against—but we then take them and lock them up. Mandatory detention has failed because it treats them as unlawful people who have committed no crime. It treats them worse than criminals. At least criminals know when they are going to be released; people in detention do not.


We know that the system of mandatory detention has failed because it is now being prosecuted for purely political reasons. It has become an issue of who can be toughest on this issue in the hope that it will win some votes somewhere. We have lost any defining policy behind our immigration system. We know that mandatory detention has failed because it is the most costly alternative available to us, with at least a billion dollars a year being spent on a so-called border protection policy which has nothing to do with national security issues but has everything to do with attempts to win votes domestically.


My colleague on the crossbench the member for Denison made a point about people smugglers. I have no doubt that there are some very unsavoury people who are people smugglers, but for this somehow to be made an issue not of protecting the rights of asylum seekers but of breaking the model of people smugglers is completely the wrong approach. If I, and I suspect most Australians, were in the position where I or my family were being threatened, where there was war around me or where I or people I knew were being persecuted I would do anything I could to get out of my country, including paying some money to someone to get me out. I think most fair-minded people would feel the same way. The more we talk about people smugglers, the more we ignore the fact that we are talking about individuals seeking assistance to flee appalling conditions. I am reminded that it was not always like this in Australia.

Mr NEUMANN (

Blair

I move:





That this House:





(1) recognises that:





(a) there are about three million Au
stralians who still smoke; and





(b) tobacco is a le
thal product, killing around 15
000 Australians every year; and





(2) calls on all Members and political parties to immediately stop accepting political donations from tobacco companies.



The Leader of the Opposition likes to say no. In fact, he is good at saying no—he is addicted to it. He should say no to political donations from tobacco companies. Why? Because three million Australians smoke tobacco. Smoking is one of the leading causes of preventable death and disease among Australians, killing about 15,000 Australians a year. On average, the life expectancy of people who smoke is 10 years less than that of lifelong nonsmokers. Tobacco smoking not only causes diseases but impedes treatment. Smokers' wounds take longer to heal and they use hospital services more than nonsmokers. Second-hand smoke is a serious health hazard: it contains 250 toxic substances, some of which are in the worst categories of cancer-causing substances.


In 2008, the Commonwealth Department of Health and Ageing estimated the social and economic cost of tobacco use to Australian society was $31.5 billion each year—and that includes of course the health costs. That is an increase of 50 per cent from the last estimate in 1998-99. That represents 56.2 per cent of the costs of all drug use—including alcohol, illicit drugs and tobacco. Research in the Medical Journal of Australia states that a fall of just over five per cent in smoking rates would save $4.5 billion to our national economy over the next 37 years. The smoking rate is much higher in Indigenous communities: one in two Indigenous Australians smoke and one in five will die from smoking related diseases.


The tobacco companies form a powerful, global cartel. They spend tens of millions of dollars annually on marketing and they employ highly skilled lobbyists and advertisers to maintain and increase tobacco use. Fortunately, unlike in many parts of the world, tobacco use is on the decline in Australia. Too often tobacco use is perceived to be solely a question of personal choice. The World Health Organisation tells us that tobacco users are aware of the health impacts and really want to quit.


The coalition parties are addicted to the political donations from tobacco. The Liberal and National parties have accepted a combined $3 million in donations from big tobacco, with more than $1.7 million of that coming after 2004 when, fortunately and bravely, the Australian Labor Party stopped accepting these poisonous donations. The Leader of the Opposition needs to kick his habit. As a former health minister, he knows that tobacco kills Australians each year and brings suffering to families across the country. Accepting donations from big tobacco is not acceptable given what we know about the dangerous nature of these substances. When will the Liberal and National parties stop defending big tobacco and start defending the health of Australians? When will they kick their habit of accepting money from those who manufacture these lethal substances? Why do they not give up on big tobacco? It is possibly because they are struggling to match the efforts of previous coalition administrations.


In 2009-10 British American Tobacco gave $130,385 to the national and state divisions of the Liberal Party, and $14,650 to the National Party—a total of $145,035 from British American Tobacco to the coalition. In 2009 Philip Morris gave $103,945 to the Liberal Party and $43,100 to the National Party—a total of $147,045. We know that big tobacco cannot be trusted with the facts.


This federal Labor government has acted on these matters. We have increased the tobacco excise by 25 per cent, we are restricting internet advertising of tobacco products and we are introducing mandatory plain packaging of tobacco products. This is supported by the Cancer Council, but, sadly, those opposite will not support it. We have launched the largest ever national tobacco campaign.


I say to the Leader of the Opposition: it is time to kick the habit. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: it is time to quit. I say to the Leader of the Opposition: it is time to stop the donations. We know that this is important. We know that smoking kills; it is as simple as that. Those opposite should have the courage of their convictions and stand up for the health of the Australian community and stop the donations.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(

"Briggs, Jamie, MP",LP,2011-05-30,"



Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayo) (11:25): I rise more out of pity than I do out of a genuine need to debate this motion. Realistically, this motion is a desperate bid from the Labor Party to try to create a political diversion in question time. With the mover of the motion not being able to fill five minutes on his own motion, we see just how desperate a bid this is to create a political opportunity for the Minister for Health and Ageing and her little sidekick, the Minister for Mental Health and Ageing. I think this is a desperate attempt from a desperate government that has big issues on its plate that it cannot deal with. Telling fibs to the Australian electorate prior to an election and then changing its mind straight after the election has probably been its biggest issue.


So it is with a bit of pity that we waste the parliament's time with this motion when there are so many other important things we could be talking about, particularly from a minister and a government mired in hypocrisy when it comes to this issue. The Minister for Health and Ageing gets in here every day—and I am sure we will see the theatrics again today—and tries to create a big storm about donations, but she was the beneficiary of corporate hospitality from Philip Morris. I am sure that everyone knows that the Minister for Health and Ageing is a huge Lleyton Hewitt fan and she was so desperate to see Lleyton play that she went ahead and accepted corporate hospitality from Philip Morris. I think it just shows the hypocrisy. There is nothing wrong with accepting corporate hospitality—I am sure that all members on both sides do—but there is something very wrong with the hypocrisy of a minister who comes into this place day after day and tries to suggest that, in effect, taking donations from organisations makes you corrupt, accessible to corruption or that your policies are being influenced by those donations.


If that is the case then let us just go through the record on donations and the use of Commonwealth money by the Labor Party. We know that each member of the Labor Party is a wholly owned subsidiary of the trade union movement in this country. The trade unions pay a hell of a lot of money to have that right over each of those members. We know in the last three years, leading to the 2010 election, that the Labor Party received some $20 million from its trade union masters—just at the federal level alone. Coincidentally, in the last two budgets the Labor government has handed the trade unions $20 million. What a coincidence! In the last two budgets the taxpayer—including everyone sitting in the gallery watching this debate—handed $10 million to the Trade Union Education Foundation. Another effort this year can be found on page 148 in the budget papers, for the information of the member for La Trobe, where the unions were handed another $10 million for another fund, the Building Australia's Future Workforce fund:


The Fund will provide … $10.0 million … to unions to enable them to provide tailored information and education resources to their membership.


And, of course, to complete the money-go-round of Labor Party and trade union donations there was $20 million from the unions to the Labor Party and $20 million back to the unions from the Australian taxpayer through the Labor government. Absolute, utter hypocrites! These people get in here and waste the parliament's time on matters relating to donations. They are complete and utter hypocrites. They spend their time getting their union masters to get them elected and then they give them back their money in government. They come into this place and waste the time of this parliament when we should be debating complete fibs about carbon taxes. We should be debating the integrity of a government that says one thing and then does another directly after an election. In the last parliament the now Leader of the Opposition outlined in this place on many occasions the complete rort that was Centenary House. Some members in this place remember the rort that was Centenary House. For those who do not remember, that was the deal the Labor Party gave themselves in a previous government, where they organised to have $36 million fleeced from the Australian taxpayer to pay for over-the-market rents from the ANAO at Centenary House in Barton.


This motion should be treated with contempt, because that is what the Australian Labor Party are showing by putting it to the parliament. This is a complete and utter joke. We know the record of the Minister for Health and Ageing in taking corporate hospitality from tobacco companies. We know this is a desperate attempt by the Labor Party to divert attention from the ongoing crisis, which is their base walking away from them because they fibbed to the Australian electorate before the last election.

"Smyth, Laura, MP",ALP,2011-05-30,"



Ms SMYTH
 (La Trobe) (11:30):  This motion, as all of us on this side of the House know, is about one thing: backbone. Either you accept donations from the tobacco industry and compromise your political views and your judgment on important issues of public policy or you take a stand and say that no amount of money is worth compromising good policy. Despite fairly valiant but quite sad attempts by the coalition to avoid taking a position on political donations from tobacco companies, this is an issue that we know all parties must face up to. If the coalition cannot stand up to big tobacco, how can we ever believe that it will stand up to big polluters? How will it ever stand up to people who do not want to distribute the profits and the benefits of the mining boom amongst ordinary Australians?


We have already seen in the last couple of weeks that the coalition will not even stand up for mum and dad shareholders on the issue of excessive executive pay. When it came to the vote, they backed executives over consumers and shareholders. They tried very hard to camouflage their position. They made all the right noises about the forgotten shareholders and standing up for forgotten consumers, forgotten employees and forgotten customers, but when it came to the vote they voted to look after executives.


This motion is yet another a litmus test for the coalition. Are they able to take tough decisions or will they simply dance for the highest bidder? Will they oppose good policy because their wealthy benefactors crack the whip? Who is in fact running the show for the opposition? Is it the member for Warringah? Is it Senator Minchin? Is it big tobacco or big polluters? Is it tobacco sceptics this week, or climate sceptics? Which big lobby group has its hands on the purse strings this week?


In this parliament we are dealing with the tough issues—issues that cannot and should not be determined by vested interests; issues that test all of us. It is important to listen to community perspectives in the policy debate and to listen to different perspectives, but there is a vast difference between taking advice and taking orders. We know that tobacco smoking is the leading preventable cause of premature death and disease in Australia. We know that smoking leads to a wide range of diseases, including many types of cancer, heart disease and stroke. We know that tobacco smoking costs our economy around $31.5 billion and that 84 per cent of new lung cancers in men and 77 per cent of new lung cancers in women result from smoking. We have heard that the Cancer Council of Australia estimates that smoking claims the lives of more than 15,000 Australians each year. If we are really talking about forgotten families, let us have a chat about the families of those 15,000. Let us talk about their dependants—their kids, their husbands, their wives—their friends and the colleagues they leave behind.


That is why those of us on this side of the House decided it was impossible to accept political donations from tobacco interests. I am confident that some on the other side of the House share that view, but unfortunately the vast majority of those on the other side of the House appear to have ducked the issue. The ALP knows it is not possible to legislate effectively to decrease the effects of tobacco while accepting donations from tobacco companies. Australians should be asking why other political parties do not do the same.


We know that tobacco companies have donated $3 million to the Liberal and National parties over the last 12 years. We also know that those parties are dragging their feet on the issue of plain packaging for cigarettes, something that doctors and other health professionals have been calling for to try to curb the rate of smoking, particularly in the group most vulnerable to tobacco marketing: young people. British American Tobacco states clearly in its charter that the political donations it makes are given specifically to influence the debate on issues affecting the company and its business. In fact, its website states:


Such payments can only be made for the purpose of influencing the debate on issues affecting the company or Group.


There is no escaping it: tobacco companies expect results from their donations. Tobacco companies expect to sway the views of political parties that accept their donations. They have no other purpose. There can be no other conclusion.


When questioned about all of this, all the Leader of the Opposition can feebly say is, 'They've wasted their money.' I think most of us would consider that money given to the coalition is a complete waste, but it really is insulting to the Australian public to expect them to believe that political donations from tobacco companies will not have an influence on the opposition's policy position. Australians need to ask themselves how a party that can do the bidding of tobacco companies, polluters and other big vested interests can still say that they stand for forgotten families.

"Buchholz, Scott, MP",LP,2011-05-30,"



Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright) (11:35):  The debate on this motion on political donations from tobacco companies is nothing more than a diversion from the main game in Australia at the moment: the carbon tax and asylum seekers. The government has found itself in a downward spiral of polling across the nation, and this is a poor attempt to try to divert attention away from what is a critical situation for this nation.


I will start by stating that the coalition does not encourage smoking. We never have and will not ever. I will elaborate on the coalition's position on smoking over the last couple of years. Statistics show that under the coalition government there was a decline in smoking rates across Australia. Under the coalition government the prevalence of smoking declined from 21.8 per cent in 1998 to 16.6 per cent in 2007, a substantial decrease. These rates were amongst the lowest in the world. The decline was amongst the biggest falls among OECD countries, and the fall in the smoking rate for women was the greatest among OECD countries. It was at that time that Tony Abbott, who was then the Minister for Health and Ageing, introduced the current graphic health warnings that you see on cigarette packages today. It was the coalition that first proposed an increase in tobacco excise in 2009, a measure taken onboard later by subsequent governments. It is very, very difficult for the government to go and take the moral high ground on this debate. We hear figures bandied about along the lines of $3 million that the coalition has accepted—over the last 10 years, mind you, and on a downward trend—from the tobacco companies. But what they omit to say is that, at the very same time, the Labor government have taken over $20 million in donations from the union movement, some of which has been derived from problem gambling. It is worth noting that Australia has the lowest smoking rate per capita in the world and yet it has one of the highest gambling rates in the world.


With reference to the $20 million received over the last period of time from unions, this budget also allocated a $10 million kick-back to the unions for various reasons, including the development of web pages. Ten million dollars? I created a web page in my electorate the other day for $2,300—quite a significant difference in cost-effectiveness, but then that goes to the moral high ground that Labor want to take on the issue of smoking.


I also pick up the point that Labor actually need to stand up to the unions and say, 'No longer will we take money from the unions that has been derived from problem gamblers.' I have some stats here on problem gambling in Australia. First, 40 per cent of all money lost on pokies comes from problem gamblers. In addition, there are probably about 100,000 addicted gamblers, with an additional 200,000 at significant risk. And poker machines can take up to $1,200 an hour out of mums' and dads' and working families' pockets, per machine around the country. The Alfred Hospital cite figures that one in five people who present in emergency rooms for attempted suicide have some type of gambling issue as their primary cause of attempted suicide.


It is farcical that we are even having this debate. All the data is available for public knowledge. We as a coalition did not shrink away from our responsibility, and our proven track record, for the downward spiralling cigarette intake.


In finishing I want to allude to a quote from ex Prime Minister Rudd—potentially, the way things are going, he could be the next leader of the Australian Labor Party—from 2007. He was quoted as saying on gaming:


What I've said before, and I don't back away from it one minute, is I don't like poker machines. I've said that even though I was working in the Queensland government at the time when poker machines were introduced. That was a decision, together with other decisions, to introduce poker machines which I don't think have been helpful for working families.


I encourage this debate to be done, concluded, so we can get back to the task at hand of debating the state of the nation when it comes to the carbon tax, asylum seekers and issues that impact on families.

"Leigh, Andrew, MP",ALP,2011-05-30,"



Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (11:40):  Each year 15,000 Australians die from smoking. That means 41 people a day. By the time this debate has concluded, an Australian will have died because she smoked. We also know that smokers harm those around them—children who inhale passive smoke, or the one-in-six babies born to mothers who smoked while pregnant. Smoking rates in regional areas are twice as high as in the cities, and people in the bush have higher death rates from lung cancer, heart disease, asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.


These are the stark realities of smoking. Yet there remain groups in this place that continue to profit from this reality. The self-proclaimed party of responsibility refuses to take responsibility for the devastating impact of tobacco on Australians' health. And the self-proclaimed party of the bush shows less concern for the health of rural Australians than the property rights of tobacco companies.


Last week I received an email from a constituent about why we should support the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health and Ageing in their efforts to reduce smoking rates. The constituent wrote:


My great-grandfather, grandfather, father and one of my uncles all died from smoking-related conditions. Each of the latter three died 20-30 years before the life expectancy for their generation. My father's addiction contributed to two decades of poor health prior to his premature death, resulting in frequent periods where he was unable to work.


My siblings and I grew up in poverty, the effects of which are still evident, and the taxpayer bore the cost of his many hospitalisations as well as the cumulative years of income support our family depended on in lieu of employment. I say this so that you will understand my absence of sympathy for the 'principle argument', that tobacco companies have a right to make a profit from pushing legal drugs.


I was proud to join the Minister for Health and Ageing and the Minister for Indigenous Health earlier this year at the launch of an ad campaign designed by Indigenous Australians to help reduce Indigenous smoking rates, rates that are twice as high as for non-Indigenous Australians and a major contributor to the life expectancy gap. Yet those opposite seem set on blocking common-sense reforms like higher tobacco excise or the plain packaging of cigarettes. As with their stance on climate change, they are the party of 'no'. There is a precedent for this kind of nay-saying. Former opposition leader Billy Snedden said about the link between smoking and diseases such as lung cancer and heart disease: 'So far I have not seen any conclusive evidence to that effect and, as I understand the position, there is still some argument on the question.' The Leader of the Opposition today is like his predecessor of yore. Mr Abbott's denial of the science of climate change is the modern-day equivalent of Billy Snedden's denial of the link between smoking and cancer.


In Merchants of Doubt, Naomi Oreskes and Erik Conway document some remarkable parallels between the debate over climate change and earlier debates over tobacco smoking, acid rain and the hole in the ozone layer. In each case, those opposed to action tried to sow doubt. Oreskes and Conway quote a 1969 memo in which a tobacco industry executive makes clear the strategy: 'Doubt is our product, since it is the best means of competing with the body of fact that exists in the minds of the public.'


As late as 1995, Senator Minchin doubted the link between smoking and adverse health effects, yet even he has now come around. If a warhorse like Senator Minchin can change his mind and accept the science, there is hope for anyone. The Leader of the Opposition wrote in his book Battlelines:


Conservatism prefers facts to theory, practical demonstration to metaphysical abstraction; what works to what's in the mind's eye … Conservatives are not optimists or pessimists but realists.


On both climate change and smoking, the science is settled—and the solutions are clear. All that stands in the way are big polluters and big tobacco.


I know there are some in the Liberal and National Parties who are concerned about going cold turkey on accepting donations from big tobacco. But I can assure them that we will help them through this. We can offer them counselling. We will walk them through this. And they will have the best nicotine patch of all: the knowledge that they have, at long last, done the right thing for the health of young Australians.

"Van Manen, Bert, MP",LP,2011-05-30,"



Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde) (11:45):  This motion is a desperate attempt by this government to divert the attention of Australians from its many failures and from its proposed tax attack on Australian families and businesses. The coalition has a proven track record of decisive action in reducing the rate of smoking in Australia and whilst in government presided over the biggest ever fall in smoking rates. As a result, Australia now has one of the lowest smoking rates in the world.


This is not an argument about the consequences or effects of smoking on people's health; it is an argument about the rights of individuals and private companies to make donations to whichever political party they so wish. Donations to political parties are often subject to much discussion, but if a legal business wishes to donate funds to a political party of its choice, it is up to the party organisation to decide whether or not to accept those donations. As former Prime Minister John Howard once stated, if donations were given by corporations and individuals carrying on lawful activities there is no reason in principle why the donations should not be accepted. Is the government really suggesting that they too discriminate in whom they receive donations from?


There will always be differing opinions between individuals and groups, based upon many different factors. Therefore, it cannot be argued that a party is influenced by one or any of its benefactors. Previous speakers have mentioned that the coalition parties have received donations from tobacco companies over the last 10 or 12 years. Equally, the Labor Party has received large donations from its trade union supporters. In fact, over the period 2007 to 2010, it received in excess of $20 million in donations from the union movement. It is interesting to note that in the recent budget the union movement was rewarded with a $10 million allocation for a trade union education foundation grant. Previous to that there was another $10 million allocated to the union movement under the Building Australia's Future Workforce program. Equally, if we go a little bit further back in time, we see that the ALP is hypocritical in pursuing this motion when you consider its historical dealings with the Australian National Audit Office in 1993, with a lease that was above market rates of rent and above market rates of annual increases, the end result being that Australian taxpayers have paid more than $36 million over and above the standard market rates of rent for the period of the lease.


The Leader of the Opposition has a strong track record in relation to dealing with the health issues faced from smoking. When health minister, he was responsible for the introduction of the graphic warnings on cigarette packets that we see today. That was made compulsory. Under the coalition government smoking rates declined from a bit over 21 per cent in 1998 to approximately 17 per cent in 2007. These rates were the lowest smoking rates in the world. It was also the coalition that first proposed an increase in the tobacco excise, back in 2009, a measure that has now been adopted by the government.


Any suggestion that we are soft on tobacco companies is just plain nonsense, and the coalition's track record shows this quite clearly. Accepting donations from a particular corporation or organisation does not mean that a party changes its views. Any party should be able to accept donations from any local business or other organisation.

"Georganas, Steve, MP",ALP,2011-05-30,"



Mr GEORGANAS
 (Hindmarsh) (11:50):  I, too, like all the others on this side, rise in support of this motion. I am very pleased to do so on the eve of World No Tobacco Day, which will be observed tomorrow, 31 May, all around the globe, when the message will be given that smoking kills. Certainly, it is a very special message to younger people who have not taken up the habit yet but are being influenced by tobacco companies through their marketing, their packaging and through the colours on the packets. It is a message to them not to take up smoking, because we all know that tobacco kills.


I say this because tomorrow it will be seven years since I gave up. I was an addicted smoker—two packets a day—and I thought I would never give up. The damage that that has done to my body over a period of 30 years of smoking I cannot wish upon anyone. So I am very passionate about this debate.


I cannot believe what I am hearing from the opposite side this morning. Their argument about not supporting plain-packaged products is that the Labor Party receives donations from the unions. I say 'big deal'. I would much rather receive donations from an organisation that sticks up for workers' rights than from an organisation that is selling a product that is doing damage to people's health and that is trying to market their product to younger people, because that is the only new client they have here in Australia. I would rather receive donations from an organisation that assists people—workers—to ensure that they have rights at work. I have no problems with that. They can put up that argument as much as they like, but it is a non-argument; it is just a diversion from the real debate. The real debate is that they are receiving donations from companies that sell a product that is damaging people's health. These companies are looking at marketing their product to new clients, and their only new clients are teenagers and young people. With the laws in Australia not allowing the advertising of tobacco products, their only way of marketing is through packaging. This may not be about people giving up, but it is fundamental when it comes to people taking up smoking. Packaging is the last bastion of marketing that the tobacco companies have left to them.


It is absolutely devastating to know that there are still three million Australians who smoke and put their lives at risk every day and put the lives of others at risk through passive smoking. Smoking affects not just the people who light up but also their friends, families and workplace colleagues—and the consequences for their health can have an impact on their employment as well. Smoking damages not just you but everyone around you. Regardless of how many times you hear it, it is still a shocking statistic that 15,000 Australians die each year as a direct result of cigarette smoking—let alone the people who are dying indirectly from many other causes of tobacco smoking as well. That is 41 people dying every single day directly as a consequence of their smoking. And the Liberal and National parties on the other side are saying it is fine to receive donations from companies that contribute to these 15,000 deaths every year here in Australia.


I am very pleased to speak in support of this motion. Recognising that there is a serious problem is the most fundamental step towards addressing it. In fact, this government is already showing the strongest possible leadership on this issue. As we all know, we have introduced the world's first plain packaging to help people realise what putting a cigarette in their mouth really means: it means you are gambling with your life. I took up smoking when I was a teenager. Without a shadow of a doubt, if the packaging then looked like the plain packaging that we are going to have now, I would have thought twice about whether it was really something cool that I wanted to take up. This is what we are trying to get through to people. That could have saved me from 30 years of smoking and all the damage it has done to me. This is incredibly important because we know that eight out of 10 new smokers are young people. This is who the packaging is aimed at. We know that packaging and branding form a significant part of that appeal to smoke. (Time expired)

"Simpkins, Luke, MP",LP,2011-05-30,"



Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (11:55):  I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion. There is no doubt that the coalition is the party of effective action on smoking. Our leader, the Hon. Tony Abbott, acted to achieve great reductions in smoking rates when he was the health minister in the Howard government. The efforts of the Howard government on this issue are without peer. I remind members that the graphic health warnings that were introduced by the Leader of the Opposition when he was the health minister in the Howard government remain the only substantial effort made by a federal government to reduce smoking rates in recent history. In 1998 the smoking rate in this country was 22 per cent. By 2005 it had fallen to 17 per cent—the lowest on record and one of the lowest in the world. The Howard government was responsible for this through decisive initiatives and anti-smoking campaigns. I am proud to be part of the coalition, which has acted decisively and effectively with initiatives to reduce smoking rates. This is backed up by clear evidence on these matters. I say again that the Howard government was capable of making decisions and acting decisively with regard to policy and initiation of action.


I am afraid the only thing this government is capable of is politicking. I have provided evidence of this. Last week in parliament the health minister made a number of false accusations about the coalition when she suggested that she was going to introduce legislation on the plain packaging of cigarettes and tobacco. We hold true to our position that we will consider all legislation when we have seen the detail. We will make a decision when we see the bill and any regulations proposed. This is the right course of action.


But I remain a little concerned about whether we will see such legislation, because the government's only real skill is in politicking, not the delivery of programs. There is great hypocrisy within this government. They make a very poor attempt to castigate us for waiting to see this legislation. But, given their failure to deliver workable, effective and cost-efficient legislation on border control, pink batts, capital funding and set-top boxes, there is every reason to be careful about backing anything this failure of government proposes. The Australian people expect the opposition to be critical of any legislation the government proposes, let alone legislation that, it appears, does not even exist yet.


I would like to address the health issues inherent in this motion. We all care greatly about improving the health outcomes for Australians. I hope this is a priority for the government—because it is certainly a priority for the coalition. If we had an Abbott government, we would have seen action since the report on smoking issues was handed down in July 2009. Instead, we have seen several announcements, claims of action coming and claims of legislation coming et cetera. This is typical of this government. If this government is so committed to action on health, why hasn't it acted since July 2009. It has been almost two years and the only thing the government has done is this political stunt motion. This is a suggestion that we might actually see legislation in July—by the second anniversary of this report, we might actually see this government bring some legislation into the House of Representatives.


This demonstrates the Gillard government's idea of priorities. Instead of being concerned enough about the health of Australians to take action in July 2009, they wait two years and instead make a priority of bringing this pathetic political stunt before the House. The Gillard government, faced with an opportunity to address a health problem, decided to do nothing for two years. Trying to score political points is more important to them than any legislation, so that is what they do instead of bringing legislation to the House today. This is the priority for this government: delay and politics instead of real action. The difference between the Labor Party and the coalition is that we actually accomplished something: we did the graphic warnings and we reduced the smoking rate.


I note that this motion mentions that there are three million Australian smokers and 1,500 of them die each year from smoking. I am surprised that, after two years of talking about action and only now suggesting action in July 2011, the government would mention the number of people who actually die each year from smoking. I say again that I am proud of the coalition's record and I am glad that the Leader of the Opposition, when he was health minister in the Howard government, acted to reduce smoking rates. Many people's lives were saved as a result of us taking real action as opposed to the tragic alternative strategy of this government, which was to wait two years and play politics—and maybe there might be some legislation coming towards us in July.

Mrs GRIGGS
 (Solomon) (13:52):  In the lead-up to the 2010 federal election I campaigned to allow the empty RAAF base houses in Darwin to be used for the community and to prevent their destruction or removal. I have continued to fight to ensure that these houses are not sitting their vacant, and to this end I prepared a private members' motion, which was presented earlier today, to hand over the 395 houses to Defence Housing Australia, making them available to Territorians.


I am in the House today to present a petition supporting my motion, which has been through the Petitions Committee and is in order, with 719 local signatures.




The petition read as follows—



To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives


This petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the decision of the Federal Labor Government to decommission 395 houses on RAAF Base Darwin in the midst of the Territory's worst ever housing crisis. We therefore ask the House to support the desperate need for housing in the Territory and the interests of local businesses which rely on support from local residents by excising from Commonwealth ownership the residential housing area of RAAF Base Darwin and handing the houses over to Territorians for a range of housing options including public housing and houses for first home buyers as a matter of urgency.

Territorians are outraged. They see with the eye of common sense but fail to understand why this issue remains unresolved and these 125 houses continue to sit vacant. It is time to stop Labor's waste and mismanagement of taxpayer funded resources, make these houses available to Territorians and make them available now. I seek leave to table this petition.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The honourable member's time has expired. Leave is not required, as the Petitions Committee has, apparently, considered the petition and found it to be in order. The petition is received in accordance with standing orders.

Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:54):  I move:


That so much of standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the member for Warringah moving immediately—


That this House calls upon the Prime Minister to come clean with the Australian people, our forgotten families, the manufacturing sector, our exporters, our small businesses and our farmers and:


(1) own up to the following fact, that yes:


(a) she did say, five days before the last election, ""there will be no carbon tax under the Government I lead"";


(b) she did say, one day before the election, ""I rule out a carbon tax"";


(c) she did promise there would be no carbon tax without a ""deep and lasting community consensus"";


(d) around the world, our global competitors, Russia, Japan, Canada and the US, are walking away from the next round of Kyoto carbon-cuts; and


(2) that as Prime Minister, she should declare, ""yes, I won’t introduce a carbon tax without first seeking a mandate at a new election"".


It is necessary to suspend—




Mr Fitzgibbon:
  Mr Speaker, on a point of order: I certainly do not raise this to put any additional and unnecessary pressure on you, but it is very clear, and I am sure you would agree, that I easily was on my feet before the Leader of the Opposition. I would have thought that, if he really wanted to have a debate on climate change, he would have been quicker to his feet.




The SPEAKER:
 There is no point of order. The Leader of the Opposition.




Mr ABBOTT:
  It is necessary to suspend standing orders because this matter cannot wait. It cannot wait and standing orders must be suspended because this is a Prime Minister who is happy to listen to actors but she will not listen to voters. She wants to say yes to celebrities, but she will not say yes to the people of Australia by having an election on this topic. She will listen to actors and she will listen to celebrities, but one of the people she would not listen to is the foreign minister, who is now walking out of the chamber. None of us are surprised that he is walking out of the chamber, because she would not listen to him either before the last election. She would not listen to him when he wanted an emissions trading scheme, instead she destroyed his prime ministership and lied to the Australian people at the election we had in the middle of last year.




The SPEAKER:
  Order! The Leader of the Opposition will be very careful.




Mr ABBOTT:
  I take your admonition, Mr Speaker. What did this Prime Minister say to the Australian people before the election? Putting her hands on her heart she said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' That is why this suspension cannot wait. She has got to explain herself. What did the Treasurer say to the Australian people before the election? He said that my claim that as sure as night follows day there will be a carbon tax if this government is re-elected was a hysterical exaggeration. It is so hysterical that it is exactly what this government is doing and that is why this suspension of standing orders cannot wait.


This Prime Minister went to the Australian people saying: 'There will not be a carbon tax. There will not be an emissions trading scheme. What there will be is a climate change people's convention.' That is what she said. That is what she took to the Australian people and nothing would happen, she said, until there was a deep and lasting consensus. That is what the Prime Minister took to the Australian people. She reckons she has got a consensus because she has got a deal with the Greens. We had the climate change people's convention on the weekend. It consisted of just five people: two Greens, two Independents and one Labor minister to take the Greens' instructions back to the cabinet. That is no people's convention; that is a fraud on the Australian people and that is why it is important that we suspend standing orders.


I think that it is very important that the actors and the celebrities of this country should have their say. People who live in ecomansions have a right to be heard, they really do. People who are worth $53 million have a right to be heard, but their voice should not be heard ahead of the voice of the ordinary working people of this country. Their voice should not be heard ahead of the forgotten families of this country. It is one of the fundamental principles of our democracy that everyone's voice is equal. You do not give special weight to celebrities, you do not give special weight to people who live half the year in Hollywood, where there is no carbon tax, and you do not give special weight even to former leaders of the Liberal Party. You give weight to the voice of the Australian people. That is why it is so important that we should suspend standing orders, and that is why this matter cannot wait. I say to the Prime Minister, who typically has scuttled out of this chamber, that you will not be able to avoid the voice of the Australian people for that much longer. The Prime Minister should stop thinking that a handful of celebrities somehow represent the voice of the Australian people. She should not be frightened of their voice. If she is so certain that her arguments on climate change and a carbon tax are so right, she should listen to the Australian people. She should give them a chance to say yes or no, as the case may be. She should stop thinking that the only people who count are the people who agree with her.


Why it is so important that we suspend standing orders, and why this matter cannot wait, is that this government's carbon tax will be a massive hit on the standard of living of the forgotten families of our country. It will lead to a 25 per cent increase in power prices, a 6½c a litre increase in private petrol prices, a five per cent increase in grocery prices, a $6,000 increase in the price of a new home and, as we discovered today, at least a $12,000 a year increase in the price of running a farm—and that is at just $20 a tonne. If the government's carbon tax goes ahead, at least 16 coalmines will close, 23,000 jobs will be lost in the mining industry and 45,000 jobs will be lost in the manufacturing industry.




The SPEAKER:
  The Leader of the Opposition will return to the suspension.




Mr ABBOTT:
  We must suspend standing orders because the 126,000 workers in regional Australia whose jobs will be in jeopardy if this carbon tax goes ahead deserve to be heard. What has this Prime Minister got against the manufacturing workers of our country that makes her want to destroy manufacturing by putting on our industries burdens that will not be borne by any of our competitors?


We heard a lot today from the Prime Minister about the Prime Minister of Great Britain. What she did not tell us about is the escape clause that David Cameron put in his statement the other day that, if in 2014 no other country is doing what is proposed, he will revise his targets down. What we should see is a bit of honesty from this Prime Minister, who if she was fair dinkum would say to the Australian people: 'All right, I deceived you before the election. I want to make an honest politician of myself by going to you and saying, ""Give me a mandate for this tax.""'



The Prime Minister says there will be compensation, but of course she has overpromised the compensation. You cannot give all of it to households and half of it to industry. The fact is that there will never be enough compensation for this carbon price, because you cannot compensate people who have lost their jobs as a result of this Prime Minister's toxic tax. The tax will be permanent, the compensation will be temporary and the tax will just go up and up. It must be $40 a tonne, according to the Greens, if it is going to drive a shift from coal to gas. It must be $100 a tonne, according to the Greens, to drive a shift from fossil fuels to renewables. We know who is running this government when it comes to this policy. It is not the Prime Minister; it is Senator Bob Brown. When the Prime Minister said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead,' did she mislead the Australian people or is the carbon tax an admission that the real Prime Minister of this country is Senator Bob Brown? The Prime Minister should get up on her feet and answer those questions. If she does not, the charge against her will be that not only did she deceive the people but also she has got no guts and she has got no ticker. (Time expired)

"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2011-05-30,"



Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (15:04):  I second the motion to suspend standing and sessional orders. This matter is urgent, because the government is refusing to answer the most basic questions in this place about the carbon tax. The government is refusing to answer a question about how many jobs will be affected. The government is refusing to answer a question about the impact on the economy. The government is refusing to answer a simple question about the impact on households. The government is refusing to answer a simple question about what the price will be, leaving the vacuum to be filled by the Greens, who range between $40 a tonne and $100 a tonne. The government is refusing to answer questions about the impact of other trading partners, such as Russia and Canada, declaring that they will not have a second round of the Kyoto protocol. The government is refusing to answer a question about whether it is modelling the impact of our trading partners pulling out over the weekend from that commitment. The government is refusing to respond to the modelling of the Australian Food and Grocery Council which suggests that food and grocery prices will rise by between three and five per cent at $26 a tonne.


The government is refusing to answer every simple question that the Australian people want answered. Instead, it is sending out others. A Prime Minister with no courage at all is standing behind an advertising campaign commenced last night led by others. The Prime Minister stated blatantly on the front page of a newspaper today that she was sending her ministers out for a blitz on the Australian community, but she will not answer simple questions in this place. The Australian people are bemused by this, but they are also made afraid by this. Why? Because it clearly illustrates the fact that this is a government with no confidence, no plan and no roadmap. It declares issues to be the greatest moral challenge of all time and it declares issues to be fundamental to the Australian economy, yet it leaves the great questions unanswered. It leaves Australians confused and in a place where, if they cannot have confidence in this government, they cannot have confidence in the destiny of the nation. So it comes as no surprise that this is a matter of urgency because as each day passes new data comes out that indicates that confidence in the community is, at best, flat but it is having a real impact on our economy. Flat retail sales, flat housing starts—it all comes through in the economy because this is a government that creates no sense of confidence. It is a government that does not believe in its own words. If the government does not believe in its own words and if it has a Prime Minister who refuses to debate this issue in detail in this place, how can you expect Australians to believe the government knows what it is doing?


In the same way that this government confuses Australians about its fiscal strategy and in the same way that it confuses Australians about its approach to climate change—having said it is the great moral challenge—now the two chief salespeople for the government's new carbon tax are the ones who only a few months ago said to Kevin Rudd, 'Dump it and dump it fast.' We have a Treasurer with no commitment and no spine. We have a Prime Minister with no courage and no direction.


Out of all of that, they are smiling at the thought that the Australian people are afraid. I will tell you what: the carbon tax issue is not about climate change; it is about the rising cost of living for everyday Australians. That is what it is about. That is why there was a visceral reaction to the ads last night. There is extreme concern in the community about the introduction of a carbon tax because Australians know that over the next six months they will face higher interest rates, higher electricity prices, higher health costs and higher education costs. They will face a flood tax, a mining tax and now a carbon tax. All of it makes everyday life more expensive for everyday Australians. The Prime Minister, who proclaims that this will be the year of decision-making, does not have the ticker to come in here and lay the details of the carbon tax on the floor of the House for all Australians to debate.


This is a government without direction and without confidence, and it emanates directly from the leadership of the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister. They are not committed to this. They simply do not understand where they are taking the Australian people. From the coalition's perspective, we are standing up for everyday Australians and we call on the government to go to the people and get their endorsement if they think it is such a great policy.

 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (15:09):  We just had the shadow Treasurer say there was no confidence in the Australian economy at a time when we have the biggest investment pipeline in Australia's history. What we have seen yet again—




Mr Pyne:
  I rise on a point of order, Mr Speaker. Is it in order for a motion to suspend standing orders, which is directed at asking the Prime Minister to explain herself to the House, to be answered by the—




The SPEAKER:
  Order! The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat. He is now warned. The Leader of the House has the call.




Mr ALBANESE:
  We heard from those opposite a number of pleas for those on this side of the House to answer questions, but this suspension of standing orders motion is to stop question time. They are the first opposition since Federation who have come in here day after day and moved a suspension of standing orders motion at 10 minutes to three so they can get on TV before Play School. That is the dominant strategy of their tactics committee each and every day. The only reason Tony Abbott wants an election is that he knows he will not last the distance. He knows that the opposition are divided. They stand for nothing and therefore they are divided on everything. They are divided across the board. It is Minchin versus Abbott on whether the Libs should support good policy or not. It is Turnbull versus Abbott on carbon pricing.




The SPEAKER:
  The Leader of the House will refer to members by their parliamentary titles and relate his material to the suspension.




Mr ALBANESE:
  It is the member for Fairfax and the member for Moore versus the Leader of the Opposition on plain packaging, and it is the entire Liberal Party and the Nationals on carbon farming—




Mr Hockey:
  On a point of order, Mr Speaker, we spoke to the subject over here. The Leader of the House is seeking to talk about everything else.




The SPEAKER:
  The member for North Sydney will resume his seat. The Leader of the House will debate the suspension of standing orders.




Mr ALBANESE:
  I am indeed. The reason they want to suspend standing orders rather than have question time is that they are quite rightly embarrassed by their performance in recent times. They are divided against each other. There are letters from the shadow Treasurer today in the Financial Review—a day after he did a doorstop interview saying, 'Put aside your individual interests'—which bag the shadow finance minister and the Leader of the Opposition for their lack of economic credibility. It just does not stack up. We know that you cannot believe anything that they have to say. We know that the member for Wentworth sits there day after day reading his little iPad because there is no way he can get a question—not one question all year from the shadow minister for communications.




The SPEAKER:
  Order! The Leader of the House will relate his material to the suspension.




Mr Pyne:
  Mr Speaker, because of your rulings in past weeks with respect to speaking to the motion or to the suspension, the Leader of the Opposition did bring himself back to—




The SPEAKER:
  The Manager of Opposition Business will resume his seat.



Mr Tehan interjecting—




The SPEAKER:
  Does the member for Wannon want to respond to the point of order? The member for Wannon will be quiet. The Leader of the House knows his responsibility to relate his speech to the suspension, and on a couple of occasions I had to remind the Leader of the Opposition. The Leader of the House has the call.




Mr ALBANESE:
  The reason we should not have this suspension of standing orders is very clear. It is just a stunt from an opposition that is incapable of even trying to hold the executive to account. That is what we do in question time each day. The opposition says that the National Broadband Network is a major issue—it is terrible!—but it cannot even get a question from the shadow minister for communications. He is not allowed to communicate with this parliament by asking a question. We know that is the case because last week the opposition went into a public implosion. Its private division became public when the Chief Opposition Whip sent out an email bagging the member for Wentworth and bagging other senior members of his own political party. At the time, the Chief Opposition Whip said that he did not show it to the Leader of the Opposition; it had nothing to do with him—almost.



Opposition members interjecting—




The SPEAKER:
  Order! The Leader of the House will relate his material to the suspension.




Mr ALBANESE:
  Apart from the fact that he came down and got a tick off and the Leader of the Opposition went over to the box and approved that email going out bagging the member for Wentworth—it was untrue, of course—it had nothing to do with him. The reason we should not support this suspension is that we as a parliament should not provide a cover for the opposition's incompetence and its failure to stand for absolutely anything. Day after day the opposition come in here and try to move a suspension so that it does not actually have to debate the substance before this parliament—so that it does not have to debate the legislation, so that it does not have to try to hold the government to account. We know today that this Leader of the Opposition is the only Liberal leader still alive who does not support a price on carbon. Everyone else is out there—the member for Wentworth, the former member for Bradfield, the former PM Malcolm Fraser and the former opposition leader John Hewson. John Howard supported a price on carbon. He went to an election supporting a price on carbon. Every one of them supports a price on carbon except for our friend here the Leader of the Opposition.


Today in question time I thought, 'I want more questions from those opposite. That is why we should not have a suspension. There is some remote chance that the member for Wentworth might ask one. If not, there is some remote chance that the Leader of the National Party might ask me a question.' He has not since some time early in the last term of parliament—it has been years. If question time were not adjourned each day there might be some chance.


Earlier today we did have a question from the member for Bradfield. The member for Bradfield, whose electorate had the honour of having the Prime Minister there today talking with constituents about the need to take action on climate change, said that he wants an election on carbon tax. He is having a vote on his website, and the result is that 56.6 per cent say that yes, they do support the government introducing a carbon tax. I say to the member for Bradfield that it is no wonder the Prime Minister got such a good reception. 


I said last week that the opposition leader had done for political discourse what the vuvuzela did for World Cup soccer. The first time you hear him, it is a bit interesting—it is loud and you cannot ignore it. To give him credit, you cannot ignore it, but over a period of time when you hear it day after day and match after match you realise that there is only one noise, and that noise is no: no, no, no, no, no. That is the only noise the Leader of the Opposition can make. After a while you find what the Australian public finds, which is that it is just annoying. They expect better. They expect some substance from the Leader of the Opposition, not this relentless negativity, which is all we get day after day.

Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (15:30):   by leave—I move amendments (9) and (10), as circulated in my name, together:


(9) Schedule 1, item 40, page 14 (lines 14 and 15), omit the item.


(10) Schedule 1, item 43, page 14 (lines 27 and 28), omit the item.


The bill proposes to repeal section 117AB, which provides for mandatory cost orders, albeit that some such orders might cover only a portion of the costs where a party knowingly made a false allegation in a statement in proceedings. The explanatory memorandum cites the Australian Institute of Family Studies evaluation and the Family Law Council report as finding that the section operates as a disincentive for disclosing family violence. This is misleading. The Chisholm report alludes to practitioner concern as the basis for its recommendation for repeal, but neither of the major studies cited makes any substantive finding. The Family Law Council report in fact recommends that the provisions should be clarified with an explanatory note or with public education. The Australian Institute of Family Studies evaluation found that 67.7 per cent of respondents disagreed with the proposition that the prospect of an adverse costs order has discouraged allegations of violence or child abuse that are genuinely held and/or likely to be true.


It should be noted that the test proposed in section 117AB is a stringent one. A mandatory costs order could only arise from the evidence that was not proffered in the circumstances or even was given recklessly or without belief. It only applies—and I think this is very important—to knowingly false evidence. If a court was prepared to make such a finding there is no reason why a costs order should not follow. Individual members of the judiciary have confirmed that such false accusations by no means are unknown and that sanctions must apply in such cases.


The courts have provided guidance on the application of the existing provision. In Charles & Charles [2007] Justice Cronin said:


There can be no room for misunderstanding or doubt; objectively, the person making the statement cannot believe the statement to be true.


Recent cases include Sharma & Sharma (No. 2), where a mother was found to have fabricated allegations of abuse against a father and where the alleged victim had vehemently and unequivocally denied the allegation, and Klumper & Klumper, where a father was found to have knowingly made false statements about a mother's parenting capacity and in Hogan and Halverson, where a mother was found to have knowingly made false statements that a child sustained an injury while in his father's care.


Cost orders are made much less routinely in the family jurisdiction than in any other. Sadly, it is clear that some parties can and will make false statements if they perceive an advantage in doing so. Because cost orders are not routine there must be an express disincentive in the act and that is why it is very important that the House pass the amendments as circulated by the opposition, specifically, to make sure that when false evidence has wilfully been given some sanction will apply.

"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,2011-05-30,"



Mr McCLELLAND
 (Barton—Attorney-General) (15:34):  The government opposes the amendments. The opposition has moved amendments to omit items 40 and 43 of the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill, which seeks to repeal section 117AB of the Family Law Act.


Let us look at the evidence supporting the proposed repeal of this section. Professor Chisholm recommended its repeal and in his submission to the Senate inquiry he again stated that the provisions seemed to operate as a disincentive to disclosing family violence and do not appear to have had any beneficial effect. I remind the House that Professor Chisholm had a distinguished period of service as a judge of the Family Court of Australia.


The Family Law Council said that there is no evidence that section 117AB is achieving its purpose of discouraging false allegations of violence. The Australian and New South Wales law reform commissions endorsed the recommendations made by Professor Chisholm and by the Family Law Council. Repeal of section 117AB has strong public support including from the legal profession and key stakeholders in the family law community. The opposition essentially argues that repealing the mandatory cost order provision will open the way for false allegations of violence to be made in court. Again, this is a nonsense. In fact, the Australian Institute of Family Studies, in a report commissioned during the period of the former government, found the lack of confidence in the ability of cost orders to discourage false statements has grown. The opposition has also said that if a court is prepared to make a finding that a party has knowingly given false evidence there is no reason why a cost order should not follow that event. I should say that I could not agree more. I wholeheartedly agree that there should be disincentives to knowingly making a false allegation or false denial in relation to family violence. But the act already provides disincentives to knowingly making a false allegation or false denial in parenting matters through the current power that exists in section 117. Both Professor Chisholm and the Australian Institute of Family Studies found that while there is evidence of section 117AB being applied, cost orders on this basis are rarely sought and rarely made. In fact there have been occasions when the courts have relied on the general power to order costs against a party under section 117 and found that this section is broad enough to deal with false statements, including false allegations and false denials. A case in point is Claringbold v James in 2008, where the court used its existing powers under section 117. In that case Justice Bennett relied on section 117(2A)(c) to make a cost order against a mother who was found to have knowingly made false statements.


Finally, as the opposition keeps raising the work of the Hull committee in 2003, I think it is important to note that mandatory cost orders were not part of the original proposals of the resultant report; in fact, the clause was not to become section 117AB until it was inserted at the suggestion of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs—and it is significant to note that that recommendation was not supported by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. The former government made the decision to continue to include this clause despite there being no statistical data as to the frequency of false allegations and statements noting that courts already routinely make cost orders in the circumstances. Essentially, that begs the question as to why section 117AB was inserted in the first place. We would suggest that it was merely tokenistic, because the court already has sufficient, adequate and proven powers under section 117 of the act. For that reason we oppose the opposition's amendments.

The Family Law Council report in fact recommends that the provisions should be clarified with an explanatory note or with public education. The Australian Institute of Family Studies evaluation found that 67.7 per cent of respondents disagreed with the proposition that the prospect of an adverse costs order has discouraged allegations of violence or child abuse that are genuinely held and/or likely to be true.


It should be noted that the test proposed in section 117AB is a stringent one. A mandatory costs order could only arise from the evidence that was not proffered in the circumstances or even was given recklessly or without belief. It only applies—and I think this is very important—to knowingly false evidence. If a court was prepared to make such a finding there is no reason why a costs order should not follow. Individual members of the judiciary have confirmed that such false accusations by no means are unknown and that sanctions must apply in such cases.


The courts have provided guidance on the application of the existing provision. In Charles & Charles [2007] Justice Cronin said:


There can be no room for misunderstanding or doubt; objectively, the person making the statement cannot believe the statement to be true.


Recent cases include Sharma & Sharma (No. 2), where a mother was found to have fabricated allegations of abuse against a father and where the alleged victim had vehemently and unequivocally denied the allegation, and Klumper & Klumper, where a father was found to have knowingly made false statements about a mother's parenting capacity and in Hogan and Halverson, where a mother was found to have knowingly made false statements that a child sustained an injury while in his father's care.


Cost orders are made much less routinely in the family jurisdiction than in any other. Sadly, it is clear that some parties can and will make false statements if they perceive an advantage in doing so. Because cost orders are not routine there must be an express disincentive in the act and that is why it is very important that the House pass the amendments as circulated by the opposition, specifically, to make sure that when false evidence has wilfully been given some sanction will apply.

Mr McCLELLAND
 (Barton—Attorney-General) (15:34):  The government opposes the amendments. The opposition has moved amendments to omit items 40 and 43 of the Family Law Legislation Amendment (Family Violence and Other Measures) Bill, which seeks to repeal section 117AB of the Family Law Act.


Let us look at the evidence supporting the proposed repeal of this section. Professor Chisholm recommended its repeal and in his submission to the Senate inquiry he again stated that the provisions seemed to operate as a disincentive to disclosing family violence and do not appear to have had any beneficial effect. I remind the House that Professor Chisholm had a distinguished period of service as a judge of the Family Court of Australia.


The Family Law Council said that there is no evidence that section 117AB is achieving its purpose of discouraging false allegations of violence. The Australian and New South Wales law reform commissions endorsed the recommendations made by Professor Chisholm and by the Family Law Council. Repeal of section 117AB has strong public support including from the legal profession and key stakeholders in the family law community. The opposition essentially argues that repealing the mandatory cost order provision will open the way for false allegations of violence to be made in court. Again, this is a nonsense. In fact, the Australian Institute of Family Studies, in a report commissioned during the period of the former government, found the lack of confidence in the ability of cost orders to discourage false statements has grown. The opposition has also said that if a court is prepared to make a finding that a party has knowingly given false evidence there is no reason why a cost order should not follow that event. I should say that I could not agree more. I wholeheartedly agree that there should be disincentives to knowingly making a false allegation or false denial in relation to family violence. But the act already provides disincentives to knowingly making a false allegation or false denial in parenting matters through the current power that exists in section 117. Both Professor Chisholm and the Australian Institute of Family Studies found that while there is evidence of section 117AB being applied, cost orders on this basis are rarely sought and rarely made. In fact there have been occasions when the courts have relied on the general power to order costs against a party under section 117 and found that this section is broad enough to deal with false statements, including false allegations and false denials. A case in point is Claringbold v James in 2008, where the court used its existing powers under section 117. In that case Justice Bennett relied on section 117(2A)(c) to make a cost order against a mother who was found to have knowingly made false statements.


Finally, as the opposition keeps raising the work of the Hull committee in 2003, I think it is important to note that mandatory cost orders were not part of the original proposals of the resultant report; in fact, the clause was not to become section 117AB until it was inserted at the suggestion of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs—and it is significant to note that that recommendation was not supported by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee. The former government made the decision to continue to include this clause despite there being no statistical data as to the frequency of false allegations and statements noting that courts already routinely make cost orders in the circumstances. Essentially, that begs the question as to why section 117AB was inserted in the first place. We would suggest that it was merely tokenistic, because the court already has sufficient, adequate and proven powers under section 117 of the act. For that reason we oppose the opposition's amendments.

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2011-05-30,"



Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (15:49):  I rise to speak on the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Bill 2011 and related bills. What we see with these bills is a lazy piece of policy making that is designed to recoup the costs that are associated with Labor's failed economic management. The purpose of these bills is to fulfil Labor's 2010-11 budget commitment to recover the costs of AUSTRAC's supervisory activities from 1 July this year. I could not characterise the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Bill 2011 any better than it was characterised by the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, ASFA, when they said that this bill was akin to asking the Australian Taxation Office to charge taxpayers a fee to lodge their returns.


The bills place a large burden on reporting entities, depending on how much they earn. The initial proposal from the government was to charge all reporting entities to recover the costs of running AUSTRAC, but, after a lot of those entities voiced their opposition—and rightly so because they were to be levied $500 at a time—the government revised their proposal, so now this levy is only going to apply to larger entities. I understand that only 199 of the largest reporting entities will be taxed. Those large entities will obviously be places like banks and casinos and people who you might say are able to pay the levy, but, at the end of the day, somebody always pays when the government levies a new tax. This is not a large amount of money in the scheme of things, but, regardless, this is still poor policy-making.


As we know, a Senate committee is looking into the bills and is due to report on 16 June. In a submission to the committee inquiry, the Law Council of Australia noted their concerns about the bills and about their profession falling under the reporting obligations. The Law Council said:


If law practices become subject to AML/CTF—


that is, anti-money-laundering and counterterrorism financing—


reporting obligations and consequently the cost recovery regime, the Law Council would have particular concerns about the impact on smaller firms.


…   …   …


The proposed cost recovery levy, which would apply other than beyond a legal practice's compliance costs, would almost certainly lead, in the Law Council's opinion, to an increase in the cost of legal services, making such services less affordable.


The Law Council makes a valid point which would no doubt be of concern to many businesses and institutions across Australia. There are also concerns that the levy will place Australia and its financial institutions at a substantial competitive disadvantage. This is what happens when you levy new taxes that are not levied on other players within our region. Citigroup wrote in their submission to the committee that the levy will have unintended consequences in relation to Australia's ability to compete in the Asia-Pacific region, given the additional significant costs that the levy will impose on Australian financial institutions. They said:


We recommend that the composition of the levy be reassessed to ensure a more equitable distribution reflective of the designated services that AUSTRAC monitors and supervises. 


The government's rationale for basing the large-entity component of the levy on the earnings of the entity group is that AUSTRAC incurs greater expenses in regulating larger entities because larger entities have more customers and usually provide more complex products. However, this calculation does not take into account the extent to which a leviable entity's earnings are related to the provision of designated services. 


Due to this, an entity with high earnings may incur a large-entity component even though the entity only provides a small volume of designated services. There is a potential that the levy will have a disproportionate effect on those large entities which only provide designated services as an incidental part of their businesses.


I have already stated what some of the industry associations have been saying about these bills. I particularly like ASFA's way of characterising it. I also note that the Australian Bankers Association director Tony Burke said that the government's clear objective was to recover costs rather than provide any benefit to those subject to the regulation. He is quoted in an article:


""As the paper currently stands, the potential cost of compliance would be high,"" he said. ""Charge-backs to internal groups and agencies would add significant overheads in tracking costs and reconciling payments.""


The same article goes on: 


Institute of Chartered Accountants executive general manager Lee White said members already incurred significant costs in supporting AUSTRAC's regulatory aims, and it was unreasonable to ask them to bear more.


""Our members provide legitimate services to clients who overwhelmingly are law-abiding individuals and businesses,"" he said.


""If these legitimate services are exploited by criminals, it is these wrong-doers who create the need for regulation and who should contribute to the costs through the confiscated proceeds of their crimes.""


I think those comments from industry really go to the heart of this bill. The services that AUSTRAC provide are not necessarily services direct to the reporting entities that have been charged under this legislation. As I said, it is not a large sum of money so you will not find an enormous public outcry but that does not mean that it does not represent bad policy making. It is not reasonable for the government to recoup the costs of running every government agency if that government agency is providing a public service rather than providing direct services to the people who are being asked to pay for them.


AUSTRAC does provide a very valuable service but we believe that it is not reasonable to come back and to ask the 199 largest users to cover the costs of its running, particularly when really this is all about filling the budget black hole that Labor have created for themselves from their enormous wasteful spending up to this point.


We will not be opposing the bill in the House, although we do reserve the right to move amendments in the Senate based on the outcome of the Senate committee report.

Mr RIPOLL
 (Oxley) (15:57):  It is a pleasure for me to speak in relation to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Bill 2011 and cognate bills, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy (Collection) Bill 2011 and the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2011. They all relate to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre supervisory cost recover matter. 


Listening to that previous speaker and others from the opposition, I think they will be supporting these bills but that they are waiting to hear what the Senate committee report has to say on these matters. I will pick up on one of the issues that was raised by the previous speaker. Essentially, the member was saying there is no need to have organisations and businesses that carry out supervisory activities paying a fee in terms of providing that information. The reality is that this happens across a lot of areas. There is a cost, and cost recovery in any government department or any agency is a normal process. It is something that goes on. The previous speaker also mentioned that it is the case that it is not a lot of money. The cost recovery is in the order of about $89 million for the period 2011 to 2014 and represents those people involved in activities paying a fee in the process of having those activities properly recorded.


I want to briefly say how important AUSTRAC is. AUSTRAC does an enormous job. It does a great job and it provides a great community benefit, particularly against organised crime. It is estimated that it saves the community something like $15 billion a year. Organised crime, as we know, is a significant national security threat and it is a growing challenge. I think people ought to understand that.


The Commonwealth, through the Organised Crime Strategic Framework, is ensuring that Commonwealth intelligence, policy, regulatory and law enforcement agencies all work together in partnership to prevent, disrupt or investigate and prosecute organised crime in whatever form it takes. These bills ensure that there is proper financing and access so that AUSTRAC can do its job properly. AUSTRAC intelligence has a number of very important roles, specifically to detect drug and chemical precursor transactions and to prevent people smuggling, corruption, card skimming, Ponzi schemes, tax evasion, fraud and a whole range of other activities. It is there to protect the community; it is there to protect business; it is there to protect the Commonwealth and ordinary people. It has a very good track record. In fact, for the 2009-10 financial year, information that was provided by AUSTRAC brought about 3,700 cases conducted by the Australian Federal Police with other agencies, more than 1,800 cases for the Australian Taxation Office, which resulted in recovery of evaded taxes in excess of $272 million, and more than 1,200 cases involving Centrelink, leading to a recovery of more than $7 million per year.


So I think we can all agree about the great work that is done in this area. The case for the justification of cost recovery is as strong as it is easy to make: quite simply, it is good policy and it is policy of recent governments that entities which have created the need for government regulation should bear the cost of that regulation. Other regulators such as APRA already recover the cost of their regulatory activities from the entities they regulate. This happens in a number of areas. Rather than being a burden or merely a cost, it is actually an assistance to business. It prevents international crime, fraud and a whole range of other activities from being perpetrated on Australian business and, therefore, Australian consumers as well. It has a larger benefit to all those involved.


This is a comprehensive package of three bills that reduce the burden on small business. The government is committed to reducing the regulatory burden on small business and, as a result, small business entities of a certain type will not have to pay this levy. Affiliates of registered remittance networks are excluded on the basis that AUSTRAC's primary regulatory relationship will be with the registered remittance networks rather than individual affiliates. This removes a range of small businesses such as licensed post offices and newsagents from the operation of the levy.


The government is committed through these bills and, of course, through its broader policy to proper governance and ensuring that organised crime, people smuggling, fraud, card skimming, money laundering and all of those illegal financial activities do not occur and that, where they do, they are detected, there is proper reporting, there is proper funding and that funding can be created via cost recovery through the agency. I commend the bills to the House.

Mr MITCHELL
 (McEwen) (16:03):  I rise in support of the government's Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Recovery Bill, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Cost Recovery (Collection) Bill and the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Cost Recovery (Consequential Amendments) Bill. These bills are a legislative package that will ensure that AUSTRAC cost recovery is implemented effectively. The levy bill will establish a legislative structure that will allow AUSTRAC to reclaim the costs of its regulatory functions from the businesses that it regulates and, in turn, is part of the Gillard government's ongoing commitment to protect Australians from the social and economic impacts of organised crime.


I am pleased to speak on these bills as it gives me the opportunity to talk about the importance of AUSTRAC in protecting our financial system and how, in turn, it combats organised crime, money laundering, financing of terrorism, including people smuggling, and tax evasion. AUSTRAC is a significant body in Australia. It is a vital agency—an anti-money-laundering and counterterrorism financing regulator and specialist intelligence unit which works with Australian industries and businesses to provide information about potential criminal activity to our law enforcement agencies. It is at the forefront of the fight against transnational organised crime.


AUSTRAC's strategic directions statement as outlined in the 2011-12 budget states:


In its regulatory role, AUSTRAC oversees compliance with reporting obligations under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (AML/CTF Act) and the Financial Transactions Reports Act 1988 for approximately 18,000 businesses across diverse industry sectors that include financial services providers, the gambling industry and other specified 'regulated entities'. As Australia’s financial intelligence unit, AUSTRAC collects and analyses financial information provided by regulated entities to assist Australian law enforcement, national security, social justice and revenue agencies and certain international counterparts in the investigation and prosecution of serious criminal activity, including terrorism financing, organised crime and tax evasion.


In 2011–12, AUSTRAC will continue to improve and supplement its systems to enhance all aspects of its dealings with its diverse regulated population. AUSTRAC will also review the way in which it provides guidance to regulated entities on their obligations.


As Australia’s financial intelligence unit, AUSTRAC disseminates financial intelligence to Commonwealth, state and territory partner agencies and international counterparts. In 2011–12, AUSTRAC will continue to strengthen its support to whole-of-government initiatives and priorities focused on combating organised crime, tax evasion and threats to Australia’s security. As part of this commitment, AUSTRAC will also continue to provide critical financial intelligence support to national investigations and taskforces.


AUSTRAC also plays a key role in identifying the methods and techniques used by criminals and this in turn is pivotal in catching and combating fraud and other serious crimes. AUSTRAC then outlines these techniques in its reports and tracks emerging techniques like card skimming, early release super schemes, Ponzi schemes, boiler room scams, and internet, lottery and sweepstake scams. AUSTRAC continues to uphold the integrity of Australia's financial system and assists to safeguard and protect Australians from serious organised crime.


This package of bills enables AUSTRAC to collect the levy and deal with the related administrative matters such as invoicing, late payment penalties and review mechanisms. It makes it a requirement for reporting entities to enrol with AUSTRAC. Currently reporting entities are encouraged to enrol with AUSTRAC. Only enrolled entities can lodge reports with AUSTRAC electronically. Over 18,000 entities have enrolled with AUSTRAC to date.


Organised crime is a growing challenge that the Gillard government is committed to fight and deter, and the passage of this legislation will go to strengthening our stance against organised crime in Australia. The impacts of organised crime are far-reaching and have severe consequences for our economy and society, as it is estimated to cost the community $15 million per year. Therefore, monitoring money flows—which is, in essence, the lifeblood of organised crime—is critical.


The Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission conducted an inquiry into the future impact of serious and organised crime on Australian society back in 2007. The inquiry found that technological developments like the internet have increased opportunities which enable organised crime groups to pursue new types of crime—things like electronic piracy, counterfeiting and forgery, credit card fraud, money laundering and denial-of-service attacks. The committee's inquiry into the legislative arrangements to outlaw serious and organised crime groups stated that the impact of organised crime in Australia is significant. The Australian Crime Commission found that in 2008 organised crime's financial impact on Australia was roughly $10 billion. These impacts include: loss of legitimate business revenue, loss of tax revenue, expenditure fighting organised crime through law enforcement and regulatory means, and expenditure managing social harms caused through criminal activity.


Last year, AUSTRAC's annual report highlighted the importance of financial intelligence in combating serious crimes. The report illustrated the significant role AUSTRAC had played in assisting the detection and persecution of a wide range of offences such as money laundering, fraud and the importation of drugs. In 2009-10 AUSTRAC received over 21 million financial transaction reports from businesses in the financial, money remittance, bullion and gambling sectors. This included almost 50,000 reports motivated by suspicious matters. The report highlighted the increase in organised crime with a record number of reports received during that year. Last year, AUSTRAC played a vital role in investigating a major money-laundering case which resulted in the imprisonment of a Sydney woman who pleaded guilty to laundering over $1.9 million through her money transfer business over a 2½ month period from November 2007 to January 2008. It was reported that the woman had divided the money into amounts of less than $10,000, which was then transferred to beneficiaries in Vietnam using a series of false names. The woman will serve at least 3½ years before being eligible for parole. This case and the sentencing will deter others who are thinking about breaking Australia's laws.


In the 2009-10 financial year AUSTRAC information contributed to more than 3,700 cases conducted by the Australian Federal Police and other partner agencies; more than 1,800 cases conducted by the Australian Taxation Office, resulting in recovery of evaded taxes in excess of $272 million; and more than 1,200 cases involving Centrelink, leading to a total of more than $7 million in savings per year.


It has been reported that last year organised criminals were ripping more than $15 billion a year out of the Australian economy. As I mentioned earlier, there has been an increase in organised crime with the use of new and emerging technologies and the internet, giving these criminals additional avenues. Therefore it is not surprising that there has been a 50 per cent jump in organised crime since 2008, and we are working to combat this. This government are committed to tackling organised crime. We have spent $14.5 million on a Criminal Intelligence Fusion Centre to provide new capabilities to prevent and detect organised crime. The fusion centre provides in-depth criminal intelligence and analysis and boosts the capability of law enforcement agencies to identify high-risk cash flows, patterns of crime and the individuals, businesses and corporations that may be involved in criminal enterprises in Australia and abroad.


AUSTRAC is an important agency upholding the integrity of Australia's financial system by making businesses resilient to money laundering, tracking and discovering the techniques used by serious organised criminals. I therefore support the measures in these bills to allow AUSTRAC to recover the cost of its supervisory activities from businesses which it regulates under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006.

"Saffin, Janelle, MP",ALP,2011-05-30,"



Ms SAFFIN
 (Page) (16:13):  I rise to speak in support of the Australian Transactions Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Bill 2011, the collection bill and the consequential amendments bill. Firstly, I would like to thank the Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Justice for considering at the outset the operations of small businesses in general and particularly in rural and regional areas. In some cases if the legislation had been applied in a blanket way, it could have adversely affected the operations of those small businesses and particularly those small businesses in rural and regional areas. I know from conversations with the minister and from consultations, which he was able to ensure happened around Australia, that we have got a good outcome. The minister took the time to listen to MPs and backbenchers. That was good, because backbenchers sometimes know a thing or two and are engaged on the ground. Ministers are backbenchers too, so they hear views from their electorates as well.


These bills provide exemptions from levy arrangements and businesses can claim if they fall into those exemption categories or will be exempted—as I read it—as of right if they are in certain categories. I am not sure of the mechanism by which they will exercise that but it seems that there are two parts in place for that. I am getting nods around the chamber, so I must have read that bit correctly.


The bills give effect to sensible recommendations announced in the 2010-11 budget that, from this financial year, 2011-12, will allow AUSTRAC to recover the cost of its supervisory activities from businesses regulated by the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act. Those activities have their genesis or their national legislation but they also give effect to part of the package of the counterterrorism conventions—and there are about 13 that we are obligated or mandated by the Security Council to put in place. Indeed, we want to at a national level for reasons that are self-evident but are worthy of reiteration. The minister has quoted the figures—as I think most people in this place have done. The Australian government figures show that organised crime—where a lot of money laundering and financing of terrorism activities do take place and can take place and not just here but also internationally—costs Australia about $15 billion a year. I take it that that $15 billion figure would mean cost by commission and omission.


The cost recovery that is inherent in these three bill is not new. In this area, the cost-recovery guidelines of 2002 lay out that approach. Its essence is simple. It is that entities that have created the need for government regulation should bear the cost of that regulation. People may argue that they do not allow any irregular activities that could facilitate crime and the things that we are talking about—and that may be so. But, when you are setting up a regulatory framework, it is like setting up your rates at local government level—we all have to bear that cost in a collective, coordinated way. It is no different when we are doing it nationally. It is the same cost-recovery model. If you are a beneficiary or are in a business that could cause some of that harm, even inadvertently, we all have to participate in paying in that way. The framework starts with the general and then it deals with the particular—in this case, the particular as well as that category of exemptions.


That brings me back to the small businesses and the rural and regional area and where the government is making sure that we have a coherent and cogent regulatory framework while, at the same time, making sure that small business does not have to bear the burden in a disproportionate way. This legislation is very mindful of that. It proposes that affiliates of registered remittance networks will not have to pay the levy. Affiliates are excluded on the basis that AUSTRAC's primary regulatory relationship will be with the registered remittance network rather than with individual affiliates. This removes a range of small businesses such as licensed post offices and newsagents from the operation of the levy. That is really important in my seat of Page and I know it would be in other seats. It was really important that that was one of the considerations that the minister and those in the department involved in preparing the legislation were able to turn their minds to.


For pubs and clubs in rural and regional areas, I understand that AUSTRAC is currently consulting on a draft rule around that area—again, looking at those venues where there are a certain number of gaming machines. That will be the benchmark for where the exemption is able to be had. It is also proposed to remove non-employing entities, such as sole proprietors and partnerships without employees—which are often run by families—and microbusinesses which employ fewer than five people. That is an ABS definition. They will be able to be exempt from the base component levy. That is rather sensible.


I understand that these three bills will recover $88.9 million in the period 2011-14. That is important, because part of governing is spending. I know that I like spending in my seat of Page and I am always asking ministers for money. But, as responsible members of parliament, we also have an obligation to talk about those bills that allow government to recover moneys and we have some responsibility to be mindful, particularly in terms of such a critical where the costs of organised crime do cost us as a community—that $15 billion a year.



I know that sometimes people think that these sorts of bills are not the bills that necessarily attract a lot of people champing at the bit to speak about them and that cost recovery, white collar crime and things like that might seem a bit pedestrian, but they are really fundamental to the way our criminal justice system operates and to good government. With those comments, I commend the bills to the House.

Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR
 (Gorton—Minister for Privacy and Freedom of Information, Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Justice) (16:22):  I thank the member of Page and the members for McEwen, Stirling and Oxley for their contributions. The member for Page is quite right; the government did consider the impacts upon small businesses, took submissions from representative bodies and took submissions from members of parliament, who raised the potential adverse impacts of this levy upon organisations within their own constituencies, particularly smaller businesses and businesses in those regional areas that we would not want to impose on unnecessarily. I believe, through the process of engagement with the sector, with members of parliament and with people who are advocating on behalf of those who are involved in this sector, we have come up with a very good balance indeed.


I note that the member for Stirling did indicate that the opposition would support this bill unamended through the House. Of course, we will wait to see whether in fact the opposition will support this bill unamended in the other place. However, I say to the opposition that, if we are looking at ensuring we are sufficiently resourced to have very strong, rigorous regulations to protect the interests of our financial system and indeed protect us against organised crime and other threats to this country, there needs to be a solution. If there is just criticism of a mechanism enclosed within a number of bills, that in itself is not enough. I do implore the member for Stirling to keep that in mind. It is important that we get this right. A lot of work has gone into this and a lot of engagement with the sector, and I do believe that we have struck the right balance.


Organised crime, as has been said by all of the speakers in this debate, is a significant national security threat and challenge for Australia. Through the Commonwealth Organised Crime Strategic Framework, the government is ensuring that Commonwealth intelligence, policy, regulatory and law enforcement agencies are working together to prevent, disrupt, investigate and prosecute organised crime. AUSTRAC plays a critical role in the fight against organised crime. Through its regulatory activities, AUSTRAC helps to mitigate the risk of Australian businesses being used for money laundering, terrorism financing and other organised crime. This legislative package is necessary to give effect to the 2010 budget commitment that, consistent with the government's cost recovery guidelines, AUSTRAC will recover the costs of its regulatory activities from 1 July this year.


The levy bill imposes a levy on entities regulated by AUSTRAC under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006. It provides that the amount of levy payable for each financial year will be determined by legislative instrument and cannot exceed a statutory limit of $33 million indexed. The collection bill enables AUSTRAC to collect the supervisory cost recovery levy and establishes the necessary framework for administering the levy, including matters relating to collection, invoicing and dealing with late payments. The collection bill also introduces administrative review of a decision by the AUSTRAC CEO to waive a levy or late payment penalty. Significant consultation has occurred with industry around the structure of AUSTRAC's supervisory levy. Through this process the government has, as I said earlier, listened to the concerns of business and made significant adjustments to lessen the burden, particularly on small business.


The third bill in this package, the consequential amendments bill, amends the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act to introduce compulsory enrolment for all reporting entities regulated by AUSTRAC. This formalises current arrangements where AUSTRAC encourages entities to voluntarily enrol. Mandating this requirement will mean that AUSTRAC can better identify its regulated population for the purposes of calculating and applying the AUSTRAC cost recovery levy. The consequential amendments bill also amends the current infringement notice scheme to allow for the issuing of notices for failure to enrol and failure to appropriately maintain enrolment details. I commend this legislative package to the House and, in doing so, I also table a correction to the explanatory memorandum in relation to all three bills.

Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (15:49):  I rise to speak on the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Bill 2011 and related bills. What we see with these bills is a lazy piece of policy making that is designed to recoup the costs that are associated with Labor's failed economic management. The purpose of these bills is to fulfil Labor's 2010-11 budget commitment to recover the costs of AUSTRAC's supervisory activities from 1 July this year. I could not characterise the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Bill 2011 any better than it was characterised by the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia, ASFA, when they said that this bill was akin to asking the Australian Taxation Office to charge taxpayers a fee to lodge their returns.


The bills place a large burden on reporting entities, depending on how much they earn. The initial proposal from the government was to charge all reporting entities to recover the costs of running AUSTRAC, but, after a lot of those entities voiced their opposition—and rightly so because they were to be levied $500 at a time—the government revised their proposal, so now this levy is only going to apply to larger entities. I understand that only 199 of the largest reporting entities will be taxed. Those large entities will obviously be places like banks and casinos and people who you might say are able to pay the levy, but, at the end of the day, somebody always pays when the government levies a new tax. This is not a large amount of money in the scheme of things, but, regardless, this is still poor policy-making.


As we know, a Senate committee is looking into the bills and is due to report on 16 June. In a submission to the committee inquiry, the Law Council of Australia noted their concerns about the bills and about their profession falling under the reporting obligations. The Law Council said:


If law practices become subject to AML/CTF—


that is, anti-money-laundering and counterterrorism financing—


reporting obligations and consequently the cost recovery regime, the Law Council would have particular concerns about the impact on smaller firms.


…   …   …


The proposed cost recovery levy, which would apply other than beyond a legal practice's compliance costs, would almost certainly lead, in the Law Council's opinion, to an increase in the cost of legal services, making such services less affordable.


The Law Council makes a valid point which would no doubt be of concern to many businesses and institutions across Australia. There are also concerns that the levy will place Australia and its financial institutions at a substantial competitive disadvantage. This is what happens when you levy new taxes that are not levied on other players within our region. Citigroup wrote in their submission to the committee that the levy will have unintended consequences in relation to Australia's ability to compete in the Asia-Pacific region, given the additional significant costs that the levy will impose on Australian financial institutions. They said:


We recommend that the composition of the levy be reassessed to ensure a more equitable distribution reflective of the designated services that AUSTRAC monitors and supervises. 


The government's rationale for basing the large-entity component of the levy on the earnings of the entity group is that AUSTRAC incurs greater expenses in regulating larger entities because larger entities have more customers and usually provide more complex products. However, this calculation does not take into account the extent to which a leviable entity's earnings are related to the provision of designated services. 


Due to this, an entity with high earnings may incur a large-entity component even though the entity only provides a small volume of designated services. There is a potential that the levy will have a disproportionate effect on those large entities which only provide designated services as an incidental part of their businesses.


I have already stated what some of the industry associations have been saying about these bills. I particularly like ASFA's way of characterising it. I also note that the Australian Bankers Association director Tony Burke said that the government's clear objective was to recover costs rather than provide any benefit to those subject to the regulation. He is quoted in an article:


""As the paper currently stands, the potential cost of compliance would be high,"" he said. ""Charge-backs to internal groups and agencies would add significant overheads in tracking costs and reconciling payments.""


The same article goes on: 


Institute of Chartered Accountants executive general manager Lee White said members already incurred significant costs in supporting AUSTRAC's regulatory aims, and it was unreasonable to ask them to bear more.


""Our members provide legitimate services to clients who overwhelmingly are law-abiding individuals and businesses,"" he said.


""If these legitimate services are exploited by criminals, it is these wrong-doers who create the need for regulation and who should contribute to the costs through the confiscated proceeds of their crimes.""


I think those comments from industry really go to the heart of this bill. The services that AUSTRAC provide are not necessarily services direct to the reporting entities that have been charged under this legislation. As I said, it is not a large sum of money so you will not find an enormous public outcry but that does not mean that it does not represent bad policy making. It is not reasonable for the government to recoup the costs of running every government agency if that government agency is providing a public service rather than providing direct services to the people who are being asked to pay for them.


AUSTRAC does provide a very valuable service but we believe that it is not reasonable to come back and to ask the 199 largest users to cover the costs of its running, particularly when really this is all about filling the budget black hole that Labor have created for themselves from their enormous wasteful spending up to this point.


We will not be opposing the bill in the House, although we do reserve the right to move amendments in the Senate based on the outcome of the Senate committee report.

Mr RIPOLL
 (Oxley) (15:57):  It is a pleasure for me to speak in relation to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Bill 2011 and cognate bills, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy (Collection) Bill 2011 and the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2011. They all relate to the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre supervisory cost recover matter. 


Listening to that previous speaker and others from the opposition, I think they will be supporting these bills but that they are waiting to hear what the Senate committee report has to say on these matters. I will pick up on one of the issues that was raised by the previous speaker. Essentially, the member was saying there is no need to have organisations and businesses that carry out supervisory activities paying a fee in terms of providing that information. The reality is that this happens across a lot of areas. There is a cost, and cost recovery in any government department or any agency is a normal process. It is something that goes on. The previous speaker also mentioned that it is the case that it is not a lot of money. The cost recovery is in the order of about $89 million for the period 2011 to 2014 and represents those people involved in activities paying a fee in the process of having those activities properly recorded.


I want to briefly say how important AUSTRAC is. AUSTRAC does an enormous job. It does a great job and it provides a great community benefit, particularly against organised crime. It is estimated that it saves the community something like $15 billion a year. Organised crime, as we know, is a significant national security threat and it is a growing challenge. I think people ought to understand that.


The Commonwealth, through the Organised Crime Strategic Framework, is ensuring that Commonwealth intelligence, policy, regulatory and law enforcement agencies all work together in partnership to prevent, disrupt or investigate and prosecute organised crime in whatever form it takes. These bills ensure that there is proper financing and access so that AUSTRAC can do its job properly. AUSTRAC intelligence has a number of very important roles, specifically to detect drug and chemical precursor transactions and to prevent people smuggling, corruption, card skimming, Ponzi schemes, tax evasion, fraud and a whole range of other activities. It is there to protect the community; it is there to protect business; it is there to protect the Commonwealth and ordinary people. It has a very good track record. In fact, for the 2009-10 financial year, information that was provided by AUSTRAC brought about 3,700 cases conducted by the Australian Federal Police with other agencies, more than 1,800 cases for the Australian Taxation Office, which resulted in recovery of evaded taxes in excess of $272 million, and more than 1,200 cases involving Centrelink, leading to a recovery of more than $7 million per year.


So I think we can all agree about the great work that is done in this area. The case for the justification of cost recovery is as strong as it is easy to make: quite simply, it is good policy and it is policy of recent governments that entities which have created the need for government regulation should bear the cost of that regulation. Other regulators such as APRA already recover the cost of their regulatory activities from the entities they regulate. This happens in a number of areas. Rather than being a burden or merely a cost, it is actually an assistance to business. It prevents international crime, fraud and a whole range of other activities from being perpetrated on Australian business and, therefore, Australian consumers as well. It has a larger benefit to all those involved.


This is a comprehensive package of three bills that reduce the burden on small business. The government is committed to reducing the regulatory burden on small business and, as a result, small business entities of a certain type will not have to pay this levy. Affiliates of registered remittance networks are excluded on the basis that AUSTRAC's primary regulatory relationship will be with the registered remittance networks rather than individual affiliates. This removes a range of small businesses such as licensed post offices and newsagents from the operation of the levy.


The government is committed through these bills and, of course, through its broader policy to proper governance and ensuring that organised crime, people smuggling, fraud, card skimming, money laundering and all of those illegal financial activities do not occur and that, where they do, they are detected, there is proper reporting, there is proper funding and that funding can be created via cost recovery through the agency. I commend the bills to the House.

Mr MITCHELL
 (McEwen) (16:03):  I rise in support of the government's Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Recovery Bill, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Cost Recovery (Collection) Bill and the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Cost Recovery (Consequential Amendments) Bill. These bills are a legislative package that will ensure that AUSTRAC cost recovery is implemented effectively. The levy bill will establish a legislative structure that will allow AUSTRAC to reclaim the costs of its regulatory functions from the businesses that it regulates and, in turn, is part of the Gillard government's ongoing commitment to protect Australians from the social and economic impacts of organised crime.


I am pleased to speak on these bills as it gives me the opportunity to talk about the importance of AUSTRAC in protecting our financial system and how, in turn, it combats organised crime, money laundering, financing of terrorism, including people smuggling, and tax evasion. AUSTRAC is a significant body in Australia. It is a vital agency—an anti-money-laundering and counterterrorism financing regulator and specialist intelligence unit which works with Australian industries and businesses to provide information about potential criminal activity to our law enforcement agencies. It is at the forefront of the fight against transnational organised crime.


AUSTRAC's strategic directions statement as outlined in the 2011-12 budget states:


In its regulatory role, AUSTRAC oversees compliance with reporting obligations under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006 (AML/CTF Act) and the Financial Transactions Reports Act 1988 for approximately 18,000 businesses across diverse industry sectors that include financial services providers, the gambling industry and other specified 'regulated entities'. As Australia’s financial intelligence unit, AUSTRAC collects and analyses financial information provided by regulated entities to assist Australian law enforcement, national security, social justice and revenue agencies and certain international counterparts in the investigation and prosecution of serious criminal activity, including terrorism financing, organised crime and tax evasion.


In 2011–12, AUSTRAC will continue to improve and supplement its systems to enhance all aspects of its dealings with its diverse regulated population. AUSTRAC will also review the way in which it provides guidance to regulated entities on their obligations.


As Australia’s financial intelligence unit, AUSTRAC disseminates financial intelligence to Commonwealth, state and territory partner agencies and international counterparts. In 2011–12, AUSTRAC will continue to strengthen its support to whole-of-government initiatives and priorities focused on combating organised crime, tax evasion and threats to Australia’s security. As part of this commitment, AUSTRAC will also continue to provide critical financial intelligence support to national investigations and taskforces.


AUSTRAC also plays a key role in identifying the methods and techniques used by criminals and this in turn is pivotal in catching and combating fraud and other serious crimes. AUSTRAC then outlines these techniques in its reports and tracks emerging techniques like card skimming, early release super schemes, Ponzi schemes, boiler room scams, and internet, lottery and sweepstake scams. AUSTRAC continues to uphold the integrity of Australia's financial system and assists to safeguard and protect Australians from serious organised crime.


This package of bills enables AUSTRAC to collect the levy and deal with the related administrative matters such as invoicing, late payment penalties and review mechanisms. It makes it a requirement for reporting entities to enrol with AUSTRAC. Currently reporting entities are encouraged to enrol with AUSTRAC. Only enrolled entities can lodge reports with AUSTRAC electronically. Over 18,000 entities have enrolled with AUSTRAC to date.


Organised crime is a growing challenge that the Gillard government is committed to fight and deter, and the passage of this legislation will go to strengthening our stance against organised crime in Australia. The impacts of organised crime are far-reaching and have severe consequences for our economy and society, as it is estimated to cost the community $15 million per year. Therefore, monitoring money flows—which is, in essence, the lifeblood of organised crime—is critical.


The Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Crime Commission conducted an inquiry into the future impact of serious and organised crime on Australian society back in 2007. The inquiry found that technological developments like the internet have increased opportunities which enable organised crime groups to pursue new types of crime—things like electronic piracy, counterfeiting and forgery, credit card fraud, money laundering and denial-of-service attacks. The committee's inquiry into the legislative arrangements to outlaw serious and organised crime groups stated that the impact of organised crime in Australia is significant. The Australian Crime Commission found that in 2008 organised crime's financial impact on Australia was roughly $10 billion. These impacts include: loss of legitimate business revenue, loss of tax revenue, expenditure fighting organised crime through law enforcement and regulatory means, and expenditure managing social harms caused through criminal activity.


Last year, AUSTRAC's annual report highlighted the importance of financial intelligence in combating serious crimes. The report illustrated the significant role AUSTRAC had played in assisting the detection and persecution of a wide range of offences such as money laundering, fraud and the importation of drugs. In 2009-10 AUSTRAC received over 21 million financial transaction reports from businesses in the financial, money remittance, bullion and gambling sectors. This included almost 50,000 reports motivated by suspicious matters. The report highlighted the increase in organised crime with a record number of reports received during that year. Last year, AUSTRAC played a vital role in investigating a major money-laundering case which resulted in the imprisonment of a Sydney woman who pleaded guilty to laundering over $1.9 million through her money transfer business over a 2½ month period from November 2007 to January 2008. It was reported that the woman had divided the money into amounts of less than $10,000, which was then transferred to beneficiaries in Vietnam using a series of false names. The woman will serve at least 3½ years before being eligible for parole. This case and the sentencing will deter others who are thinking about breaking Australia's laws.


In the 2009-10 financial year AUSTRAC information contributed to more than 3,700 cases conducted by the Australian Federal Police and other partner agencies; more than 1,800 cases conducted by the Australian Taxation Office, resulting in recovery of evaded taxes in excess of $272 million; and more than 1,200 cases involving Centrelink, leading to a total of more than $7 million in savings per year.


It has been reported that last year organised criminals were ripping more than $15 billion a year out of the Australian economy. As I mentioned earlier, there has been an increase in organised crime with the use of new and emerging technologies and the internet, giving these criminals additional avenues. Therefore it is not surprising that there has been a 50 per cent jump in organised crime since 2008, and we are working to combat this. This government are committed to tackling organised crime. We have spent $14.5 million on a Criminal Intelligence Fusion Centre to provide new capabilities to prevent and detect organised crime. The fusion centre provides in-depth criminal intelligence and analysis and boosts the capability of law enforcement agencies to identify high-risk cash flows, patterns of crime and the individuals, businesses and corporations that may be involved in criminal enterprises in Australia and abroad.


AUSTRAC is an important agency upholding the integrity of Australia's financial system by making businesses resilient to money laundering, tracking and discovering the techniques used by serious organised criminals. I therefore support the measures in these bills to allow AUSTRAC to recover the cost of its supervisory activities from businesses which it regulates under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006.

"Saffin, Janelle, MP",ALP,2011-05-30,"



Ms SAFFIN
 (Page) (16:13):  I rise to speak in support of the Australian Transactions Reports and Analysis Centre Supervisory Cost Recovery Levy Bill 2011, the collection bill and the consequential amendments bill. Firstly, I would like to thank the Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Justice for considering at the outset the operations of small businesses in general and particularly in rural and regional areas. In some cases if the legislation had been applied in a blanket way, it could have adversely affected the operations of those small businesses and particularly those small businesses in rural and regional areas. I know from conversations with the minister and from consultations, which he was able to ensure happened around Australia, that we have got a good outcome. The minister took the time to listen to MPs and backbenchers. That was good, because backbenchers sometimes know a thing or two and are engaged on the ground. Ministers are backbenchers too, so they hear views from their electorates as well.


These bills provide exemptions from levy arrangements and businesses can claim if they fall into those exemption categories or will be exempted—as I read it—as of right if they are in certain categories. I am not sure of the mechanism by which they will exercise that but it seems that there are two parts in place for that. I am getting nods around the chamber, so I must have read that bit correctly.


The bills give effect to sensible recommendations announced in the 2010-11 budget that, from this financial year, 2011-12, will allow AUSTRAC to recover the cost of its supervisory activities from businesses regulated by the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act. Those activities have their genesis or their national legislation but they also give effect to part of the package of the counterterrorism conventions—and there are about 13 that we are obligated or mandated by the Security Council to put in place. Indeed, we want to at a national level for reasons that are self-evident but are worthy of reiteration. The minister has quoted the figures—as I think most people in this place have done. The Australian government figures show that organised crime—where a lot of money laundering and financing of terrorism activities do take place and can take place and not just here but also internationally—costs Australia about $15 billion a year. I take it that that $15 billion figure would mean cost by commission and omission.


The cost recovery that is inherent in these three bill is not new. In this area, the cost-recovery guidelines of 2002 lay out that approach. Its essence is simple. It is that entities that have created the need for government regulation should bear the cost of that regulation. People may argue that they do not allow any irregular activities that could facilitate crime and the things that we are talking about—and that may be so. But, when you are setting up a regulatory framework, it is like setting up your rates at local government level—we all have to bear that cost in a collective, coordinated way. It is no different when we are doing it nationally. It is the same cost-recovery model. If you are a beneficiary or are in a business that could cause some of that harm, even inadvertently, we all have to participate in paying in that way. The framework starts with the general and then it deals with the particular—in this case, the particular as well as that category of exemptions.


That brings me back to the small businesses and the rural and regional area and where the government is making sure that we have a coherent and cogent regulatory framework while, at the same time, making sure that small business does not have to bear the burden in a disproportionate way. This legislation is very mindful of that. It proposes that affiliates of registered remittance networks will not have to pay the levy. Affiliates are excluded on the basis that AUSTRAC's primary regulatory relationship will be with the registered remittance network rather than with individual affiliates. This removes a range of small businesses such as licensed post offices and newsagents from the operation of the levy. That is really important in my seat of Page and I know it would be in other seats. It was really important that that was one of the considerations that the minister and those in the department involved in preparing the legislation were able to turn their minds to.


For pubs and clubs in rural and regional areas, I understand that AUSTRAC is currently consulting on a draft rule around that area—again, looking at those venues where there are a certain number of gaming machines. That will be the benchmark for where the exemption is able to be had. It is also proposed to remove non-employing entities, such as sole proprietors and partnerships without employees—which are often run by families—and microbusinesses which employ fewer than five people. That is an ABS definition. They will be able to be exempt from the base component levy. That is rather sensible.


I understand that these three bills will recover $88.9 million in the period 2011-14. That is important, because part of governing is spending. I know that I like spending in my seat of Page and I am always asking ministers for money. But, as responsible members of parliament, we also have an obligation to talk about those bills that allow government to recover moneys and we have some responsibility to be mindful, particularly in terms of such a critical where the costs of organised crime do cost us as a community—that $15 billion a year.



I know that sometimes people think that these sorts of bills are not the bills that necessarily attract a lot of people champing at the bit to speak about them and that cost recovery, white collar crime and things like that might seem a bit pedestrian, but they are really fundamental to the way our criminal justice system operates and to good government. With those comments, I commend the bills to the House.

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2011-05-30,"



Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR
 (Gorton—Minister for Privacy and Freedom of Information, Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Justice) (16:22):  I thank the member of Page and the members for McEwen, Stirling and Oxley for their contributions. The member for Page is quite right; the government did consider the impacts upon small businesses, took submissions from representative bodies and took submissions from members of parliament, who raised the potential adverse impacts of this levy upon organisations within their own constituencies, particularly smaller businesses and businesses in those regional areas that we would not want to impose on unnecessarily. I believe, through the process of engagement with the sector, with members of parliament and with people who are advocating on behalf of those who are involved in this sector, we have come up with a very good balance indeed.


I note that the member for Stirling did indicate that the opposition would support this bill unamended through the House. Of course, we will wait to see whether in fact the opposition will support this bill unamended in the other place. However, I say to the opposition that, if we are looking at ensuring we are sufficiently resourced to have very strong, rigorous regulations to protect the interests of our financial system and indeed protect us against organised crime and other threats to this country, there needs to be a solution. If there is just criticism of a mechanism enclosed within a number of bills, that in itself is not enough. I do implore the member for Stirling to keep that in mind. It is important that we get this right. A lot of work has gone into this and a lot of engagement with the sector, and I do believe that we have struck the right balance.


Organised crime, as has been said by all of the speakers in this debate, is a significant national security threat and challenge for Australia. Through the Commonwealth Organised Crime Strategic Framework, the government is ensuring that Commonwealth intelligence, policy, regulatory and law enforcement agencies are working together to prevent, disrupt, investigate and prosecute organised crime. AUSTRAC plays a critical role in the fight against organised crime. Through its regulatory activities, AUSTRAC helps to mitigate the risk of Australian businesses being used for money laundering, terrorism financing and other organised crime. This legislative package is necessary to give effect to the 2010 budget commitment that, consistent with the government's cost recovery guidelines, AUSTRAC will recover the costs of its regulatory activities from 1 July this year.


The levy bill imposes a levy on entities regulated by AUSTRAC under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006. It provides that the amount of levy payable for each financial year will be determined by legislative instrument and cannot exceed a statutory limit of $33 million indexed. The collection bill enables AUSTRAC to collect the supervisory cost recovery levy and establishes the necessary framework for administering the levy, including matters relating to collection, invoicing and dealing with late payments. The collection bill also introduces administrative review of a decision by the AUSTRAC CEO to waive a levy or late payment penalty. Significant consultation has occurred with industry around the structure of AUSTRAC's supervisory levy. Through this process the government has, as I said earlier, listened to the concerns of business and made significant adjustments to lessen the burden, particularly on small business.


The third bill in this package, the consequential amendments bill, amends the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act to introduce compulsory enrolment for all reporting entities regulated by AUSTRAC. This formalises current arrangements where AUSTRAC encourages entities to voluntarily enrol. Mandating this requirement will mean that AUSTRAC can better identify its regulated population for the purposes of calculating and applying the AUSTRAC cost recovery levy. The consequential amendments bill also amends the current infringement notice scheme to allow for the issuing of notices for failure to enrol and failure to appropriately maintain enrolment details. I commend this legislative package to the House and, in doing so, I also table a correction to the explanatory memorandum in relation to all three bills.


Question agreed to.

"Pyne, Christopher, MP",LP,2011-05-30,"



Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Manager of Opposition Business) (20:06):  It is kind of so many of my colleagues to come into the House to listen to this debate tonight on the youth allowance. They have had many opportunities to be part of debates on the youth allowance, and it is nice that they are now finally taking the youth allowance issue seriously and coming into the parliament in such large numbers in order to find out why they should support the coalition's motion to extend the eligibility requirements for youth allowance for young people in inner regional Australia. I move:


That this House:


(1) notes that the Government has:


(a) admitted there is a problem with the criteria for independent youth allowance for inner regional students;


(b) committed to bringing forward its review of the matter with the broad purpose of finding a permanent solution to address the disadvantages that currently exist for rural and regional students in qualifying for financial assistance; and


(c) indicated it will remove the difference between the inner regional areas and the other regional zones for the eligibility criteria for independent youth allowance; and


(2) calls on the Government to bring forward its timetable for resolving the matter, and in particular ensure that:


(a) the review is completed and funds to pay for the measure are secured by l July 2011;


(b) the current eligibility criteria for independent youth allowance for persons whose homes are located in Outer Regional Australia, Remote Australia, and Very Remote Australia according to the Remoteness Structure defined in subsection 1067A(10F) of the Social Security Act 1991 also apply to those with homes in Inner Regional Australia from 1 July 2011; and


(c) all students who had a gap year in 2010 (ie, 2009 Year 12 school leavers) and who meet the relevant criteria qualify for the payment.


This is the fifth opportunity the parliament will have had since the last election to vote in favour of inner regional students. On 28 October last year the House dealt with a youth allowance motion, which was moved by the member for Forrest and seconded by the member for Gippsland, that would have placed inner regional students in the same boat as students from other parts of regional and rural Australia so they could qualify for the youth allowance under a criteria that was more readily available to regional students than the one that has been implemented by the government. That motion was supported by the crossbenchers and passed in October last year. The government took it as an indication from the parliament of the need to ensure that rural and remote students were fairly treated but did not act on the motion and in fact has kept the discrimination against inner regional students in place through to the present time, creating a cohort of students who are incapable of being eligible for the independent rate of youth allowance under the old criteria in spite of the fact that the government has admitted that those students are disadvantaged because they are in inner regional Australia and that this should be addressed.


The government has demonstrated its acceptance that this arrangement is discriminatory by announcing a review of the criteria for the independent rate of youth allowance for inner regional Australia that will apply from 1 January 2012 to report by July this year. The only problem with that policy solution is that it creates three cohorts of students. It creates a cohort of students from before 2010 who could apply under the old rules. It creates a cohort of students who can apply under the new rules in three parts of rural and remote Australia and it creates a third cohort of students—those who graduated in 2009 from year 12, who are ineligible to apply for the independent rate youth of allowance under criteria which are fair to them as regional students who are disadvantaged in terms of their access to tertiary education, which has not been taken into account by the government.


There have been three other occasions when the House has been called to vote on introducing fairness criteria for inner regional students. On 21 February this year the House dealt with a bill that was passed by the Senate after being sponsored by Senator Fiona Nash from New South Wales. It would have put inner regional students on the same footing as other regional students. That bill was passed by the Senate and defeated inexplicably by the crossbenches in the House of Representatives on 21 February.


Again, I moved in this House an amendment, which was dealt with on 3 March, to an amendment that had been moved by the member for Goldstein to the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2010-11 that would equally have placed inner regional students in a position where they were on the same footing as other rural and regional students. Inexplicably again the crossbenchers defeated that motion on the basis that they had done a deal with the government which would see a review of the youth allowance criteria for inner regional students and would give those students the opportunity to be placed in a fairer position than they are now. The flaw in that deal, the very substantial hole in the heart of that deal, is that it only required the government to report by July 2011 on how it would address the unfairness that is now endemic in the system, with the changes, if any, applying from 1 January 2012. Senator Evans in estimates indicated that there should be no expectation at all that the criteria would be changed. So the crossbenchers were sold a pup, a pup that they purchased at the expense of inner regional students.




Mr Tony Smith:
  It was a mutt.




Mr PYNE:
  It is mongrel of a deal; the member for Casey is right. The crossbenchers, I am sure in good faith, accepted this deal only to be sold down the river by Senator Evans and the Prime Minister, because the government is not intending to act until at least 1 January 2012, and even then Senator Evans has indicated there may be no change to the eligibility criteria. So again, on 23 March, an amendment was moved by the member for Menzies to the Families, Housing, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs and Other Legislation Amendment (Election Commitments and Other Measures) Bill 2011 that again placed inner regional students in the same position as all other regional students, and again the crossbenchers defeated that resolution.


The question leaps to mind: why would the coalition return a fifth time to move this motion. It does seem unprecedented that we would return with a fifth motion or amendment in order to place inner regional students in the same boat as all other regional students. We return with this motion because the unfairness the government has created in terms of eligibility for the independent rate of youth allowance is causing real hardship to rural families at a time when they can least afford it, at a time when cost-of-living pressures are rising well in excess of the official inflation rates. Every family knows that the official inflation rates bear no resemblance at all at the current time to the cost pressures that families are facing, whether they are school fees, electricity bills, food and grocery prices or the daily requirements of living. Those cost-of-living pressures are greater today than at any time in the 18 years that I have been a member of the House of Representatives. But at this really difficult time in families' lives the government has acted to create hardship for inner regional students who are clearly incapable of finding the 30 hours of work a week needed to qualify for the independent rate of youth allowance under the government's changes. They found it hard enough to qualify when the criterion was 15 hours, but finding 30 hours work is beyond the capacity of students in inner regional Australia. However, that is what is required by a government that is out of touch and far too focused on getting its carbon tax, its mining tax and its flood levy through the parliament. It has forgotten the daily needs of Australians from across regional and rural Australia who cannot go to university unless they get this vital support from government.

Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (20:14):  The member for Sturt said that perhaps the government is not focused. I say that we are focused on outcomes. If you listen to the member for Sturt you might think there had not been any outcomes as a result of the reforms of student allowances introduced by this government, but in fact there have. The number of enrolments in regional areas has increased since the introduction of these reforms, and many more students across the country have had access to student allowance than would have prior to these reforms.


I will talk about the reforms in general for a few minutes. In March 2010, the government introduced comprehensive reforms to ensure that, across Australia, more university students would have fairer access to student income support. The changes to the youth allowance eligibility criteria aimed to ensure a fairer and more equitable allocation of resources to provide support for the students who most needed assistance. The legislation giving effect to these reforms was supported by the coalition.


The reform package ultimately directed more support to students from low-income families who were genuinely in need of financial assistance. Prior to the reforms, the parental income test was just $33,300. The Bradley review found that 18 per cent of students who were living at home and receiving youth allowance through having been considered independent were from families with incomes above $150,000, 10 per cent were from families with incomes above $200,000 and three per cent were from families with incomes above $300,000. Accordingly, the review recommended the tightening of the workforce participation criteria. We did that and, at the same time, increased the number of eligible students by increasing the parental income test from $33,300 to $44,000. That is not all we did. We also began reducing the age of independence for full-time students receiving youth allowance. The implementation was phased so that the age of independence was reduced to 24 years from 1 April last year, 23 years from 1 January this year and 22 years from 1 January 2012.


With effect from 1 April 2010, all university students receiving student income support have also been entitled to a start-up scholarship for each year of their course. The scholarship provides essential assistance to university students for the high up-front cost of textbooks and specialised equipment. We also introduced a relocation scholarship. With effect from April 2010, all dependent university students receiving student income support who need to relocate to study receive a relocation scholarship. The scholarship will assist students with the high cost of establishing accommodation. This scholarship is also indexed. In 2011, it is valued at $4,124.


I am particularly pleased to say that, from 1 January 2012, students enrolled in all masters by coursework programs will also be eligible to apply for student income support. This is an excellent incentive for more mature people to upskill. From 1 July 2012, the personal income threshold will rise from $236 per fortnight to $400 per fortnight. Students receiving support will be able to earn up to $400 per fortnight without having their payments reduced. The student income bank will also increase from $6,000 to $10,000.


All of these changes significantly improve the capacity of students, particularly those from low-income areas, to access a university education. We have already seen, in the last year, the number of students from disadvantaged households enrolled in universities increase by eight per cent—a substantial improvement over past years.


There are 793 people who live in Parramatta who are now receiving youth allowance because of this government's changes to the youth allowance arrangements—that is out of a total of 3,517 receiving student income. This is a very good result for the people of my electorate. Parramatta has the 51st highest number of new youth allowance recipients across the country, and I am very pleased to be a member of the government which has delivered this benefit to people in my electorate. I am also delighted to say that Parramatta ranks very highly for numbers of start-up scholarships. We are in the top quarter in that list, and we rank about halfway on the list of areas where people have received relocation assistance. Of course, we are blessed with an excellent university campus in the Parramatta region. Many students also receive relocation grants to attend that university, and they are of course extremely welcome in Parramatta.


We will reap the rewards of this key investment in years to come. Unlike the coalition, who could have invested the proceeds of the mining boom mark 1 in education but chose not to, this government knows the value of investment in education and training and the value of supporting young people as they work hard to better themselves.


We are already seeing the effects of the changes flow through our communities. Labor's landmark reforms to youth allowance give more students the opportunity to go to university by targeting financial assistance to those with the greatest need. Just 12 months on, you can see significant flow-on benefits. Students who need support are receiving it, and hundreds of students are becoming the first members of their families to attend university. In just 12 months the number of dependent students from disadvantaged backgrounds receiving the maximum youth allowance payment has increased by 108 per cent, and the number of rural and regional university students receiving youth allowance has increased by 22 per cent. I should point out that under the coalition government the proportion fell but it has increased in the last year by 22 per cent. There has been a 15 per cent increase in the total number of university students receiving youth allowance; this is effectively an increase of 21,000 university students. New scholarships have also been hugely successful over the past year. There have been 240,000 university students who have received a Student Start-Up Scholarship and more than 55,000 of those are from rural and regional areas. More than 36,000 university students who need to move away from home to study have received the Relocation Scholarship and 15,000 of those are from rural and regional areas. More than 107,000 young people have already benefited from our changes because they are either eligible for youth allowance for the first time or they are receiving more money than before, and more than 36,000 of those are from rural and regional areas.


These figures show that after only 12 months the government's reforms have already resulted in a fairer and more equitable targeting of youth allowance payments. More than 18,000 students have achieved independence since 1 April 2010 as a result of the age of independence being lowered from 25 to 23, and 2,800 of those students are from rural and regional areas. From 1 July 2012 students will be allowed to earn more money through part-time work before their payments are affected when the personal income test threshold increases to $400 per fortnight. During the coalition's time in office the story was quite different. The participation rates of young people from regional areas declined. Regional participation rates fell from 18.7 percent to about 18.1 percent. Under this Labor government that number is tracking back up again.


The government's recent reforms to student income support have significantly improved the financial assistance to students from low socioeconomic backgrounds, including regional students. The government is responding positively to concerns about the current eligibility arrangements for youth allowance. The current arrangements for youth allowance were determined following an agreement between the government and the coalition in March last year. The government is committed to removing eligibility distinctions between inner regional and outer regional students by 1 January 2012. To facilitate this the government has brought forward a legislated comprehensive review of student income support with a particular focus on the capacity of rural and regional students to access higher education. The review is headed by an independent chair, Professor Kwong Lee Dow, and will report by 1 July this year. Options for implementing new eligibility arrangements are being considered as part of the review. The review is also considering appropriate savings that can be made to pay for extensions in eligibility for youth allowance. Following the review, the government will implement new eligibility arrangements for youth allowance to remove eligibility distinctions by 1 January 2012.


I am particularly proud to talk about our achievements in reforming student allowances. They have made a significant difference in my electorate and clearly they have made significant improvements in regional and rural areas as well.

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2011-05-30,"



Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Opposition Whip) (20:26):  I strongly support this motion moved by the member for Sturt because many families and students in my electorate have been unfairly discriminated against by the changes to youth allowance. In 2009 the Prime Minister decided to make the changes and she effectively chose winners and losers—and my students were the losers. The Prime Minister drew arbitrary lines on a map and inflicted stricter rules on those classified as inner regional compared to those classified as outer regional for the purpose of applying for independent youth allowance. So students have been, and still are, in limbo—that is what we have.


We continue to hear dreadful examples of how this is affecting those in regional and rural areas like my own. For example, I know of two students who go to the same school, travel on the same bus and live just kilometres away from each other, yet one of the students is able to have a single gap year and the other has to work for 30 hours a week for 18 months and take two years away from study just to qualify for youth allowance support.


I know that young people are choosing alternative pathways in year 11 and 12 already because they know their families cannot afford to send them to tertiary education and the government has not given them confidence. I know this because I talk to the mums and dads who are sometimes working two jobs each to try to afford their children's higher education or training at a time of significantly increased costs of living.


I understand the discrimination these changes have brought to students and families in regional and rural areas. We on this side have introduced motions and legislation aimed at putting fairness back into the criteria for independent youth allowance, but the Labor government has voted against fairness and equity for regional and rural students every single time. We have provided a voice on behalf of every student in Australia whose higher education is being so badly affected by the Labor government's changes to accessing youth allowance. The Prime Minister recently released a media statement that claimed more people are receiving youth allowance support than ever before, according to new figures. She claimed success there, but how many of the additional students come from inner regional areas? Where is the breakdown of where these additional students are coming from?


Unfortunately, the Labor government will go to any lengths and use all forms of spin to hide the truth that my students and their families are currently living with. This uncertainty is just dreadful. The truth is that students in inner regional areas are still being penalised by this government because of where they live and the Prime Minister continues to ignore their plight. They cannot find 30 hours of work in regional and rural areas because of seasonal work or a lack of work, or they cannot get access because of their age. I look forward to Senator Nash asking a range of questions during Senate estimates this week. The Labor government shows very little interest or understanding when dealing with the issues facing regional and rural residents. This was demonstrated to me when one parent recently contacted me. During this youth allowance debacle, on Wednesday, 17 June 2009, she sent the Prime Minister an email. She explained how these changes to youth allowance were affecting her family. To her surprise and disgust, it took until Friday, 6 May 2011 for her to see a brand new 'read receipt' email from her message. You might think I have mixed up the dates, but unfortunately it did take the Prime Minister—or her office—nearly two years to even read my constituent's email. And that was not the only time.


Unfortunately, it reinforces the message that the Prime Minister views students and families with contempt. I am appalled and hurt for my constituents. This has been going on for too long. It is a very serious matter, and I condemn the Prime Minister for her treatment of people who are seeking the best educational and training opportunities for their families. What it has done to some of these people is just appalling. I want to thank every family that came along to the hearings that Professor Kwong Lee Dow conducted in my electorate. They gave heartfelt and very genuine explanations of what it has done to their families, and I thank them for their contributions.


I call on the government to support this motion by the member for Sturt and bring forward the timetable for resolving this matter. It is so important to the decision making of young people and their families. Are they going to qualify this year? Will they be able to qualify next year? The young people who are in limbo deserve certainty and they need to be able to plan for their futures. This form of discrimination should not be allowed to continue.

"Zappia, Tony, MP",ALP,2011-05-30,"



Mr ZAPPIA
 (Makin) (20:31):  This motion by the member for Sturt, on the criteria for independent youth allowance, is nothing more than a pretentious attempt to show concern for university students. I make this single point: if he were truly concerned for university students he would have opposed the Work Choices legislation that the previous government, of which he was a member, introduced into this place. Most university students I know work part time. They do jobs that most other people would not do. They do not get paid terribly highly, yet it was them and people in similar employment positions who would have been most affected by the Work Choices legislation. In fact, they would have been much worse off because of it. They were the ones who were going to lose all their rights.


Let me also make it very clear that Labor believes the opportunity of high-quality education should be available to all students regardless of their background or where they live. The changes made to youth allowance payments in April 2010 were made to give more students the chance to go to university. They targeted those students most in need of assistance. Since those changes were made more than 100,000 young people have benefited because they are eligible for youth allowance for the first time or they are receiving more money than before. More than one-third of these young people are from rural and regional areas.


If this motion is designed to address a problem for students in regional areas, it ignores last week's announcement that the number of rural and regional university students receiving youth allowance has increased by 22 per cent since changes to youth allowance payments were introduced. Hundreds of students are becoming the first members of their families to attend university. The new scholarship programs that were introduced have also been hugely successful over the past year in helping more students overcome some of the costs that come with attending university. More than 240,000 university students have received student start-up scholarships towards their education costs. More than 55,000 are from rural and regional areas. More than 36,000 university students who need to move away from home to study have received relocation scholarship payments towards their accommodation costs. More than 15,000 are from rural and regional areas.


These changes have been positive not only for those living in rural and regional areas but also for those in my own electorate of Makin. For example, 841 young people in my electorate benefited from changes to the parental income test and now receive youth allowance. Since 1 April 2010, all university students receiving student income support have been entitled to a student start-up scholarship, providing essential assistance to university students for the high up-front costs of textbooks for each year of their course. In my electorate of Makin, 1,382 young people have benefited from these changes.


The member for Sturt may be delighted to know that over 2,000 residents of the Sturt electorate have received the student start-up scholarships since 1 April 2010. I question whether the shadow minister would roll back the changes made in April 2010 if he were in government, thus denying thousands of young people in his electorate critical assistance. Since April 2010, all dependent university students receiving student income support who need to relocate to study receive a relocation scholarship valued at over $4,000 for the first year and over $1,000 for subsequent years of their course. To this point, 140 young people from Makin have been paid a relocation scholarship. I understand that in the Sturt electorate 214 young people would not have benefited from the scholarship had Labor not been in government. All in all, some 2,584 people in Makin receive youth allowance, and I understand that the figure in the electorate of Sturt is very similar.


I will finish on this point: earlier this year we debated the student amenities legislation in this place. Again, I recall that the highest beneficiaries of student amenities at universities are young people from rural and regional areas. I also recall that it was the member for Sturt and his party who opposed that legislation every step of the way. If he were truly concerned about the welfare of students from rural and regional areas going to university he would have supported that legislation, but he did not—which again highlights that the motion he has brought before the House tonight is nothing but a stunt.

"Secker, Patrick, MP",LP,2011-05-30,"



Mr SECKER
 (Barker—Opposition Whip) (20:36):  I rise tonight to speak on this motion on behalf of all students in my electorate who are being unfairly discriminated against by this government. This is the government's fifth chance to change the criteria for youth allowance so that all students have a fair chance of furthering their education. The coalition has been pushing for the government to make the criteria fairer for inner regional students because the maps currently used are ridiculous and do not reflect the difficulties students from some areas have in getting to university. I note the member for Makin's comments, where he suggested we are ignoring the government's announcement last week about the increased numbers going to university. We actually do not have a problem with that; we support that. But there is still this problem, and what we are trying to do is address the problem caused by the criteria for the so-called inner regional students. To understand this, in South Australia we actually have the perfect example: Mount Gambier. Mount Gambier is about 450 kilometres away from Melbourne or Adelaide universities. So it is a long way, and there is no way they can actually go to university every day from home. Under the old criteria they had the opportunity of getting youth allowance if they were away from the workforce for 1½ years. But what we now have is that, in Mount Gambier, if you live in the city, 450 kilometres away from Adelaide or Melbourne, you are treated like a student in Adelaide or Melbourne, but if you live outside the town boundaries, you are treated as you were under the old Howard government conditions. So you have this stupid decision, which is based not on educational criteria but medical criteria relating to the availability of doctors—and, as a result of that, being in a city area like Mount Gambier, a reasonable sized city of about 23,000-24,000 people, you are treated differently.


Of course, if you have doctors operating from within the city of Mount Gambier, people from outside the boundary can go to those doctors; it does not really affect them. It is really only about the funding that goes to doctors in that metropolitan area of Mount Gambier. But in this situation, they have used those criteria to have two different standards of students. So, if you live inside the town, you are treated like someone who lives in Adelaide or Melbourne, but if you live outside the town limits, that line on the road, you are treated differently. This is obviously a stupid situation, based on criteria which are not related to education. So all we are trying to do is point out to the government, for the fifth time, that they do not get it, they do not understand that people in Mount Gambier are obviously very angry, on the basis that they are treated differently from those who live outside the township. And if you understood Mount Gambier at all you would know that outside the town boundaries is still part of the urban area, which is the District Council of Grant.


So we have these two classes of students. Inner regional students are currently forced to find 30 hours of work. Anyone who has any idea about regional communities would know that this is very difficult. I have received a huge amount of letters, calls and emails from concerned students and parents, over the length of this debate, because this is a genuine problem that needs to be fixed. As a representative of a large rural electorate, where parents are faced with huge costs to fund their children's university studies hundreds of kilometres away, I remain extremely concerned by the government's arrogant dismissal of the very sincere problems caused by the changes to the support arrangements for rural and regional students. This is an opportunity for the government to stop the inequity and get it fixed. (Time expired)

"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2011-05-30,"



Mr SIDEBOTTOM
 (Braddon) (20:41):  What we have with this motion tonight is a repetition of several stunts by those opposite—




Mr Secker:
  It's not a stunt; that's outrageous!




Mr SIDEBOTTOM:
  Thank you; you have had your four-pence worth. It is a stunt to raise an issue which this government is now, and has been for some time, taking on board. I do not deny the difficulty with the inner and outer regional classifications. The member for Barker and others here know that I have been critical of that for some time and remain so—and, with them and others in here, on my own side as well, saw to it that we had a review, and that is what we are indeed doing. So let us get the facts on the table for a start. We are having a review led by Professor Kwong Lee Dow, who has been going around regional and rural Australia taking evidence, and we have a commitment to do something about it, to remove the inequity in terms of eligibility distinctions that the member for Barker pointed out and which exists in my electorate. So I recognise that.


But, you see, we are dealing with this motion, which is in effect purely and simply rehashing an argument. And nowhere—apart from in the contribution of the member for Barker, to be fair to him—does it recognise the fantastic record that this government is now able to make some claim to in getting more students to university, and most especially more students from rural and regional Australia. I am glad the member for Barker was at least reasonable in making that case, because it was not the case with the member for Sturt or any other speaker that I heard from the other side. I think it is important, therefore, to restate that case: many more families and students are eligible for support to go to university now than ever before—and that is a tremendous thing.


We know that the reforms are striking a chord with students, particularly students with disadvantaged backgrounds. Indeed, the number of students receiving the maximum youth allowance—now, listen to this—has increased by 108 per cent. In anybody's terms, that is a policy that is working. It is doing what it is intended to do and on the grounds of equity, notwithstanding some of those anomalies have been raised both over here and by those on the other side. Importantly, the number of rural and regional university students receiving youth allowance has increased by 22 per cent. So, we have those on the other side telling us about the hard-luck stories, and I am not sure how they go about quantifying those, but there are many more good-luck stories because of this support scheme. There has been a 15 per cent increase in the total number of university students receiving youth allowance, so the scholarship program has also added to this and been highly successful. For example, more than 240,000 university students have received Start-Up scholarships towards their education costs, and more than 55,000 of the 240,000 are from rural and regional areas. Also, more than 36,000 university students who need to move away from home to study have received relocation scholarship payments towards their accommodation costs. That is more than 15,000 who are from rural and regional areas.


So, yes, there are some anomalies, but by far the greatest percentage of rural and regional students and their families benefit from this fantastic reform program. More than 170,000 young people have already benefited from our changes, because they are either eligible for youth allowance for the first time or they are receiving more money than before. More than 36,000 of these young people are from rural and regional Australia.


We have changed the parental income test, we have lowered the age of independence, and, when the personal income test threshold increases from $236 to $400 per fortnight from 1 July 2012, students will be allowed to earn more money through part-time work before their payments are affected. There are anomalies, but there are fantastic stories as a result of this legislation. (Time expired)

"Chester, Darren, MP",Nats,2011-05-30,"



Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland) (20:46):  In joining the debate I want to pay tribute in particular to the regional MPs on this side of the House, who have pursued the issue of student income support with such vigour over the past three years. I want to thank the shadow minister for education for his tireless pursuit of this on behalf of regional students and I also thank Senator Fiona Nash, who has been a great champion in the other place for regional students. I also recognise the members for Forrest and Barker, who have already spoken here tonight. I also thank every regional MP on this side of the House who has been prepared to stand up for rural and regional Australian students. If the time was not so limited for this debate tonight I am sure there would be a line-up at the door of regional MPs, like the member for Dawson, who is in this place, and Deputy Speaker Scott, the member for Maranoa, and my good friend the member for Wannon, who I know is very passionate about getting a fair go for students in his electorate.


That is the bottom line in this debate. It is about getting a fair go and abolishing the discriminatory system that was introduced by this Prime Minister when she was the Minister for Education. The motion specifically refers to the issue of independent youth allowance. I take up the comments from the member for Braddon, when he described this motion as a stunt. He knows it is not a stunt, because he knows there is a problem with the independent youth allowance system and these discriminatory boundaries, these lines on a map, between inner regional and outer regional. I also take up his comments in relation to the income thresholds for dependent youth allowance. No-one on this side that I am aware of has had a problem with the revised income thresholds. We are specifically talking about the independent youth allowance and the inner regional and outer regional boundaries.


This is Prime Minister Julia Gillard's mess. From the day the former education minister started amending the system of student income support, she talked big and she delivered a mess. Even the government has admitted that the system of discriminating against students, with definitions of 'inner regional' and 'outer regional' for the purpose of calculating the independent youth allowance, is a complete mess. We have these ridiculous lines on a map, which other members have already spoken about here tonight. The workforce criterion for achieving independent youth allowance in inner regional areas of 30 hours per week over a two-year period is almost impossible in many parts of regional Australia and completely impossible in all the rest. It is a very difficult criterion for students in small regional towns to meet.


The other problem we have, and the reason this motion is so important, is that the students from the 2009 and 2010 academic years will be treated inconsistently compared to their brothers and sisters or cousins from other towns who may have gone through year 12 at a previous time. So we have students from different years being treated inconsistently with their cohorts.


This motion gives the government a clear way forward. This government is always complaining that the opposition is too negative. Well, we are putting forward a positive solution here tonight to remove the discriminatory criteria by 1 July this year and to start fixing the mess. Many on this side of the House understand the problems with the current system of student income support and the impact it has on regional students. Some on the other side, including the member for Braddon, claimed to also understand the issues, which left me wondering why this government refused to act. Then it dawned on me. Regional Australia does not have a voice in the Gillard government cabinet. It is the most city-centric ministerial list you will ever see. I invite anyone to have a look. The minister for regional development, the member for Hotham, has his electorate office in Clayton. The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, a Queensland senator, has his electorate office in Brisbane. The Minister for Resources and Energy, the member for Batman, has his office in Preston. The Minister for Infrastructure and Transport, the member for Grayndler, has his office in Marrickville. I could go on, but the bottom line is that none of the senior ministers with carriage of issues that are critical to the future of rural and regional Australia actually lives in regional Australia. The minister for tertiary education is a senator for Western Australia, whose electorate office is in Perth.


These people simply do not understand the cost barriers faced by regional families in sending their children to university. They do not live and work in regional communities and they do not understand the hopes and aspirations of regional families. It is an absolute disgrace that we would have such a city-centric cabinet table that fails to stand up for the interests of regional people.


Finally, let me quote from someone who does get it, a concerned parent, Mr Rob Oliver from Sale, who made a submission to the government's current review. He submitted the following in a letter:


In summary the outcome of your review needs to be immediate action to fix this mess and give all regional students the same access to independent youth allowance. The entire community does not want to hear hollow rhetoric about an education revolution when the government's own actions with respect to youth allowance are inhibiting the education of our country students.


That says it all. This government cannot keep hiding behind its slogan of 'the education revolution'. It has to deliver a fairer deal for regional families. It has to fix the mess that Julia Gillard created.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2011-05-30,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (20:51):  I rise tonight to speak on the independent youth allowance, with a sense of irony. Irony, because it comes from the side of politics that for over a decade ignored calls to reform the youth allowance system. It ignored pleas from students, especially rural students. It ignored pleas from welfare peak bodies. It ignored calls from the education sector. In fact, it is the side of politics that ignored calls from just about everyone to improve access to youth allowance to make sure young Australians could get access to this vital payment. Those opposite had 10 years to invest wisely the fruits of the resources boom and to share the bounty of the nation with the nation. Those opposite had 10 years to invest in the skills and education of the future, but they failed to do so. Those opposite had 10 years to make substantive reform to the youth allowance system to improve access and outcomes, but they failed to do so—a failure that saw regional participation rates not just stagnate, but fall. So it is with a strong sense of irony that I rise to speak on this motion. In fact, I think it goes a bit beyond irony. It strains the bounds of credibility that those opposite would now seek to become the champions of access to education by all Australians, especially when we consider that, at the last election, they campaigned on a platform of cutting $1 billion from the trades training program. This policy would have seen over 1.2 million students from over 1,000 secondary schools miss out on the opportunity to engage in education pathways to become the next generation of electricians, bricklayers, hairdressers, chefs, plumbers and carpenters. And now those opposite have the audacity to continue to rail against this government's Building the Education Revolution, a program that in my electorate has seen new libraries and classrooms built and upgrades to essential infrastructure. So I find myself straining to believe that they are genuine about education and improving access and outcomes in education. However, for tonight, I will take it at face value because, as the saying goes, it is better late than never.


The historic reforms that this government has made to youth allowance has seen thousands of students from across the country, including regional students, gain access to opportunities which were unknown prior to the election of this government. The figures speak, and they are astounding. After just 12 months an extra 21,000 students are receiving youth allowance—a 15 per cent increase. There has been a 22 per cent increase in the number of regional students receiving youth allowance and there has been a staggering 108 per cent increase in the number of students from disadvantaged backgrounds receiving youth allowance. Let me just say that again. There has been a 108 percent increase in the number of students from disadvantaged backgrounds receiving youth allowance.


Our changes to youth allowance are a success. In just over three years Labor has dramatically increased the number of young people receiving support to gain an education. Unlike those opposite, who ignored for a decade the calls to improve the system, we are prepared to listen. We are not resting on our laurels. We are a government of reform and we are always looking for ways to improve. So I will not stand here and say that the task of improving educational opportunities is finished. We are prepared to listen, learn and constantly improve because we on this side are genuinely and deeply committed to education for all Australians. That is why we have brought forward the review into youth allowance, with a focus on the capacity of rural and regional students to access higher education. This review will consider options for new eligibility arrangements and appropriate savings that can be made to pay for any change to the system. It will report on 1 July this year.


This government is committed to education. It is committed to ensuring that every Australian can benefit from the opportunities that exist now and in the future. That is why we invested in the Building the Education Revolution program; that is why we are investing in skills and education; that is why we made historic reforms to youth allowance; and that is why we will continue to make reforms into the future.

Mrs GRIGGS
 (Solomon) (21:30):  It has been a very busy time back in my electorate of Solomon, with lots of activities, events and openings taking place. The SIDS and Kids NT is an organisation that is very dear to my heart. It always amazes how hard the volunteers work to raise the much-needed funds for the very important awareness programs for SIDS and Kids. A special acknowledgment and thanks must go to Fiona and Craig Peters, who work tirelessly for this charity, especially when there is a BBQ fundraiser. That seems to be their speciality—the best sausage sizzles in town.


On 5 May I was delighted to host the presentation of the Australian Defence Medal for three long-time Northern Territory residents which was held at the Palmerston Sports Club. I was joined by military representative Major Pat Hay and we presented medals to Mr Christopher McManis and Mr Noel Barry. Unfortunately, the third recipient, Mr Rodney Arrowsmith, could not attend, but we did acknowledge him on the day.


The Fred's Pass Annual Show was held over the weekend of Friday, 13 May to Sunday, 15 May and this year celebrated its 33rd year. There was a great range of stalls, exhibits, rides, food, drink and activities for everyone to get involved in. Each year this event seems to get bigger and bigger and better and better. Congratulations must go to the organising committee.


Following on from my previous mention in this House about the Arafura Games, on the final day of competition I attended the volleyball finals at Marrara Indoor Stadium. In an exciting nail-biting game between Papua New Guinea and Macau, PNG eventually took the men's gold medal. The medal presentation was very memorable with the winning PNG team singing their national anthem to a very excited crowd. Special mention and congratulations to Katie Sharpe from the Women's Defence team. She was awarded Best Setter and Most Valuable Player awards and was absolutely delighted! John Cassat from the Men's Defence team was awarded Best Server for the competition. A very special mention and congratulations to the Northern Territory medal winners and Alex Billeter from the Women's NT team, who received the Best Blocker award. It was wonderful to be able to present an award to a local. I was so very proud to also present the bronze medal to the Women's Tiwi Islands team.


To all competitors across all the sports and countries, thank you for participating in the games and thank you for visiting our beautiful Top End. Thank you also to the many volunteers and sponsors for their contribution to the games. Many have said that one of the highlights of this events was local talent Jessica Mauboy, who certainly knows how to entertain a crowd.


On Sunday, 15 May I attended Darwin's premiere pet event, the RSPCA Million Paws Walk at Jingili Water Gardens. It was a fabulous morning. It was wonderful to see many locals with their four-legged friends supporting this worthwhile event. My cocker spaniel Toby thoroughly enjoyed the event. He took a real liking to Alice Burton's dog Yani, who was in the running for the smallest dog on the walk and also Leigh Gordon's cute little black cocker spaniel Duke. Miranda and Michael Opie's babies, Gremlin, Muppett, Yetti and Womble, were all RSPCA rescue dogs and stood out in the crowd as they all wore pink tutus. The funds raised through walk registrations and online fundraising goes towards vital programs, services and campaigns undertaken by the RSPCA, as well as supporting our daily battle to stop animal cruelty.


I attended the opening of the new Woolworths store at Karama on Wednesday, 18 May. Locals tell me they are delighted with the new store and were very impressed with the refurbishments of the Karama Shopping Centre complex. I was surprised that there were so many people waiting for the shop doors to open. Officially, I was the second customer of the store, purchasing some locally grown heliconas for my electorate office. Congratulations to regional manager Michael Batycki, area manager Rick Lowe and store manager Domenic Devirgilio on the opening of this new store. If your first day was any indication, I am sure Karama residents are going to keep you very busy.


As part of Walk Safely to School Day on Friday, 20 May I hosted a healthy breakfast at Malak Primary School. Students loved the fresh fruit, yogurt, fresh bread and cheese. The biggest hit by far was the watermelon. A special thank you to Principal Peter Swan and his staff for registering the school for this event. There is a real sense of community within the school. This is a real credit to Principal Peter Swan and his dedicated team of teachers, such as Vanessa Hoare and Marita Maloney. After breakfast was finished I was asked to present the weekly awards—and that was such a privilege.



Finally, I attended the Paspaley Darwin Star Ball for the Starlight Foundation on Friday, 20 May with my good friends Erica Sims and Jack Cranwell. Through the generosity of Territorians more than $200,000 was raised for the Starlight Foundation on the night. One of the highlights of the evening was the raffle. (Time expired)

"Hunt, Greg, MP",LP,2011-05-30,"



Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (10:30):  On behalf of the people of Lang Lang, I want to refer to the risk that that wonderful town may lose—and has already partially lost—full police presence. Lang Lang has traditionally had a 24-hour police presence. However, not that long ago, due to reasons unrelated to the performance of an excellent local police officer, the officer was moved for reasons of safety. Since then Lang Lang has had partial police representation only. Against that background I have written to the Chief Commissioner of Victoria Police, Mr Overland, requesting that Lang Lang immediately be given a full 24-hour police presence. The reason for that is very simple. 


The Lang Lang Community Emergency Response Team, the CERT, is a group of dedicated ambulance volunteers who act as a first response until paramedics arrive. Mr Comber of the CERT made it clear to me that, with no police presence in town, recently one evening he was confronted by a mentally disturbed woman armed with a knife. Along with other CERT members, Mr Comber was forced to try to placate the woman and defuse the situation while waiting for police to arrive. There is no criticism of police; it is simply that the distance needed to be travelled was considerable. The CERT members were at risk for between 30 and 45 minutes. That has meant that they are constrained to a significant degree in what they can do to take care of people who may suffer from mental health conditions but have a violent tendency. This situation has been backed up by Mr Comber advising of another incident in which a young man was running amok through the town, smashing shop windows, damaging the community hall, vandalising the bus stop and destroying street lighting. I am also advised that other forms of vandalism and local crime have increased. 


As a consequence of this, I have written to the police commissioner. I believe that it is wrong, inappropriate and unacceptable for Lang Lang to be without a police officer on a 24-hour basis. This situation must be remedied. My approach will be to stand up for the people of Lang Lang to make sure that we have a full police presence and that the 24-hour police role that has traditionally been associated with this town is returned and that it is done as a matter of urgency. I will not rest until Lang Lang has a 24-hour police presence.

"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2011-05-30,"



Mr HAYES
 (Fowler—Government Whip) (11:01):  Today I rise to speak about an issue which is of great concern—that is, the persecution of the ethnic and religious minorities of Iraq, which has escalated since the invasion of Iraq by the coalition of the willing in 2003. Without wishing to be political about this, the point should be made at the outset that, regardless of the policy of participation in the coalition of the willing, Australia was part of the coalition and what goes with that, I believe, is responsibility. This is an issue that I have raised on a number of occasions in this chamber and also in correspondence with the minister for immigration. Unfortunately, however, this is an issue which is often sidelined in debate about Iraq and the ongoing security concerns in the region. My position is unequivocal. As a member of the coalition of the willing, Australia has a responsibility to pursue this issue and to do all it can as a good global citizen to raise awareness of the issue, in the first instance, and, more importantly, to ensure that the democratically elected government of Iraq protect all its citizens regardless of race and religion.


Regardless of one's opinion about the invasion, there is no doubt that persecution of minorities in Iraq requires compassion and a proactive response. I strongly believe those countries that participated in the 2003 coalition of the willing that invaded Iraq have a moral responsibility imperative, and that is what I want to focus on in this debate. Despite the Australian government's motives to help restore democracy in Iraq and to seize evidence of weapons of mass destruction, and despite the contest that may have been associated with that, the fact is that Australia did participate in that invasion. As a consequence, we have unleashed certain forces that hitherto were not fully understood before 2003. 


There are a number of credible reports that members of ethnic and religious minorities in Iraq are subject to continuous persecution, often to the point of death, within their own country. These include various Christian groups, the indigenous Assyrians, Mandaeans—the followers of John the Baptist—Chaldean Catholics, Syriacs and the other Aramaic speakers who have all called the geographic area known as Iraq home for the last 2,000 years. They all have a unique history within Iraq but, at the moment, they are all disproportionately represented amongst those who have fled Iraq since 2003. They are also disproportionately represented in the refugee numbers in Syria, Jordan, Lebanon, Turkey and Egypt. We see the numbers are truly astounding when we look at the figures associated with those who have fled Iraq due to persecution. The US State Department says that prior to 2003 Christian leaders estimated that there were somewhere between 800,000 and 1.4 million Christians across the various indigenous Assyrian groups, such as the Chaldeans, Syriacs and Armenians. Currently, according to the American State Department, the number is somewhere around 400,000. If you look at the Sabaen-Mandaean community—the community that follows the teaching of John the Baptist—you see the number is even more stark, with the current community numbering around 3,500—down from 60,000 in 2003.


It is clear that there is real persecution and a real ongoing fear of persecution for those minority groups in Iraq. It is not limited to religion or is it a black-and-white case of something that has been experienced by any particular groups. It transcends religion and includes groups such as, as I say, the indigenous Assyrians, whose rights must be protected in any resolution of contemporary Iraq.


While the Iraqi constitution protects freedom of association and freedom of religion, there is one hell of a gap between those statute rights and the real situation on the ground with these minorities being persecuted and those responsible for the persecution not being held to account. The reports, such as those released by the UNHCR, the Assyrian International News Agency, Amnesty International and the Minority Rights Group International, all point the finger that this persecution is happening and, quite frankly, that not enough resources have been committed to addressing these concerns. 


The Catholic Church, for instance, has estimated that this issue has seen over one million Christians flee Iraq since 2003. A secondary issue to all of that in this debate is the plight of refugees and the role that we in Australia have in assisting those persecuted to come to this country to make a new start. As I said at the outset, having participated in the coalition of the willing, for whatever reason, what goes with that participation is responsibility.


There are many people in my electorate of Fowler who come from these persecuted minorities and, as all participating in the debate probably know as well, they know what a first-rate contribution they have made as citizens of this country. They have embraced Australia as their new home and I have greatly enjoyed getting to know them and their communities better. On their behalf, I have written previously—as the member for Werriwa and now the member for Fowler—to the then Minister for Immigration and Citizenship, Senator Chris Evans, and to the current minister. I believe we must do more to assist those who are fleeing persecution in Iraq. This is our moral responsibility and, while so far very few visas have been granted to refugees fleeing persecution and currently sheltering in Syria, Jordan, Turkey, Egypt and other places, it is my strong hope that this will change as we do more in this space.


As I mentioned previously, I have forged a strong relationship with community leaders and I thank them for their continuous support and advocacy for their communities. In particular, I thank Mar Meelis Zaia, the Archbishop of the Assyrian Church of the East of the diocese of Australia, New Zealand and Lebanon, for his continuous advocacy and leadership on this issue. I would also like to thank and commend the work of Hermiz Shahen of the Assyrian Universal Alliance and Mr Amad Mtashar, who represents a significant proportion of the Mandaean population, which is also represented by me and the member for Werriwa.



In the limited time I have left, I would also like to draw attention to the provinces of northern Iraq, in the area of Kurdistan. Many indigenous Assyrians and Christian minority groups have sought sanctuary in those provinces. It is one thing to have a degree of sanctuary shown to them there, but without resources such as schools, hospitals and also the opportunity of having a future, it is one step away from the persecution from which they fled in other areas of Iraq. If we are going to be serious about a refugee or a visa solution to all of the issues here, we do need to make a renewed commitment with financial as well as other resources to Iraq with a view to reducing this persecution and doing something just for the people of Iraq.

"Ruddock, Philip, MP",LP,2011-05-30,"



Mr RUDDOCK
 (Berowra) (11:11):  Can I thank the member for Fowler for raising the matter of religious minorities in Iraq. I have over a long period of time associated myself with Sabean Mandaeans, Assyrians, Chaldeans and the Aramaic speakers generally, not because they are in my electorate but because they do have a very significant place in our community in Sydney. I had the opportunity of visiting many refugees in Jordan and Syria and I had the great privilege of being able to provide places within our refugee and special humanitarian program for people in need of resettlement in Australia who had fled Iraq.


Let me just make a couple of points about this debate, because I do not think it should be taken out of context. In my discussions with people in the region, particularly from the Middle East Council of Churches, I found a very real awareness of the plight that Christians have been suffering. But the council also made the point very strongly that we would not want to preside over essentially Christians being driven out of the Middle East generally. This has very real repercussions not just for Iraq but also for Syria, where many of the Eastern churches have their patriarchs and where some of these issues are arising now. The same issues arise in Egypt, where 10 per cent of the population, almost 10 million as I understand it, are Egyptian Coptic Christians. And so it is important, I think, to see these matters in the broader perspective. This is not about seeing Christians driven from the Middle East; it is about accommodating those who have had need to flee.


It is also important to understand that this is not a new issue. Christians were fleeing Saddam Hussein. Many of the people I met were people who had fled long before 2003. I do not wish to make an issue of it, but to suggest that our part in dealing with this issue is predicated only on having been part of the 'coalition of the willing' that got rid of Saddam Hussein would, I think, be hanging it on the wrong peg. Equally I would make the point that many of us who were involved in some of the decision making had a much wider perspective than just issues of weapons of mass destruction being potentially harboured by Saddam Hussein. I have to say from my own point of view, as one who participated in some of those decisions at an earlier point in time, it was the horrific gassing of his own population that had a far greater impact upon me. It was his lack of humanity for his own population that was a very real and substantial concern. But I do not make a debate about that. I simply want to be associated with a resolution that makes it clear that for more than 2,000 years religious groups have called Iraq their home, and they are fine people who are entitled to be able to exercise their choice to practise their religion as they see fit. Such provision is made in the Iraqi Constitution today but the concern as you go through and look at events that have occurred even in 2009 and 2010 is that many attacks do occur. I have got a schedule of incidents of violence that have been perpetrated against Christians, against Sabean Mandaeans, where people have been bombed, where they have been killed. Obviously it is those acts of terrorism, which may not be directed against them because of their religion but are directed against them, certainly not by the state, that can often bring people to a point where they flee. 


I think it is very important to know that the Assyrians and the Chaldeans and the Syriac people are descendants of the ancient Assyrian nation that occupied much of modern-day Iraq. They trace their roots back to more than history as we understand it. I think we have been enriched by having those people settle in Australia and able to talk with us about so much of their history and the importance of it. The Sabean Mandaeans I find particularly interesting. We all know of John the Baptist but we do not realise often that there are specific people who identify around him and who claim descent from his teachings. They are monotheistic, they are identified with the Sabean religion and are believed to have developed out of the mainstream Sabean religious community. The Mandaeans have applied the term Sabean Mandaean to themselves and they have become known by Muslims under this term. There are estimates that something of the order of 60,000 and 70,000 Sabean Mandaeans are around the world and still adherents to that religion. So I think it is very appropriate that today we have an opportunity to note the importance of these religions, to note that Australia can play a part where people have been subjected to horrendous acts of persecution. We know that they have been bombed, we know they have been murdered and we know that there is extortion.


Relevant to the numbers of people involved, I heard the honourable member speak of that and I noted that the Americans, because there are no census data available, have suggested that prior to the 2003 period Christians estimated their numbers of followers to be between 800,000 and 1.4 million. Currently they suggest it ranges between 400,000 and 600,000. These are very significant numbers. They may not be necessarily the one million that the member refers to I think in his motion or in his own discussion of this issue, but nevertheless they are very significant indeed. It is the case that it is highly unlikely that all of those people are going to be able to be resettled. Many of them have fled into other parts of the Middle East. While I would like to see them comprising a very significant proportion of our continuing resettlement program, I have to say that the special humanitarian program which many identify with and want to sponsor their own relatives is under enormous stress because of the unauthorised boat arrivals, and that is leading to many people being extremely disappointed that there are not places for them within the special humanitarian program. I think this reinforces the view that I hold very strongly that managing our borders is of particular importance because it enables us to focus on those people who need help most and to do so in an objective way. It is the case that many Christians, many Sabean Mandaeans, are sheltering in Syria, in Jordan and in other parts of the Middle East and they believe they cannot safely return home. I think it is important that Australia continues to play a role in ensuring that resettlement options are available for them. As I mentioned in the initial stage of my remarks, it was a great privilege to have an opportunity to see the circumstances in which many of these people were living in Damascus and in Amman. It was a great privilege to be able to play a part in ensuring that many were resettled here in Australia under our refugee and humanitarian program.


As has been noted by the member for Fowler, those who have come and made Australia their home have made a very significant contribution to this nation and will continue to do so positively. I think we are enriched when we are able to focus on our own religion and to understand its many roots and the different elements of our heritage—whether it be Catholic, orthodox or even Protestant—in places like Iraq and Syria. I commend the member for raising the matter and I hope Australia can continue to play a positive role in dealing with the problems that religious minorities are facing, not only in Iraq but in the Middle East generally.

"Ferguson, Laurie, MP",ALP,2011-05-30,"



Mr LAURIE FERGUSON
 (Werriwa) (11:21):  I am pleased to join the two previous speakers, who have long-term credibility in association with Middle Eastern Christians and their causes. There is one group who are not included in the motion because they have no constituents in this country to advocate for them. They are quite small. They are the Yazidis, who are misdescribed often as devil worshippers. In the last two years, they have suffered a particularly horrific attack, when Islamic fundamentalists sent a truckload of explosives into one of their small villages and murdered hundreds of people.


I do not want to enter into the debate between the two previous speakers about the connection between the Western intervention in Iraq and the persecution of Christians; I do, however, note that the former Bishop of Parramatta, Kevin Manning, in his strenuous opposition to the war, placed a very heavy emphasis on what he predicted to be its outcome for Christians. That was because of his close association with the Catholic Bishop of Baghdad. There were very early predictions that, because of the association of Christianity with the Western world, there would be very counterproductive outcomes for them. That is not to say by itself the intervention was right or wrong, but it is certainly a factor in what has occurred.


There is no doubt that we have witnessed a significant long-term assault on the Christian minority in Iraq. It has been characterised by the kidnapping of bishops and at least 12 priests and by car bomb attacks on churches. In November of last year there was a physical siege of a major church, leading to the murder of 52 people. I noticed a report by Serena Chaudhry in Reuters in the last month or so, during Easter, which talked about a person, Raad, who had lost 30 personal friends in that murder of 52 people.


I agree with the member for Berowra on one point—that it would be an unfortunate outcome if we spent all of our energy on facilitating the departure of Christians from the Middle East. Obviously the genesis of Christianity is in that region, there are many historical ties to the Middle East and there are various important religious centres there. I read a book in the last year or so about the experience of a Baghdad Jewish family who had an internal debate in their family about whether they should go to Israel in the early years of its establishment and the way in which various Zionist organisations paid Jews to leave Baghdad at that stage to build up Israel. It was a heart-wrenching decision for members of that family. Some of them stayed in Baghdad because of thousands of years of connection with the city and only left later when persecution occurred and they became the victims of internal political struggles in Iraq, whereas others left earlier.


I do not think the aim should be that we put everyone on planes and send them to America and Australia, but there is no doubt that significant numbers of Christians have fled the region and should become a major consideration of countries with regard to their refugee intake. There is quite a bit of debate about the figures. Austen Ivereigh, in October 2010, talked about there only being 800,000 Christians in the early 1990s. Other figures are in the area of 1.15 million, going down to 850,000 in recent years. The member for Fowler has cited other figures from the US Department of State. But what is very fundamental is that a very large number—of the order of hundreds of thousands—of Christians are fleeing to Jordan and Syria in particular. 


I want to say in passing that another threat they face is right on the horizon today and that is the question of what occurs in Syria. No-one would defend the Assad regime; no-one would stand by its attack on Homs in the 1990s or the current shooting down of demonstrators. But in this week's New York Review of Books, Melise Ruthven makes this point:


While its massacre in Hama was horrendous and it has an abysmal record on human rights, engaging in torture and severe political repression, it—


that is, the Syrian government—


had a good, even excellent one when it came to protecting the pluralism of the religious culture that is one of Syria's most enduring and attractive qualities. Some of these virtues are captured in Brooke Allen's engaging account of her travels in Syria, The Other Side of the Mirror, where she meets ordinary people from different backgrounds and rejoices in the natural friendliness of Syria's people and the extraordinary richness of its past. Instead of the Soviet-style grayness she expected to find from accounts in the US media, she discovers a sophisticated cosmopolitan society where life is being lived in many different styles and varieties.


The author of the book review goes on to say:


Visiting several mosques, churches, and shrines, she provides impressive testimony of the country's religious diversity and the regime's commitment to religious freedom. It would be tragic if the pursuit of democracy led to the shredding of this bright human canopy, where religious and cultural differences seem to have flourished under the iron grip of a minority sectarian regime.


The reality is that we might not have much time for the Assad regime—we know that it is Alawite self-interest which preserves this pluralism—but one of the realities that Christians in the Middle East understand is that, whatever we say about their lack of democracy and the suppression of human rights, we have a serious problem now with what is going to happen to Christians in Syria, including the significant number of Iraqi Christians who have fled there. I had a discussion with former Minister for Foreign Affairs Downer recently and he was making the same point. As I say, it is a very complex picture.


I would hope that many Muslims would join Shaikh Shuja, the Chairman of the British Muslim Council, who, in the attacks of November last year stated:


For more than 1,000 years Christians, Jews and Muslims have lived in peace and harmony as good neighbours, and we have no doubt that they will continue to do so. The present suffering of Christians is a part of the tragic political situation suffered by all the people of Iraq. The Christians in Iraq are a part of Iraq. The majority of the Christians are not likely to leave Iraq and, if they do so, those who are left there are likely to be more vulnerable …


It is important that the Muslims in Iraq and the world over should come forward to express their condemnation of persecution of the Christian minority and to give whatever spiritual, material and practical help they can.


This important statement by, as I say, British Muslims shows that they appreciate just how dire have been the circumstances of Christians in recent years. This is, as the member for Fowler has indicated, a matter of great significance to significant numbers of Christians who have entered Australia and who tend to reside in the member for Fowler's electorate, my electorate and other parts of the Liverpool region. 


They have been assiduous in lobbying members of parliament to make sure that there is an understanding of the continuing plight their people suffer in the region and to make sure that, when we consider the size of our refugee intake and where we take people from, this continues to be a significant factor. As both members have indicated, they have proven to be a very good group of citizens. They are highly concentrated in areas such as jewellery and IT. They are essentially—more, perhaps, in the case of the Mandaeans than the other groups—very Western oriented. If you went to their events, you would see the way in which they have integrated very fully, not only to the employment opportunities in this country but to the actual culture. One of the things that particularly impresses me about the Mandaeans, amongst all the other groups, is that they have been outward going. They have made sure that they have associated themselves with Australian NGOs and with community groups outside their own community. They have not been insular; they have not been separate—they have sought to come into the mainstream of this nation.


As I say, I fully associate myself with the two previous speakers in raising an important matter. In a world that has many similar human rights issues where large numbers of people flee from persecution, it is important, given Australian involvement. We are not saying for one moment that it is necessarily the be-all of association. It is a complex situation. There are Islamist fundamentalists, Salafis, who would have murdered Christians at the drop of a hat. It did not necessarily require Western intervention. But we did have it, it is an ingredient, and we should make sure that we continue to focus on this area, to press government and to press departments to make sure that this group remains in our minds with regard to the refugee humanitarian intake.

"Simpkins, Luke, MP",LP,2011-05-30,"



Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (11:30):  When I became aware of this motion this morning, I chose to take up the opportunity to speak, not because there were a great number or because I have been contacted by members of these persecuted groups but because I have often spoken in this place of the need for religious freedom in the world. Particularly in the region of the Middle East, we see that there are problems. In Iran, we see the problems for the Baha'is. In Egypt, we see the problem for the Copts. For those reasons I am particularly keen to speak on this motion and reiterate the messages of previous speakers.


When we look at what is happening in the Middle East now, we can see that there are times of great hope ahead. With what happened in Egypt, to a degree, and what has happened in Libya, the mood is for change and the mood is for democracy. We should be very encouraged by that. Unfortunately, things have not worked out quite the way that a lot of these religious groups had hoped they would. I know that for the Coptic people in my electorate of Cowan the hopes they had for Egypt are unravelling fast.


Indeed, when we look at Iraq, the hopes of religious minorities in that country also have not been fulfilled. What we want for Iraq is a strong democracy, pluralism and opportunities for all forms of religion to have the freedom that they desire so that their followers can live in peace and can raise their children in peace and adherence to their faith. But that is not the case. It has always been difficult in the last thousand years or so for Christians in the Middle East, and it certainly does not appear to be becoming any easier in Iraq.


We see that there are certain groups, whether they are al-Qaeda or other extremist Islamic groups, which tend to look at minorities as an opportunity to blame, to persecute, to further their political considerations and to further their political case for power. When you look at Iraq, at the need for constitutional change and the need for the democracy to really strengthen and lock in the rights of religious minorities, there is still a distance to go with regard to these matters. There are laws, of course, that say you have freedom to practise your religion, but unfortunately there is also a lack of will on many occasions. Crimes go on against these groups—churches are blown up; people are attacked with bombs or are shot—and the state of investigation is highly disappointing. It is a major problem in places like Iraq and it is a major problem in the region. But it is not right for us to immediately opt for the safe haven. As has been said by people who have some of these particular groups within their electorate, they have come to Australia and have flourished, and long may it be the case that we have the opportunities for people to come here and carry on practising their religious freedom. 


We should be looking at some of these countries to try to work with them to strengthen their democracy and help them to move towards a time when not only can they have a constitution that guarantees religious freedom but also there is a willingness and a determination by all agencies of government—defence and police—to comply with the needs of minorities. That is what we should be working towards and what we must do. I agree that all of the groups mentioned have added great value. They have integrated well into our society and enjoy the freedom that we have. Within the constraints of the humanitarian program we should be looking for further opportunities whereby such people can be given the chance to come to Australia and flourish. Admittedly, the humanitarian program is under some stress at the moment, and I do not wish to go there in this debate, but I think that when there are further opportunities to reconfigure the humanitarian program we should look to make contact post 2003 and allow these groups of people into the country.


There is a fair bit in the motion about what has changed in Iraq since 2003. It is clear that a lot of work needed to be done post 2003. I have already alluded to and spoken about some of that. At the same time, no-one could ever say that Saddam Hussein was any form of positive influence on religious freedom or the freedom of minority groups. Irrespective of why the second war in Iraq took place, we should have the confidence to say that the removal of Saddam Hussein was overwhelmingly positive for Iraq. There will always be challenges, because into the environment that followed his removal and the fall of his regime, came those who sought to take political advantage. The long enmity that has existed between Iran and Iraq and the influence of al-Qaeda and those who are against some of the religious elements within Iraq have created opportunities post Saddam Hussein for havoc, death and destruction. 


There is hope for the future in Iraq. We should focus on trying to work with that country to encourage it and the instrumentalities of its government to make the most of the new democracy—the new period—and be very determined to develop the right laws and implement those laws to ensure that minority groups are protected.


I conclude by saying that I support the inclusion of Christians within the humanitarian program, particularly those from Iraq who are a good and positive influence—the Medes and the Chaldeans. I also support the words of the motion that more needs to be done in Iraq. I also pray for the Christians who have long been persecuted not only in Iraq but within this whole region, and I include here my good friends from the Coptic Orthodox Church who have been so badly persecuted in Egypt.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER (Ms Vamvakinou):
  Before the debate is resumed on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2011-2012, I remind the Committee that pursuant to the resolution agreed to by the House on 10 May 2011 this order of the day will be debated concurrently with Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2011-2012 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2011-2012.


Debate resumed on the motion:


That this bill be now read a second time.


to which the following amendment was moved:


That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:


""while not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House:


(1) condemns the Government for incorporating in an annual appropriation bill provisions to increase the limit on government borrowings above the total of $200 billion;


(2) recognises that a special case must be made for such a significant increase in borrowing limits and that the Government must explain any special circumstances that it believes justify such an increase; and


(3) demands that the Parliament be given the opportunity to consider separately and vote on the proposed increases in borrowing limits set out in Part 5 of Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2001-12.""



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The immediate question is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question.

Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (16:01):  We heard all the leaks which said that this was going to be a tough budget. Yes siree, the Treasurer and the Prime Minister were talking it up all along. This, my friends, was going to be the year of delivery. Well, they got that right! They delivered a $49.4 billion deficit; they have delivered a record borrowing limit of $250 billion; they have delivered a record net debt of $107 million; they have raised their own record borrowing on a daily basis to $135 million per day; they have raised their own record of interest payments on this debt to $7 billion per year—that is, $19,178,072 per day or $799,086 per hour, after hour, after hour, of interest payments alone. 


We have heard about the China boom mark 2. We have heard the Minister for Foreign Affairs wax lyrical about the rivers of gold coming to our economy. But we have seen what this government has done with these and we—the people of Townsville—sit back, scratch our heads and wonder what happened. And what do we have to show for it: debt, no plans and no prospects. We certainly have seen growth though. The Commonwealth Public Service has grown by over 20,000 people since 2007. While the Prime Minister was telling everyone that things are tough and we have to tighten our belts, her Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet grew by over 100 new staff. This budget does not deliver what it promised. In fact, the biggest line item in the savings in this budget is the flood levy itself. This government can talk pretty tough, but it cannot back it up. 


I take issue, as does my electorate, with the announcement of funding for the Bruce Highway and roads in North Queensland. The Treasurer carried on about the announcement of roadworks in Vantassel Street as though it was brand-new funding. Those of us who have been hit by the continual flooding of the Bruce Highway know that this was already to be done. This flood mitigation work was pulled during the recent floods to aid flood mitigation work elsewhere in the state. The project has been reinstated but surely the Treasurer will not mind if we in Townsville take this promise with a grain of salt. It should never have been pulled in the first place.


In the week prior to the budget, I held a budget roundtable in Townsville. Those in attendance included small businesses in the mining and construction sectors, retail and service industries, and representatives of our region's chamber of commerce and health sector. To a person, they want the waste stopped. They look at the way this country and our state of Queensland are being run and they want the waste stopped. They are sick and tired of being treated like an ATM for any level of government which cannot balance its books. Each and every one of those represented at the meeting have been forced to make tough decisions to keep their costs down. But at every turn they are faced with an increasing number of taxes, charges and regulations from government, which simply does not see anything other than an easy grab. It has to stop. I call on this government to get serious about taxation and deliver on its promised tax summit so that real reform to the way business and individuals are taxed can be discussed and implemented. In Townsville, the message I am getting is that business is simply not hiring. We have seen unemployment rise to 8.5 per cent in my city. While there are significant projects happening in Queensland, Townsville may face skill shortages as professionals in trades chase jobs across the state and the country. All these government charges and regulations are making it increasingly costly to live anywhere, but especially in Townsville. There have been interest rate rises, levies, rising government charges and the like which have added to the pressure on ordinary families. The strain is seen in my office every week when I see broken families and pensioners come to me, worried about where they will get the money to survive. They do not care whose fault it is that bananas are $13 a kilo or that petrol is $1.45 per litre. They just want help, and they do not see it coming from this government.


What they do see coming from this government is a continuation of the failed pink batts and school halls programs. What they do see is a set-top box program worth $376 million being rolled out by the same people who delivered the pink batts program and the solar power program. Somewhere in that meeting surely someone, anyone, would have said, 'Are we sure about this? Haven't we got form on this sort of thing? Haven't we learned any lessons from the last few times we got involved?' Surely someone somewhere said something about it costing $360 for a set-top box to be installed at a pensioner's home. I checked the website of the Good Guys in Townsville and found six different digital TV sets costing under $360, the cost to install a set-top box. So why bother with a set-top box at all? Send them all to Troy Williams and they can get a brand new TV for less than the government is paying. Where is the sense here, and why has no-one in the government stood up in this place and said, 'This is just not a good idea'?


Of course, the whole budget is basically predicated on a lie, and the Treasurer dare not speak its name. That the carbon tax is not mentioned in the forward estimates reduces this budget to a farcical document. He comes into this House and pours scorn on all who dare to question his commitment to the tax. But he is not allowed to include it in his calculations, nor was he a part of the team used to sell the product to start off with. This government does not care about global warming, climate change or climate action. What this government care about is telling Australians that the budget will be back in surplus in an election year, and they do not care how they do it. They simply cannot stop spending. It is only by taxing people that they can do this. This government and the Treasurer want the people of Townsville to believe that the budget will be back in surplus due to economic management but, in truth, they are just going to raise taxes to try to get a result.


I would like to say that the reforms to mental health are welcomed by all of us. It is a good start, but there is still a lot of work to do. I would like to use this opportunity to call for the states to get out of mental health altogether. We need a system where decisions are made and the money gets to the pointy end as quickly and as intact as possible. By having to engage the states in the process, there are extra costs which take vital funds away from the clinicians and the services they provide. I recognise the government's commitment to headspace and the recent approval of the headspace phase 1 at Riverway in Townsville. This is a vital project, and the non-intrusive way in which young people can access services will save this country millions of dollars into the future. I know that the Mental Illness Fellowship of North Queensland has also received funds from this government to establish a proper base in Townsville away from the hospital in a non-threatening manner. I note that Andy Froggatt, their soon-to-depart CEO, has worked very hard to get this up across all levels of government. I thank the government for their support here. I do note though that the new funding is actually outside the forward estimates. I just hope that this is not some sort of accounting trick to appease the sector while not delivering on these vital reforms.


I want to touch on something not covered in the budget but something that surely must be considered. The Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme, or the DFRDB, needs to be indexed correctly. I am not about to take a swipe at this government for its inaction, because it has been in front of the Whitlam government, the Fraser government, the Hawke government, the Keating government, the Howard government and the Rudd government. As well as the Gillard government, all have ducked and weaved on the issue and made those people in our defence forces who have served at least 20 years all the poorer by doing so. The Whitlam government needed cash and took the money for the Defence pensions and absorbed it into consolidated revenue. For that, he told the forces, they would keep all their benefits and their pension would be indexed to the consumer price index, the CPI. Every other pension is also indexed to the male total average weekly earnings, the MTAWE, and the pensioner and beneficiary cost of living cost index, the PBCLI, as well as the CPI, whichever is the highest. This has meant that the DFRDB recipients have slowly but surely slipped further and further behind.


I have a very good working relationship with retired Brigadier Neil Weekes, who is a DFRDB recipient. In one of our conversations last week he asked me if it was fair. When I asked him what was fair, he responded by asking me what was fair or right that DFRDB recipients who have served a minimum of 20 years in the armed services continually are treated as second-class citizens by their government. We as politicians line up every Anzac Day and we let the reflected glory of our men and women of the armed services wash over us at functions and on exercises. But as soon as they retire we drop them like a bad habit. We, the coalition, have finally been able to get this as policy on our side and we will fix this once we have government. But wouldn't it be lovely to be as one House on this issue? It is no wonder that all politicians are treated with scepticism by the defence forces when we are pretty much two-faced in how we deal with them. No, Neil, it is not right and it is not fair.


When it comes to education, I have real concerns about some of the government's plans in this country. I worry about NAPLAN. I worry that it has become the only thing taught in schools. It is the only thing taught in the years that the test is given. It is the only thing taught in the year preceding the examination. My question is: what happens to sport or music or art? These are disappearing from our schools' teaching landscapes as the My School website is hanging schools out to dry. The $400 million being touted as bonuses for high-performing teachers is simply misguided. The sooner we as a country realise that teaching is a calling and the money, while important, is not the sole decision maker for professionals making the career choice the better. I think you would find that most primary school teachers would prefer the money to be spent on additional aide time to assist them with delivery of quality education. By installing a bonus system into schools you are making internal politics and personal relationships more important than providing education to our children. I would also call on the government to recognise the need for funding equity in primary and secondary schools. If we can learn that mental illness can be better treated if detected early—and the cost to the community is lowered if it is treated early—then surely funds must be made available to primary schools to pick up and treat learning difficulties and/or disabilities.


This budget does not provide a decent building block for the future. It is too much of a punt to be taken seriously. This budget fails to address rampant government spending and papers over the cracks instead of bringing in real reform. For the sake of Australia and for the sake of Townsville we must have a change of government.

"Cheeseman, Darren, MP",ALP,2011-05-30,"



Mr CHEESEMAN
 (Corangamite) (16:13):  I take this opportunity today to speak on the very important Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2011-2012 and related bills. This is a vital budget for this nation and it is certainly a Labor budget, a budget that focuses on the key elements and key challenges that this nation faces, both in terms of building a modern economy and also making sure that every Australian has the opportunity to participate in a workplace and to earn a respectable wage. I believe this budget is not only very much a Labor budget but also a very fair budget, a budget that is very smart and of course does recognise the very important challenges our nation faces and will build employment opportunities as the private sector returns to this economy following the global financial crisis.


The budget talks about an economy that has near full employment. In my electorate of Corangamite and also in the broader Geelong area there is almost full employment at the moment. Many of the communities that are still suffering from unemployment have in fact had multigenerational unemployment, and I believe this budget provides opportunities for those particular parts of the Geelong community to engage in the workplace.


It is fair to say that our economy is the envy of the rest of the world. Many parts of the OECD still have an unemployment rate that is close to 10 per cent. Of course our own unemployment rate is just a tick under five per cent. This budget is the right budget for this particular point in Australia's evolution. It provides for record investment in many parts of our economy, particularly the nation-building parts of our economy—rail, road and our telecommunications system. The National Broadband Network will be critical, particularly for rural and regional Australia. The regions will be given a playing field level with that of metropolitan Australia, something that has certainly not been the case with broadband. Being a regional member of the House of Representatives, I am very pleased and proud that the National Broadband Network will open up our economy and put us on a level playing field.


This budget provides $1.8 billion for critical infrastructure upgrades to our public hospitals and health services, particularly for the regions. In Geelong we were very pleased to receive the announcement of $26 million for a regional cancer centre, which will not only service the broader Geelong region but will provide very important cancer outreach services to the Western District of Victoria, an area that has suffered from high rates of cancer. This fantastic initiative was put forward by the Geelong Hospital, and I was very pleased to be with the minister, Nicola Roxon, in Geelong to make the announcement that we would invest in that very important area.


This budget also delivers in terms of our transport infrastructure in Corangamite and for the whole of the western side of the state. Particularly, we are working in partnership with the state government to deliver the Regional Rail Link, an important piece of Victorian infrastructure that this government is committed to, which will assist western Victorians with access to Melbourne via public transport. Importantly, locally this budget continues to deliver the necessary funding for the Geelong Ring Road, which is a very important road in the Geelong region, and also provides funding for the continued duplication of the Princes Highway. The Princes Highway is arguably the most important piece of economic infrastructure in the Geelong region. Again, we are delivering the necessary money to duplicate it not only to make the road safer but also, importantly, to open up the western side of Victoria and to provide a very much safer transport passage and greater access for primary producers and others in western Victoria to get their product to the port of Geelong, the Port of Melbourne, Avalon Airport and Tullamarine Airport. I think that says a lot about this government and the priorities that we have set. We very much believe in putting in place the nation-building infrastructure that we do of course require.


Importantly, this budget also continues the process of implementing our historic higher education reforms. I have spoken on education in almost every single session of parliament since we came to office in 2007. We certainly have great ambition for Australia's education system, whether it be our universities or our schools. I must say I am a very proud member who has contributed to a lot of the debates that have taken place in this place on education. This budget continues to deliver with respect to that. Again, some $500 million is available for regional priorities. Again, this particular government is very keen to ensure that our regions do not miss out. Labor has had a very proud and longstanding history with respect to Australia's regions. Importantly, this budget again prioritises funding for our regions.


This budget also provides some $916 million for regional infrastructure projects that will be undertaken by our regional development bodies. They will be prioritised by those bodies. We have made available funding for those regions for the very projects that they require and that they consider as priorities. It is part of a $1 billion program that this government has committed to over the next five years.


I do want to make the point that in every budget, except for this last one, Labor have been in a position to be able to deliver tax cuts. We were not in a position to be able to do that with this budget. I know that the Treasurer has had to make some very tough decisions to enable us to bring the budget back to surplus. We will of course continue to work hard to do that. In terms of reducing the Commonwealth spend as a proportion of the economy, I think this budget is the single biggest step back that the Commonwealth has ever made. It is important that we do that, because we have a very substantial pipeline of private sector funding, particularly in association with the mining industry, that will be coming through in the next few years. It is important that the Commonwealth step back from the economy to enable that investment to come through. If we do not make those tough decisions and the Commonwealth does not reduce its spending—which is what we are doing—then of course that will have inflationary consequences in the Australian economy and will push up the cost of living and a whole raft of other things. We have delivered what I believe to be a very substantial budget.


I particularly want to make the point that, for many generations, my seat of Corangamite was considered a backwater by the Liberal Party. They owned the seat—that was their belief—for some 73-odd years and nothing much ever happened. There was no funding, no election commitments and no campaigning. None of that took place. We worked hard and we were able to win the seat in 2007 and again in 2010. That really was on the back of a lot of hard work and getting the right mixture of projects in the seat to open up the economy and to provide opportunities for young people from my part of the world to go to university, not only to the major metropolitan universities but also locally. We have worked hard with Deakin University to put in a lot of additional money to enable it to grow as an institution. I certainly look forward to continuing to work with the university to grow that institution, which has very much embraced Geelong and assisted the great transition that has taken place across the Geelong community. It is an innovative university and one that is very comfortable working with the federal government's innovation agenda. I look forward to continuing to work closely with it and the various ministers to ensure that it is able to grow and provide opportunities for young people.


It is also important to recognise that every single primary school in my seat has had a construction project either finish or be underway—building new classrooms, new libraries, new sports stadiums and the like to help educate young people. When I get around to talk to those school communities—the parents, the teachers and the students—they are all singularly excited by the Commonwealth government's massive investment in Victorian schools. It was pointed out to me that Building the Education Revolution was like the equivalent of 10 years of normal state government capital—a massive investment to help stimulate the economy but also, importantly, to provide modern educational spaces which teachers could use. We have also put money into the new GP superclinic. We continue to work with Deakin University and the innovation centre. We continue to invest in the duplication of the Princes Highway and in the Geelong Ring Road.


This budget, as I said earlier, is a budget for its time. It is a tough budget. We have had to make some difficult and challenging decisions. But I think it will set up our economy to take full advantage of the mining boom. I commend the bill to the House.

"O'Dowd, Ken, MP",Nats,2011-05-30,"



Mr O'DOWD
 (Flynn) (16:28):  I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No.1) 2011-2012 and the 2011 Labor budget. It is important that I place on record how little this budget delivers to the people of my electorate of Flynn. Flynn is a very productive electorate. It has aluminium and cement industries and coal-fired power stations. It is the beef capital of Australia. It has grain, citrus, sugar cane, small crops, cotton—it goes on and on. We add a lot to the Australian economy.


I want to expose this budget for what it is: all talk and no action. It is all smoke and mirrors. The government has shown again that it has no idea when it comes to nation building. It has no idea how to manage the big projects needed to secure Australia's future. I will give you some examples of how the Labor government budget fails not only the people of Flynn but the people of Australia. Firstly, the majority of workers in Central Queensland must drive long distances to and from work. Many work in mines and in the service industry and their homes are hundreds of kilometres from where they work. This budget will penalise these workers by slugging them for going into work. Under the 2011 Labor government budget, people who have no choice but to travel more than 40,000 kilometres per year will pay 20 per cent fringe benefits tax, up from the current seven per cent. On a $65,000 vehicle, a miner, a tradie or a salesman will shell out an additional $8,450 in tax. This is not just an attack on the mining industry; it hits the pockets of all kinds of workers who purchase a work vehicle through salary sacrifice and have to drive long distances in doing their work.


Secondly, the government must stand condemned for continually breaking election promises. It must stand condemned for building false hopes within the community only to let people down because it has no idea how to plan and manage projects within budget. I will give you some more examples of how the people of Flynn have been short-changed by the Gillard government and how they are being lied to by the Gillard government. These are just three examples. And you Labor guys over there had better put your fingers in your ears, because I know you do not want to hear this—that goes especially for the member for Capricornia, who has done her best on radio and in the papers to gloss over these issues without giving any idea at all when the real work will start.


Let us look at the Calliope Crossroads, the Yeppen bridge and the Gracemere upgrade—and then there is the Port Access Road. Promises made during the election campaign of 2007 and in 2010 have been pushed aside and replaced with a wide range of excuses. This is not good enough. There is an urgent need for the government to get back on track and stop hoodwinking the Australian public. The Calliope Crossroads presents a vital bit of infrastructure which enables Dawson Highway traffic to cross over the Bruce Highway at Calliope. It was promised, at a cost of $55 million, by both major parties in 2007. Labor failed to honour that promise during its   first term of government. It was promised again in 2010, but by this time Labor had driven the cost up to $155 million. In the 2011 budget, however, there is nothing—only a few pennies for planning. This intersection has been planned to within an inch of its life. Millions have been spent by Labor planning for something, but they have no idea at all when this project is going to start. There have been suggestions that the original $55 million to complete the project will only cover the planning and resumption of land. 


Likewise, another bridge for the Yeppen flood plain, with double lanes to Egans Hill and to Gracemere along the Capricorn Highway, is essential. The Gladstone Port Access Road is also an important project which so far has had no public consultation. We can all see the need for these projects, but nothing is being done to bring these plans to reality. In fact the government, in its latest budget, reveals that work will only start in 2014-15 and then only if the mining resource rent tax is approved. How many people will have to die on these roads before the government moves?


The reality is that the government cannot move on these issues because it is virtually bankrupt. It has transformed a strong surplus economy in 2007 into a basket case in just three years. In 2007, the coalition left the Australian people with billions of dollars in the bank. We are now borrowing in excess of $135 million a day and this budget seeks to increase our borrowings to $250 billion, up from $200 billion. We have wasted money on the failed pink batts program, the dodgy BER scheme and the countless other touchy-feely, feel-good projects. Labor has thrown money around like a drunken sailor, and I apologise to the drunken sailor for associating him with this government. The 2011 Labor government budget is an attack on middle Australians. It is an attack on working families. It is an attack on the hardworking men and women of Australia who work in our regional towns and cities.


Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to turn your attention to another very important issue affecting the people of Flynn. I refer to the proposal by the Labor government and the Greens to introduce a carbon tax into the Australian economic landscape. To pretend that a carbon tax will not cost several thousands of Queenslanders their jobs is in my opinion the height of gross stupidity or incompetence or both. Our forefathers and captains of industry have worked diligently over the last 200 years to establish a wide range of industries and development projects across Australia. We cannot let the Green-Independent-Labor government destroy our industrial base. My electorate is without doubt the carbon capital of Australia and it naturally follows that it will be that area of Australia that suffers most from the effect of a tax that will effectively make industry less competitive on the world market.


Like with everything else, this government skirts around the issues. They will not tell industry what price per tonne they will have to pay for this carbon. Is it going to be $26 per tonne or $45 per tonne? Maybe it is going to be $100 per tonne, as demanded by the Greens, or maybe it will be somewhere in between. Uncertainty destabilises our industries. The government has a responsibility to ensure that any change to the way businesses are taxed and regulated is carried out in a measured way over a long time frame. To pretend that this tax will improve world pollution and lower temperatures, when the government's own experts say any change in a thousand years will be minor, is dishonest. The reality is that this is a tax the government must have to help dig itself out of the fiscal hole it has created for the Australian people. Let us be honest about it. Tell the Australian people the truth. The government cannot manage money and we need the Australian public to yet again cop it on the chin.


The state of our health and community services in the electorate of Flynn is in urgent need of an overhaul. There is nothing in this budget to give the community any comfort at all. On 27 July 2010 Prime Minister Julia Gillard said, 'I want to be absolutely clear—mental health will be a second-term priority for this government.' The budget papers reveal that this is a tricky move by the Prime Minister. Most of the money will be delivered in five years time—the last year of the next term of the government. The budget shows that $500 million has been cut from regional programs. It is a snub to Central Queensland when $480 million of regional development funds has been allocated to the roads around Perth Airport.


In summary, this budget delivers nothing substantial to my electorate of Flynn. It eats into the incomes of hardworking families and will take jobs from Australia and place them overseas. The government is gambling with our country and our lives. There are no guarantees about the precarious world economy and yet this sham of a budget is based on the assumption that the economies of our trading partners will continue as they are today. Where will we be if these predicted downturns in China occur? What measures has the government taken to deal with another global economic disaster if it should happen? The government has left us no room to move. It has spent foolishly and has not provided for much needed infrastructure projects like the Bruce Highway and many other trouble spots around the area, especially our internal roads. I implore the government to get its priorities sorted out and concentrate on projects that will benefit Australians in the long term.

"Gibbons, Steve, MP",ALP,2011-05-30,"



Mr GIBBONS
 (Bendigo) (16:39):  During a time of global economic uncertainty when many Western countries are battling against low or negative economic growth and a large national debt, this budget is all about getting the settings right. It is about getting the settings right for a strong, secure and sustainable economy that will benefit all Australians in the years to come. As Craig James, chief economist at CommSec, has said:


Overall, it is a smart budget, and a budget right for the times and challenges ahead. 


There is much talk about our economy today being resourced based—indeed, our resources industries do make a huge contribution to our national output—but, as the Treasurer pointed out in his post-budget speech to the National Press Club, this is as much an oversimplification as thinking Australia was just an agricultural economy during the last century. We are not simply a resource economy and the time of our manufacturers has not passed. Indeed, our manufacturers have innovated and moved with the times and they will continue to do so. 


I take the opportunity today to talk about one innovating manufacturing sector in my electorate: defence manufacturing, its importance to the region's economy and jobs and how this sector has been responsible for making or breaking the aspirations of several political candidates and in some cases political careers. It is worth spending some time going through a brief history of defence manufacturing in Bendigo. Seventy years ago the Commonwealth government announced plans to build a Commonwealth ordnance factory in north Bendigo to manufacture and refurbish heavy gun barrels for the Australian Navy, produce munitions and a range of other heavy engineering tasks for the war effort. Between 1942 and 1981, the factory not only manufactured and refurbished defence equipment for Australia's requirements but also completed several large export contracts including some for the United States navy. At its peak of operations the factory employed well in excess of a thousand people. 


The announcement in 1981 by then Treasurer Phillip Lynch that the Fraser government would sell or close the Commonwealth Ordnance Factory with a loss of hundreds of jobs produced an angry reaction in the Bendigo community. A study of the impact of the proposed closure on Bendigo's economy was undertaken and an intensive lobbying campaign got underway. In fact, three Bendigo councillors got together and nominated as legislative assembly candidates in the 1982 Victorian election on a cross-party 'Save the Commonwealth Ordnance Factory' ticket. The idea was that those electors who would normally vote Liberal but wanted to register a protest about the factory sale or closure could vote for Councillor Joe Pearce and direct their second preference to the Liberals, Labor voters could vote for Councillor Dick Turner and direct preferences to Labor and those supporting other parties could vote for Councillor Chris Stoltz and then preference one of the minor parties or candidates. In the event, sitting Liberal member Darrell McClure was dumped and Labor's official candidate, David Kennedy, who campaigned extensively on the Commonwealth Ordnance Factory issue, was elected.


The proposed closure claimed another political victim in the following year's federal election when sitting Liberal member and then Chief Government Whip John Bouchier was defeated by Labor's John Brumby. The future of the Commonwealth Ordnance Factory was once more a major issue in the local campaign.


In the late 1980s the Commonwealth government restructured several government owned defence manufacturers, including the Commonwealth Ordnance Factory and the Commonwealth Clothing Factory which had been manufacturing defence uniforms and combat clothing since 1912. In 1989, then Minister for Defence Kim Beazley announced that a new government owned entity, Australian Defence Industries or ADI, would bring these organisations together to create Australia's largest defence manufacturer.


Another reorganisation in 1992 saw ADI consolidate its defence clothing manufacturing operations in one location at McGoldrick Court in Bendigo. Three years later, this was established as a separate business and subsequently sold to the private sector and became Australian Defence Apparel. This company has a track record of innovation in the manufacture of combat clothing and associated equipment. It continues to operate today, producing high-value personal body armour as well as a range of military and combat uniforms, and currently employs about 300 people. 


The future of the remaining ADI operations was again an issue in the run-up to the 1996 federal election. The then Leader of the Opposition, John Howard, visited Bendigo and promised not to privatise ADI. He told a press conference, including the Bendigo Advertiser, on 14 February 1996, 'No, no and no; we have no plans to privatise ADI.' The coalition won the election and John Howard became Prime Minister on 2 March 1996. Bruce Reid, who had defeated Labor's John Brumby in the 1990 election, was re-elected as the federal member for Bendigo with an expectation that the government would keep its promise not to privatise ADI. In early 1997, the government selected ADI's Bushmaster protected mobility vehicle as a preferred option over the ASVS Taipan alternative. Then in February Liberal Minister for Defence, Ian McLachlan, announced the government's decision to fully privatise ADI, despite John Howard's campaign promise to Bendigo not to do so. The Howard government was re-elected in 1998, but I successfully defeated the new Liberal candidate for Bendigo, Max Turner—Bruce Reid having announced his decision to retire—with the ADI privatisations betrayal and the future of the Bushmaster contract among the main local issues. John Moore replaced Ian McLachlan as defence minister in 1998 and the following year the Howard government sold ADI to a fifty-fifty partnership comprising Transfield Australia and French company Thompsons-CSF, which is now Thales. 


In 1999, the first production contract for 370 Bushmasters was signed with ADI and the first Bushmasters to be used on operations, the two original prototype test vehicles affectionately known as B1 and B2, were deployed to East Timor. After Peter Reith replaced John Moore as defence minister in 2001, he received a recommendation from the Defence Materiel Organisation that the Bushmaster production contract should be cancelled. Sections of the defence department and senior military personnel had expressed strong doubts regarding the Bushmaster's suitability for the ADF. This ensured that the suitability of the Bushmaster and ADI would again be a major issue in the 2001 federal election campaign. The Howard government was re-elected, but I was successful in retaining Bendigo for Labor.


In March 2002, I led a deputation to new defence minister, Senator Robert Hill, to argue the case for retaining the Bushmaster contract for ADI. Four months later, Senator Hill, to his great credit, announced that the government would honour a revised Bushmaster contract with ADI, although the number of vehicles would be reduced from 370 to 299. The first production Bushmasters rolled off the assembly line at ADI Bendigo in 2003 and in 2006 Thales Australia acquired 100 per cent ownership of ADI and assumed full control of its operations. The company restructured and Thales specialist vehicles were created at the Bendigo factory. By this time, more Bushmasters had been deployed in East Timor, Iraq and Afghanistan, where again and again they demonstrated their superiority in saving the lives of Australian defence soldiers.


After succeeding Senator Hill as defence minister, Dr Brendan Nelson increased the contract with ADI for Bushmaster PMVs to a total of about 730 vehicles. This was about the time that the Australian Defence Force Land 121 Phase 3 vehicle acquisition program released specifications for several light, medium and heavy trucks including a number of armour protected vehicles. Twenty vehicles were initially assessed with a view to short listing the light to medium category down to three, but despite the Bushmaster's proven combat performance, a utility variant, then called the Copperhead, was not even included in the initial assessment process. Again, some senior defence personnel had expressed doubts on this vehicle's suitability.


Meanwhile, having seen the success of Bushmasters in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Netherlands Defence Force placed an initial order for 25 Bushmasters, which was subsequently increased to a total of 86 vehicles. This important export order was won despite a conspicuous lack of support from the Howard government for Thales' efforts to sell their world-beating products overseas. 


In the 2007 federal election, potential export markets for Thales protected mobility vehicles was a major issue in the Bendigo campaign. I retained the seat for Labor and the member for Hunter was sworn in as the new defence minister in the Rudd government. This was followed by further export success for the Bushmaster when the British defence force took delivery of 24 vehicles. 


In 2008 the new Labor government overhauled the troubled Land 121 Phase 3 program resulting in the Bushmaster single-cab utility vehicle finally being considered in a new round of initial assessments. Subsequently the Defence Materiel Organisation short-listed the Bushmaster utility, along with vehicles from Mercedes-Benz and MAN. We are still waiting for a final purchase recommendation, which has been expected from the DMO since last December. 


The ADF also needs to replace a significant part of its ageing Land Rover fleet and its Land 121 Phase 4 program will provide around 1,300 light protected mobility vehicles for this purpose. Defence minister Fitzgibbon announced in 2008 that Australia would commit about $40 million to participate in the US joint light tactical vehicle development program, with a view to buying a US vehicle to meet the ADF's light protected mobility vehicle requirements. The minister's statement also signalled an opportunity for Australia's defence manufacturing sector to compete in the light protected mobility vehicle program, and Thales developed the Hawkei prototype for this category. However, during private briefings on Land 121 Phase 4 from senior DMO personnel in 2009, I was told that they did not believe Thales were capable of producing a light protected mobility vehicle. Senator John Faulkner replaced the member for Hunter as Minister for Defence later that year and a separate Minister for Defence Materiel, the member for Charlton, was appointed. 


In May last year Mr Combet announced funding for three Australian manufactured light protected mobility vehicles to compete against the US JLTV. Thales, Force Protection and General Dynamics each received funding of up to $9 million to develop prototypes. Thales's Hawkei is the only Australian designed and manufactured vehicle involved. We have also learned from the US documents made public by WikiLeaks last year that US diplomats have been pressuring Australian officials to abandon our defence manufacturing sector and purchase products exclusively from the United States. 


In the narrow re-election of the Gillard government in 2010, I was returned as the member for Bendigo, the member for Perth replaced Senator Faulkner as the Minister for Defence and the member for Blaxland became Minister for Defence Materiel. In February this year Thales delivered two Hawkei prototypes for an intensive test and appraisal process to select an Australian light protected mobility vehicle to compete with the successful US JLTV vehicle. A decision on this is anticipated within two years. 


The people of Bendigo continue to support the city's defence industries. In April, about 300 people attended a rally to demonstrate that support. Since then, the defence minister has announced an order for another 101 Bushmaster PMVs for the Australian Army. Today, Thales is part of Bendigo's progressive and innovative defence industry—one that also includes protective clothing manufacturer Australian Defence Apparel and the Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organisation. Bendigo's defence industries employ more than 800 people and the jobs supported by the ADA and Thales operations alone represent approximately 18 per cent of Bendigo's total employment in manufacturing. It is one of the key sectors of Bendigo's economy. The annual direct output generated by the defence industry in Bendigo is estimated at more than $490 million and, including the flow-on effects to other sectors, the industry's total contribution to the local economy is estimated to be around $760 million a year. 


I have tried to demonstrate today that Australia has a world-class, innovative manufacturing capability in protected mobility vehicles and armoured protective clothing. I believe it is in our national interest that this should be retained and supported—and this is a regionally-based industry that contributes significantly to the economy of central Victoria. As I have also shown, we do not always make it easy for our domestic manufacturers to deliver the world-class products they are capable of producing. The saga I have recounted of Thales and its Bushmaster vehicle program is one of delay, prevarication and uncertainty, and it has claimed more than one political scalp along the way. If we are serious about encouraging our manufacturers in this country, we must walk the walk and not just talk the talk. We must do better. Government can do much to support local manufacturing through its various acquisition programs without making compromises on the quality of its purchases. This year's budget includes several measures that continue this government's support for local industries to innovate and compete in world markets. I commend the budget to the House.

"Billson, Bruce, MP",LP,2011-05-30,"



Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (16:54):  The budget Appropriation Bill (No.1) 2011-2012 and related bills were largely built on a speech full of misrepresentations, make-believe and an incredible dose of optimism when the Treasurer introduced them on budget night. Labor proclaims this budget for what it might do not in this financial year, and not in the next financial year, but in the year after that—that is the key selling point of this budget. We seem to have moved into a bit of a time warp where we have chosen to ignore the budgets and the fiscal position in the intervening period and are not talking about this financial year or the next but the one after. There is a suggestion that at that time Labor will deliver something it probably would not know if it saw it, and that is a budget surplus.


I say make-believe is at the heart of this budget because, when you look at the assumptions that underpin it, we need to take into account a number of things. The Gillard government is counting on record high terms of trade staying that way and at worst being diminished by four per cent, a fairly minor adjustment, but apparently the Gillard government believes these incredible terms of trade, probably the best in 150 years, will not change by more than four per cent.


Secondly, it then talks about some Herculean projections in revenue. If you look at the GST figures, for instance, there is an enormous growth in the revenue that that is supposed to bring in. There are also some assumptions embedded in it about what the mining tax will bring to this budget even though the mining tax has not been finalised and many commentators are suggesting the concessions or negotiations that Prime Minister Gillard engaged in will see the biggest three mining companies likely to be paying less tax than they are now because of changes in the way assets will be valued and offsets in terms of state-based royalty changes.


There is also something that cannot speak its name in this budget, and that is the carbon tax, one of the most substantial impacts on the Australian economy and on the Australian community, a new tax that comes in at exactly the same time as the mining tax. Albeit not well argued and not well analysed in the budget, the mining tax is at least there. But the carbon tax is not. Then you go behind those figures even further and you realise the slender surplus that the Gillard Labor government believes it will produce not this year, not next year but the year after—a slender surplus that is less than most of the adjustments in the budgets over recent years, but apparently we are supposed to believe that in these out years those assumptions will be right—is built on bracket creep. There are no tax cuts to adjust the threshold rates at which income tax is paid. So you will see Australians who are fortunate enough to gain an increase in their income increasingly moving into higher tax brackets. There are not even tax cuts in this budget that maintain people's tax liability; as their income goes up they are going to sneak into higher brackets and pay higher income tax because of it. But on the flipside, in terms of family allowances and the like, you see a number of those benefits also now getting into this budget benefit through bracket creep category where, as their incomes move and those thresholds stay frozen, people will increasingly move out of those areas of eligibility. So it is a piece of fiction. This budget would be in the fiction section of most public libraries but, alas, we are here to discuss it.


But there is one moment of disclosure and that is the disclosure, I think in Budget Paper No 2, where there is finally an admission that the debt ceiling that the government has had to operate under will need to be increased. You might recall that when Labor was elected the debt ceiling captured by the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act, if I recall correctly, was around $75 billion. It was pushed out to some $200 billion as part of the government's response to the global financial crisis. It was pushed out there with an assumption that the government would need to account for its actions to move out to that higher figure to prove that there were some special considerations that justified that increase. Now not only are we faced with a request to push that $200 billion debt cap out to a quarter of a trillion dollars, $250 billion, but now the government wants to have no requirement on it to explain and to justify its actions to increase the debt to $250 billion. 


Why this is important is that, long after the electorate is able to cast its judgment on the Gillard Labor government and whatever that judgment may be, some of the legacies of its actions will still be with us in terms of the debt that we will all need to pay—not only service but hopefully repay at a subsequent date when the coalition is elected down the track, but we will all be paying for it. It is perfectly reasonable that, if the Gillard government wants to max out the Visa card limit of the Commonwealth, it should account for its actions. That is why the coalition's amendments are very worthy of support. We have said that we are not declining to give the bill a second reading but the government deserves to be condemned for incorporating in the bill this plan to push its government borrowing limits above $200 billion, and that we should recognise that a special case must be made for such a significant increase in borrowings and that the government must explain any special circumstances that it feels justify taking our debt above $200 billion. The parliament needs to be given the opportunity to hear the government's case. If the government is so convinced there is a need to blow out Commonwealth debt above $200 billion then the requirement to justify that action is perfectly reasonable. There may well be a good reason, but where is the accountability and transparency in this Australian parliament where the Labor government thinks it can simply run over the top of a $200 billion debt limit feeling no need to justify its actions to the Australian public?


The debt binge that the government is on is just one of a number of challenges that my community, my electorate, and also the constituency that I represent as the shadow small business minister are facing. It is little wonder that small businesses are struggling to get access to finance, when there is a gorilla in the room devouring financial resources at such a huge rate, as evidenced by the blow-out in the government debt for this year, next year and, I would dare suggest, for many years to come. But that is just one of a number of challenges the small business community faces that the government has not faced up to in this budget. The government has failed to address any of the major and compelling concerns and challenges faced by the engine room of our economy. In fact it seems almost an environmental initiative that the government is trying to take a couple of cylinders out of the engine room of our economy as some kind of response to climate change. 


It is quite bizarre. The key challenges that the small business community face do not even crack it for a mention in this budget. Instead, there are a number of tricks where the government is suggesting it is doing good things by the small business and family enterprises of Australia but where they are actually being serviced by harmful measures that the government is not that keen to talk about. Earlier speakers have talked about the impact of FBT changes and what they would mean for a small business that might provide a delivery van or a work vehicle for their employees. There is also the issue of the instant write-off. The government seems to proclaim that as a great win for small businesses, that somehow there will be a cash flow benefit. But they have failed to mention that to get the benefit, in the example cited by the Treasurer, for an end-of-year tax benefit—not this financial year but next, probably payable in October 2013 or somewhere in that order—of $1,275 you need to spend $34,000. In terms of cash flow analysis, that is a hell of a lot of lolly—$34,000 to get $1,275 back. But it is the only good thing that the government thinks it can cite in this budget.


You dig a little bit deeper and you wonder: how is this being financed? The courage of the Gillard Labor government is to take on 400,000 of our smallest businesses. By scrapping the entrepreneurs tax offset, they are ripping out of 400,000 of Australia's smallest businesses and self-employed an incentive to provide for their own wellbeing and to provide opportunities for others. This measure was introduced by the Howard government to give support and encouragement to those people prepared to invest in their potential to support their own livelihood, to nurture a business, to grow opportunities in this country. If you think that is a terrible thing to do, it was quite remarkable last week when Canberra based Labor MP, Andrew Leigh, had a spray at those who were actually benefiting from the entrepreneurs tax offset. Rather than face up to the over 400,000 small and microbusinesses scattered right across Australia, who see this modest incentive as some encouragement to provide for their own requirements and to provide their own employment and economic opportunities, Mr Leigh had a spray at them, suggesting that people are deliberately organising themselves and rejecting 'market opportunities which might be present' solely to claim the ETO benefit he describes as 'a fairly low level of assistance'. So what is he saying? Is he saying that for a 25 per cent discount on taxable income people would turn their back on an opportunity to grow their business? He went on to decry the fact that the average payment being made was less than $500 and that 70 per cent of those claiming it were getting less than $600 back. Looking at the standard tax table and allowing for a tax-free threshold, the average person claiming the entrepreneurs tax offset—which, according to Labor's own figures, is around $500 in benefit—is earning about $420 a week. These people are earning less than $22,000 a year as entrepreneurs in their own right through self-employment, and this Labor government wants to take a modest incentive off them to somehow fund a dodgy cash benefit where you spend $34,000 to get $1,275 back. 


What is this about? The people being criticised by the Labor Party are earning under $22,000 a year and they get a modest benefit for that. Mr Leigh goes on to say that 70 per cent of the claims are for less than $600. According to the standard tax table and allowing for the tax-free threshold, do you know how much they are earning? It is $466 a week. Their grand income is under $25,000 a year, and they are getting slugged with extra tax by this Labor government, which claims to have some passing interest in small business. Well, it does not. Labor has never understood small business and never bothered to understand the challenges that the small business community face. It was bad enough when Kevin Rudd was Prime Minister, but at least there was apathy. Now it is downright adversarial.


What the small business community needs is an advocate and an ally. Since the election of the Labor government, 300,000 jobs have been lost in the small business community and 25,000 small businesses no longer exist. When the government boasts about the jobs it is creating, it is not boasting about jobs being created in small business and family enterprises. These are the economies of outer metropolitan and rural communities that do not have the luxury of a CBD or a mine. This is what drives the livelihoods and opportunities across Australia and they are being done over, day in and day out, by this government.


But it gets worse. The Prime Minister has the gall to go out there saying that you must value the working capability of every Australian. Well, apparently not. Apparently you only value people who receive a pay cheque. Why would you go after them with this enterprise tax offset? Why would you wipe that out? It is because they are self-employed. They are not receiving a pay cheque; they are trying to earn their own and perhaps create pay cheques for others.


But it gets worse. The opposition and those two million people who derive their livelihoods from self-employment were very concerned about secret meetings between the union movement and the Gillard Labor government, the ones that were denied and then admitted to. Nick Sherry had a very awkward time in the Senate explaining these meetings that everyone else seemed to know about but he said did not happen. This coordinated, multipronged assault on legitimate contracting and self-employed arrangements had another weapon added to it out of this budget. This is now a new weapon. It was not enough to send out the Fair Work Ombudsman to get stuck into self-employed independent contractors. It was not enough to send the tax office out after these people with no evidence that there was a need to have such a jihad against them as has been unleashed by this Gillard government. It was not enough to send the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner out after them. That was not enough. Do you know what is out there now? Under this budget, the Labor government wants those people who are engaging contractors to now be involved in this web of making sure nobody is self-employed and that everyone is forced into a traditional employee-employer relationship where the union movement has what it believes is a controlling stake and a controlling interest.


When is enough enough? When are you going to let independent contractors and self-employed people actually have a fair go? Every day there is a new attack on them. Why? It is because they do not fit in this neat little unionist view that everyone receives a pay cheque. These people are earning their incomes through hard work. They do not have the comfort of being able to turn to an employer and say, 'Hey, things are a bit tough, but that is okay; you can cover me for a few more weeks until things pick up.' These people do not become unemployed; they just do not have enough work. As the government talk around participation in our economy, do they not realise that self-employment is a legitimate way for people either returning to the workforce after periods out or maybe contemplating retirement trying to juggle their working arrangements? Being an independent contractor and self-employed is as legitimate as any other way of earning a livelihood in this country, but you would not know it.


Assistant Treasurer Bill Shorten came out with another press release today somehow suggesting, 'It will not be a problem for any honest contractors; we will just throw a bit more red tape and compliance obligations at them.' You stalk people and harass them out of a legitimate career and employment trajectory, and those people who dare engage contractors because it supports their entire workforce— (Time expired)

"Parke, Melissa, MP",ALP,2011-05-30,"



Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (17:08):  I welcome the Gillard government's disciplined and responsible 2011-12 budget, and I congratulate the Treasurer and his department and staff. This budget delivers the fiscal settings and savings that will keep a lid on inflation and return Australia to surplus in 2012-13 while delivering an historic and comprehensive mental healthcare program and investing further in jobs training and in renewable energy.


That combination of fiscal prudence, hard-won savings and forward-looking investments is, in a nutshell, the hallmark of our government, which has delivered the following significant achievements. It has put in place a response to the global financial crisis that has seen Australia outperform other developed countries. It has reduced unemployment and maintained low inflation growth against the background of the worst crisis since the Great Depression and following a summer of unprecedented natural disasters. It has made the largest investment in schools and the largest single lift in payments to pensioners. It continues on the path to increasing our foreign aid commitment to 0.5 per cent of GNI by 2015-16.


This budget makes a historic $2.2 billion investment in mental health services. This government has been prepared to make very difficult decisions, such as introducing a carbon price to the economy and adopting world-first plain packaging for cigarettes, often at some political cost, so that Australia benefits now and in the long term.


The budget includes $22 billion in savings by achieving efficiencies in the delivery of government services and by continuing Labor's program of identifying unnecessary and unproductive churn in our tax and payment assistance framework in order to ensure that government payments and concessions are made only when they are for genuine assistance. That is the responsible thing to do and it is the only way to ensure fairness in the system. By creating savings we will not only improve the bottom line but also make possible key investments in critical policy areas and better support for those who need it most.


Despite the strength of the resources sector in WA, there are many people in the Fremantle electorate who are not benefiting from the boom and who, instead, are facing rising costs in the form of state government electricity charges and the rent impact of a severe housing shortage. This is especially true for those on low and fixed incomes. In recognising the patchwork nature of the economy, and also by bringing forward the low-income tax offset, this budget provides $772 million of increased family tax benefits to support parents with dependent teenagers aged 16 to 19 in full-time study.


In addition to the record pension payment increases, made since 2009, which have seen the maximum pension rate increase by $128 per fortnight for singles and by $116 for couples, this budget now expands the work bonus for pensioners, which will come into operation from 1 July. This change follows the same philosophy that drives the government's efforts to support and encourage greater work participation across the board. Those words 'support' and 'encourage' are important, because the approach of this government is to ensure that (1) the system provides incentives for people to move from welfare to work and (2) the education and training and job support framework can enable that transition.


This budget does both of those things. As I have just mentioned, the pensioner work bonus changes mean that older Australians can now work more before suffering a reduction in their pension payments. The government will also be providing $95 million in wage assistance to reward employees who provide work to persons, including older workers over the age of 50, defined as 'long-term unemployed'. In terms of supporting work readiness, the budget introduces the Building Australia's Future Workforce package, whose initiatives include $558 million to deliver around 130,000 appropriately tailored training places; $200 million in assistance to apprentices; and $1.75 billion in partnership with the states and territories for necessary reform of the vocational education and training system. This investment is a distinctly Labor project and it will be particularly welcome in my electorate, which includes areas that have higher than average youth unemployment and therefore presents a clear need to equip young Australians with the skills and qualities that allow them to take advantage of jobs that the Western Australian economy is generating.


Of course, the Building Australia's Future Workforce package follows from earlier steps taken by the government in this area, such as the funding of the Trade Training Centres in Schools. In March this year the community cabinet came to Fremantle. It was hosted at South Fremantle Senior High School, which will be the site of a new $4.3 million maritime trades training centre. Just two weeks ago I accompanied the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, Peter Garrett, on a site visit to the new training centre. These are the kinds of substantial training and education ventures that will be the foundation of jobs and productive lives for the next generation of Western Australians.


From a Fremantle perspective this budget addresses a number of issues that have been prominent in my community, and I want to touch on some of those. Mental health reform is the best example of this government's steady progress in tackling overdue and big picture reform. Indeed, there were few larger issues in 2010 than the need for a dramatic shift in the way that mental health care is provided and funded in Australia. It is an issue that I have been engaged in for a long time, not least because acute mental health care is provided through the Alma Street Clinic of Fremantle Hospital and so there is a focus in the Fremantle area on people receiving that care. For too long, mental health care has been the poor cousin within the health services framework and for too long mental health has been poorly understood and inaccurately perceived by the general community. Change has been occurring and I want to acknowledge the courage of ordinary Australians and of prominent people who have come forward and been open about their own mental health challenges, including in this place the member for Goldstein. When people realise that depression or anxiety is an illness and when people realise that it comes out of nowhere to affect footballers, bricklayers, lawyers, musicians, teenagers and politicians and when people realise that it can be treated and that it does not have to be a barrier to participation in life or a barrier to performance at a high level then we will have achieved a cultural shift that allows us to approach this area of health openly and without stigma. 


On the night of the Candidates Forum that was held in Fremantle during the 2010 campaign, a candlelight vigil was held to demonstrate the strong desire in the community to see a new and effective commitment to mental health care in Australia. It is no surprise then that the government's historic $2.2 billion mental healthcare package has been well received. I have had a number of emails in the last three weeks welcoming the introduction of short- and long-term measures, including the $433 million for suicide prevention, the $492 million for early intervention when it comes to children and young people who experience or who are at risk of mental illness and the $200 million to support mental health programs for those who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. 


I recently accompanied the Minister for Social Housing and Homelessness, Senator Arbib, to St Pat's crisis care centre in Fremantle, where this funding was warmly welcomed. Those who work day in, day out with the homeless, like my friends at St Pat's, are only too aware that mental illness is both a cause and a consequence of homelessness. When the first annual Gimme Shelter concert in Fremantle was being planned five years ago, it was a clear objective of the concert to raise funds and awareness not only for homelessness but also for mental illness. It is fantastic that the federal government has also recognised this link in the budget and provided serious money towards assisting the many Australians struggling with the dual difficulties of homelessness and mental illness. 


To drive the long-term reform in this area, the budget provides new funding of $12 million to a total commitment of $32 million over five years for the creation of an independent National Mental Health Commission, which will provide accountability and transparency as well as contributing analysis and direction in the development of the Ten Year Roadmap for ongoing mental health reform. The commitment to increase the national network of headspace centres to 90 has been particularly welcome. Fremantle was fortunate to have one of the first such centres established and it has proved its worth from the moment it became operational. 


At a time when the cohort of senior Australians as a proportion of the population as a whole is set to increase markedly, I am a big supporter of initiatives that give effective support and resources to assist elderly people who wish to continue to live independently. As I have said before, wherever this is possible I think this is actually the natural preference of most people and most families and it is also a scenario in which the load on the residential aged care system can be reduced. For those reasons I am delighted that this budget brings with it new increases to Home and Community Care, or HACC, program funding. The latest allocation of $9 million in funding to WA brings the total 2010-11 WA funding to more than $212 million, underwriting services that benefit 66,000 Western Australians or nearly three per cent of the population. Eight providers in the Fremantle electorate are among more than 270 organisations that deliver HACC services. In addition to the extra $396,000 in recurrent funding, four Fremantle providers will also receive one-off funding for new capital including Neighbourhood Link in East Fremantle, which will receive nearly $140,000 for a new bus; Melville CARES, which will receive $40,000 for IT equipment; and, the Villa Dalmacia Social Centre, which will receive $15,000 for vehicle modifications. In each of these cases and through the boost to recurrent funding, this Labor government is making an investment in the wellbeing of elderly Australians and in the peace of mind of their families, while at the same time alleviating the pressure on residential aged care. 


That effort to help those who want to live at home has a parallel in the budget with the $72 million Healthy Communities Initiative, which supports local governments who run programs that encourage healthier lifestyles and therefore deliver important preventive health outcomes. Once again, this is funding that provides direct benefits to individuals but also reduces the likely future impact of illness and disease that result from unhealthy diet and lifestyle choices. In my electorate, the City of Cockburn was one of four local governments in Western Australia and the only one in the metropolitan area selected under this program. It will receive $700,000 for its Co-Health Lifestyle Project, which is aimed at those not working full time and at risk of poor health outcomes. It also includes some targeted nutritional education for Indigenous and Torres Strait Islander Australians. The Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, made this welcome announcement at the Cockburn seniors club in my electorate two weeks ago. As noted by the Mayor of Cockburn, Logan Howlett, at the event, the Healthy Communities initiative also complements extremely well the existing projects encouraging healthy lifestyles that are underway in the city of Cockburn and to which the federal government has provided generous assistance, including the Coogee Beach Surf Life Saving Club, the GP superclinic and the Bibra Lake wetlands education centre precinct.


In terms of big picture infrastructure, I am very pleased that the budget provides further support for rail freight into the port of Fremantle. As part of the government's $350 million contribution to the Perth urban transport and freight corridor upgrade project, we are providing funding to the development of the Kewdale Intermodal Rail Supply Chain, and that includes a $27 million contribution to a rail-passing loop near Fremantle port and works comprising stage 2 of the North Quay rail terminal. The project will provide intermodal freight services for the receipt of interstate and intrastate containerised and bulk freight and international and interstate containerised sea freight.


That is the direction we need to go in. By increasing rail and coastal sea freight, and by supporting better freight coordination through the Kewdale intermodal facility, we will see a road freight impact reduction by volume of total freight. More trucks and more and bigger roads for those trucks cannot be the answer to our freight challenge. I am glad that this government is keen to work in partnership with the WA government when it comes to new rail infrastructure and to better roads and freight management yet, quite sensibly, continues to have absolutely no interest in funding the outdated folly that is Roe Highway stage 8.


In conclusion, this budget is a no-nonsense, practically oriented and rigorous blueprint for economic stability, responsible savings and necessary investment in the things that matter for Australia's future—namely, education and training, health service capacity, economic infrastructure and renewable energy. It is marked as a Labor budget by its fairness; its social responsibility, when it comes to protecting and assisting vulnerable people in our community; and its willingness to undertake difficult reform, including reform to Australia's tax and payment assistance framework.

"Christensen, George, MP",Nats,2011-05-30,"



Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson) (17:21):  I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No.1) 2011-2012 and cognate bills and to condemn the lost opportunities that this budget represents. This is indeed a budget that has a bark that is worse than its bite. Madam Deputy Speaker, two weeks ago, you might remember, the hounds were out howling at the moon before this budget was delivered, howling about how tough things had to be and howling about how tough measures would be taken to bring the budget back into surplus. But what was the result come budget night? An utter disappointment and a disgraceful waste of opportunity.


This budget does not cut back on spending. On the contrary, the budget actually increases spending, ramping up government expenses from $351 billion to $368 billion. That is no way to go about returning a budget to surplus. If that is the government's plan, then it is a dog of a plan. That is not surprising as it comes from a dog of a government delivering a dog of a budget. It beggars belief that a government purporting to have the ability to bring a budget back to surplus would start by increasing spending. You do not have to have a high-school education to recognise the fundamental flaw in that plan, and Labor wonders why the public thinks it has no economic credentials.


If this government thinks spending more money is a tough budget that can deliver a surplus, then it is not smarter than a fifth grader. But increased expenditure alone is not why this is a dog of a budget. The real issue that Australian families find unpalatable is the reckless waste they are witnessing from the current government. Far from tightening its belt, this government has employed an additional 24,000 public servants since it took power in 2007. That is a bitter pill to swallow for people in my electorate of Dawson, many of them living in regional towns with an entire population less than that.


We now have 1,027 public servants in the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency alone. This is a department that has proved to be a total failure. It has failed its first priority for 2010-11, which is spelt out in its corporate plan. It is, 'Delivery of the government's election commitments.' That is not just a fail; that is a fail of epic proportions. The government's pre-election commitment was that there would be no carbon tax. The Prime Minister said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' That was her election commitment, and yet we have 1,027 public servants there in the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency beavering away to achieve the polar opposite of that election commitment, trying to sell a lie to the Australian public. It is now time for the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency to amend his department's corporate plan so that he can at least say that 1,027 public servants paid by the Australian taxpayer are achieving the election commitments of the one Greens MP in the House of Representatives.


It is the same Australian public money that is going to pay for the scandalous excesses of this government, like exorbitantly priced set-top boxes for pensioners, valued at $400 each. Even the pensioners recognise what a contemptible waste of money that program represents. Those who have already purchased a set-top box for themselves tell me that they would just like to be reimbursed the $50 that it actually cost them. I have listened with interest to various members of the government, particularly the member for Kingston, yelping that the coalition members keep talking about these set-top boxes. I say: get used to it, because that is what the general public is talking about.


How can this government look the public in the eye and say to them, 'We're paying $400 of your money for something that is worth $50'? How can this government look the public in the eye and tell them, 'We're increasing our offshore asylum seekers spend by an extra $1.7 billion of your money so that we can swap one of our illegal immigrants for five of Malaysia's'? These are not the actions of a government capable of a budget surplus. These are the actions of a government with an atrocious record of debt and deficit. Australian families who are struggling to meet spiralling cost-of-living expenses cannot even comprehend the sheer magnitude of the debt that this government is racking up. How can the average family comprehend interest payments of $135 million every day? The average family cannot even comprehend just how much money that is, let alone the thought of borrowing that much on a daily basis to service debt incurred by a government addicted to spending—$135 million a day, and every single taxpayer will have to pay that debt back.


It is also interesting to hear the government speakers yelping about how the coalition have not produced a detailed budget on how we would do things. The answer to that probably should be a bit obvious: fixing the Labor-Greens debacle is a moving feast because the mess gets bigger each day, $135 million a day bigger, and that is if they stop making bad decisions today. But debt and deficit are to be expected from this lot in the long run. This dog of a government is a mongrel breed with a big Labor streak, a Labor streak that has no form on the board for economic competency, just a track record of reckless spending and reckless taxing. And added to this mix now are the Greens, whose barren economic understanding is limited to the cost of a pair of sandals and whose economic answer to alarmist bleatings about climate change is to close down all the coalmines in Australia.


This government is a pack of strays with no legitimacy, no direction and no leadership, an illegitimate government that has sold its soul and the soul of the Australian taxpayer in a desperate grab for power. The price the Australian people have to pay for the grubby deals that are so far apparent is blatant pork-barrelling in the extreme to woo the Independents, reckless pokies legislation that will destroy clubs and the communities that depend on them and, of course, the biggest tax with no mandate to ever be thrust on Australian families. This is a sign of a weak government, a dog of a government with not one but many different leaders, these multiple leaders all leading the pack astray, all pulling in different directions and pushing the government from one extreme to the other.


One of this government's leaders, Senator Bob Brown, is leading the pack off to investigate this rotting carcass of a carbon tax that no-one wants to touch, but now it is one in, all in. They are all feeding on that same rotting carcass because that is the only way they can stay in office. And the country is forced to follow, even though everyone knows it is a rotting carcass. Industry can smell that it is rotten, business can smell that it is rotten, and families can smell that it is rotten. Even the government recognises how rotten it is, by not including the carbon tax in its budget. The majority of this pack is too embarrassed for the public to see where it is going to be led. The mining tax legislation has not been introduced into parliament, yet it is in this budget. How can this government pretend the carbon tax is not part of the nation's economy in the next four years when it will have far-reaching, damaging consequences for every single person, every single family and every single business in this nation?


This dog of a government is embarrassed because it knows it has no mandate to introduce a carbon tax. On the contrary, as I said, the Prime Minister has a mandate for there to be no carbon tax under the government she leads. Even the taxpayer funded Climate Commission cannot sell this tax to families, who will have to pay for it, because those families are not stupid. They understand the Climate Commission is just a taxpayer funded advertising scheme for a bad tax. They understand that the commission was never going to provide advice or a report that did not support the government's carbon tax decision that has already been made, that was made in a backroom deal to get the Greens on board to form government. 


We have been given thousands of doomsday predictions and not one of them has come to pass. Even a couple of weeks ago the world was supposed to end. The world did not end, and we did not have aeroplanes dropping out of the sky or nuclear weapons launching themselves with the Y2K bug. The world did not end in an ice age as they predicted back in the 1970s. Forty years ago science, as reported in Time magazine in June 1974, was of the opinion that global cooling that had been experienced for more than three decades was a sign of an impending ice age. 


We do not need scientists to tell us that the climate is changing. The climate is always changing and always has changed. But that is not to say we should not cut pollution or develop alternative energy. And everyday families know that the best way to cut pollution is to do something about it. They know that investing in new technology will cut pollution. They know that taxing every man, woman and child in Australia is not the way to cool the planet. Families in my electorate of Dawson know that if Climate Commissioner Tim Flannery's wild predictions of people having to row a boat down the main street of Mackay to get to work were true—that is what he said—then getting slugged an extra $300 on their electricity bill would not make one scrap of difference. 


The Greens, who have a single member in the House of Representatives, seem to be the majority shareholder of the leadership of this government through Senator Bob Brown. The extent to which the Greens are willing to hold this government to ransom is a frightening proposition for the Australian economy and the families who depend on it. Not happy with the mining tax to bleed our biggest industry dry, the Greens have insisted on this carbon tax, so bad that the Labor streak in this government are too embarrassed to show it in public and put it in their budget. But, as if that is not enough to kill the golden goose, they have insisted on including in this budget an amendment to the fringe benefits tax that will see hardworking miners pay $8,000 a year for the privilege of going to work. Under these changes, someone who works in the mining industry and who leases a $65,000 vehicle for the long drives to and from work, racking up more than 40,000 kilometres a year, will be taxed at 20 per cent instead of seven per cent FBT. That means the FBT payable for that vehicle, which is used to get them to and from work and around the work site, will increase from $4,550 to $13,000. But it will not just apply to mineworkers and the industries servicing the mines; it will also apply to regional farmers and even sales representatives forced to travel enormous distances just to provide for their families. It would appear this government has some kind of visceral hatred for people who are working hard and having a go, especially if they live in rural Australia and even more especially if they have the misfortune to work in the mining industry that is propping this country up. 


The extremist Greens, and the Labor government that panders to their extremist views, will continue to kill off industry, to kill off opportunity and to kill off the hopes and dreams of families until the Australian people have the opportunity to stop them. They will continue to rip the heart out of our way of life and our future in the interests of a few—the few scruffy tails wagging this dog of a government. While this budget delivers further blows to the cost-of-living pressures on everyday families, it makes a deceitful attempt to look like it gives more than it takes. 


Last year prior to the election we identified the need for urgent action on mental health in Mackay. The Mackay region has an unacceptably high rate of youth suicide. There is a very good solution to this problem. It is called headspace. Headspace mental health centres have proved to be successful in terms of curbing youth suicide. The coalition made an election commitment to the people of Mackay that we would provide a headspace centre for the region if we formed government. We did not, but we still intend to work hard to get this Labor government to match that commitment. It is unacceptable that an area of such need is ignored in the latest rollout of new headspace centres. We had a petition circulating in Mackay that got 4,000 signatures in six short weeks. It was with great expectation that people who worked so hard to highlight this issue watched the delivery of the budget, and expectation was heightened with the leaks of a big investment in mental health. However, it was a little off the mark—$700 million of the mental health package was re-announcing previously committed funds. But there was a glimmer of hope: $197 million and 30 new headspace centres. But, on closer scrutiny, only seven per cent of the funds will be provided in the next financial year and more than 80 per cent does not kick in until after the next election. In an act of high deception, this yellow dog of a government pushed $65 million of that $197 million out to a period of five years from now. Flying in the face of a standard four-year budget estimate, the government included a third of the package in 2015-16. If Professor Flannery is right, we will all be rowing boats down the main street of Mackay before that promise ever comes to fruition. In addition to that are $580 million in cuts to mental health programs coordinated by GPs. On Friday, I was informed that psychologists have been sacked, in the mess that is now the coordination of federally funded health services in Mackay. One wonders whether this is the result of those cuts.


This is a government that must accept the fact that if you lie down with dogs you will get fleas. It is a flea-bitten government that needs to go to an election, and the most humane thing to do is to let the people put this dog of a government down before it is too late.

"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2011-05-30,"



Mr ADAMS
 (Lyons) (17:36):  We just heard some comments about mental health. These appropriation bills before the House certainly deal with mental health. Record numbers of Australians are receiving mental health treatment, according to an evaluation released today. There are certainly still some groups who are not accessing the services that they need, so there is more work to do. While treatment rates for people with mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression have improved from 35 per cent in 2007 to an estimated 46 per cent in 2010, many young people, men, people living in rural and remote areas and people in areas of high socioeconomic disadvantage are still missing out. 


The honourable member for Dawson says that his seat is missing out on headspace services and other things. Maybe it is him; maybe he is not working hard enough to generate the activity needed to get those resources in his area, or maybe he cannot put the figures together. I do not know. But people with mental health issues are entitled to services and this government has put money into this budget to deliver those services. Let's not talk about dogs and fleas; let's talk about what is happening. What are the opposition proposing? They have not produced a budget; they have just ranted and raved. The shadow Treasurer has failed to produce an alternative budget—once in the House and once at the Press Club. They just will not say what they would do to spend budgetary moneys.


An evaluation of the Better Access to Psychiatrists, Psychologists and General Practitioners through the Medicare Benefits Schedule initiative was released today by the minister. Better Access provides Medicare rebates for mental health services. The evaluation was commissioned by the Department of Health and Ageing in 2008 and was overseen by experts in the mental health and research fields. The evaluation found that from 2007 to 2009 over two million people received more than 11.1 million individual mental health services. Around half of all Better Access consumers may be new not only to Better Access but to mental health care more generally. 


The initiative provided value for money for those it reached and consumers experienced clinically significant reductions in levels of psychological stress and severe symptoms upon completing the treatment. Investment in Better Access has been $1.45 billion from 2006-07 to 2009-10. The evaluation findings are encouraging, especially on access and improvements in treatment rates for common mental disorders. They also point to some areas of particular concern that echoes the feedback received from the mental health forums held late last year. We still need to do more for those people who are continuing to miss out on much needed mental health care—men, young people and those people living in rural and remote areas, as the member for Dawson would know; as well as those in areas of low socioeconomic disadvantage. These people stand out in all the statistics I see and I am sure that you also see, Madam Deputy Speaker. 


It is also vital that we focus our efforts on getting the right care to the most vulnerable in our society, including those at greatest risk of suicide—young people, Indigenous Australians and those with severe and persistent conditions. The outlines in the budget certainly go in that direction. Mental health reform is a key priority of this Labor government in its second term. This is why the Prime Minister has asked the minister to establish an expert advisory group on mental health. The group has already started to provide ideas for real improvement in mental health services that are achievable and make best possible use of the government's resources. 


The Better Access evaluation is important to help inform the government's reform efforts and to ensure the balance of services across the spectrum of mental illness. The Gillard government is committed through its reform efforts to ensure that mental health services are coordinated, cost efficient and fundamentally targeted to those people most in need. 


In addition to Better Access, the government is investing $120.7 million between 2010 and 2014 in the Access to Allied Psychological Services, ATAPS, program, which delivers psychological services at low or no cost to patients and targets hard-to-reach groups. The government is also investing $64.2 million between 2010 and 2014 in mental health services in rural and remote areas under the Mental Health Services in Rural and Remote Areas program. 


There is also a program—the government's flexible care packages—for people with severe mental illness or illnesses. In the 2010-11 budget, $58.5 million was allocated in funding for flexible care packages to provide clinical and case coordination services to better support people with severe mental illness in the community, delivered through Medicare Locals. These are all new initiatives in this budget. Clinical services include psychological therapy provided by specially trained providers such as psychologists and social workers, who will be encouraged to link patients to other services in the community for people with severe illness. Flexible care packages will allow Medicare Locals to purchase the services people with a severe mental illness need to keep them well in the community and out of hospital. Consultations across the nation, including in regional areas, have been conducted on the design and implementation of these flexible care packages. More than 70 written submissions were received. These consultations have shown that there is strong support for the implementation of the flexible care packages, including from GPs, who are central to supporting and finding referral pathways to other services for their patients with a severe mental illness. There is also a desire to see them implemented in a considered and staged way, with a clear and consistent process to ensure appropriate targeting to people with severe illness and with support for a development phase to enable essential service links and quality assurance to be arranged at a local level, before services start to roll out.


The government has listened to the sector and based on the feedback received will implement the flexible care packages in a staged approach to coincide with the establishment of the first 15 Medicare Locals. From now until 1 July clinical governance, service delivery and quality assurance issues will be determined in consultation with relevant stakeholders. From 1 July, the first 15 Medicare Locals will become eligible for funding to provide additional services to consumers through flexible care packages. Work will also be done to ensure Medicare Locals are provided with funding for development and planning, before service delivery starts.


The roll-out of these flexible care packages demonstrates the government's commitment to ongoing mental health reform. The government will continue to work with the sector to deliver mental health reform and ensure the best delivery of services for people with a severe mental illness.


Many people will remember the service in my electorate of Lyons, Rural Alive and Well, which was set up during the terrible drought times to try and bring back some hope to many farmers who were in despair of losing their animals and their properties. This too falls into the area of mental health. These community-developed programs are vital for keeping an eye on the mental health of our farmers and rural workers, and make up the many approaches to deal with mental health problems that have emerged in recent years. There is a community-based approach, and this is taking place in areas such as forestry in Tasmania, with a lot of contractors and forest workers being laid off. There is a person dealing with those issues using a community-based approach, referring the people concerned to professional assistance if that is needed.


Mental health issues have offered a real challenge to many ordinary health services. I am sure there are many other instances around Australia where mental health have been put into the too-hard basket. It with a great relief that I see that the budget has been able to provide a priority weighting to mental health issues. This will allow the local health services to provide primary services that have links to referral services for those who have been touched with a mental illness. It gives me great joy to see so much emphasis being put on mental health in this most recent budget.


I would also like to touch on education. I continue to have the honour of opening BER projects in my electorate. I opened one on Friday in the historical township of Evandale. If you have flown into Launceston Airport, Evandale is the village at the end of the runway. It has spent, very well, a lot of money to improve the school, renewing the school hall and making it larger. Many classrooms and playground areas have been improved as well. I was at the opening at Oatlands District High School the week before that. The principal of Oatlands high school described the money that came through from the Commonwealth government as 'a fairytale'. She said it was like a fairytale that they received the money; they could do so many things that they wanted to do to the school. It has enhanced their program so much. That is a great thing to see happen, and, as I said, I am always honoured to do that. It is enhancing the educational opportunities for young people in Tasmania.


We have also had the opportunity in this budget to continue the flow of money to Tasmania for irrigation projects which are set to rejuvenate the farming community of Tasmania. The Whitemore scheme was opened earlier this month, with 40 kilometres of pipeline delivering about 5,500 megalitres over about 12,000 hectares. Of course, we will be going to the Midlands scheme very shortly. That will take a couple of years to get on stream as the biggest irrigation project in the electorate of Lyons, and that will revitalise and create a lot of economic activity that will enhance us into the future. This budget has been very good for Australia and very good for Tasmania, and I have a great deal of pleasure in supporting these bills through the parliament.

"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2011-05-30,"



Dr SOUTHCOTT
 (Boothby) (17:51):  What can we say? This is another Labor budget, another deficit budget, another budget which adds to growing government debt. Despite all the government's rhetoric, this was not a tough budget. It is a budget that has all of the wrong priorities for Australia. Constantly saying that it was a tough budget, constantly repeating those words to the public, will not make it true. The Prime Minister was right when she described it as a traditional Labor budget. It is. It is a budget with big deficit, big debt and more taxes. It is a traditional Labor budget. It is another deficit budget.


The Labor Party, incredibly, have not delivered a budget in surplus in the last 21 years. We even have a member of this House who has never seen a Labor budget surplus in his lifetime. The Labor Party have not delivered a budget surplus since the Hawke-Keating government did in 1989-90. It requires a special sort of genius to deliver four deficit budgets in a row during a time of a resources boom and during a time when the economy has been growing. The deficit for 2010-11 will be almost $50 billion. Net debt will now peak at $107 billion. What this country needs is a safe pair of hands guiding our nation's finances. The Treasurer has broken another record. We should give him a medal. He has managed to beat Keating's debt record of $96 billion in 1996. Debt will peak at $107 billion.


The coalition paid off Labor's debt last time and will pay it off again. This government is borrowing $135 million a day, and its interest alone will be $7 billion a year. The total interest paid on that debt over the next four years will be $26 billion. That is $26 billion we do not have to spend. How many hospitals could $26 billion have funded? How much infrastructure could have been bought for $26 billion? The worst part is that the carbon tax is not even included in this budget, so this budget is built on a false premise. The carbon tax is expected to add $11½ billion to household budgets, which is going to add further to pressure on the cost of living.


There are a couple of points in this budget that I want to focus on—first of all, the government's attempts to wind back the private health insurance rebate. In every one of the four budgets delivered by the Labor Party so far, they have attacked private health insurance and those who hold private health cover, and they are persisting with their plan to wind back private health insurance. The private health insurance rebate was originally introduced by the coalition government in 1999. Labor's proposals to means test the rebate has been twice rejected by the Senate and yet the government are introducing it again. They just cannot let this go. The Labor Party hate private health care. They are pursuing this as an ideological argument. They have not really thought about this at all. The importance of private health insurance is that it takes pressure off the public system. It provides people with choice but importantly it takes pressure off the public healthcare system. Within five years, this move will be budget negative and within five years it will be costing more than it saves. 


Recently, the Australian Health Insurance Association commissioned a report by Deloitte which shows that the cost due to increased public healthcare system demand will be $2.4 billion over the next four years. It is going to end up costing everyone. Private health insurance premiums are estimated to rise more than 10 per cent over and above the annual premium rises. This is on top of the 15 per cent, 30 per cent and 45 per cent cuts in the rebates for people on different incomes. In the electorate of Boothby more than 70,000 residents have private health insurance. More than 73 per cent of households in my electorate of Boothby hold private health insurance. This is a budget which is no good for them. This budget measure is an attack on every single one of those households.


Mental health is an important priority. It has been really good that mental health has been at the centre of the debate in federal parliament. That is in no small part due to the leadership shown by the Liberal Party on this issue. It was the $1.9 billion package announced in the 2006 budget when the Leader of the Opposition was the health minister which led to improvements in the way that GPs and psychologists were rewarded for spending time with their patients with mental health problems. And through Pat McGorry and John Mendoza, the opposition developed a very good mental health policy, which we took to the 2010 election. The Labor Party's policy at that election was appalling. They showed complete neglect of mental health. 


This is an issue where the Liberal and National parties have made the running. We have put up good ideas and the government have responded. But their mental health budget measures are really an illusion. It is like a lot of things with this government: it looks good but by the time you kick the tyres and have a look under the bonnet, you find out it is another lemon. When you look into the budget papers, you realise that what was described is not what you end up with.


In 2011-12, the Gillard government are providing $47.3 million in new funding for mental health. But, unfortunately, in that same year they are also cutting $62.8 million from existing mental health programs. In year 1, giving with one hand and pulling back with the other, there is actually a drop of $15½ million dollars in funding for mental health. This is hardly following through on the Prime Minister's promise that mental health would be a priority in their second term of government. Unfortunately, over the next four years of the forward estimates, after taking into account the budget cuts there is only $583 million in new money. It is nowhere near what was announced in the budget. The majority of their big spend on mental health is old money rebadged with a new name. It is about a third of what the coalition promised for the same period. Their truthful commitment is hardly the $2.2 billion dollar headline figure that the Minister for Health and Ageing has been putting about. The worst part is that the majority of the mental health funding is promised not now, not next year, but in five years time. This is towards the end of the next government's term. The coalition committed $1.5 billion at the 2010 election, and we announced another $430 million more recently.


There is another aspect of the funding for mental health which I think is very short-sighted. These are cuts to general practitioner funding for mental health. Anyone who knows anything about mental health will realise the importance of having it dealt with by a general practitioner in the first instance. A lot of mental health can be dealt with very adequately by a GP. Budget day was a sad day for patient care in general practice because what the government did was rip $580 million over four years out of mental health programs coordinated by GPs. General practice is the universal access point for health care nationally. Most people have a medical home which is their GP, and it is very important for continuity of care that people do have a medical home and that they do have one GP who can coordinate their health care. GPs are best placed to identify and work with patients due to their recurring contact and due to the fact that they have known a patient often over the life and perhaps are caring for the whole family as well. Dr Pesce, the former president of the AMA, has agreed with this position. He said, 'Family doctors are the preferred entry point for mental health care.' The government has dramatically devalued the role of the family doctor in managing community mental health. The RACGP have stated that around 70 per cent of patients will consult with their GP when they are first noticing problems with their mental health. To date 17,000 GPs across the country have undertaken additional mental health skills training.


The MBS rebates for GP mental health plans have been cut by half. This measure alone will strip $405.9 million away from GPs over five years. Under the new budget measures, the rebates will be reduced from the current $163.35 to $85.92 for consultations lasting between 20 and 40 minutes for those practitioners who have completed mental health training. This rebate will be dropped to $67.65 for GPs who have not completed the mental health training.


The government have also slashed the number of allied health treatment services available to patients under the Better Access initiative. This measure strips $174.6 million over the next five years. Under this reduced initiative, patients are only allowed to access up to six subsidised mental health services through the MBS, with an additional four subsidised services for those who need it. This is down from a total possible of 18, a cut of almost half. The majority of the funding for mental health is to now be distributed by Medicare Locals. It is still unknown how effective this will be.


GPs are still unsure how these bodies will operate or how effective they will be. I urge the government on this issue to properly consult with the general practice organisations, the RACGP, the AMA, the AGPN and GP Registrars Australia, before the implementation of these damaging cuts to mental health funding provided by general practitioners. It will be detrimental to patients. It is something which has worked very well, I think, since the Better Access program was introduced in 2006. This is a very short-term and short-sighted measure by the government.

Ms SAFFIN
 (Page) (18:04):  I welcome the opportunity to talk generally about the budget and the budget priorities and the government's handling of this, particularly over the last four years since the federal Labor Party came to government. One of the things that I always find rather puzzling is the view put, particularly by the coalition, that only they can manage the economy and only they can manage the government. Yet, if you read the history of budgets, of macro and microeconomic reform and of federal governments in Australia, you will see that that is simply not true; it is not borne out by the facts. The major reforms to our economy actually started in modern times during the period of the Hawke-Keating governments. But I have to say that, at the time, there were a few more 'yeses' from the then coalition opposition than we hear now. All we hear now from the opposition is 'no, no, no'—whatever it is. It is almost like a case of 'cut off your nose to spite your face'. They do not know when to say yes. A measure of an effective and credible opposition is knowing when to say yes. 


What I want to talk about is this Labor government's budget. It builds on that history of reform, and it has done so since coming to government in 2007—and each budget thereafter, including this budget, reflects that. This budget reflects two essential things. One is keeping the economy strong—strengthening it where it needs to. That is necessary if you want to spend, and we need to spend because of the priorities that have to be funded in the electorates. I know that governments, whoever they are, have every backbencher at them wanting some of that money spent in their electorates. I am no different; I always want my share. But for a government to spend across the nation you need a strong economy. You also need—and this is the second essential thing and the essence of the Labor Party and what it does in government—to inculcate a fair go. That is inherent in this budget and in the way that the budget spend is prioritised. But this also means that there have to be savings; it has to be a responsible budget. 


One thing that I have always said is that I am not in parliament to help the Mr Packers, the Mr Palmers, the Mr Forrests and the Ms Rineharts. It is nothing personal. Many of these people do big things and some do it more than others in terms of their sense of corporate social responsibility, which is a key—




Mr Danby:
  Some of them have it, some of them don't.




Ms SAFFIN:
  And some of them do it and some of them do not. However, I do not think they need my representation—I am sure they do not even know who I am. I am here to represent those without much voice, like people on wages, pensioners, my mum and a whole lot of other people in my electorate, such as people without jobs living at or below the poverty line as it is set in Australia, people living with mental illness, people basically in need and people suffering oppression and injustice wherever they are. Budgets—and Labor budgets more so—are one way of representing the people that I am talking about, and this budget shows that. 


My seat of Page is not a rich seat; yet we do not feel poor. Ours is a rural and coastal area. We have a larger than average number of senior citizens. The aged care industry is one of 11 industries in my seat. In terms of numbers, we have twice the national average of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living in the area. In fact, 10 per cent of Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population live within the strip from the Hunter up to the Tweed. My seat sits within that strip. So when we talk about closing the gap and Indigenous Australia, we are talking about a large proportion of that population living in my seat and in the broader coastal framework. 


I feel quite honoured to be on the expert panel for constitutional recognition of Indigenous Australians. This is something that we are approaching in a multipartisan way. I am on the expert panel with the honourable member for Hasluck, the honourable member for Lyne and Senator Rachel Siewert, so we have a broad political representation. This is something that we are talking about at the moment. Closing the Gap is an important policy way of incorporating a fair go. God knows that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have not had a fair go throughout our history in Australia, and it behoves all of us to try to give them a fair go. Is it complex? Yes. Is it complex for people in need? Yes. But we still have to do it.


On the evening of the budget, I put out a statement on what it meant for me and the people locally in my seat of Page. In the lead-up to the budget, I had speculated as much as anybody else. People spend weeks speculating about what is going to be in and what is going to be out. It is one of those times when people think that backbenchers will have some particular information or knowledge. Those who are in government or who have been in government know that that is not quite true. What we see in the media is what we know. But that did not stop me speculating and being in the media, as it did not stop everybody else! On the day after the budget, I did eight or nine interviews in the media about it. So I have actually covered a lot of the things in the budget that impacted on us locally. Two of the general areas I went through were health and mental health. 


I have always said that, if I have a key priority, it is health. I continue to make sure that I am knocking on the doors all the time on health. There were some good things in the budget in terms of health. Up to about $1.8 billion had been available in the Health and Hospitals Fund, and there is $475 million allocated to it but not yet spent. That means that some people can get a second go. I have said that in our area we can have a second go at trying to get some of that. That $475 million is national, so there will be a lot of people knocking at the door trying to get some of it, but we have got to get in and try. There were some other good things in the budget. One was the permanent funding for the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program, something that I and other members had lobbied for. I commend the Minister for Health and Ageing for that. 


I also commend the minister for the $2.2 billion for mental health services. That is a historic investment in services for those with mental illness. My comments around mental illness over a long period of time have been that none of us have got it quite right. There is a lot more that needs to be done, but this is a good start. The fact that we actually went to an election with mental health as an issue was really important, because often it never gets into elections as a seminal issue. But there is still a lot more to do in terms of how we engage, people and engage them early, and some of the strategies in the mental health framework. It is a 10-year plan and it needs to be ongoing about how we respond to people with mental illness.


I listened to some of the speeches in this place about how GPs are our first port of call. They are for most things, but there are a lot of people who do not get access to mental health services through GPs being their first port of call. It is an issue I have been engaged in for a long time as a mental health advocate, and it is something that I am currently engaged in through personal family circumstances and experience. I share that with lots of families around Australia. It is another complex area to be formulating policy around, and it is one of those areas where it is better if we can do it in a bipartisan way. The people who suffer from mental illness deserve that. Another area of the budget that I want to talk about is regional spending and development. There has been record investment in our region for transport, water—infrastructure, which covers health as well—and education of over $4.4 billion. The previous government was elected in 1996, and in 1997 that government axed the whole department of regional development as well as a lot of regional development programs. I thought that was a rather odd thing to do, particularly when it was a coalition and one part of that coalition was the National Party, which says it is the natural party of the country or the bush. We reintroduced those programs and did a lot more in regional Australia.


That brings me to a report issued recently called Investing in regions: making a difference. We called it the Grattan report as it was put out by the Grattan Institute.It hit the headlines because it said regional investment fails to make a difference. It just seemed absolute nonsense. At my university—Southern Cross University—the vice chancellor, Peter Lee, entered the public debate and said, 'It's fundamentally flawed.' He went through the report critiquing the methodology. One of the measures the report used, which I found intriguing, was the number of patents that come from regions. I found that a rather odd measure. Regions that have small to medium businesses may never generate a patent—unlike my region, which, with someone like Rick Richardson, generates a lot of patents. He is an inventor with a national and international reputation. It just seemed an odd measure. My husband is a retired academic who chaired some regional economic development forums. He has a PhD in this area, and when talking to me at home about this issue he has been rather exercised. I keep saying, 'Get out and publish something on it because you know the issue better than most.'


The report also said basically that having a university in your region does not make a difference to a regional economy. What nonsense! We have figures that quantify that and it is really clear that it does make a difference, even with the jobs alone. It does make a difference with people from regions going to universities. Just having one there is a symbol; it appeals to that aspiration to go to university. I know it has done that in my area and in other regions across Australia. I would be surprised if any member here were able to agree with that report and the general approach that it took to regional development right across Australia.


In closing, I am happy to support this budget—it is responsible and will get us back into the black.

"Forrest, John, MP",Nats,2011-05-30,"



Mr FORREST
 (Mallee) (18:19):  There is no doubt that the budget is the principal policy opportunity for the government of the day. This is my 18th budget, the first three in opposition, 11 from government and now four again from opposition. It is an opportunity for the government to set its priorities, where its priorities are going to be. I have to say, contrary to what was said by the previous speaker, the member for Page, that from my constituency's point of view I feel as though on their behalf they have been completely let down. For example, and I will give plenty more in the 15 minutes of this contribution, this budget in the middle of Australia's biggest flood crisis has elected to withdraw exceptional circumstances assistance to my farming communities at the time of their greatest need. It is completely inappropriate. EC money could have been viewed as a stimulatory expenditure we needed to kick-start these important regional economies. Without EC the job will be much harder. In fact, there will be much more pain for my families struggling to save their businesses.


I have been interested to listen to the contributions from government members focusing on expenditure; bold statements that this is the largest level of expenditure on infrastructure that there has ever been. Opposition conservative contributions have been more about where this huge amount of money has come from that is borrowed and reminding their own constituents it has to be paid for. Money does not grow on trees. The ideological differences are remarkable. There seems to be a thought from the government that it does not matter that a nation can transfer, intergenerationally, its debt responsibility to a new generation. I have been raised from a conservative point of view. I support the concept that you borrow, you mortgage to buy your modest home and then you extend that to perhaps borrow again to develop your business, but you keep it at a level that you know you can manage knowing full well that you need to put away for the rainy day. The disaster is going to come. In my experience it was either frost in the dried vine fruit industry or it was hail, and you knew that when you got the good year you did not spend it all but you put it away as one in every seven at least would be a disaster year. I do not believe that a nation should be any different in the way it manages the money it has got custodianship of, which belongs to taxpayers. But that is just the ideological difference between the two arguments I have been listening to for the last week or so as people make their contributions with regard to this budget.


My constituency tell me they feel very badly let down. I think the budget has failed to pick up on the importance of our rural powerhouse, that it has the capacity to make a major contribution to our national economy. It has done so for years and will continue to do so. It just needs a little bit of support as we get through the disasters that it has endured, from Queensland through New South Wales all the way to Victoria. In fact, the Victorian flood circumstances astounded everybody, particularly when you think of the arid nature of the Mallee constituency I represent. It has a notional annual rainfall of 10 inches in the year in the old measurements, 250 millimetres. There was that amount of rainfall in two or three days. At Mildura on 9 March there was 250 millimetres in eight hours. It has completely devastated the viticultural industry there and it is an ongoing struggle. So to have that exceptional circumstance removed at that time was hard. I was corresponding with the relevant minister and, yes, it is an awkward position to be in to have exceptional circumstance financial support for a drought outcome but the implications of the opposite, a flood, are just the same: financial pain and financial insecurity. In my Mallee constituency 183 agricultural constituents reported loss and damage of more than $250,000 each and 400 had losses of more than $100,000 each. This gives a staggering total in the order of $350 million in losses at the farm gate—figures supported by the Victorian Farmers Federation and the Department of Primary Industries in Victoria. And this does not allow for the much higher value-added amount after processing, mostly into food but also into fibre.


I have some of the best farmers and horticulturalists in my constituency, but their balance sheets have been crippled by a decade of drought. Just when they thought that El Dorado was upon them, an opportunity to get them out of trouble with their banks, down came the worst meteorological disaster that the region has probably ever seen. I wrote to the minister on 11 February 2011 imploring him not to abandon EC and to find another option, knowing it was going to finish on 31 March—as recommended by the National Rural Advisory Council. But their advice was put to the minister's office before the rainfall. To this day, I have not had a response to my correspondence—very disappointing. My intention was to provide early advice, not knowing then but suspecting that meteorological outcomes of the nature that were showing up in the Pacific due to the El Nino. My prophecy came to fruition, sadly. Fruit, vegetables, melon and nut crops were all affected. As well, the viticultural and the dried vine fruit sectors were affected. Wine grape growers were already struggling but I thought table grapes in the Murray Valley was one commodity that had the capacity to allow horticulture to carry on, especially after getting formal access to China after many years. But the weather conditions wrecked the crop. The fruit rotted and it got downy mildew, a fungal growth that develops in the bunch because of the high humidity. It was very disappointing. I had hoped that this budget would offer something more to my constituents, but it did not. 


Eight out of the nine municipalities in the electorate of Mallee have experienced severe flooding, particularly in January. The community of Charlton was flooded three times in six months, to the extent that 80 per cent of the township was inundated with water up to the height of my chest. The hospital, the aged-care facility and the doctor's surgery were all in one complex which was inundated. 



The Charlton community are still struggling to recover from that. Those people are in despair as they try to sleep in this cold weather with no carpets on their floors and the gyprock removed from their walls up to chest height. They are waiting for their insurers to respond positively and honour their claims. I put those insurance companies on notice: if I do not get some positive responses from them in accepting claim responsibilities in Donald and Charlton then I will come into this place and name and shame. If people do not want to insure that is fine, but do not leave those who had insurance hanging by a hook not knowing where to go from here. One of those people is the doctor in Charlton. He is not in a good frame of mind. When you have young children and you cannot live comfortably in your own home, the pressure on a family is devastating. That is the Buloke Shire. Donald also lost its aged-care facility in the flood. Equally as devastating was the news in Queensland but down south they were a little disappointed because whilst no-one was injured and no lives were lost the outcome was the same. The 30 residents at the aged-care facility in Donald had to be relocated across the region. This has created enormous uncertainty and will lead to very poor outcomes from a health point of view. That is why I am so disappointed that this budget will see the closure of the Medicare access facilities in those vital towns spread across the north-west of Victoria in my constituency.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER

The DEPUTY SPEAKER (Ms Vamvakinou):
  Before the debate is resumed on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2011-2012, I remind the Committee that pursuant to the resolution agreed to by the House on 10 May 2011 this order of the day will be debated concurrently with Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2011-2012 and Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2011-2012.


Debate resumed on the motion:


That this bill be now read a second time.


to which the following amendment was moved:


That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:


""while not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House:


(1) condemns the Government for incorporating in an annual appropriation bill provisions to increase the limit on government borrowings above the total of $200 billion;


(2) recognises that a special case must be made for such a significant increase in borrowing limits and that the Government must explain any special circumstances that it believes justify such an increase; and


(3) demands that the Parliament be given the opportunity to consider separately and vote on the proposed increases in borrowing limits set out in Part 5 of Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2001-12.""



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The immediate question is that the words proposed to be omitted stand part of the question.

Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (16:01):  We heard all the leaks which said that this was going to be a tough budget. Yes siree, the Treasurer and the Prime Minister were talking it up all along. This, my friends, was going to be the year of delivery. Well, they got that right! They delivered a $49.4 billion deficit; they have delivered a record borrowing limit of $250 billion; they have delivered a record net debt of $107 million; they have raised their own record borrowing on a daily basis to $135 million per day; they have raised their own record of interest payments on this debt to $7 billion per year—that is, $19,178,072 per day or $799,086 per hour, after hour, after hour, of interest payments alone. 


We have heard about the China boom mark 2. We have heard the Minister for Foreign Affairs wax lyrical about the rivers of gold coming to our economy. But we have seen what this government has done with these and we—the people of Townsville—sit back, scratch our heads and wonder what happened. And what do we have to show for it: debt, no plans and no prospects. We certainly have seen growth though. The Commonwealth Public Service has grown by over 20,000 people since 2007. While the Prime Minister was telling everyone that things are tough and we have to tighten our belts, her Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet grew by over 100 new staff. This budget does not deliver what it promised. In fact, the biggest line item in the savings in this budget is the flood levy itself. This government can talk pretty tough, but it cannot back it up. 


I take issue, as does my electorate, with the announcement of funding for the Bruce Highway and roads in North Queensland. The Treasurer carried on about the announcement of roadworks in Vantassel Street as though it was brand-new funding. Those of us who have been hit by the continual flooding of the Bruce Highway know that this was already to be done. This flood mitigation work was pulled during the recent floods to aid flood mitigation work elsewhere in the state. The project has been reinstated but surely the Treasurer will not mind if we in Townsville take this promise with a grain of salt. It should never have been pulled in the first place.


In the week prior to the budget, I held a budget roundtable in Townsville. Those in attendance included small businesses in the mining and construction sectors, retail and service industries, and representatives of our region's chamber of commerce and health sector. To a person, they want the waste stopped. They look at the way this country and our state of Queensland are being run and they want the waste stopped. They are sick and tired of being treated like an ATM for any level of government which cannot balance its books. Each and every one of those represented at the meeting have been forced to make tough decisions to keep their costs down. But at every turn they are faced with an increasing number of taxes, charges and regulations from government, which simply does not see anything other than an easy grab. It has to stop. I call on this government to get serious about taxation and deliver on its promised tax summit so that real reform to the way business and individuals are taxed can be discussed and implemented. In Townsville, the message I am getting is that business is simply not hiring. We have seen unemployment rise to 8.5 per cent in my city. While there are significant projects happening in Queensland, Townsville may face skill shortages as professionals in trades chase jobs across the state and the country. All these government charges and regulations are making it increasingly costly to live anywhere, but especially in Townsville. There have been interest rate rises, levies, rising government charges and the like which have added to the pressure on ordinary families. The strain is seen in my office every week when I see broken families and pensioners come to me, worried about where they will get the money to survive. They do not care whose fault it is that bananas are $13 a kilo or that petrol is $1.45 per litre. They just want help, and they do not see it coming from this government.


What they do see coming from this government is a continuation of the failed pink batts and school halls programs. What they do see is a set-top box program worth $376 million being rolled out by the same people who delivered the pink batts program and the solar power program. Somewhere in that meeting surely someone, anyone, would have said, 'Are we sure about this? Haven't we got form on this sort of thing? Haven't we learned any lessons from the last few times we got involved?' Surely someone somewhere said something about it costing $360 for a set-top box to be installed at a pensioner's home. I checked the website of the Good Guys in Townsville and found six different digital TV sets costing under $360, the cost to install a set-top box. So why bother with a set-top box at all? Send them all to Troy Williams and they can get a brand new TV for less than the government is paying. Where is the sense here, and why has no-one in the government stood up in this place and said, 'This is just not a good idea'?


Of course, the whole budget is basically predicated on a lie, and the Treasurer dare not speak its name. That the carbon tax is not mentioned in the forward estimates reduces this budget to a farcical document. He comes into this House and pours scorn on all who dare to question his commitment to the tax. But he is not allowed to include it in his calculations, nor was he a part of the team used to sell the product to start off with. This government does not care about global warming, climate change or climate action. What this government care about is telling Australians that the budget will be back in surplus in an election year, and they do not care how they do it. They simply cannot stop spending. It is only by taxing people that they can do this. This government and the Treasurer want the people of Townsville to believe that the budget will be back in surplus due to economic management but, in truth, they are just going to raise taxes to try to get a result.


I would like to say that the reforms to mental health are welcomed by all of us. It is a good start, but there is still a lot of work to do. I would like to use this opportunity to call for the states to get out of mental health altogether. We need a system where decisions are made and the money gets to the pointy end as quickly and as intact as possible. By having to engage the states in the process, there are extra costs which take vital funds away from the clinicians and the services they provide. I recognise the government's commitment to headspace and the recent approval of the headspace phase 1 at Riverway in Townsville. This is a vital project, and the non-intrusive way in which young people can access services will save this country millions of dollars into the future. I know that the Mental Illness Fellowship of North Queensland has also received funds from this government to establish a proper base in Townsville away from the hospital in a non-threatening manner. I note that Andy Froggatt, their soon-to-depart CEO, has worked very hard to get this up across all levels of government. I thank the government for their support here. I do note though that the new funding is actually outside the forward estimates. I just hope that this is not some sort of accounting trick to appease the sector while not delivering on these vital reforms.


I want to touch on something not covered in the budget but something that surely must be considered. The Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits Scheme, or the DFRDB, needs to be indexed correctly. I am not about to take a swipe at this government for its inaction, because it has been in front of the Whitlam government, the Fraser government, the Hawke government, the Keating government, the Howard government and the Rudd government. As well as the Gillard government, all have ducked and weaved on the issue and made those people in our defence forces who have served at least 20 years all the poorer by doing so. The Whitlam government needed cash and took the money for the Defence pensions and absorbed it into consolidated revenue. For that, he told the forces, they would keep all their benefits and their pension would be indexed to the consumer price index, the CPI. Every other pension is also indexed to the male total average weekly earnings, the MTAWE, and the pensioner and beneficiary cost of living cost index, the PBCLI, as well as the CPI, whichever is the highest. This has meant that the DFRDB recipients have slowly but surely slipped further and further behind.


I have a very good working relationship with retired Brigadier Neil Weekes, who is a DFRDB recipient. In one of our conversations last week he asked me if it was fair. When I asked him what was fair, he responded by asking me what was fair or right that DFRDB recipients who have served a minimum of 20 years in the armed services continually are treated as second-class citizens by their government. We as politicians line up every Anzac Day and we let the reflected glory of our men and women of the armed services wash over us at functions and on exercises. But as soon as they retire we drop them like a bad habit. We, the coalition, have finally been able to get this as policy on our side and we will fix this once we have government. But wouldn't it be lovely to be as one House on this issue? It is no wonder that all politicians are treated with scepticism by the defence forces when we are pretty much two-faced in how we deal with them. No, Neil, it is not right and it is not fair.


When it comes to education, I have real concerns about some of the government's plans in this country. I worry about NAPLAN. I worry that it has become the only thing taught in schools. It is the only thing taught in the years that the test is given. It is the only thing taught in the year preceding the examination. My question is: what happens to sport or music or art? These are disappearing from our schools' teaching landscapes as the My School website is hanging schools out to dry. The $400 million being touted as bonuses for high-performing teachers is simply misguided. The sooner we as a country realise that teaching is a calling and the money, while important, is not the sole decision maker for professionals making the career choice the better. I think you would find that most primary school teachers would prefer the money to be spent on additional aide time to assist them with delivery of quality education. By installing a bonus system into schools you are making internal politics and personal relationships more important than providing education to our children. I would also call on the government to recognise the need for funding equity in primary and secondary schools. If we can learn that mental illness can be better treated if detected early—and the cost to the community is lowered if it is treated early—then surely funds must be made available to primary schools to pick up and treat learning difficulties and/or disabilities.


This budget does not provide a decent building block for the future. It is too much of a punt to be taken seriously. This budget fails to address rampant government spending and papers over the cracks instead of bringing in real reform. For the sake of Australia and for the sake of Townsville we must have a change of government.

"Cheeseman, Darren, MP",ALP,2011-05-30,"



Mr CHEESEMAN
 (Corangamite) (16:13):  I take this opportunity today to speak on the very important Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2011-2012 and related bills. This is a vital budget for this nation and it is certainly a Labor budget, a budget that focuses on the key elements and key challenges that this nation faces, both in terms of building a modern economy and also making sure that every Australian has the opportunity to participate in a workplace and to earn a respectable wage. I believe this budget is not only very much a Labor budget but also a very fair budget, a budget that is very smart and of course does recognise the very important challenges our nation faces and will build employment opportunities as the private sector returns to this economy following the global financial crisis.


The budget talks about an economy that has near full employment. In my electorate of Corangamite and also in the broader Geelong area there is almost full employment at the moment. Many of the communities that are still suffering from unemployment have in fact had multigenerational unemployment, and I believe this budget provides opportunities for those particular parts of the Geelong community to engage in the workplace.


It is fair to say that our economy is the envy of the rest of the world. Many parts of the OECD still have an unemployment rate that is close to 10 per cent. Of course our own unemployment rate is just a tick under five per cent. This budget is the right budget for this particular point in Australia's evolution. It provides for record investment in many parts of our economy, particularly the nation-building parts of our economy—rail, road and our telecommunications system. The National Broadband Network will be critical, particularly for rural and regional Australia. The regions will be given a playing field level with that of metropolitan Australia, something that has certainly not been the case with broadband. Being a regional member of the House of Representatives, I am very pleased and proud that the National Broadband Network will open up our economy and put us on a level playing field.


This budget provides $1.8 billion for critical infrastructure upgrades to our public hospitals and health services, particularly for the regions. In Geelong we were very pleased to receive the announcement of $26 million for a regional cancer centre, which will not only service the broader Geelong region but will provide very important cancer outreach services to the Western District of Victoria, an area that has suffered from high rates of cancer. This fantastic initiative was put forward by the Geelong Hospital, and I was very pleased to be with the minister, Nicola Roxon, in Geelong to make the announcement that we would invest in that very important area.


This budget also delivers in terms of our transport infrastructure in Corangamite and for the whole of the western side of the state. Particularly, we are working in partnership with the state government to deliver the Regional Rail Link, an important piece of Victorian infrastructure that this government is committed to, which will assist western Victorians with access to Melbourne via public transport. Importantly, locally this budget continues to deliver the necessary funding for the Geelong Ring Road, which is a very important road in the Geelong region, and also provides funding for the continued duplication of the Princes Highway. The Princes Highway is arguably the most important piece of economic infrastructure in the Geelong region. Again, we are delivering the necessary money to duplicate it not only to make the road safer but also, importantly, to open up the western side of Victoria and to provide a very much safer transport passage and greater access for primary producers and others in western Victoria to get their product to the port of Geelong, the Port of Melbourne, Avalon Airport and Tullamarine Airport. I think that says a lot about this government and the priorities that we have set. We very much believe in putting in place the nation-building infrastructure that we do of course require.


Importantly, this budget also continues the process of implementing our historic higher education reforms. I have spoken on education in almost every single session of parliament since we came to office in 2007. We certainly have great ambition for Australia's education system, whether it be our universities or our schools. I must say I am a very proud member who has contributed to a lot of the debates that have taken place in this place on education. This budget continues to deliver with respect to that. Again, some $500 million is available for regional priorities. Again, this particular government is very keen to ensure that our regions do not miss out. Labor has had a very proud and longstanding history with respect to Australia's regions. Importantly, this budget again prioritises funding for our regions.


This budget also provides some $916 million for regional infrastructure projects that will be undertaken by our regional development bodies. They will be prioritised by those bodies. We have made available funding for those regions for the very projects that they require and that they consider as priorities. It is part of a $1 billion program that this government has committed to over the next five years.


I do want to make the point that in every budget, except for this last one, Labor have been in a position to be able to deliver tax cuts. We were not in a position to be able to do that with this budget. I know that the Treasurer has had to make some very tough decisions to enable us to bring the budget back to surplus. We will of course continue to work hard to do that. In terms of reducing the Commonwealth spend as a proportion of the economy, I think this budget is the single biggest step back that the Commonwealth has ever made. It is important that we do that, because we have a very substantial pipeline of private sector funding, particularly in association with the mining industry, that will be coming through in the next few years. It is important that the Commonwealth step back from the economy to enable that investment to come through. If we do not make those tough decisions and the Commonwealth does not reduce its spending—which is what we are doing—then of course that will have inflationary consequences in the Australian economy and will push up the cost of living and a whole raft of other things. We have delivered what I believe to be a very substantial budget.


I particularly want to make the point that, for many generations, my seat of Corangamite was considered a backwater by the Liberal Party. They owned the seat—that was their belief—for some 73-odd years and nothing much ever happened. There was no funding, no election commitments and no campaigning. None of that took place. We worked hard and we were able to win the seat in 2007 and again in 2010. That really was on the back of a lot of hard work and getting the right mixture of projects in the seat to open up the economy and to provide opportunities for young people from my part of the world to go to university, not only to the major metropolitan universities but also locally. We have worked hard with Deakin University to put in a lot of additional money to enable it to grow as an institution. I certainly look forward to continuing to work with the university to grow that institution, which has very much embraced Geelong and assisted the great transition that has taken place across the Geelong community. It is an innovative university and one that is very comfortable working with the federal government's innovation agenda. I look forward to continuing to work closely with it and the various ministers to ensure that it is able to grow and provide opportunities for young people.


It is also important to recognise that every single primary school in my seat has had a construction project either finish or be underway—building new classrooms, new libraries, new sports stadiums and the like to help educate young people. When I get around to talk to those school communities—the parents, the teachers and the students—they are all singularly excited by the Commonwealth government's massive investment in Victorian schools. It was pointed out to me that Building the Education Revolution was like the equivalent of 10 years of normal state government capital—a massive investment to help stimulate the economy but also, importantly, to provide modern educational spaces which teachers could use. We have also put money into the new GP superclinic. We continue to work with Deakin University and the innovation centre. We continue to invest in the duplication of the Princes Highway and in the Geelong Ring Road.


This budget, as I said earlier, is a budget for its time. It is a tough budget. We have had to make some difficult and challenging decisions. But I think it will set up our economy to take full advantage of the mining boom. I commend the bill to the House.

"O'Dowd, Ken, MP",Nats,2011-05-30,"



Mr O'DOWD
 (Flynn) (16:28):  I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No.1) 2011-2012 and the 2011 Labor budget. It is important that I place on record how little this budget delivers to the people of my electorate of Flynn. Flynn is a very productive electorate. It has aluminium and cement industries and coal-fired power stations. It is the beef capital of Australia. It has grain, citrus, sugar cane, small crops, cotton—it goes on and on. We add a lot to the Australian economy.


I want to expose this budget for what it is: all talk and no action. It is all smoke and mirrors. The government has shown again that it has no idea when it comes to nation building. It has no idea how to manage the big projects needed to secure Australia's future. I will give you some examples of how the Labor government budget fails not only the people of Flynn but the people of Australia. Firstly, the majority of workers in Central Queensland must drive long distances to and from work. Many work in mines and in the service industry and their homes are hundreds of kilometres from where they work. This budget will penalise these workers by slugging them for going into work. Under the 2011 Labor government budget, people who have no choice but to travel more than 40,000 kilometres per year will pay 20 per cent fringe benefits tax, up from the current seven per cent. On a $65,000 vehicle, a miner, a tradie or a salesman will shell out an additional $8,450 in tax. This is not just an attack on the mining industry; it hits the pockets of all kinds of workers who purchase a work vehicle through salary sacrifice and have to drive long distances in doing their work.


Secondly, the government must stand condemned for continually breaking election promises. It must stand condemned for building false hopes within the community only to let people down because it has no idea how to plan and manage projects within budget. I will give you some more examples of how the people of Flynn have been short-changed by the Gillard government and how they are being lied to by the Gillard government. These are just three examples. And you Labor guys over there had better put your fingers in your ears, because I know you do not want to hear this—that goes especially for the member for Capricornia, who has done her best on radio and in the papers to gloss over these issues without giving any idea at all when the real work will start.


Let us look at the Calliope Crossroads, the Yeppen bridge and the Gracemere upgrade—and then there is the Port Access Road. Promises made during the election campaign of 2007 and in 2010 have been pushed aside and replaced with a wide range of excuses. This is not good enough. There is an urgent need for the government to get back on track and stop hoodwinking the Australian public. The Calliope Crossroads presents a vital bit of infrastructure which enables Dawson Highway traffic to cross over the Bruce Highway at Calliope. It was promised, at a cost of $55 million, by both major parties in 2007. Labor failed to honour that promise during its   first term of government. It was promised again in 2010, but by this time Labor had driven the cost up to $155 million. In the 2011 budget, however, there is nothing—only a few pennies for planning. This intersection has been planned to within an inch of its life. Millions have been spent by Labor planning for something, but they have no idea at all when this project is going to start. There have been suggestions that the original $55 million to complete the project will only cover the planning and resumption of land. 


Likewise, another bridge for the Yeppen flood plain, with double lanes to Egans Hill and to Gracemere along the Capricorn Highway, is essential. The Gladstone Port Access Road is also an important project which so far has had no public consultation. We can all see the need for these projects, but nothing is being done to bring these plans to reality. In fact the government, in its latest budget, reveals that work will only start in 2014-15 and then only if the mining resource rent tax is approved. How many people will have to die on these roads before the government moves?


The reality is that the government cannot move on these issues because it is virtually bankrupt. It has transformed a strong surplus economy in 2007 into a basket case in just three years. In 2007, the coalition left the Australian people with billions of dollars in the bank. We are now borrowing in excess of $135 million a day and this budget seeks to increase our borrowings to $250 billion, up from $200 billion. We have wasted money on the failed pink batts program, the dodgy BER scheme and the countless other touchy-feely, feel-good projects. Labor has thrown money around like a drunken sailor, and I apologise to the drunken sailor for associating him with this government. The 2011 Labor government budget is an attack on middle Australians. It is an attack on working families. It is an attack on the hardworking men and women of Australia who work in our regional towns and cities.


Madam Deputy Speaker, I would like to turn your attention to another very important issue affecting the people of Flynn. I refer to the proposal by the Labor government and the Greens to introduce a carbon tax into the Australian economic landscape. To pretend that a carbon tax will not cost several thousands of Queenslanders their jobs is in my opinion the height of gross stupidity or incompetence or both. Our forefathers and captains of industry have worked diligently over the last 200 years to establish a wide range of industries and development projects across Australia. We cannot let the Green-Independent-Labor government destroy our industrial base. My electorate is without doubt the carbon capital of Australia and it naturally follows that it will be that area of Australia that suffers most from the effect of a tax that will effectively make industry less competitive on the world market.


Like with everything else, this government skirts around the issues. They will not tell industry what price per tonne they will have to pay for this carbon. Is it going to be $26 per tonne or $45 per tonne? Maybe it is going to be $100 per tonne, as demanded by the Greens, or maybe it will be somewhere in between. Uncertainty destabilises our industries. The government has a responsibility to ensure that any change to the way businesses are taxed and regulated is carried out in a measured way over a long time frame. To pretend that this tax will improve world pollution and lower temperatures, when the government's own experts say any change in a thousand years will be minor, is dishonest. The reality is that this is a tax the government must have to help dig itself out of the fiscal hole it has created for the Australian people. Let us be honest about it. Tell the Australian people the truth. The government cannot manage money and we need the Australian public to yet again cop it on the chin.


The state of our health and community services in the electorate of Flynn is in urgent need of an overhaul. There is nothing in this budget to give the community any comfort at all. On 27 July 2010 Prime Minister Julia Gillard said, 'I want to be absolutely clear—mental health will be a second-term priority for this government.' The budget papers reveal that this is a tricky move by the Prime Minister. Most of the money will be delivered in five years time—the last year of the next term of the government. The budget shows that $500 million has been cut from regional programs. It is a snub to Central Queensland when $480 million of regional development funds has been allocated to the roads around Perth Airport.


In summary, this budget delivers nothing substantial to my electorate of Flynn. It eats into the incomes of hardworking families and will take jobs from Australia and place them overseas. The government is gambling with our country and our lives. There are no guarantees about the precarious world economy and yet this sham of a budget is based on the assumption that the economies of our trading partners will continue as they are today. Where will we be if these predicted downturns in China occur? What measures has the government taken to deal with another global economic disaster if it should happen? The government has left us no room to move. It has spent foolishly and has not provided for much needed infrastructure projects like the Bruce Highway and many other trouble spots around the area, especially our internal roads. I implore the government to get its priorities sorted out and concentrate on projects that will benefit Australians in the long term.

"Gibbons, Steve, MP",ALP,2011-05-30,"



Mr GIBBONS
 (Bendigo) (16:39):  During a time of global economic uncertainty when many Western countries are battling against low or negative economic growth and a large national debt, this budget is all about getting the settings right. It is about getting the settings right for a strong, secure and sustainable economy that will benefit all Australians in the years to come. As Craig James, chief economist at CommSec, has said:


Overall, it is a smart budget, and a budget right for the times and challenges ahead. 


There is much talk about our economy today being resourced based—indeed, our resources industries do make a huge contribution to our national output—but, as the Treasurer pointed out in his post-budget speech to the National Press Club, this is as much an oversimplification as thinking Australia was just an agricultural economy during the last century. We are not simply a resource economy and the time of our manufacturers has not passed. Indeed, our manufacturers have innovated and moved with the times and they will continue to do so. 


I take the opportunity today to talk about one innovating manufacturing sector in my electorate: defence manufacturing, its importance to the region's economy and jobs and how this sector has been responsible for making or breaking the aspirations of several political candidates and in some cases political careers. It is worth spending some time going through a brief history of defence manufacturing in Bendigo. Seventy years ago the Commonwealth government announced plans to build a Commonwealth ordnance factory in north Bendigo to manufacture and refurbish heavy gun barrels for the Australian Navy, produce munitions and a range of other heavy engineering tasks for the war effort. Between 1942 and 1981, the factory not only manufactured and refurbished defence equipment for Australia's requirements but also completed several large export contracts including some for the United States navy. At its peak of operations the factory employed well in excess of a thousand people. 


The announcement in 1981 by then Treasurer Phillip Lynch that the Fraser government would sell or close the Commonwealth Ordnance Factory with a loss of hundreds of jobs produced an angry reaction in the Bendigo community. A study of the impact of the proposed closure on Bendigo's economy was undertaken and an intensive lobbying campaign got underway. In fact, three Bendigo councillors got together and nominated as legislative assembly candidates in the 1982 Victorian election on a cross-party 'Save the Commonwealth Ordnance Factory' ticket. The idea was that those electors who would normally vote Liberal but wanted to register a protest about the factory sale or closure could vote for Councillor Joe Pearce and direct their second preference to the Liberals, Labor voters could vote for Councillor Dick Turner and direct preferences to Labor and those supporting other parties could vote for Councillor Chris Stoltz and then preference one of the minor parties or candidates. In the event, sitting Liberal member Darrell McClure was dumped and Labor's official candidate, David Kennedy, who campaigned extensively on the Commonwealth Ordnance Factory issue, was elected.


The proposed closure claimed another political victim in the following year's federal election when sitting Liberal member and then Chief Government Whip John Bouchier was defeated by Labor's John Brumby. The future of the Commonwealth Ordnance Factory was once more a major issue in the local campaign.


In the late 1980s the Commonwealth government restructured several government owned defence manufacturers, including the Commonwealth Ordnance Factory and the Commonwealth Clothing Factory which had been manufacturing defence uniforms and combat clothing since 1912. In 1989, then Minister for Defence Kim Beazley announced that a new government owned entity, Australian Defence Industries or ADI, would bring these organisations together to create Australia's largest defence manufacturer.


Another reorganisation in 1992 saw ADI consolidate its defence clothing manufacturing operations in one location at McGoldrick Court in Bendigo. Three years later, this was established as a separate business and subsequently sold to the private sector and became Australian Defence Apparel. This company has a track record of innovation in the manufacture of combat clothing and associated equipment. It continues to operate today, producing high-value personal body armour as well as a range of military and combat uniforms, and currently employs about 300 people. 


The future of the remaining ADI operations was again an issue in the run-up to the 1996 federal election. The then Leader of the Opposition, John Howard, visited Bendigo and promised not to privatise ADI. He told a press conference, including the Bendigo Advertiser, on 14 February 1996, 'No, no and no; we have no plans to privatise ADI.' The coalition won the election and John Howard became Prime Minister on 2 March 1996. Bruce Reid, who had defeated Labor's John Brumby in the 1990 election, was re-elected as the federal member for Bendigo with an expectation that the government would keep its promise not to privatise ADI. In early 1997, the government selected ADI's Bushmaster protected mobility vehicle as a preferred option over the ASVS Taipan alternative. Then in February Liberal Minister for Defence, Ian McLachlan, announced the government's decision to fully privatise ADI, despite John Howard's campaign promise to Bendigo not to do so. The Howard government was re-elected in 1998, but I successfully defeated the new Liberal candidate for Bendigo, Max Turner—Bruce Reid having announced his decision to retire—with the ADI privatisations betrayal and the future of the Bushmaster contract among the main local issues. John Moore replaced Ian McLachlan as defence minister in 1998 and the following year the Howard government sold ADI to a fifty-fifty partnership comprising Transfield Australia and French company Thompsons-CSF, which is now Thales. 


In 1999, the first production contract for 370 Bushmasters was signed with ADI and the first Bushmasters to be used on operations, the two original prototype test vehicles affectionately known as B1 and B2, were deployed to East Timor. After Peter Reith replaced John Moore as defence minister in 2001, he received a recommendation from the Defence Materiel Organisation that the Bushmaster production contract should be cancelled. Sections of the defence department and senior military personnel had expressed strong doubts regarding the Bushmaster's suitability for the ADF. This ensured that the suitability of the Bushmaster and ADI would again be a major issue in the 2001 federal election campaign. The Howard government was re-elected, but I was successful in retaining Bendigo for Labor.


In March 2002, I led a deputation to new defence minister, Senator Robert Hill, to argue the case for retaining the Bushmaster contract for ADI. Four months later, Senator Hill, to his great credit, announced that the government would honour a revised Bushmaster contract with ADI, although the number of vehicles would be reduced from 370 to 299. The first production Bushmasters rolled off the assembly line at ADI Bendigo in 2003 and in 2006 Thales Australia acquired 100 per cent ownership of ADI and assumed full control of its operations. The company restructured and Thales specialist vehicles were created at the Bendigo factory. By this time, more Bushmasters had been deployed in East Timor, Iraq and Afghanistan, where again and again they demonstrated their superiority in saving the lives of Australian defence soldiers.


After succeeding Senator Hill as defence minister, Dr Brendan Nelson increased the contract with ADI for Bushmaster PMVs to a total of about 730 vehicles. This was about the time that the Australian Defence Force Land 121 Phase 3 vehicle acquisition program released specifications for several light, medium and heavy trucks including a number of armour protected vehicles. Twenty vehicles were initially assessed with a view to short listing the light to medium category down to three, but despite the Bushmaster's proven combat performance, a utility variant, then called the Copperhead, was not even included in the initial assessment process. Again, some senior defence personnel had expressed doubts on this vehicle's suitability.


Meanwhile, having seen the success of Bushmasters in Iraq and Afghanistan, the Netherlands Defence Force placed an initial order for 25 Bushmasters, which was subsequently increased to a total of 86 vehicles. This important export order was won despite a conspicuous lack of support from the Howard government for Thales' efforts to sell their world-beating products overseas. 


In the 2007 federal election, potential export markets for Thales protected mobility vehicles was a major issue in the Bendigo campaign. I retained the seat for Labor and the member for Hunter was sworn in as the new defence minister in the Rudd government. This was followed by further export success for the Bushmaster when the British defence force took delivery of 24 vehicles. 


In 2008 the new Labor government overhauled the troubled Land 121 Phase 3 program resulting in the Bushmaster single-cab utility vehicle finally being considered in a new round of initial assessments. Subsequently the Defence Materiel Organisation short-listed the Bushmaster utility, along with vehicles from Mercedes-Benz and MAN. We are still waiting for a final purchase recommendation, which has been expected from the DMO since last December. 


The ADF also needs to replace a significant part of its ageing Land Rover fleet and its Land 121 Phase 4 program will provide around 1,300 light protected mobility vehicles for this purpose. Defence minister Fitzgibbon announced in 2008 that Australia would commit about $40 million to participate in the US joint light tactical vehicle development program, with a view to buying a US vehicle to meet the ADF's light protected mobility vehicle requirements. The minister's statement also signalled an opportunity for Australia's defence manufacturing sector to compete in the light protected mobility vehicle program, and Thales developed the Hawkei prototype for this category. However, during private briefings on Land 121 Phase 4 from senior DMO personnel in 2009, I was told that they did not believe Thales were capable of producing a light protected mobility vehicle. Senator John Faulkner replaced the member for Hunter as Minister for Defence later that year and a separate Minister for Defence Materiel, the member for Charlton, was appointed. 


In May last year Mr Combet announced funding for three Australian manufactured light protected mobility vehicles to compete against the US JLTV. Thales, Force Protection and General Dynamics each received funding of up to $9 million to develop prototypes. Thales's Hawkei is the only Australian designed and manufactured vehicle involved. We have also learned from the US documents made public by WikiLeaks last year that US diplomats have been pressuring Australian officials to abandon our defence manufacturing sector and purchase products exclusively from the United States. 


In the narrow re-election of the Gillard government in 2010, I was returned as the member for Bendigo, the member for Perth replaced Senator Faulkner as the Minister for Defence and the member for Blaxland became Minister for Defence Materiel. In February this year Thales delivered two Hawkei prototypes for an intensive test and appraisal process to select an Australian light protected mobility vehicle to compete with the successful US JLTV vehicle. A decision on this is anticipated within two years. 


The people of Bendigo continue to support the city's defence industries. In April, about 300 people attended a rally to demonstrate that support. Since then, the defence minister has announced an order for another 101 Bushmaster PMVs for the Australian Army. Today, Thales is part of Bendigo's progressive and innovative defence industry—one that also includes protective clothing manufacturer Australian Defence Apparel and the Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organisation. Bendigo's defence industries employ more than 800 people and the jobs supported by the ADA and Thales operations alone represent approximately 18 per cent of Bendigo's total employment in manufacturing. It is one of the key sectors of Bendigo's economy. The annual direct output generated by the defence industry in Bendigo is estimated at more than $490 million and, including the flow-on effects to other sectors, the industry's total contribution to the local economy is estimated to be around $760 million a year. 


I have tried to demonstrate today that Australia has a world-class, innovative manufacturing capability in protected mobility vehicles and armoured protective clothing. I believe it is in our national interest that this should be retained and supported—and this is a regionally-based industry that contributes significantly to the economy of central Victoria. As I have also shown, we do not always make it easy for our domestic manufacturers to deliver the world-class products they are capable of producing. The saga I have recounted of Thales and its Bushmaster vehicle program is one of delay, prevarication and uncertainty, and it has claimed more than one political scalp along the way. If we are serious about encouraging our manufacturers in this country, we must walk the walk and not just talk the talk. We must do better. Government can do much to support local manufacturing through its various acquisition programs without making compromises on the quality of its purchases. This year's budget includes several measures that continue this government's support for local industries to innovate and compete in world markets. I commend the budget to the House.

"Billson, Bruce, MP",LP,2011-05-30,"



Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (16:54):  The budget Appropriation Bill (No.1) 2011-2012 and related bills were largely built on a speech full of misrepresentations, make-believe and an incredible dose of optimism when the Treasurer introduced them on budget night. Labor proclaims this budget for what it might do not in this financial year, and not in the next financial year, but in the year after that—that is the key selling point of this budget. We seem to have moved into a bit of a time warp where we have chosen to ignore the budgets and the fiscal position in the intervening period and are not talking about this financial year or the next but the one after. There is a suggestion that at that time Labor will deliver something it probably would not know if it saw it, and that is a budget surplus.


I say make-believe is at the heart of this budget because, when you look at the assumptions that underpin it, we need to take into account a number of things. The Gillard government is counting on record high terms of trade staying that way and at worst being diminished by four per cent, a fairly minor adjustment, but apparently the Gillard government believes these incredible terms of trade, probably the best in 150 years, will not change by more than four per cent.


Secondly, it then talks about some Herculean projections in revenue. If you look at the GST figures, for instance, there is an enormous growth in the revenue that that is supposed to bring in. There are also some assumptions embedded in it about what the mining tax will bring to this budget even though the mining tax has not been finalised and many commentators are suggesting the concessions or negotiations that Prime Minister Gillard engaged in will see the biggest three mining companies likely to be paying less tax than they are now because of changes in the way assets will be valued and offsets in terms of state-based royalty changes.


There is also something that cannot speak its name in this budget, and that is the carbon tax, one of the most substantial impacts on the Australian economy and on the Australian community, a new tax that comes in at exactly the same time as the mining tax. Albeit not well argued and not well analysed in the budget, the mining tax is at least there. But the carbon tax is not. Then you go behind those figures even further and you realise the slender surplus that the Gillard Labor government believes it will produce not this year, not next year but the year after—a slender surplus that is less than most of the adjustments in the budgets over recent years, but apparently we are supposed to believe that in these out years those assumptions will be right—is built on bracket creep. There are no tax cuts to adjust the threshold rates at which income tax is paid. So you will see Australians who are fortunate enough to gain an increase in their income increasingly moving into higher tax brackets. There are not even tax cuts in this budget that maintain people's tax liability; as their income goes up they are going to sneak into higher brackets and pay higher income tax because of it. But on the flipside, in terms of family allowances and the like, you see a number of those benefits also now getting into this budget benefit through bracket creep category where, as their incomes move and those thresholds stay frozen, people will increasingly move out of those areas of eligibility. So it is a piece of fiction. This budget would be in the fiction section of most public libraries but, alas, we are here to discuss it.


But there is one moment of disclosure and that is the disclosure, I think in Budget Paper No 2, where there is finally an admission that the debt ceiling that the government has had to operate under will need to be increased. You might recall that when Labor was elected the debt ceiling captured by the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act, if I recall correctly, was around $75 billion. It was pushed out to some $200 billion as part of the government's response to the global financial crisis. It was pushed out there with an assumption that the government would need to account for its actions to move out to that higher figure to prove that there were some special considerations that justified that increase. Now not only are we faced with a request to push that $200 billion debt cap out to a quarter of a trillion dollars, $250 billion, but now the government wants to have no requirement on it to explain and to justify its actions to increase the debt to $250 billion. 


Why this is important is that, long after the electorate is able to cast its judgment on the Gillard Labor government and whatever that judgment may be, some of the legacies of its actions will still be with us in terms of the debt that we will all need to pay—not only service but hopefully repay at a subsequent date when the coalition is elected down the track, but we will all be paying for it. It is perfectly reasonable that, if the Gillard government wants to max out the Visa card limit of the Commonwealth, it should account for its actions. That is why the coalition's amendments are very worthy of support. We have said that we are not declining to give the bill a second reading but the government deserves to be condemned for incorporating in the bill this plan to push its government borrowing limits above $200 billion, and that we should recognise that a special case must be made for such a significant increase in borrowings and that the government must explain any special circumstances that it feels justify taking our debt above $200 billion. The parliament needs to be given the opportunity to hear the government's case. If the government is so convinced there is a need to blow out Commonwealth debt above $200 billion then the requirement to justify that action is perfectly reasonable. There may well be a good reason, but where is the accountability and transparency in this Australian parliament where the Labor government thinks it can simply run over the top of a $200 billion debt limit feeling no need to justify its actions to the Australian public?


The debt binge that the government is on is just one of a number of challenges that my community, my electorate, and also the constituency that I represent as the shadow small business minister are facing. It is little wonder that small businesses are struggling to get access to finance, when there is a gorilla in the room devouring financial resources at such a huge rate, as evidenced by the blow-out in the government debt for this year, next year and, I would dare suggest, for many years to come. But that is just one of a number of challenges the small business community faces that the government has not faced up to in this budget. The government has failed to address any of the major and compelling concerns and challenges faced by the engine room of our economy. In fact it seems almost an environmental initiative that the government is trying to take a couple of cylinders out of the engine room of our economy as some kind of response to climate change. 


It is quite bizarre. The key challenges that the small business community face do not even crack it for a mention in this budget. Instead, there are a number of tricks where the government is suggesting it is doing good things by the small business and family enterprises of Australia but where they are actually being serviced by harmful measures that the government is not that keen to talk about. Earlier speakers have talked about the impact of FBT changes and what they would mean for a small business that might provide a delivery van or a work vehicle for their employees. There is also the issue of the instant write-off. The government seems to proclaim that as a great win for small businesses, that somehow there will be a cash flow benefit. But they have failed to mention that to get the benefit, in the example cited by the Treasurer, for an end-of-year tax benefit—not this financial year but next, probably payable in October 2013 or somewhere in that order—of $1,275 you need to spend $34,000. In terms of cash flow analysis, that is a hell of a lot of lolly—$34,000 to get $1,275 back. But it is the only good thing that the government thinks it can cite in this budget.


You dig a little bit deeper and you wonder: how is this being financed? The courage of the Gillard Labor government is to take on 400,000 of our smallest businesses. By scrapping the entrepreneurs tax offset, they are ripping out of 400,000 of Australia's smallest businesses and self-employed an incentive to provide for their own wellbeing and to provide opportunities for others. This measure was introduced by the Howard government to give support and encouragement to those people prepared to invest in their potential to support their own livelihood, to nurture a business, to grow opportunities in this country. If you think that is a terrible thing to do, it was quite remarkable last week when Canberra based Labor MP, Andrew Leigh, had a spray at those who were actually benefiting from the entrepreneurs tax offset. Rather than face up to the over 400,000 small and microbusinesses scattered right across Australia, who see this modest incentive as some encouragement to provide for their own requirements and to provide their own employment and economic opportunities, Mr Leigh had a spray at them, suggesting that people are deliberately organising themselves and rejecting 'market opportunities which might be present' solely to claim the ETO benefit he describes as 'a fairly low level of assistance'. So what is he saying? Is he saying that for a 25 per cent discount on taxable income people would turn their back on an opportunity to grow their business? He went on to decry the fact that the average payment being made was less than $500 and that 70 per cent of those claiming it were getting less than $600 back. Looking at the standard tax table and allowing for a tax-free threshold, the average person claiming the entrepreneurs tax offset—which, according to Labor's own figures, is around $500 in benefit—is earning about $420 a week. These people are earning less than $22,000 a year as entrepreneurs in their own right through self-employment, and this Labor government wants to take a modest incentive off them to somehow fund a dodgy cash benefit where you spend $34,000 to get $1,275 back. 


What is this about? The people being criticised by the Labor Party are earning under $22,000 a year and they get a modest benefit for that. Mr Leigh goes on to say that 70 per cent of the claims are for less than $600. According to the standard tax table and allowing for the tax-free threshold, do you know how much they are earning? It is $466 a week. Their grand income is under $25,000 a year, and they are getting slugged with extra tax by this Labor government, which claims to have some passing interest in small business. Well, it does not. Labor has never understood small business and never bothered to understand the challenges that the small business community face. It was bad enough when Kevin Rudd was Prime Minister, but at least there was apathy. Now it is downright adversarial.


What the small business community needs is an advocate and an ally. Since the election of the Labor government, 300,000 jobs have been lost in the small business community and 25,000 small businesses no longer exist. When the government boasts about the jobs it is creating, it is not boasting about jobs being created in small business and family enterprises. These are the economies of outer metropolitan and rural communities that do not have the luxury of a CBD or a mine. This is what drives the livelihoods and opportunities across Australia and they are being done over, day in and day out, by this government.


But it gets worse. The Prime Minister has the gall to go out there saying that you must value the working capability of every Australian. Well, apparently not. Apparently you only value people who receive a pay cheque. Why would you go after them with this enterprise tax offset? Why would you wipe that out? It is because they are self-employed. They are not receiving a pay cheque; they are trying to earn their own and perhaps create pay cheques for others.


But it gets worse. The opposition and those two million people who derive their livelihoods from self-employment were very concerned about secret meetings between the union movement and the Gillard Labor government, the ones that were denied and then admitted to. Nick Sherry had a very awkward time in the Senate explaining these meetings that everyone else seemed to know about but he said did not happen. This coordinated, multipronged assault on legitimate contracting and self-employed arrangements had another weapon added to it out of this budget. This is now a new weapon. It was not enough to send out the Fair Work Ombudsman to get stuck into self-employed independent contractors. It was not enough to send the tax office out after these people with no evidence that there was a need to have such a jihad against them as has been unleashed by this Gillard government. It was not enough to send the Australian Building and Construction Commissioner out after them. That was not enough. Do you know what is out there now? Under this budget, the Labor government wants those people who are engaging contractors to now be involved in this web of making sure nobody is self-employed and that everyone is forced into a traditional employee-employer relationship where the union movement has what it believes is a controlling stake and a controlling interest.


When is enough enough? When are you going to let independent contractors and self-employed people actually have a fair go? Every day there is a new attack on them. Why? It is because they do not fit in this neat little unionist view that everyone receives a pay cheque. These people are earning their incomes through hard work. They do not have the comfort of being able to turn to an employer and say, 'Hey, things are a bit tough, but that is okay; you can cover me for a few more weeks until things pick up.' These people do not become unemployed; they just do not have enough work. As the government talk around participation in our economy, do they not realise that self-employment is a legitimate way for people either returning to the workforce after periods out or maybe contemplating retirement trying to juggle their working arrangements? Being an independent contractor and self-employed is as legitimate as any other way of earning a livelihood in this country, but you would not know it.


Assistant Treasurer Bill Shorten came out with another press release today somehow suggesting, 'It will not be a problem for any honest contractors; we will just throw a bit more red tape and compliance obligations at them.' You stalk people and harass them out of a legitimate career and employment trajectory, and those people who dare engage contractors because it supports their entire workforce— (Time expired)

"Parke, Melissa, MP",ALP,2011-05-30,"



Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (17:08):  I welcome the Gillard government's disciplined and responsible 2011-12 budget, and I congratulate the Treasurer and his department and staff. This budget delivers the fiscal settings and savings that will keep a lid on inflation and return Australia to surplus in 2012-13 while delivering an historic and comprehensive mental healthcare program and investing further in jobs training and in renewable energy.


That combination of fiscal prudence, hard-won savings and forward-looking investments is, in a nutshell, the hallmark of our government, which has delivered the following significant achievements. It has put in place a response to the global financial crisis that has seen Australia outperform other developed countries. It has reduced unemployment and maintained low inflation growth against the background of the worst crisis since the Great Depression and following a summer of unprecedented natural disasters. It has made the largest investment in schools and the largest single lift in payments to pensioners. It continues on the path to increasing our foreign aid commitment to 0.5 per cent of GNI by 2015-16.


This budget makes a historic $2.2 billion investment in mental health services. This government has been prepared to make very difficult decisions, such as introducing a carbon price to the economy and adopting world-first plain packaging for cigarettes, often at some political cost, so that Australia benefits now and in the long term.


The budget includes $22 billion in savings by achieving efficiencies in the delivery of government services and by continuing Labor's program of identifying unnecessary and unproductive churn in our tax and payment assistance framework in order to ensure that government payments and concessions are made only when they are for genuine assistance. That is the responsible thing to do and it is the only way to ensure fairness in the system. By creating savings we will not only improve the bottom line but also make possible key investments in critical policy areas and better support for those who need it most.


Despite the strength of the resources sector in WA, there are many people in the Fremantle electorate who are not benefiting from the boom and who, instead, are facing rising costs in the form of state government electricity charges and the rent impact of a severe housing shortage. This is especially true for those on low and fixed incomes. In recognising the patchwork nature of the economy, and also by bringing forward the low-income tax offset, this budget provides $772 million of increased family tax benefits to support parents with dependent teenagers aged 16 to 19 in full-time study.


In addition to the record pension payment increases, made since 2009, which have seen the maximum pension rate increase by $128 per fortnight for singles and by $116 for couples, this budget now expands the work bonus for pensioners, which will come into operation from 1 July. This change follows the same philosophy that drives the government's efforts to support and encourage greater work participation across the board. Those words 'support' and 'encourage' are important, because the approach of this government is to ensure that (1) the system provides incentives for people to move from welfare to work and (2) the education and training and job support framework can enable that transition.


This budget does both of those things. As I have just mentioned, the pensioner work bonus changes mean that older Australians can now work more before suffering a reduction in their pension payments. The government will also be providing $95 million in wage assistance to reward employees who provide work to persons, including older workers over the age of 50, defined as 'long-term unemployed'. In terms of supporting work readiness, the budget introduces the Building Australia's Future Workforce package, whose initiatives include $558 million to deliver around 130,000 appropriately tailored training places; $200 million in assistance to apprentices; and $1.75 billion in partnership with the states and territories for necessary reform of the vocational education and training system. This investment is a distinctly Labor project and it will be particularly welcome in my electorate, which includes areas that have higher than average youth unemployment and therefore presents a clear need to equip young Australians with the skills and qualities that allow them to take advantage of jobs that the Western Australian economy is generating.


Of course, the Building Australia's Future Workforce package follows from earlier steps taken by the government in this area, such as the funding of the Trade Training Centres in Schools. In March this year the community cabinet came to Fremantle. It was hosted at South Fremantle Senior High School, which will be the site of a new $4.3 million maritime trades training centre. Just two weeks ago I accompanied the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, Peter Garrett, on a site visit to the new training centre. These are the kinds of substantial training and education ventures that will be the foundation of jobs and productive lives for the next generation of Western Australians.


From a Fremantle perspective this budget addresses a number of issues that have been prominent in my community, and I want to touch on some of those. Mental health reform is the best example of this government's steady progress in tackling overdue and big picture reform. Indeed, there were few larger issues in 2010 than the need for a dramatic shift in the way that mental health care is provided and funded in Australia. It is an issue that I have been engaged in for a long time, not least because acute mental health care is provided through the Alma Street Clinic of Fremantle Hospital and so there is a focus in the Fremantle area on people receiving that care. For too long, mental health care has been the poor cousin within the health services framework and for too long mental health has been poorly understood and inaccurately perceived by the general community. Change has been occurring and I want to acknowledge the courage of ordinary Australians and of prominent people who have come forward and been open about their own mental health challenges, including in this place the member for Goldstein. When people realise that depression or anxiety is an illness and when people realise that it comes out of nowhere to affect footballers, bricklayers, lawyers, musicians, teenagers and politicians and when people realise that it can be treated and that it does not have to be a barrier to participation in life or a barrier to performance at a high level then we will have achieved a cultural shift that allows us to approach this area of health openly and without stigma. 


On the night of the Candidates Forum that was held in Fremantle during the 2010 campaign, a candlelight vigil was held to demonstrate the strong desire in the community to see a new and effective commitment to mental health care in Australia. It is no surprise then that the government's historic $2.2 billion mental healthcare package has been well received. I have had a number of emails in the last three weeks welcoming the introduction of short- and long-term measures, including the $433 million for suicide prevention, the $492 million for early intervention when it comes to children and young people who experience or who are at risk of mental illness and the $200 million to support mental health programs for those who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. 


I recently accompanied the Minister for Social Housing and Homelessness, Senator Arbib, to St Pat's crisis care centre in Fremantle, where this funding was warmly welcomed. Those who work day in, day out with the homeless, like my friends at St Pat's, are only too aware that mental illness is both a cause and a consequence of homelessness. When the first annual Gimme Shelter concert in Fremantle was being planned five years ago, it was a clear objective of the concert to raise funds and awareness not only for homelessness but also for mental illness. It is fantastic that the federal government has also recognised this link in the budget and provided serious money towards assisting the many Australians struggling with the dual difficulties of homelessness and mental illness. 


To drive the long-term reform in this area, the budget provides new funding of $12 million to a total commitment of $32 million over five years for the creation of an independent National Mental Health Commission, which will provide accountability and transparency as well as contributing analysis and direction in the development of the Ten Year Roadmap for ongoing mental health reform. The commitment to increase the national network of headspace centres to 90 has been particularly welcome. Fremantle was fortunate to have one of the first such centres established and it has proved its worth from the moment it became operational. 


At a time when the cohort of senior Australians as a proportion of the population as a whole is set to increase markedly, I am a big supporter of initiatives that give effective support and resources to assist elderly people who wish to continue to live independently. As I have said before, wherever this is possible I think this is actually the natural preference of most people and most families and it is also a scenario in which the load on the residential aged care system can be reduced. For those reasons I am delighted that this budget brings with it new increases to Home and Community Care, or HACC, program funding. The latest allocation of $9 million in funding to WA brings the total 2010-11 WA funding to more than $212 million, underwriting services that benefit 66,000 Western Australians or nearly three per cent of the population. Eight providers in the Fremantle electorate are among more than 270 organisations that deliver HACC services. In addition to the extra $396,000 in recurrent funding, four Fremantle providers will also receive one-off funding for new capital including Neighbourhood Link in East Fremantle, which will receive nearly $140,000 for a new bus; Melville CARES, which will receive $40,000 for IT equipment; and, the Villa Dalmacia Social Centre, which will receive $15,000 for vehicle modifications. In each of these cases and through the boost to recurrent funding, this Labor government is making an investment in the wellbeing of elderly Australians and in the peace of mind of their families, while at the same time alleviating the pressure on residential aged care. 


That effort to help those who want to live at home has a parallel in the budget with the $72 million Healthy Communities Initiative, which supports local governments who run programs that encourage healthier lifestyles and therefore deliver important preventive health outcomes. Once again, this is funding that provides direct benefits to individuals but also reduces the likely future impact of illness and disease that result from unhealthy diet and lifestyle choices. In my electorate, the City of Cockburn was one of four local governments in Western Australia and the only one in the metropolitan area selected under this program. It will receive $700,000 for its Co-Health Lifestyle Project, which is aimed at those not working full time and at risk of poor health outcomes. It also includes some targeted nutritional education for Indigenous and Torres Strait Islander Australians. The Minister for Health and Ageing, Nicola Roxon, made this welcome announcement at the Cockburn seniors club in my electorate two weeks ago. As noted by the Mayor of Cockburn, Logan Howlett, at the event, the Healthy Communities initiative also complements extremely well the existing projects encouraging healthy lifestyles that are underway in the city of Cockburn and to which the federal government has provided generous assistance, including the Coogee Beach Surf Life Saving Club, the GP superclinic and the Bibra Lake wetlands education centre precinct.


In terms of big picture infrastructure, I am very pleased that the budget provides further support for rail freight into the port of Fremantle. As part of the government's $350 million contribution to the Perth urban transport and freight corridor upgrade project, we are providing funding to the development of the Kewdale Intermodal Rail Supply Chain, and that includes a $27 million contribution to a rail-passing loop near Fremantle port and works comprising stage 2 of the North Quay rail terminal. The project will provide intermodal freight services for the receipt of interstate and intrastate containerised and bulk freight and international and interstate containerised sea freight.


That is the direction we need to go in. By increasing rail and coastal sea freight, and by supporting better freight coordination through the Kewdale intermodal facility, we will see a road freight impact reduction by volume of total freight. More trucks and more and bigger roads for those trucks cannot be the answer to our freight challenge. I am glad that this government is keen to work in partnership with the WA government when it comes to new rail infrastructure and to better roads and freight management yet, quite sensibly, continues to have absolutely no interest in funding the outdated folly that is Roe Highway stage 8.


In conclusion, this budget is a no-nonsense, practically oriented and rigorous blueprint for economic stability, responsible savings and necessary investment in the things that matter for Australia's future—namely, education and training, health service capacity, economic infrastructure and renewable energy. It is marked as a Labor budget by its fairness; its social responsibility, when it comes to protecting and assisting vulnerable people in our community; and its willingness to undertake difficult reform, including reform to Australia's tax and payment assistance framework.

"Christensen, George, MP",Nats,2011-05-30,"



Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson) (17:21):  I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No.1) 2011-2012 and cognate bills and to condemn the lost opportunities that this budget represents. This is indeed a budget that has a bark that is worse than its bite. Madam Deputy Speaker, two weeks ago, you might remember, the hounds were out howling at the moon before this budget was delivered, howling about how tough things had to be and howling about how tough measures would be taken to bring the budget back into surplus. But what was the result come budget night? An utter disappointment and a disgraceful waste of opportunity.


This budget does not cut back on spending. On the contrary, the budget actually increases spending, ramping up government expenses from $351 billion to $368 billion. That is no way to go about returning a budget to surplus. If that is the government's plan, then it is a dog of a plan. That is not surprising as it comes from a dog of a government delivering a dog of a budget. It beggars belief that a government purporting to have the ability to bring a budget back to surplus would start by increasing spending. You do not have to have a high-school education to recognise the fundamental flaw in that plan, and Labor wonders why the public thinks it has no economic credentials.


If this government thinks spending more money is a tough budget that can deliver a surplus, then it is not smarter than a fifth grader. But increased expenditure alone is not why this is a dog of a budget. The real issue that Australian families find unpalatable is the reckless waste they are witnessing from the current government. Far from tightening its belt, this government has employed an additional 24,000 public servants since it took power in 2007. That is a bitter pill to swallow for people in my electorate of Dawson, many of them living in regional towns with an entire population less than that.


We now have 1,027 public servants in the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency alone. This is a department that has proved to be a total failure. It has failed its first priority for 2010-11, which is spelt out in its corporate plan. It is, 'Delivery of the government's election commitments.' That is not just a fail; that is a fail of epic proportions. The government's pre-election commitment was that there would be no carbon tax. The Prime Minister said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' That was her election commitment, and yet we have 1,027 public servants there in the Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency beavering away to achieve the polar opposite of that election commitment, trying to sell a lie to the Australian public. It is now time for the Minister for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency to amend his department's corporate plan so that he can at least say that 1,027 public servants paid by the Australian taxpayer are achieving the election commitments of the one Greens MP in the House of Representatives.


It is the same Australian public money that is going to pay for the scandalous excesses of this government, like exorbitantly priced set-top boxes for pensioners, valued at $400 each. Even the pensioners recognise what a contemptible waste of money that program represents. Those who have already purchased a set-top box for themselves tell me that they would just like to be reimbursed the $50 that it actually cost them. I have listened with interest to various members of the government, particularly the member for Kingston, yelping that the coalition members keep talking about these set-top boxes. I say: get used to it, because that is what the general public is talking about.


How can this government look the public in the eye and say to them, 'We're paying $400 of your money for something that is worth $50'? How can this government look the public in the eye and tell them, 'We're increasing our offshore asylum seekers spend by an extra $1.7 billion of your money so that we can swap one of our illegal immigrants for five of Malaysia's'? These are not the actions of a government capable of a budget surplus. These are the actions of a government with an atrocious record of debt and deficit. Australian families who are struggling to meet spiralling cost-of-living expenses cannot even comprehend the sheer magnitude of the debt that this government is racking up. How can the average family comprehend interest payments of $135 million every day? The average family cannot even comprehend just how much money that is, let alone the thought of borrowing that much on a daily basis to service debt incurred by a government addicted to spending—$135 million a day, and every single taxpayer will have to pay that debt back.


It is also interesting to hear the government speakers yelping about how the coalition have not produced a detailed budget on how we would do things. The answer to that probably should be a bit obvious: fixing the Labor-Greens debacle is a moving feast because the mess gets bigger each day, $135 million a day bigger, and that is if they stop making bad decisions today. But debt and deficit are to be expected from this lot in the long run. This dog of a government is a mongrel breed with a big Labor streak, a Labor streak that has no form on the board for economic competency, just a track record of reckless spending and reckless taxing. And added to this mix now are the Greens, whose barren economic understanding is limited to the cost of a pair of sandals and whose economic answer to alarmist bleatings about climate change is to close down all the coalmines in Australia.


This government is a pack of strays with no legitimacy, no direction and no leadership, an illegitimate government that has sold its soul and the soul of the Australian taxpayer in a desperate grab for power. The price the Australian people have to pay for the grubby deals that are so far apparent is blatant pork-barrelling in the extreme to woo the Independents, reckless pokies legislation that will destroy clubs and the communities that depend on them and, of course, the biggest tax with no mandate to ever be thrust on Australian families. This is a sign of a weak government, a dog of a government with not one but many different leaders, these multiple leaders all leading the pack astray, all pulling in different directions and pushing the government from one extreme to the other.


One of this government's leaders, Senator Bob Brown, is leading the pack off to investigate this rotting carcass of a carbon tax that no-one wants to touch, but now it is one in, all in. They are all feeding on that same rotting carcass because that is the only way they can stay in office. And the country is forced to follow, even though everyone knows it is a rotting carcass. Industry can smell that it is rotten, business can smell that it is rotten, and families can smell that it is rotten. Even the government recognises how rotten it is, by not including the carbon tax in its budget. The majority of this pack is too embarrassed for the public to see where it is going to be led. The mining tax legislation has not been introduced into parliament, yet it is in this budget. How can this government pretend the carbon tax is not part of the nation's economy in the next four years when it will have far-reaching, damaging consequences for every single person, every single family and every single business in this nation?


This dog of a government is embarrassed because it knows it has no mandate to introduce a carbon tax. On the contrary, as I said, the Prime Minister has a mandate for there to be no carbon tax under the government she leads. Even the taxpayer funded Climate Commission cannot sell this tax to families, who will have to pay for it, because those families are not stupid. They understand the Climate Commission is just a taxpayer funded advertising scheme for a bad tax. They understand that the commission was never going to provide advice or a report that did not support the government's carbon tax decision that has already been made, that was made in a backroom deal to get the Greens on board to form government. 


We have been given thousands of doomsday predictions and not one of them has come to pass. Even a couple of weeks ago the world was supposed to end. The world did not end, and we did not have aeroplanes dropping out of the sky or nuclear weapons launching themselves with the Y2K bug. The world did not end in an ice age as they predicted back in the 1970s. Forty years ago science, as reported in Time magazine in June 1974, was of the opinion that global cooling that had been experienced for more than three decades was a sign of an impending ice age. 


We do not need scientists to tell us that the climate is changing. The climate is always changing and always has changed. But that is not to say we should not cut pollution or develop alternative energy. And everyday families know that the best way to cut pollution is to do something about it. They know that investing in new technology will cut pollution. They know that taxing every man, woman and child in Australia is not the way to cool the planet. Families in my electorate of Dawson know that if Climate Commissioner Tim Flannery's wild predictions of people having to row a boat down the main street of Mackay to get to work were true—that is what he said—then getting slugged an extra $300 on their electricity bill would not make one scrap of difference. 


The Greens, who have a single member in the House of Representatives, seem to be the majority shareholder of the leadership of this government through Senator Bob Brown. The extent to which the Greens are willing to hold this government to ransom is a frightening proposition for the Australian economy and the families who depend on it. Not happy with the mining tax to bleed our biggest industry dry, the Greens have insisted on this carbon tax, so bad that the Labor streak in this government are too embarrassed to show it in public and put it in their budget. But, as if that is not enough to kill the golden goose, they have insisted on including in this budget an amendment to the fringe benefits tax that will see hardworking miners pay $8,000 a year for the privilege of going to work. Under these changes, someone who works in the mining industry and who leases a $65,000 vehicle for the long drives to and from work, racking up more than 40,000 kilometres a year, will be taxed at 20 per cent instead of seven per cent FBT. That means the FBT payable for that vehicle, which is used to get them to and from work and around the work site, will increase from $4,550 to $13,000. But it will not just apply to mineworkers and the industries servicing the mines; it will also apply to regional farmers and even sales representatives forced to travel enormous distances just to provide for their families. It would appear this government has some kind of visceral hatred for people who are working hard and having a go, especially if they live in rural Australia and even more especially if they have the misfortune to work in the mining industry that is propping this country up. 


The extremist Greens, and the Labor government that panders to their extremist views, will continue to kill off industry, to kill off opportunity and to kill off the hopes and dreams of families until the Australian people have the opportunity to stop them. They will continue to rip the heart out of our way of life and our future in the interests of a few—the few scruffy tails wagging this dog of a government. While this budget delivers further blows to the cost-of-living pressures on everyday families, it makes a deceitful attempt to look like it gives more than it takes. 


Last year prior to the election we identified the need for urgent action on mental health in Mackay. The Mackay region has an unacceptably high rate of youth suicide. There is a very good solution to this problem. It is called headspace. Headspace mental health centres have proved to be successful in terms of curbing youth suicide. The coalition made an election commitment to the people of Mackay that we would provide a headspace centre for the region if we formed government. We did not, but we still intend to work hard to get this Labor government to match that commitment. It is unacceptable that an area of such need is ignored in the latest rollout of new headspace centres. We had a petition circulating in Mackay that got 4,000 signatures in six short weeks. It was with great expectation that people who worked so hard to highlight this issue watched the delivery of the budget, and expectation was heightened with the leaks of a big investment in mental health. However, it was a little off the mark—$700 million of the mental health package was re-announcing previously committed funds. But there was a glimmer of hope: $197 million and 30 new headspace centres. But, on closer scrutiny, only seven per cent of the funds will be provided in the next financial year and more than 80 per cent does not kick in until after the next election. In an act of high deception, this yellow dog of a government pushed $65 million of that $197 million out to a period of five years from now. Flying in the face of a standard four-year budget estimate, the government included a third of the package in 2015-16. If Professor Flannery is right, we will all be rowing boats down the main street of Mackay before that promise ever comes to fruition. In addition to that are $580 million in cuts to mental health programs coordinated by GPs. On Friday, I was informed that psychologists have been sacked, in the mess that is now the coordination of federally funded health services in Mackay. One wonders whether this is the result of those cuts.


This is a government that must accept the fact that if you lie down with dogs you will get fleas. It is a flea-bitten government that needs to go to an election, and the most humane thing to do is to let the people put this dog of a government down before it is too late.

"Adams, Dick, MP",ALP,2011-05-30,"



Mr ADAMS
 (Lyons) (17:36):  We just heard some comments about mental health. These appropriation bills before the House certainly deal with mental health. Record numbers of Australians are receiving mental health treatment, according to an evaluation released today. There are certainly still some groups who are not accessing the services that they need, so there is more work to do. While treatment rates for people with mental health disorders such as anxiety and depression have improved from 35 per cent in 2007 to an estimated 46 per cent in 2010, many young people, men, people living in rural and remote areas and people in areas of high socioeconomic disadvantage are still missing out. 


The honourable member for Dawson says that his seat is missing out on headspace services and other things. Maybe it is him; maybe he is not working hard enough to generate the activity needed to get those resources in his area, or maybe he cannot put the figures together. I do not know. But people with mental health issues are entitled to services and this government has put money into this budget to deliver those services. Let's not talk about dogs and fleas; let's talk about what is happening. What are the opposition proposing? They have not produced a budget; they have just ranted and raved. The shadow Treasurer has failed to produce an alternative budget—once in the House and once at the Press Club. They just will not say what they would do to spend budgetary moneys.


An evaluation of the Better Access to Psychiatrists, Psychologists and General Practitioners through the Medicare Benefits Schedule initiative was released today by the minister. Better Access provides Medicare rebates for mental health services. The evaluation was commissioned by the Department of Health and Ageing in 2008 and was overseen by experts in the mental health and research fields. The evaluation found that from 2007 to 2009 over two million people received more than 11.1 million individual mental health services. Around half of all Better Access consumers may be new not only to Better Access but to mental health care more generally. 


The initiative provided value for money for those it reached and consumers experienced clinically significant reductions in levels of psychological stress and severe symptoms upon completing the treatment. Investment in Better Access has been $1.45 billion from 2006-07 to 2009-10. The evaluation findings are encouraging, especially on access and improvements in treatment rates for common mental disorders. They also point to some areas of particular concern that echoes the feedback received from the mental health forums held late last year. We still need to do more for those people who are continuing to miss out on much needed mental health care—men, young people and those people living in rural and remote areas, as the member for Dawson would know; as well as those in areas of low socioeconomic disadvantage. These people stand out in all the statistics I see and I am sure that you also see, Madam Deputy Speaker. 


It is also vital that we focus our efforts on getting the right care to the most vulnerable in our society, including those at greatest risk of suicide—young people, Indigenous Australians and those with severe and persistent conditions. The outlines in the budget certainly go in that direction. Mental health reform is a key priority of this Labor government in its second term. This is why the Prime Minister has asked the minister to establish an expert advisory group on mental health. The group has already started to provide ideas for real improvement in mental health services that are achievable and make best possible use of the government's resources. 


The Better Access evaluation is important to help inform the government's reform efforts and to ensure the balance of services across the spectrum of mental illness. The Gillard government is committed through its reform efforts to ensure that mental health services are coordinated, cost efficient and fundamentally targeted to those people most in need. 


In addition to Better Access, the government is investing $120.7 million between 2010 and 2014 in the Access to Allied Psychological Services, ATAPS, program, which delivers psychological services at low or no cost to patients and targets hard-to-reach groups. The government is also investing $64.2 million between 2010 and 2014 in mental health services in rural and remote areas under the Mental Health Services in Rural and Remote Areas program. 


There is also a program—the government's flexible care packages—for people with severe mental illness or illnesses. In the 2010-11 budget, $58.5 million was allocated in funding for flexible care packages to provide clinical and case coordination services to better support people with severe mental illness in the community, delivered through Medicare Locals. These are all new initiatives in this budget. Clinical services include psychological therapy provided by specially trained providers such as psychologists and social workers, who will be encouraged to link patients to other services in the community for people with severe illness. Flexible care packages will allow Medicare Locals to purchase the services people with a severe mental illness need to keep them well in the community and out of hospital. Consultations across the nation, including in regional areas, have been conducted on the design and implementation of these flexible care packages. More than 70 written submissions were received. These consultations have shown that there is strong support for the implementation of the flexible care packages, including from GPs, who are central to supporting and finding referral pathways to other services for their patients with a severe mental illness. There is also a desire to see them implemented in a considered and staged way, with a clear and consistent process to ensure appropriate targeting to people with severe illness and with support for a development phase to enable essential service links and quality assurance to be arranged at a local level, before services start to roll out.


The government has listened to the sector and based on the feedback received will implement the flexible care packages in a staged approach to coincide with the establishment of the first 15 Medicare Locals. From now until 1 July clinical governance, service delivery and quality assurance issues will be determined in consultation with relevant stakeholders. From 1 July, the first 15 Medicare Locals will become eligible for funding to provide additional services to consumers through flexible care packages. Work will also be done to ensure Medicare Locals are provided with funding for development and planning, before service delivery starts.


The roll-out of these flexible care packages demonstrates the government's commitment to ongoing mental health reform. The government will continue to work with the sector to deliver mental health reform and ensure the best delivery of services for people with a severe mental illness.


Many people will remember the service in my electorate of Lyons, Rural Alive and Well, which was set up during the terrible drought times to try and bring back some hope to many farmers who were in despair of losing their animals and their properties. This too falls into the area of mental health. These community-developed programs are vital for keeping an eye on the mental health of our farmers and rural workers, and make up the many approaches to deal with mental health problems that have emerged in recent years. There is a community-based approach, and this is taking place in areas such as forestry in Tasmania, with a lot of contractors and forest workers being laid off. There is a person dealing with those issues using a community-based approach, referring the people concerned to professional assistance if that is needed.


Mental health issues have offered a real challenge to many ordinary health services. I am sure there are many other instances around Australia where mental health have been put into the too-hard basket. It with a great relief that I see that the budget has been able to provide a priority weighting to mental health issues. This will allow the local health services to provide primary services that have links to referral services for those who have been touched with a mental illness. It gives me great joy to see so much emphasis being put on mental health in this most recent budget.


I would also like to touch on education. I continue to have the honour of opening BER projects in my electorate. I opened one on Friday in the historical township of Evandale. If you have flown into Launceston Airport, Evandale is the village at the end of the runway. It has spent, very well, a lot of money to improve the school, renewing the school hall and making it larger. Many classrooms and playground areas have been improved as well. I was at the opening at Oatlands District High School the week before that. The principal of Oatlands high school described the money that came through from the Commonwealth government as 'a fairytale'. She said it was like a fairytale that they received the money; they could do so many things that they wanted to do to the school. It has enhanced their program so much. That is a great thing to see happen, and, as I said, I am always honoured to do that. It is enhancing the educational opportunities for young people in Tasmania.


We have also had the opportunity in this budget to continue the flow of money to Tasmania for irrigation projects which are set to rejuvenate the farming community of Tasmania. The Whitemore scheme was opened earlier this month, with 40 kilometres of pipeline delivering about 5,500 megalitres over about 12,000 hectares. Of course, we will be going to the Midlands scheme very shortly. That will take a couple of years to get on stream as the biggest irrigation project in the electorate of Lyons, and that will revitalise and create a lot of economic activity that will enhance us into the future. This budget has been very good for Australia and very good for Tasmania, and I have a great deal of pleasure in supporting these bills through the parliament.

"Southcott, Dr Andrew, MP",LP,2011-05-30,"



Dr SOUTHCOTT
 (Boothby) (17:51):  What can we say? This is another Labor budget, another deficit budget, another budget which adds to growing government debt. Despite all the government's rhetoric, this was not a tough budget. It is a budget that has all of the wrong priorities for Australia. Constantly saying that it was a tough budget, constantly repeating those words to the public, will not make it true. The Prime Minister was right when she described it as a traditional Labor budget. It is. It is a budget with big deficit, big debt and more taxes. It is a traditional Labor budget. It is another deficit budget.


The Labor Party, incredibly, have not delivered a budget in surplus in the last 21 years. We even have a member of this House who has never seen a Labor budget surplus in his lifetime. The Labor Party have not delivered a budget surplus since the Hawke-Keating government did in 1989-90. It requires a special sort of genius to deliver four deficit budgets in a row during a time of a resources boom and during a time when the economy has been growing. The deficit for 2010-11 will be almost $50 billion. Net debt will now peak at $107 billion. What this country needs is a safe pair of hands guiding our nation's finances. The Treasurer has broken another record. We should give him a medal. He has managed to beat Keating's debt record of $96 billion in 1996. Debt will peak at $107 billion.


The coalition paid off Labor's debt last time and will pay it off again. This government is borrowing $135 million a day, and its interest alone will be $7 billion a year. The total interest paid on that debt over the next four years will be $26 billion. That is $26 billion we do not have to spend. How many hospitals could $26 billion have funded? How much infrastructure could have been bought for $26 billion? The worst part is that the carbon tax is not even included in this budget, so this budget is built on a false premise. The carbon tax is expected to add $11½ billion to household budgets, which is going to add further to pressure on the cost of living.


There are a couple of points in this budget that I want to focus on—first of all, the government's attempts to wind back the private health insurance rebate. In every one of the four budgets delivered by the Labor Party so far, they have attacked private health insurance and those who hold private health cover, and they are persisting with their plan to wind back private health insurance. The private health insurance rebate was originally introduced by the coalition government in 1999. Labor's proposals to means test the rebate has been twice rejected by the Senate and yet the government are introducing it again. They just cannot let this go. The Labor Party hate private health care. They are pursuing this as an ideological argument. They have not really thought about this at all. The importance of private health insurance is that it takes pressure off the public system. It provides people with choice but importantly it takes pressure off the public healthcare system. Within five years, this move will be budget negative and within five years it will be costing more than it saves. 


Recently, the Australian Health Insurance Association commissioned a report by Deloitte which shows that the cost due to increased public healthcare system demand will be $2.4 billion over the next four years. It is going to end up costing everyone. Private health insurance premiums are estimated to rise more than 10 per cent over and above the annual premium rises. This is on top of the 15 per cent, 30 per cent and 45 per cent cuts in the rebates for people on different incomes. In the electorate of Boothby more than 70,000 residents have private health insurance. More than 73 per cent of households in my electorate of Boothby hold private health insurance. This is a budget which is no good for them. This budget measure is an attack on every single one of those households.


Mental health is an important priority. It has been really good that mental health has been at the centre of the debate in federal parliament. That is in no small part due to the leadership shown by the Liberal Party on this issue. It was the $1.9 billion package announced in the 2006 budget when the Leader of the Opposition was the health minister which led to improvements in the way that GPs and psychologists were rewarded for spending time with their patients with mental health problems. And through Pat McGorry and John Mendoza, the opposition developed a very good mental health policy, which we took to the 2010 election. The Labor Party's policy at that election was appalling. They showed complete neglect of mental health. 


This is an issue where the Liberal and National parties have made the running. We have put up good ideas and the government have responded. But their mental health budget measures are really an illusion. It is like a lot of things with this government: it looks good but by the time you kick the tyres and have a look under the bonnet, you find out it is another lemon. When you look into the budget papers, you realise that what was described is not what you end up with.


In 2011-12, the Gillard government are providing $47.3 million in new funding for mental health. But, unfortunately, in that same year they are also cutting $62.8 million from existing mental health programs. In year 1, giving with one hand and pulling back with the other, there is actually a drop of $15½ million dollars in funding for mental health. This is hardly following through on the Prime Minister's promise that mental health would be a priority in their second term of government. Unfortunately, over the next four years of the forward estimates, after taking into account the budget cuts there is only $583 million in new money. It is nowhere near what was announced in the budget. The majority of their big spend on mental health is old money rebadged with a new name. It is about a third of what the coalition promised for the same period. Their truthful commitment is hardly the $2.2 billion dollar headline figure that the Minister for Health and Ageing has been putting about. The worst part is that the majority of the mental health funding is promised not now, not next year, but in five years time. This is towards the end of the next government's term. The coalition committed $1.5 billion at the 2010 election, and we announced another $430 million more recently.


There is another aspect of the funding for mental health which I think is very short-sighted. These are cuts to general practitioner funding for mental health. Anyone who knows anything about mental health will realise the importance of having it dealt with by a general practitioner in the first instance. A lot of mental health can be dealt with very adequately by a GP. Budget day was a sad day for patient care in general practice because what the government did was rip $580 million over four years out of mental health programs coordinated by GPs. General practice is the universal access point for health care nationally. Most people have a medical home which is their GP, and it is very important for continuity of care that people do have a medical home and that they do have one GP who can coordinate their health care. GPs are best placed to identify and work with patients due to their recurring contact and due to the fact that they have known a patient often over the life and perhaps are caring for the whole family as well. Dr Pesce, the former president of the AMA, has agreed with this position. He said, 'Family doctors are the preferred entry point for mental health care.' The government has dramatically devalued the role of the family doctor in managing community mental health. The RACGP have stated that around 70 per cent of patients will consult with their GP when they are first noticing problems with their mental health. To date 17,000 GPs across the country have undertaken additional mental health skills training.


The MBS rebates for GP mental health plans have been cut by half. This measure alone will strip $405.9 million away from GPs over five years. Under the new budget measures, the rebates will be reduced from the current $163.35 to $85.92 for consultations lasting between 20 and 40 minutes for those practitioners who have completed mental health training. This rebate will be dropped to $67.65 for GPs who have not completed the mental health training.


The government have also slashed the number of allied health treatment services available to patients under the Better Access initiative. This measure strips $174.6 million over the next five years. Under this reduced initiative, patients are only allowed to access up to six subsidised mental health services through the MBS, with an additional four subsidised services for those who need it. This is down from a total possible of 18, a cut of almost half. The majority of the funding for mental health is to now be distributed by Medicare Locals. It is still unknown how effective this will be.


GPs are still unsure how these bodies will operate or how effective they will be. I urge the government on this issue to properly consult with the general practice organisations, the RACGP, the AMA, the AGPN and GP Registrars Australia, before the implementation of these damaging cuts to mental health funding provided by general practitioners. It will be detrimental to patients. It is something which has worked very well, I think, since the Better Access program was introduced in 2006. This is a very short-term and short-sighted measure by the government.

"Saffin, Janelle, MP",ALP,2011-05-30,"



Ms SAFFIN
 (Page) (18:04):  I welcome the opportunity to talk generally about the budget and the budget priorities and the government's handling of this, particularly over the last four years since the federal Labor Party came to government. One of the things that I always find rather puzzling is the view put, particularly by the coalition, that only they can manage the economy and only they can manage the government. Yet, if you read the history of budgets, of macro and microeconomic reform and of federal governments in Australia, you will see that that is simply not true; it is not borne out by the facts. The major reforms to our economy actually started in modern times during the period of the Hawke-Keating governments. But I have to say that, at the time, there were a few more 'yeses' from the then coalition opposition than we hear now. All we hear now from the opposition is 'no, no, no'—whatever it is. It is almost like a case of 'cut off your nose to spite your face'. They do not know when to say yes. A measure of an effective and credible opposition is knowing when to say yes. 


What I want to talk about is this Labor government's budget. It builds on that history of reform, and it has done so since coming to government in 2007—and each budget thereafter, including this budget, reflects that. This budget reflects two essential things. One is keeping the economy strong—strengthening it where it needs to. That is necessary if you want to spend, and we need to spend because of the priorities that have to be funded in the electorates. I know that governments, whoever they are, have every backbencher at them wanting some of that money spent in their electorates. I am no different; I always want my share. But for a government to spend across the nation you need a strong economy. You also need—and this is the second essential thing and the essence of the Labor Party and what it does in government—to inculcate a fair go. That is inherent in this budget and in the way that the budget spend is prioritised. But this also means that there have to be savings; it has to be a responsible budget. 


One thing that I have always said is that I am not in parliament to help the Mr Packers, the Mr Palmers, the Mr Forrests and the Ms Rineharts. It is nothing personal. Many of these people do big things and some do it more than others in terms of their sense of corporate social responsibility, which is a key—




Mr Danby:
  Some of them have it, some of them don't.




Ms SAFFIN:
  And some of them do it and some of them do not. However, I do not think they need my representation—I am sure they do not even know who I am. I am here to represent those without much voice, like people on wages, pensioners, my mum and a whole lot of other people in my electorate, such as people without jobs living at or below the poverty line as it is set in Australia, people living with mental illness, people basically in need and people suffering oppression and injustice wherever they are. Budgets—and Labor budgets more so—are one way of representing the people that I am talking about, and this budget shows that. 


My seat of Page is not a rich seat; yet we do not feel poor. Ours is a rural and coastal area. We have a larger than average number of senior citizens. The aged care industry is one of 11 industries in my seat. In terms of numbers, we have twice the national average of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people living in the area. In fact, 10 per cent of Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population live within the strip from the Hunter up to the Tweed. My seat sits within that strip. So when we talk about closing the gap and Indigenous Australia, we are talking about a large proportion of that population living in my seat and in the broader coastal framework. 


I feel quite honoured to be on the expert panel for constitutional recognition of Indigenous Australians. This is something that we are approaching in a multipartisan way. I am on the expert panel with the honourable member for Hasluck, the honourable member for Lyne and Senator Rachel Siewert, so we have a broad political representation. This is something that we are talking about at the moment. Closing the Gap is an important policy way of incorporating a fair go. God knows that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people have not had a fair go throughout our history in Australia, and it behoves all of us to try to give them a fair go. Is it complex? Yes. Is it complex for people in need? Yes. But we still have to do it.


On the evening of the budget, I put out a statement on what it meant for me and the people locally in my seat of Page. In the lead-up to the budget, I had speculated as much as anybody else. People spend weeks speculating about what is going to be in and what is going to be out. It is one of those times when people think that backbenchers will have some particular information or knowledge. Those who are in government or who have been in government know that that is not quite true. What we see in the media is what we know. But that did not stop me speculating and being in the media, as it did not stop everybody else! On the day after the budget, I did eight or nine interviews in the media about it. So I have actually covered a lot of the things in the budget that impacted on us locally. Two of the general areas I went through were health and mental health. 


I have always said that, if I have a key priority, it is health. I continue to make sure that I am knocking on the doors all the time on health. There were some good things in the budget in terms of health. Up to about $1.8 billion had been available in the Health and Hospitals Fund, and there is $475 million allocated to it but not yet spent. That means that some people can get a second go. I have said that in our area we can have a second go at trying to get some of that. That $475 million is national, so there will be a lot of people knocking at the door trying to get some of it, but we have got to get in and try. There were some other good things in the budget. One was the permanent funding for the National Bowel Cancer Screening Program, something that I and other members had lobbied for. I commend the Minister for Health and Ageing for that. 


I also commend the minister for the $2.2 billion for mental health services. That is a historic investment in services for those with mental illness. My comments around mental illness over a long period of time have been that none of us have got it quite right. There is a lot more that needs to be done, but this is a good start. The fact that we actually went to an election with mental health as an issue was really important, because often it never gets into elections as a seminal issue. But there is still a lot more to do in terms of how we engage, people and engage them early, and some of the strategies in the mental health framework. It is a 10-year plan and it needs to be ongoing about how we respond to people with mental illness.


I listened to some of the speeches in this place about how GPs are our first port of call. They are for most things, but there are a lot of people who do not get access to mental health services through GPs being their first port of call. It is an issue I have been engaged in for a long time as a mental health advocate, and it is something that I am currently engaged in through personal family circumstances and experience. I share that with lots of families around Australia. It is another complex area to be formulating policy around, and it is one of those areas where it is better if we can do it in a bipartisan way. The people who suffer from mental illness deserve that. Another area of the budget that I want to talk about is regional spending and development. There has been record investment in our region for transport, water—infrastructure, which covers health as well—and education of over $4.4 billion. The previous government was elected in 1996, and in 1997 that government axed the whole department of regional development as well as a lot of regional development programs. I thought that was a rather odd thing to do, particularly when it was a coalition and one part of that coalition was the National Party, which says it is the natural party of the country or the bush. We reintroduced those programs and did a lot more in regional Australia.


That brings me to a report issued recently called Investing in regions: making a difference. We called it the Grattan report as it was put out by the Grattan Institute.It hit the headlines because it said regional investment fails to make a difference. It just seemed absolute nonsense. At my university—Southern Cross University—the vice chancellor, Peter Lee, entered the public debate and said, 'It's fundamentally flawed.' He went through the report critiquing the methodology. One of the measures the report used, which I found intriguing, was the number of patents that come from regions. I found that a rather odd measure. Regions that have small to medium businesses may never generate a patent—unlike my region, which, with someone like Rick Richardson, generates a lot of patents. He is an inventor with a national and international reputation. It just seemed an odd measure. My husband is a retired academic who chaired some regional economic development forums. He has a PhD in this area, and when talking to me at home about this issue he has been rather exercised. I keep saying, 'Get out and publish something on it because you know the issue better than most.'


The report also said basically that having a university in your region does not make a difference to a regional economy. What nonsense! We have figures that quantify that and it is really clear that it does make a difference, even with the jobs alone. It does make a difference with people from regions going to universities. Just having one there is a symbol; it appeals to that aspiration to go to university. I know it has done that in my area and in other regions across Australia. I would be surprised if any member here were able to agree with that report and the general approach that it took to regional development right across Australia.


In closing, I am happy to support this budget—it is responsible and will get us back into the black.

"Forrest, John, MP",Nats,2011-05-30,"



Mr FORREST
 (Mallee) (18:19):  There is no doubt that the budget is the principal policy opportunity for the government of the day. This is my 18th budget, the first three in opposition, 11 from government and now four again from opposition. It is an opportunity for the government to set its priorities, where its priorities are going to be. I have to say, contrary to what was said by the previous speaker, the member for Page, that from my constituency's point of view I feel as though on their behalf they have been completely let down. For example, and I will give plenty more in the 15 minutes of this contribution, this budget in the middle of Australia's biggest flood crisis has elected to withdraw exceptional circumstances assistance to my farming communities at the time of their greatest need. It is completely inappropriate. EC money could have been viewed as a stimulatory expenditure we needed to kick-start these important regional economies. Without EC the job will be much harder. In fact, there will be much more pain for my families struggling to save their businesses.


I have been interested to listen to the contributions from government members focusing on expenditure; bold statements that this is the largest level of expenditure on infrastructure that there has ever been. Opposition conservative contributions have been more about where this huge amount of money has come from that is borrowed and reminding their own constituents it has to be paid for. Money does not grow on trees. The ideological differences are remarkable. There seems to be a thought from the government that it does not matter that a nation can transfer, intergenerationally, its debt responsibility to a new generation. I have been raised from a conservative point of view. I support the concept that you borrow, you mortgage to buy your modest home and then you extend that to perhaps borrow again to develop your business, but you keep it at a level that you know you can manage knowing full well that you need to put away for the rainy day. The disaster is going to come. In my experience it was either frost in the dried vine fruit industry or it was hail, and you knew that when you got the good year you did not spend it all but you put it away as one in every seven at least would be a disaster year. I do not believe that a nation should be any different in the way it manages the money it has got custodianship of, which belongs to taxpayers. But that is just the ideological difference between the two arguments I have been listening to for the last week or so as people make their contributions with regard to this budget.


My constituency tell me they feel very badly let down. I think the budget has failed to pick up on the importance of our rural powerhouse, that it has the capacity to make a major contribution to our national economy. It has done so for years and will continue to do so. It just needs a little bit of support as we get through the disasters that it has endured, from Queensland through New South Wales all the way to Victoria. In fact, the Victorian flood circumstances astounded everybody, particularly when you think of the arid nature of the Mallee constituency I represent. It has a notional annual rainfall of 10 inches in the year in the old measurements, 250 millimetres. There was that amount of rainfall in two or three days. At Mildura on 9 March there was 250 millimetres in eight hours. It has completely devastated the viticultural industry there and it is an ongoing struggle. So to have that exceptional circumstance removed at that time was hard. I was corresponding with the relevant minister and, yes, it is an awkward position to be in to have exceptional circumstance financial support for a drought outcome but the implications of the opposite, a flood, are just the same: financial pain and financial insecurity. In my Mallee constituency 183 agricultural constituents reported loss and damage of more than $250,000 each and 400 had losses of more than $100,000 each. This gives a staggering total in the order of $350 million in losses at the farm gate—figures supported by the Victorian Farmers Federation and the Department of Primary Industries in Victoria. And this does not allow for the much higher value-added amount after processing, mostly into food but also into fibre.


I have some of the best farmers and horticulturalists in my constituency, but their balance sheets have been crippled by a decade of drought. Just when they thought that El Dorado was upon them, an opportunity to get them out of trouble with their banks, down came the worst meteorological disaster that the region has probably ever seen. I wrote to the minister on 11 February 2011 imploring him not to abandon EC and to find another option, knowing it was going to finish on 31 March—as recommended by the National Rural Advisory Council. But their advice was put to the minister's office before the rainfall. To this day, I have not had a response to my correspondence—very disappointing. My intention was to provide early advice, not knowing then but suspecting that meteorological outcomes of the nature that were showing up in the Pacific due to the El Nino. My prophecy came to fruition, sadly. Fruit, vegetables, melon and nut crops were all affected. As well, the viticultural and the dried vine fruit sectors were affected. Wine grape growers were already struggling but I thought table grapes in the Murray Valley was one commodity that had the capacity to allow horticulture to carry on, especially after getting formal access to China after many years. But the weather conditions wrecked the crop. The fruit rotted and it got downy mildew, a fungal growth that develops in the bunch because of the high humidity. It was very disappointing. I had hoped that this budget would offer something more to my constituents, but it did not. 


Eight out of the nine municipalities in the electorate of Mallee have experienced severe flooding, particularly in January. The community of Charlton was flooded three times in six months, to the extent that 80 per cent of the township was inundated with water up to the height of my chest. The hospital, the aged-care facility and the doctor's surgery were all in one complex which was inundated. 



The Charlton community are still struggling to recover from that. Those people are in despair as they try to sleep in this cold weather with no carpets on their floors and the gyprock removed from their walls up to chest height. They are waiting for their insurers to respond positively and honour their claims. I put those insurance companies on notice: if I do not get some positive responses from them in accepting claim responsibilities in Donald and Charlton then I will come into this place and name and shame. If people do not want to insure that is fine, but do not leave those who had insurance hanging by a hook not knowing where to go from here. One of those people is the doctor in Charlton. He is not in a good frame of mind. When you have young children and you cannot live comfortably in your own home, the pressure on a family is devastating. That is the Buloke Shire. Donald also lost its aged-care facility in the flood. Equally as devastating was the news in Queensland but down south they were a little disappointed because whilst no-one was injured and no lives were lost the outcome was the same. The 30 residents at the aged-care facility in Donald had to be relocated across the region. This has created enormous uncertainty and will lead to very poor outcomes from a health point of view. That is why I am so disappointed that this budget will see the closure of the Medicare access facilities in those vital towns spread across the north-west of Victoria in my constituency.

"Christensen, George, MP",Nats,2011-05-30,"



Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson) (18:30):  The SS Yongala had a proud history in a young Australia and continues to be a key player in the history of North Queensland. The Yongala steamed out of Mackay, at the southern end of my electorate of Dawson, on 23 March 1911, bound for Townsville, at the northern end of Dawson electorate. It was a journey the Yongala would never complete. She steamed into a cyclone and sank 12 nautical miles off the coast of Alva, in the Burdekin. All 122 passengers were lost. 


One hundred years ago, steamships were a vital link between North Queensland settlements and the southern capital cities. Mackay's port, in those days, was a hive of activity as passengers and freight were arriving and departing with the tides. The Yongala was named after a small South Australian town because she was built in England, in Newcastle upon Tyne, for the Adelaide Steamship Company at a cost of £102,000. Originally working across the southern half of the continent, she linked Melbourne and Sydney in the east with the goldfields of the west. Having been launched in 1903, she was assigned the Brisbane to Fremantle route in 1906 and was the first ship to complete the then-record direct trip of 5,000 kilometres. In the quieter months, the Yongala was assigned to the east coast passage between Cairns and Melbourne. 


In 1911, she set out on her 99th, and fatal, voyage. On departure from Mackay, carrying 49 passengers, 73 crew, and a racehorse called Moonshine, the Yongalawas still within sight of land when the cyclone warning came in. Unfortunately, it was too late to relay the message to the Yongala. Although wireless was available in some ships of the time, the Yongala's wireless was still in transit from England. The Yongala steamed ahead northward along the Coral Sea, oblivious to the mounting storm ahead. It was not until several days later that concerns were raised about the late arrival of the Yongala. Although wreckage was soon washed up on beaches from Bowen to Hinchinbrook, the actual wreck was not detected until 1943 and it was not until 1958 that two skin-divers dived the wreck and retrieved the ship's safe. The safe was positively identified, by serial number, in 1961.


Today, the wreck of the Yongala is considered one of the best diving attractions in Australia and plays a major role in the tourism industry of Townsville. This tragedy is strongly tied to North Queensland in more ways than through historical event alone. The passenger and freight ship is itself a reflection on the lifestyle of those families who built North Queensland in the early years. The North Queensland communities are intrinsically tied to the Coral Sea and are always aware of the prevalence and the dangers of tropical cyclones. No doubt a ship placed in a similar position would have a much greater chance of survival today. The modern equipment we use to monitor the weather and to maintain communication would provide enough warning for a ship like the Yongala to seek refuge from the impending storm. Sadly, for the friends and families of those on board, such equipment was not available in 1911. Those friends and families will forever have a connection with our North Queensland coastline, and their loved ones hold a special place in our memory and in this parliament's memory 100 years on.

Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (18:34):  I rise to speak on the motion moved by the member for Dawson, noting the circumstances 100 years ago in which 49 passengers and 73 crew perished on board the SS Yongala. The SS Yongala is unlikely to be a name known to many Australians, other than serious scuba divers. Today, the wreck of the Yongala lies approximately 48 nautical miles south-east of Townsville and 12 nautical miles east of Cape Bowling Green in relatively shallow waters at a depth of 16 metres below the surface. The Museum of North Queensland, which manages the conservation of the SS Yongala wreck, recognises it as the largest, most intact historic shipwreck known in Australian waters apart from the modern Australian Navy warships intentionally sunk for recreational diving purposes.


Of course, the loss of the Yongala was a tragedy unparalleled in its time, having claimed 122 lives. Communities throughout eastern Australia and South Australia commemorated the tragedy in churches and village halls. Donations were offered to the Yongala distress fund, begun in March 1911 for the relief of families in distress. Other than the sheer tragedy of this story, I was intrigued by another dimension altogether. That was the role that technology and innovation played in the loss and finding of the Yongala. On the fateful last voyage, Yongala departed Mackay bound for Townsville and Cairns and, while the Yongala was still in sight of land, the signal station at Flat Top received a telegram warning of an approaching cyclone. Although the first Australian shore-based wireless station capable of maintaining communication with ships had been established in Sydney in 1910, few ships carried wireless in 1911. Ironically, a wireless destined for installation in Yongala had recently been dispatched from the Marconi company in England. Five hours later, the lighthouse keeper on Dent Island in the Whitsunday Passage watched Yongala steam past into the worsening weather. It was the last sighting.


Of course improvements were made to technology, and continue to be made, to make shipping safer for the generations that followed. Technology also played its part in the rediscovery and later identification of the Yongala. Despite its shallow resting place, Yongala remained undiscovered for 36 years. In 1947, the Royal Australian Navy hydrographic vessel HMAS Lachlan stopped to examine an obstruction reported four years earlier, using antisubmarine equipment and an echo sounder. The obstruction was thought to be a sunken ship, and was presumed to be the SS Yongala, but no further action was taken.


In 1958, a shell fisherman came upon this obstacle once again and, being fascinated by the mystery of the Yongala, spent the next few weeks dragging the sandy seabed with grapnel. The fisherman, Bill Kirkpatrick, commenced a salvage operation using a hardhat diver but this was unsuccessful. A second salvage attempt was made some time later, this time with Kirkpatrick and the Queensland Underwater Research Group hoping to positively identify the wreck as the Yongala. During this salvage operation, a safe was recovered and brought to the surface. In the presence of Customs officers, the safe was smashed open but it contained only sludge. Positive identification of the wreck only occurred after a photo of the safe was published in the Townsville Daily Bulletin and seen by the Chubb safe dealer who identified it as one of their safes.


In another irony, it was much older technology which helped identify the wreck. The partial serial number found on the door tongue was sent to England for identification, where Chubb confirmed that it matched the serial number of the safe which had been supplied to the ship builder Armstrong, Whitworth and Co. for the Yongala, and which had been installed in the purser's cabin.


Today, there are more than 10,000 recreational dives on the Yongalaevery year. The site is protected under the Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976 and managed through the Museum of Tropical Queensland, Townsville—a beautiful part of the world. The museum controls access to the site through permit only. There is strictly no access to the internals of the wreck but the artificial reef Yongala is now home and provides a great haven for sea life and wonderful viewing to those who dare to venture beneath the surface. I thank the member for Dawson for moving this motion.

Mr EWEN JONES
 (Herbert) (18:39):  I thank the member for Dawson for moving this motion on the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the SS Yongala. We have heard tonight that the ship was built in South Australia, and I am reliably informed that the actual name of the vessel is pronounced 'Yongulla', whereas the actual name of the building in Townsville is the Yongala Lodge—there are always arguments about pronunciation. It is an Aboriginal word, although I am not sure of the meaning. All 122 people were lost as the ship sailed into a cyclone, and that was a great tragedy. The racehorse Moonshine almost made it to Townsville. It was washed up; it never made it to shore alive. It had an undistinguished racing career and it did not win its last race either. What I would say is that since finding the Yongala in 1958 it has turned into not just one of the great dives in Australia but one of the top five dives in the world. The member for Flinders is a very avid and very keen scuba diver—he keeps his tickets low. He has dived with the great whites in South Australia. He has dived all over Australia and yet he has never done the Yongala. I had the member for Flinders in Townsville just prior to the 100th anniversary, but the weather was such that he was not able to make the dive. 


On Saturday, 26 March this year, there was a celebration for the 100th anniversary at Yongala Lodge. Yongala Lodge was built by the Rooney family in Townsville who lost one of their family members in the sinking of the Yongala. The Rooney family built the lodge and they also built the massive and beautiful altar in St Joseph's Church, the Strand, which is directly across the road and home to Father Mick Peters, one of the greatest blokes in the history of the world, even if he is a Warwick boy and a Nudgee boy. 


There was a dinner at Yongala Lodge for 122 people and everyone's place card marked with a crew member, passenger or racehorse that was on the ship. It was a fantastic evening. It was hosted by Stephen Price the local breakfast radio host and I was lucky enough to be called upon to do the auction that evening where we raised some valuable funds for the coastguard and other local charities.




Mr Christensen:
  Were you moonshining?




Mr EWEN JONES:
  I was not moonshining; I was actually a stoker in the thing. Natalie and Bob Flecker are now the owners of Yongala Lodge. Natalie has been nominated in the Townsville Chamber of Commerce Young Business Achievement Award. Natalie and Bob are truly wonderful people. They work hard. They have reopened the restaurant six nights a week to provide great food and welcoming service to people who stay there, as well as to the locals in Townsville. Shivaun, one of the waitresses, is a personal friend of mine and always gives me great service and slips me the occasional free beer.



Government members interjecting—




Mr EWEN JONES:
  I have declared it on my pecuniary interests—it does go down with those sorts of things. Natalie and Bob organised the evening on a shoestring. It was a great evening. I congratulate everyone involved with it. They had a number of people there related to those who lost their lives on that fateful day. 


I would finish by saying that if you ever have the chance to dive the Yongala you should take that opportunity. It is a truly beautiful dive. The water is crystal clear. You will see tropical fish the like of which you have never seen before. It is so close to Townsville—you leave first thing in the morning and you are back by five o'clock in the afternoon.


Tourism in North Queensland has suffered some terrible blows and the tourism sector in Townsville particularly is suffering. The dive and tourism operators are doing it very, very tough. I would urge everyone who has a current scuba diving ticket to get out there and dive the Yongala now. Anyone who has not got a scuba diving ticket should get up there, do a scuba diving course and then do the dive. Stay in Townsville, stay at the Yongala Lodge, and eat up and drink up big.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2011-05-30,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (18:43):  I too rise to speak on the motion put forward by the member for Dawson and I congratulate him for the motion. I would also congratulate my colleagues the member for Herbert and the member for Chifley for speaking on this private member's motion. It is great that you have drawn our attention to the tragedy and wish to extend the sympathies of the chamber to the families and friends of those who suffered in that tragedy. 


Just on the pronunciation—'Yongala' or 'Yon-gala'. Can I go for Yongala? We have the same thing in Canberra. Some people call it 'Can-berra' and it is actually 'Canberra'. I must admit that I am not necessarily the most knowledgeable person on Australia's shipwrecks .However, the story of the SS Yongala is a fascinating and important part of Australia's maritime heritage. Those opposite and also my colleague here, the member for Chifley, will probably wonder why the member for Canberra is speaking on such an issue, given that Canberra is landlocked. I remind those in the chamber that the division of Canberra also includes Norfolk Island and that the electorate of my colleague the member for Fraser also includes Jervis Bay, because, when Canberra was set up as a city in 1927, every Australian city had to have a port. That is why we have Jervis Bay. That is why the member for Fraser has his own little part of the electorate down in beautiful Jervis Bay.


On 14 March 1911, the SS Yongala embarked on its 99th voyage in Australian waters, under the command of Captain William Knight. It would be his last voyage. On 23 March that year, the Yongala departed Mackay at 1.40 pm with 617 tons of cargo, 49 passengers and 73 crew bound for Townsville, but it never made its destination. One hundred and twenty-two passengers and crew lost their lives when the ship sank in a cyclone 12 nautical miles off the coast of Cape Bowling Green in the Great Barrier Reef on 23 March 1911.


The exact details of the sinking are to this day unknown, and they may never be known. A board of inquiry following the sinking could not render a judgment due to the lack of eyewitness evidence. It was believed at the time that the Yongala hit the reef or a rock and sank. Present research suggests that, given the absence of life rafts, it happened quickly. What is known is that the Yongala, absent modern-day technology such as radar, sailed blindly into a cyclone. If she had had a wireless—which was waiting on the wharves in Cairns—it could have warned her of the impending bad weather.


By the time of World War Two, the Yongala and its fate had all but faded from memory. In fact, it had become the subject of ghost stories, becoming a mysterious ship that travelled the waters around Townsville. How exciting! It was not until 1947 and the end of the war that the Navy gave serious consideration to an obstruction that had been noted some years earlier. The HMAS Lachlan determined that this obstruction was most likely a large steamer, but no further investigation was made. The location of the Yongala was only discovered in 1958, when divers recovered a safe whose only identification was a serial number, the contents of the safe having long ago been destroyed. However, further investigation of the serial number revealed this safe to be the one installed in the purser's cabin on the Yongala during its construction in 1903.


The story of the Yongala does not end with its sinking and rediscovery. Out of this tragedy a century ago, a new life and purpose has emerged for the wreck of the Yongala. Today it acts as an artificial reef and major dive location, bringing tourism to the area. It is a microcosm of the greater barrier reef, and it is said that it has a greater spectrum of corals and fish than can be seen on the barrier reef. These features have made the Yongala one of Australia's most popular destinations for divers, with over 10,000 divers visiting the wreck every year. At 110 metres long, the Yongala is one of the largest intact historic shipwrecks in the world and the largest in Australia. The wreck is a significant part of Australia's maritime history, and I urge all Australians to learn more about it and our maritime heritage.


In closing, I would like to extend my sympathies and those of the people of Canberra to the families and friends of those who perished in the sinking of the SS Yongala 100 years ago. This significant part of Australia's heritage is protected by the Historic Shipwrecks Act and it is a heritage site, so it has a very special place in our hearts.

"Hunt, Greg, MP",LP,2011-05-30,"



Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (20:18):  In addressing this motion for Greg McNicol, I speak both as a local member representing his parents and as a friend. As a friend, we go back to 1978, 33 years ago, when we were each 12 years of age. It is three-quarters of my life that we knew each other. Against that background, let me begin by expressing my condolences and the condolences of the House to Greg McNicol's family: to his father, Graham, who I know has been so deeply affected by this loss, and to his mother, Maureen, who is going through difficult and challenging times of her own but who has been the absolute rock of the family for decades and decades. Although she was a good foot shorter than Greg McNicol, or maybe a little bit more, he was always terrified of his mother. She was a woman of stout heart and she remains a woman of stout heart despite great challenges. Her family relies upon her as the absolute rock of their existence.


Let me express my condolences to Greg's brother Steven and his sister Karen, but most significantly, to Greg's wife, Katie Scartezini, who remains a Brazilian citizen. Greg and Katie lived together in the United States.  Katie is an extraordinary woman. She is a figure in her own right nationally in both countries as a speaker and author. She has an extraordinarily positive attitude to life and she found her life partner some eight years ago in Greg McNicol. Each of them had had their own journey and for Greg this was the coming together of his life. There had been some dark and difficult days along the way but he found his partner and he was in the best place of his life. I last saw him on the balcony of my own home on the Mornington Peninsula, where 17 months ago he came to visit. We spent an evening one summer between Christmas and New Year with friends Peter Beamish, Ian McConville, my wife Paula, Gregory McNicol and his wife Katie. He talked about the journey he had made and the fortune he had had in finding his partner, and he talked about his plans to renovate, to build small local communities in America one block at a time. 


He recognised that the global financial crisis caused enormous hardship but he also saw in it the opportunity to be engaged in a commercial venture, at the same time operating towards the higher angels. In particular, Greg set out at that stage that he thought in some of the more depressed cities in the United States there was a possibility, particularly in African-American communities, to give people a sense of hope, possibility and opportunity by taking some of these rundown buildings and working with the residents on progressively upgrading and reforming them to make them a family community. He set out to do that and he was doing that in a number of places, most notably in Detroit in Beniteau Street. It was sadly in that street that he met his end while attempting to do the best by the residents, to create a small, local community that would provide a way forward and an opportunity, a sense of living at its best to people who might otherwise have struggled. It is a great tragedy, a senseless strategy. My one comfort, and I know the family's one comfort, is that in Katie he had made his life partner and they had shared time together. The great tragedy is that their hopes for a family were never realised.


The second element of this motion is to express the gratitude of the House:


... to the City and Police Department of Detroit for the speed with which they have apprehended the alleged killer, and urge that the investigation is continued until such time as police are certain that no other parties were complicit.


I particularly want to speak on behalf of family who have asked me to convey to Mayor Dave Bing and to all members of the City of Detroit Police Department their thanks. They are thankful for all that has been done so far but they have concerns that the investigation should be fully conducted in the event that there was more than one person involved in the killing. That is a matter for the police, but as a House we express our hope that the police will not rest until they have exhausted all inquiries. 


In particular as part of the thanks on half of the family I want to thank the Foreign Minister of Australia, Kevin Rudd, and his chief of staff, Philip Green. Both acted personally to assist Katie and her brother Giovanni obtain the requisite visas to move from Brazil, where sadly Katie was at the time of Greg's death, up to Detroit to gather his remains and bring Greg's remains back to Australia. They were assisted by the Australian ambassador, Kim Beazley, and by the United States embassy in Australia. I especially thank Deb Blakie from the consular division of the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. Her assistance has been herculean, compassionate, caring and fundamental in helping the family bring all the details together.


On behalf of the House, I also make the point that there is no animosity towards the city of Detroit. There is great respect for the people of America, particularly those engaged in the great renaissance through which Detroit is now passing. It is a city which has seen its hard times. But last year it had its lowest murder rate in some decades. Sadly, it still has a murder rate of over 300—and my friend, the son of Graham and Maureen and the husband of Katie, is one of this year's victims. There is a great challenge in each of our cities but we wish Detroit godspeed in their work. This brings me to the last part of the motion, which states:


(2) respectfully call on the Mayor and City of Detroit to create a public park in the vacant land adjacent to where Mr McNicol was both working and lost his life, with an appropriate recognition of Mr McNicol's vision for a better local community.


Greg's vision was not just the building at Beniteau Street; it was to create a living community by way of a small local park on the adjacent vacant block. It is a simple vision and I ask the mayor to do all he can. Mayor Bing, we know of you in Australia and we know of your city in Australia. We have great respect for you and for your city. We ask that you consider acquiring or converting this land in some way to create a small family park with picnic tables, seats and benches, to allow locals to sit beneath Greg's favourite tree and to live a proper family life with some calm and serenity to which we are all entitled.


I want to finish with a special note of thanks to Ed Husic, the member for Chifley. He suggested this motion. He is from the government side of the House. It was a very thoughtful commendation and the family pass on their thanks. He has established an enviable early reputation for honourable conduct in this House. Finally, I commend this motion to the House, but I say goodbye to my friend. It has been a difficult time. We will miss you, my friend.

Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley) (20:28):  I echo the condolences expressed by the member for Flinders about the death of an Australian expatriate, his high school friend, Greg McNicol. At the outset, I extend my condolences and deepest sympathies to Mr McNicol's wife, Katie, his father, Graham, and his mother, Maureen, and to other family. From testaments and reports in the media, Mr McNicol was a driven, self-made businessman who leapt across the Pacific from his home in Mt Eliza, Victoria, to the United States of America. His death touched Australians back home with tributes flowing from his Mt Eliza community and in Detroit where he made many friends. He was a property developer setting out to start a dream and bring his skills and talents across to the United States. Embodied within Greg McNicol's story are those national attributes we admire so much.  Often we celebrate the efforts of other business people and sports people because it is natural to garner easy coverage for their endeavours. But Greg McNicol represented our country uniquely. I learnt a lot about his efforts, and the tragic circumstances that surrounded his final moments, through a thoughtful feature article that ran in the Sydney Morning Herald a few Saturdays ago, written by Nick Miller and Chris Johnston. He was, as the Herald article said, on a 'journey from the Mornington Peninsula across the world to Los Angeles and then Detroit was a journey of self-discovery. He knew there was something out there for him; he just had to find it.'  His was not a journey necessarily anchored simply in self-advancement. He was trying to make a difference in the lives of people in tough neighbourhoods. Greg McNicol wanted them to savour hope for a more secure, comfortable future. He was doing incredible work, investing in properties he wished to rebuild. His most recent project involved renovating a rundown 10-unit apartment complex in Detroit, where his mind saw a vision for a better community, improving the quality of life for tenants while providing more affordable accommodation. 


Representing the seat of Chifley, where I have had the great pleasure of attending the openings of many new social housing initiatives, Mr McNicol's work spoke to me. It was something I could relate to. I have seen firsthand what a difference new, well-presented accommodation can make in the lives of people who never imagined they would be so fortunate to experience this, especially if they had been stuck on public housing queues for a decade or more. So, regardless of location, this fellow citizen of ours, Greg McNicol, was helping to offer others a brighter future, something our parliament should surely take the time to honour. 


To describe Mr McNicol's achievements, I quote the Herald article of 21 May: 


His tradesman's skills—roofing, plumbing, carpentry—were relics of his previous life; when he left school early he was an RAAF mechanic for seven years. After that he built his own wholesale nursery.


Then he moved to California and got into the building trade, earning US qualifications in plumbing, electrics, construction and building codes. 


From what I have learned, Greg McNicol did not do things by halves. He moved into the properties he was renovating to make sure they were protected—and to apply the work ethic he was renowned for, as recounted by his sister Karen, when she said he was the 'first there in the morning and the last to leave'. Through his industry and hard work he earned the respect of local residents in Detroit, who had nicknamed him the 'Crocodile Hunter'. Residents cooked for him, fed him and offered him company and support. But as much as he offered a better future for some, Mr McNicol had to make tough calls about others, sometimes evicting tenants as part of his redevelopments. As a result of an argument he had had with some tenants he had sought to evict, Mr McNicol was shot at close range. To quote the Herald:


Neighbours, angry because they liked McNicol and knew he meant well, brought bandages. Some tended to him. But it was too late. 


I understand the member for Flinders, Greg Hunt, has spoken to Foreign Minister Rudd to ensure that the Detroit police thoroughly investigate Mr McNicol's death, and we have heard some of the other measures that he has followed through to ensure this is the case. Having read Mr Hunt's letter to the Mayor of Detroit, David Bing, I understand Mr McNicol's family and friends have vowed to see through his work, and I am sure many in this House extend to them every single encouragement with their efforts. As local Detroit resident and friend Flo Benson said:


There are people like Greg taking a chance in Detroit, who are not going to get stopped. This time next year this property will be thriving, the way he knew it would. His life won't be in vain. 


The member for Flinders, in his letter to the mayor, remarked: 'Greg's passion was to help some of the poorest neighbourhoods in America, one block at a time. The heart of that vision was the apartment complex at 4110 Beniteau Street.' I note the letter by the member for Flinders extended a modest but important request, asking the city to consider acquiring the adjacent vacant block to help create a small park for residents, a park that might be named after Mr McNicol. To quote the member for Flinders, this would be 'a small but profoundly meaningful gesture not only for Greg's family but also for nearby residents'. 


As I speak on this motion I think of my own communities in Chifley that have experienced their own trying times of late, where the community has come together to help those feeling the pain of loss. I look to my own area where the death of young Keisha Abrahams touched so many people. Our local newspaper, the Mt Druitt Standard, recently featured photos of a purple fence erected in her memory—purple being her favourite colour. Community members built the fence and Emerton Hardware donated the paint. Dozens of messages from passers-by have been left on the palings. The support and outpouring of emotion and concern have been constant over the course of the year. 


In mid-August last year my wife, Bridget, and I visited the local temporary shrine dedicated to Keisha. As we left our flowers we were moved on that cold night by the warmth of others in their well-wishes for Keisha. I hope when the pain eases with the passing of time that a fitting memorial will be set up to remember Keisha, as a landmark testifying to the compassion and spirit of Mount Druitt's communities. 


But tonight we honour an Australian who has left. I would like to extend my deepest sympathy to Mr McNicol's family, his wife and his friends. We in this parliament offer our condolences as we remember his life and extend thanks to the community for their valued support and hope that others who were so close to him find comfort in this time.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (20:36):  Four hundred years ago, Sir Francis Bacon made a simple observation. He said, 'Knowledge itself is power.' This motion recognises the transformative power of information. When we put information in the hands of voters we help people make the best choices for themselves and their families. Providing information also helps improve public services which are crucial to boosting productivity growth in Australia. This motion focuses on three websites created by the Australian government: MySchool, MyChild and MyHospitals. 


The myschool.edu.au website allows schools, teachers, parents and the community to compare schools serving statistically similar backgrounds and to compare all schools in Australia. It allows parents to identify and learn about high-performing schools, including schools in which significant student progress is demonstrated. Under MySchool 2.0, parents can now look at student gain over time and they can learn about the financial resources available to the school. Since the MySchool website was launched at the start of last year, over five million people have visited the site. 


The mychild.gov.au website helps parents find childcare options suitable for their needs. It allows parents to find information about the childcare places in their area and assistance with childcare costs. The website now includes information about vacancies across the full range of age groups and information on both permanent and casual vacancies. In the last 12 months alone, the MyChild website has had over 420,000 visits. The website also links to useful information for parents such as children's health and wellbeing, and parenting and family support services.


The myhospitals.gov.au website provides information on bed numbers, patient admissions, hospital accreditation and types of specialised services. It also provides national public hospital performance statistics such as waiting times for elective surgery and emergency. It helps patients choose the hospital that is right for them and allows everyone to compare the performance of their local hospital with other hospitals around Australia. 


These websites were opposed at the time of their creation. Some education insiders opposed the MySchool website. The Australian Medical Association and some state governments opposed the MyHospitals website. The opposition recently has been critical of the updated MySchool 2.0 website, preferring instead to keep financial information secret from Australian families. Opposition to data release has been based around two arguments. First, critics argue the performance measures are imperfect. This is undoubtedly true, but it sets the bar too high. We should always strive to improve the quality of information but the perfect should never become the enemy of the good. Second, those who oppose data being released claim it will lead to underperforming institutions being stigmatised. But so long as the data are collected so as to minimise the potential for manipulation and provide the broadest possible set of indicators, it will help identify the strongest and weakest institutions. Rather than allowing poor performance to continue under a veil of secrecy, we should let a little sunlight in.


We also have good evidence that more information raises overall performance. In the case of school accountability, Stanford University researchers Martin Carnoy and Susanna Loeb found strong evidence that those US states that provided more public information about school performance experienced more rapid growth in maths scores. Similarly, Eric Hanushek and Margaret Raymond found that students in countries which published school performance data tended to do better on international exams. 


The same is true of hospitals. In his book Better: Asurgeon's notes on performance medical writer Atul Gawande discusses the impact that performance information had on the treatment of cystic fibrosis, a genetic disease that impedes lung capacity. While patients at the average treatment centre would typically live to 33 years, those at the best centre lived to age 47. Over recent decades the life expectancy of cystic fibrosis patients has increased substantially as treatment innovations have percolated down from the leading centres. 


Making school and hospital performance information publicly available should help everyone, but there are good reasons to think the poor may benefit more than the rich. In a low-information environment, information is restricted to insiders who share it with their friends. Publishing statistical data helps democratise access to information, allowing everyone to see what the insiders already know. The more comprehensive public data is, the less individuals will need to rely on questionable sources of information. (Time expired)

"Kelly, Craig, MP",LP,2011-05-30,"



Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (20:41):  This motion on the MySchool, MyHospitals and MyChild websites should win a prize—it is one of the most hypocritical I have seen since I have been in this place. It is a motion one should describe as an own goal, or a self-inflicted wound. Where does one start to dissect a motion that talks about this government's performance, or about how greater access to information helps Australians make the best choices? It is self-evident that greater access to information helps Australians make the best choices—just look at what happened at the last election, back in August, when Australians went to the polls. 


At that time, the information on the carbon tax that Australians had access to was a solemn promise from the lips of the Prime Minister that there would not be one. If Australians had greater access to information and had not trusted a single word that came out of the Prime Minister's mouth, they would have made the best choice and simply not voted for the Labor Party. While on the subject of access to information and helping Australians to make the best choice, last night we had 'Carbon Cate' and this ridiculous 'We say yes' campaign on TV—possibly the most dishonest and deceptive advertisement ever shown on national TV. How can Australians seriously make the best choice when served up such dishonesty?


One of the golden rules that applies equally in government as it does in life is that you should practise what you preach. Unfortunately, that does not seem to apply to this government. If this government truly believes greater access to information helps Australians make the best choice, what about the NBN? Certainly a cost-benefit analysis would help provide greater access to information about the NBN. A cost-benefit analysis would help this Labor government but, instead, it is rushing ahead and spending billions of dollars on a lick and a promise when already the alarm bells are ringing loud on the NBN. If the member for Fraser, who moved this motion, truly believed that greater access to information helps Australians make the best choices, why is he not demanding that a cost-benefit analysis be undertaken before they spend a further dollar on the NBN? Hypocrisy, thy name is Labor.


We have also seen this government's approach to access to information with its simplistic notion 'let us build a website'. Who can afford the high farce of this governments GroceryWatch website? Perhaps the worst thing about this website is the damage it did to the credibility of the ACCC. The ACCC took a political stance by aiding and abetting this Labor government's attempt to flog the lemon of GroceryWatch while the public was laughing at them. What the ACCC should have been doing was prosecuting this government for misleading and deceptive conduct. 


If this member truly supports Australians having better access to information about government performance, how about a website that details the Labor government's performance in relation to the debt that they have created? Let us have a website that informs the public about how this government is building a mountain of debt by borrowing $135 million every day or $5.5 million every hour or $93,000 every minute. We could call it 'Labor debt watch'. Unfortunately, the problem with such a website is that it would struggle to keep up with the growing mountain of debt. 


We could also have a website that informs the public about the effect on prices from a tax on carbon dioxide at different rates. The website could set out how much electricity prices would rise with a tax set at $20, how much electricity prices would rise if the tax were set at $30, at $40, at $50 and so on all the way up to $100 and more. We could also have a website that informs the public about how much this carbon tax will actually reduce global temperatures. In conclusion, this motion is just a further demonstration of how out of touch this government is and how their real intention is to hide the facts about this government's dismal performance.

"Owens, Julie, MP",ALP,2011-05-30,"



Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (20:46):  It does go without saying that good public policy is built on good information, as is stated in the motion before us. I am going to speak on the motion before us about the MySchool, MyHospitals and MyChild websites, unlike the previous speaker who seemed to go quite wildly into other areas. Good information is what helps governments set priorities and stay focused on the big issues. We also need accurate information to evaluate programs and make adjustments where the need arises. 


For that reason, I was very surprised, when we came into government back in 2007, to find out just how little information we actually had about things of great importance. We did not, for example, have consistent data on schools and, when we sought to introduce a program that targeted disadvantaged schools, we could not even get together an accurate list from the information that was available around the country. We did not have comprehensive data on literacy and numeracy, we did not know how children's literacy and numeracy skills were going over time, we did not have the data to enable us to identify and learn about which schools were performing well, we could not tell which schools were struggling or why and we did not have comparative school financial data. In fact there was very little information in the government domain that would inform a policy aimed at improving the quality of education across the country and making sure that good quality education was available for all. 


We also did not have comprehensive data based on the health and wellbeing and development of our very young children, our nought to fives. This is a very important part of a child's life; it sets them up for the rest of their life. We could not work on prevention and early intervention in mental health where it was most needed because we simply did not know where it was most needed. That data was not there. 


Parents did not have access to information about early childhood services. I remember talking to one of the peak bodies for childcare providers, based in my electorate, and they said that they also did not have data on where the populations were changing, where the childcare centres were and what services were needed then and would be needed in the future; nor did the government of the day. That was an extraordinary thing to learn in a world where information is king—that in 2007 the Australian government did not actually have the information it needed to make serious policy in these areas. 


We did not have information on average waiting times in our hospitals nor could the general public easily find out which hospitals specialised in what. Now, I am pleased to say, in many of those areas the information is actually collected and available and is being improved year by year. In some areas, we are beginning new programs—the Australian Early Development Index is a particularly important policy at the moment and I will spend a moment talking about that fantastic initiative, which also highlights the importance we place on information. The Australian Early Development Index measures a young child's development. It is like a checklist that measures five key areas of early childhood development—physical health and wellbeing, social competence, emotional maturity, language and cognitive skill, communication skills and general knowledge. We are now the first country in the world to have collected comprehensive and population based data on the health, wellbeing and development of our five-year-olds. In this year's budget, the Gillard government is committing an additional $29.7 million over five years to the Australian Early Development Index. We will now be collecting data on an ongoing basis every three years. It is a vital tool to help ensure that governments and communities continue to maximise our children's life potential. In this area, like so many others—particularly areas like education, health and early childhood wellbeing—having the information we need to plan services and focus our efforts in the right places is absolutely essential, as it is essential to evaluate current programs and determine where improvements are needed.


I would also like to talk briefly about how some of this information has been used. Arthur Phillip High School, one of the schools in my electorate, is one of the beneficiaries of the new school partnerships which place additional funds and support in schools with the highest need. Again I point out that when we came to government in 2007 it would not have been possible to identify that school among the many others that were in need of additional help, and I commend the government for the work it has done in making that information available to policymakers and the public at large.

"Wyatt, Ken, MP",LP,2011-05-30,"



Mr WYATT
 (Hasluck) (20:51):  I rise today to debate the motion put forward by the member for Fraser, who in his motion is calling on the House to recognise the importance of transparency. I must admit that I fully agree. I commend him for the motion, and I hope that his call for transparency is a genuine expression of the need for the Australian people to have access to information about government performance. I equally agree that greater access to information helps individuals and all Australians to make the best choices for themselves and their families and ultimately their community.


The question I would ask is: is it truth in transparency, or is it the perception of truth coloured by the filters of the degree of truth in transparency? If it is the latter, then what he seeks with this motion does not resolve the intent of what he seeks to address. I am reminded of the words of Henry David Thoreau:


To the man who cherishes a secret in his breast, there is a still greater secret unexplored. Our most indifferent acts may be matter for secrecy, but whatever we do with the utmost truthfulness and integrity, by virtue of its pureness, must be transparent as light.


Australians are asking for more transparent, democratic government that is completely open and frank, transparently honest in replying to answers sought and honest about its motives, which are clear and easily understood. The introduction of the My School, MyHospitals and MyChild websites has good intent, and they provide information that helps people and families to make discerning choices. Initiatives such as these are limited in the information provided, and what is not captured is the quality of human interpersonal relationships based on caring, understanding and compassion. The social, emotional and supportive nurturing environment is a significant component of the learning and workplace locations.


The motion says Australians need more information about government performance, greater transparency and better access to information to make informed decisions. These things are needed from a responsible government, but sadly Labor's actions are very different. Instead of reducing waste and streamlining processes, the Public Service has bloated under Labor's watch. Over 24,000 additional public servants have been employed since Labor was elected in 2007. That is equivalent to over 1,000 AFL teams, for example.


My office is bombarded with calls from constituents in Hasluck who are concerned about Labor's failed border protection policies. As we speak, immigration department officials are scouring the country to find more beds for people as detention centres overflow and succumb to rioting. Maybe we should have a My Detention website if we are serious about being transparent as the member suggests. Australians could see how many people were detained, the cost of detention, the number of riots, the number of staff injured or even the cost of putting up a fence and replacing damaged buildings.


One wonders what is next. Does the member for Fraser propose that the concept of transparency be expanded to enable Australians to fully understand the role, function and outcomes that taxpayer funded organisations perform, maybe creating a My Department/Agency website, and could that be extended to include a My Question Time website?


Of particular concern to parents and teachers in Hasluck is the terribly managed My School website, which flies in the face of this motion's call for greater transparency and information. Through My School, the government rushed to list the individual schools' finances for greater transparency but refused to honour its commitment to list the contractual obligations of BER programs on the My School website. Surely, this would allow parents to see how money was administered and spent at their child's school. There have also been many reports of students across Australia being asked to not sit tests to stop negative results appearing on the My School website. 


In Hasluck, our students are blessed with many fantastic schools—too many to mention—but of course there are some that are struggling with teacher numbers, student attendance and the lack of funding. During this time as a teacher I found that there were literally thousands of teachers, support staff, principals, administrators, cleaners and volunteers whose enthusiasm made schools a positive place to be for students. There are many reasons that a school might not perform as well as one nearby or elsewhere in the state. Each area has its own unique people and demographics. It does not show the efforts of individual teachers in spending time with a particular student to help identify areas for improvement. It does not show the disadvantage some children have to work through to achieve. Transparency and accountability are important but this government is going the wrong way about introducing it into our schools and health systems. Encouragement and listening to the requirements of professionals are the right ways to ensure that those services that are needed are provided. All Australians deserve better from their government and I will continue to work to see that that happens.

"Laming, Andrew, MP",LP,2011-05-30,"



Mr LAMING
 (Bowman) (20:56):  It is a particularly good day to be debating this motion from the government, a day when the Courier Mail ran the banner headline 'Time to stop the waste'. With that, it focused my mind on why I am here this week. Those in my electorate in south-east Queensland are finding it really tough because of a 63 per cent increase in the cost of power and water. Families in my electorate know the challenge of making ends meet. It is in that context that we have to be very cautious about the way we approach motions like this lest we appear to not be focusing on things that are of concern to our constituents. Mums in my electorate have told me about the tough choices they have to make about whether they can afford to put their kids through swimming lessons. And there are those who went to Woolworths and found that loaves of bread were two for $6 and had to ask, 'If I give you $3, will you give me one of those loaves?' We know that 80,000 people have turned up to Salvo services around the country this year who have not done so before. When we notice that the people of Australia are struggling with cost-of-living pressures and we are focusing our attention on the expenditure of government money on the things that really matter, we must be very careful not to be too celebratory about some websites. 


I do not deny that there are one or two benefits from these websites. It should not be forgotten that the My School website was cultivated through the Howard government years and thwarted at every step by the unions and by the then Labor opposition. And the only practical benefit for ordinary people from the My Child website and the My Hospital website—and it should be noted that four per cent of Australians have looked at the My Child website and a slightly larger number have looked at the My Hospital website—is the fuel dial graphic that shows the long waiting lists and compares state averages. The practical reality is that people have very little choice about what public health services they access. In most cases, they access the public service to which their GP has referred them. So the idea that one can look at what is happening in other states, regions and even the far corners of the country to find, say, a slightly shorter waiting list for varicose vein removal is of intellectual fascination for those of us in this Committee but of almost nil practical benefit for the ordinary person who in reality will be guided by their GP as to where to have their operation.


I do not want to spend too much time on the individual policy errors of this government, but I will relate an incident in Boston when I was sitting in the back of a taxi that was being driven by a Haitian. He heard my accent and said: 'You're Australian. You have that female Prime Minister.' I said, 'That's right.' He said: 'She said before the election no carbon tax and straight after it she is talking about one. She has signed her political obituary.' I sat there stunned. As members in this place, we will be remembered by that extraordinary duplicity. That is why we have to be very careful that we do not focus on the next policy initiative that follows things like Fuelwatch, the set-top box program or the pink batts—and I will not go into the details of that. These simple things have become examples of extraordinary excess and waste. Is government largesse better than simply writing a cheque? As the Courier Mail pointed out today, 'Writing a cheque for families for $560 and saying ""Would you like the cheque or would you like the website?""' I'll take the cheque. But you did not give them a chance on the other side of the chamber. That decision was made on their behalf, how to spend their money. And so we have these dilemmas of 260 childcare centres that mums genuinely wanted but will never be built.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER

"Marino, Nola, MP",LP,2011-05-30,"



Ms MARINO
 (Forrest—Opposition Whip) (21:00):  I am raising a very serious grievance on behalf of Australian apple and pear industries, Australian fruit consumers and the Australian environment—especially those plant species that are killed by fire blight. Australia was once a biosecurity island fortress, but the brick walls of that fortress, our biosecurity and quarantine programs, have been cut back and undermined by this government. My own state of Western Australia was the envy of the world as we did not have many of the world's major pests and diseases and as a consequence our fruit industry used no more than 40 per cent of the pesticides applied annually by eastern states growers and international exporting nations. However, almost a decade ago as a result of poor quarantine management a disease called brown rot of stone fruit was allowed to enter the state and it is now endemic, costing the production industry annually tens of millions of dollars. 


The latest example of this contempt for and neglect of our border protection is the recommendation by Biosecurity Australia to abandon the need for adequate protocols to prevent the incursion of fire blight, leaf roller, apple curling midge and European canker with the importation of New Zealand apples. Fire blight is a bacterial infection found throughout New Zealand that devastates trees, leaving them with a scorched appearance that in severe cases looks like they have had a blowtorch applied to them. The Western Australian Department of Agriculture and Food advises that a serious epidemic of fire blight is likely to decrease apple and pear production by up to 50 per cent. But it is not just apples and pears. A number of other species will be affected. The control of fire blight once established will not be easy. The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service identifies sixteen genera plants that can act as hosts across Australia. That is why it is so important to prevent it getting into Australia in the first place. That is why New Zealand apples have not been allowed into Australia in the past. Of course New Zealand apple producers do not like this, and it was inevitable that they would challenge Australia's border protection through the World Trade Organisation. 


Australia should have been ready to stand up for our borders. Instead we have surrendered with barely a whimper. So why has Biosecurity Australia abandoned our borders? We can only assume it has done so because the Prime Minister has forced it to do so. There is a great episode of Yes, Minister in which Sir Humphrey is determined to prevent the minister getting his way on policy. Mr Hacker got around him by announcing publicly that what he wanted was already happening—the 'it has to happen, it's been announced' strategy. It is this form of political deception that our own Prime Minister has forced on Biosecurity Australia and by default the people of Australia. On her trip to New Zealand the Prime Minister needed a good news announcement to boost her profile so she announced that apple imports would go ahead. Therefore the border protection and quarantine of Australia were sacrificed to give this Prime Minister a good media story. Following this, Biosecurity Australia  had little choice but to sacrifice our biosecurity because the only other option was to contradict a Prime Minister. She has hung them, and us, out to dry. 


These are the same people who know what is at risk here, who for years have argued to sustain Australia's biosecurity. The latest proposals are an abandonment of the quarantine principles that have made us amongst the cleanest producers of high quality food in the world. There are no proposed uniform standards of management and inspection proposed for New Zealand orchards. Instead it is proposed to rely on New Zealand's 'integrated fruit production system'—in effect a quality assurance program managed by farmers under an accreditation system. It is not a quarantine program, it is a quality assurance program that is also used in South Africa and Argentina. Its purpose is to promote the product by standardising the fruit leaving the farm, not to prevent disease spread to another country. It is the same quality assurance program that exists in Australia. However, in Australia it is not used as an alternative to quarantine and it does not allow access for Australian fruit into any overseas market. There will be no standards applied for disease control in the orchards in New Zealand, and there may yet be no external audit of disease control in these orchards. Instead, Biosecurity Australia has pinned its hopes on every New Zealand fruit-picking back packer having a good day, on identifying diseased fruit and removing it. What are the chances of that?


In addition, the New Zealand Integrated Fruit Production system of quality assurance does not apply a measure for the maximum residue levels of antibiotics on fruit before export. Fruit arriving here can carry antibiotics including streptomycin, which is banned in Australia in the interests of preventing antibiotic resistance in human health but is still used in New Zealand.


Curiously, in its haste to abandon our strong borders, Biosecurity Australia has shown itself willing to drop its standards to below that applied by the United States. The US applies stricter quarantine protocols on New Zealand apple imports than those proposed by Biosecurity Australia. However, New Zealand has not been to the WTO to have the US protocols downgraded. Perhaps they thought Australia was an easier target and perhaps they have been proven right. Instead of relying on backpackers in New Zealand to maintain our border protection we should be demanding independent inspections of their orchards. Orchards with recorded fire blight outbreaks should not be able to export to Australia. And shipments arriving with trash—that is, the leaves and other plant debris— should be immediately rejected, as they would be by the US.


This quarantine debacle is highlighted by one astounding and very disturbing fact: Biosecurity Australia recommended protocols that allow for a minimum of 600 fruit samples from each consignment of fruit packed to be inspected and found free of quarantine pests for Australia. Six hundred pieces of fruit from each consignment may mean 600 pieces of fruit out of a number of containers of apples from a variety of sources. It may mean only one apple in a million being inspected. What do you think the chances are of finding an infected one? Simple maths tells you that it is a one-in-a-million chance.


That is the odds we are giving our national biosecurity: one in a million. The government's commitment to biosecurity is a national disgrace. Labor's 2009 federal budget slashed $35.8 million from the quarantine and biosecurity budgets, leading to the loss of 125 jobs, and reduced inspections of arriving passengers and cargo. The sum of $58 million was also slashed from the Customs budget, leading to 4.7 million fewer air cargo consignments being inspected each year and 2,150 fewer vessels being boarded on arrival. This neglect has set the trend that Labor has continued into the current budget.


In 2011, another $32.8 million was cut from the operational budget of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, reducing the capacity of the department to deliver services to Australian agriculture.


I quote from Ally Mackay, who contacted me. She said: 'WA is now importing apples and the quantity from New Zealand is well in excess of 500 tonnes each year—that is, stone fruit. As more apples and pears are imported into the Eastern States from New Zealand and China, it is only a matter of time, perhaps 12 to 18 months, before local domestic markets are in serious decline.' That is an issue, as is the issue of our biosecurity. Ally also said, 'We were the envy of the world. In Western Australia we did not have the world's major pests and diseases and that, as a consequence, our fruit industry certainly used no more than 40 per cent of the pesticides applied annually by international exporting nations.'


In my electorate, these issues are very serious. The majority of apples and pears in Western Australia are grown in my electorate. The actual growers are seriously concerned about their biosecurity. The organic growers are extremely concerned. They have been talking to me on a regular basis and I thank them for their involvement in this issue and for their genuine concern about a very serious issue. Biosecurity measures in this nation, unfortunately, are taken far too lightly. We will find that, once we have compromised that biosecurity, with fire blight, a leaf-curling midge and European canker, we may be in a position of not being able to eradicate these particular diseases. 


I condemn the government for not focusing far more on Australia's biosecurity. It appears to me that the announcement that the Prime Minister made in New Zealand pre-empted the capacity of Biosecurity to be able to manage the risk that goes with importing apples from New Zealand.
