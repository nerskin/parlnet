Mr GRAY
 (Brand—Special Minister of State and Minister for the Public Service and Integrity) (09:35):  I move:


That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: Construction of a new Australian Embassy complex including Chancery and Head of Mission Residence in Bangkok, Thailand.


The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade proposes to construct a new purpose-built embassy complex, including a chancery and head-of-mission residence, in Bangkok, Thailand, at an estimated cost of $190.8 million. Following the terrorist bomb attack at the Australian Embassy in Jakarta in 2004 and a global review of physical security at Australia's overseas missions, the government approved the relocation of the Bangkok embassy complex on security grounds. The new site will enable appropriate setbacks for the chancery and head-of-mission residence buildings for blast mitigation while the buildings themselves will be designed to mitigate blast.


The Australian government constructed the existing buildings in 1979 for use as a chancery and head-of mission residence. The new development proposal is driven by the imperative to provide more secure accommodation. The new embassy complex will be on leased land adjacent to the Embassy of Japan in the Pathum Wan district of Bangkok, which is in the same general district as the current embassy. As well as providing appropriate physical security, the project will deliver a modern, functional chancery building to accommodate tenant agencies as well as provision of a new official residence for the ambassador, family members and high-level visitors.


As a major overseas mission, the Bangkok embassy is significant in representational terms and also acts as a hub for other Australian missions in the region. The new facilities will be capable of catering for the large range of representational functions that will be undertaken at the chancery. Through the use of public spaces, conference rooms and outdoor areas as well as the official representational areas of the head-of-mission residence, the buildings will accommodate events such as official receptions, exhibitions and trade displays, meetings, lectures and business missions.


In its report, the Public Works Committee recommended that these works should proceed, subject to the recommendations of the committee. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade accepts and will implement those recommendations. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction of the major works package could commence in October 2013, with practical completion in late March 2016, followed by security and furniture fit-out. Occupation of the complex is scheduled for around June 2016.


On behalf of the government, I thank the committee for its support. I commend the motion to the House.

That, in accordance with the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act 1969, it is expedient to carry out the following proposed work which was referred to the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and on which the committee has duly reported to Parliament: HMAS Albatross redevelopment, Nowra, NSW.


HMAS Albatross is the centre of the Royal Australian Navy's maritime aviation capability, supporting the operations of one training helicopter squadron and two operational helicopter squadrons. This proposal, at an estimated cost of $192 million, plus GST, will upgrade and replace ageing, obsolete and in some cases potentially unsafe infrastructure to improve the functionality and capability of the facilities at HMAS Albatross to support Navy's training and operational requirements. 


The proposal will provide:


(a) comprehensive engineering services upgrades;


(b) new and refurbished working accommodation;


(c) a new hot refuelling capability;


(d) works to provide increased future airside development space; and


(e) demolition of redundant facilities of HMAS Albatross


The capital invested in the project will have economic benefits for the Shoalhaven region and local industry, with significant opportunities for subcontractors and the construction industry over the next three years.


In its report the Public Works Committee has recommended that these works proceed. Subject to parliamentary approval, construction is expected to begin next year, with completion expected in mid-2015. On behalf of the government I would like to thank the committee for its support, and I commend the motion to the House.

Ms O'NEILL
 (Robertson) (10:02):  As we drew towards the adjournment debate last night, I was speaking about this legislation, the Corporations Amendment (Phoenixing and Other Measures) Bill 2012, and how it makes modern sense of the previous regulations requiring companies that had become failed companies to advise people, the public, through the usual broadsheet method of getting that advice into a regular publication. However, the world has moved on somewhat since broadsheets were the only way of communicating about businesses that had become insolvent and the reality is that Australians use the internet to find very important information that impacts on their lives. That is one of the key things that this bill will bring into being: the opportunity for ordinary Australian citizens who have been impacted by a failed business to be able, in a free and easily accessible way, to go to a website and find out about the company that they might have a particular interest in. This is very important for the sorts of people that we are seeking to represent here, ordinary working families who, through no fault of their own, have found themselves with an unscrupulous sort of employer who has sought to use their labour and not pay for that labour. So this is a very significant modernisation dimension that is embedded in the bill.


Obviously, one of the things that we hope this bill will achieve is to make sure that power is given to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to ensure that people have the security that they need in this situation where companies fail. Our concern, as a Labor Party putting forward this piece of legislation, is particularly as to the employees of such companies as those that become failed companies. We understand that when a company fails employees can miss out on some or all of their entitlements: unpaid wages and other accrued benefits. The General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme, GEERS, will certainly protect those workers' entitlements in these situations and make sure that the workers can actually recoup as much as possible of their entitlements as quickly as possible.


The reality is that some companies will fail. At that time when they fail, if it is a genuine failure and not one that has been orchestrated, the reality is that they might not have quite the agency to go through the proper processes to wind up their own company. This bill will give ASIC the power that it needs to place a company into liquidation and to deregister a company where the company itself has failed to take that action. So, in essence, this bill, which I commend to the House, is one that will certainly benefit the business sector and employees. It paves the way for a much more streamlined and cost-effective process involving the publication of insolvency notices via a single, publicly available website and it gives the benefit to creditors of companies in external administration by absolutely reducing the costs of complying with their regulatory obligations. So for those particular reasons and many other good elements that are embedded in the bill I commend it to the House.

"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2012-03-01,"



Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff) (10:05):  I am certainly pleased to rise to speak on the Corporations Amendment (Phoenixing and Other Measures) Bill 2012. As the Deputy Chair of the Standing Committee on Economics, I note the committee was a tipping point in terms of the discussion and debate surrounding whether or not the coalition would support this particular piece of legislation and whether or not we would support the initiative that the government has taken.


Let us start with the areas that we have in common. The reality is that the coalition, like the government, is concerned about phoenixing activity. There can be no doubt that directors participating in knowingly setting up companies whereby they transfer assets from indebted company A to unindebted company B—with the full intent, by doing so, of avoiding their obligations and indebtedness from company A—is among the worst types of activities that companies can participate in. The consequences of phoenixing activity are significant. Unfortunately, we see it all too often on the Australian economic landscape. There are estimations that the economic cost to the Australian economy of phoenixing activity is around $2½ billion a year. As well, there is a very real human cost associated with phoenixing activity. There are those who are left without access to entitlements and there are creditors who are left without access to cash flow, which of course has a cascading effect across corporate Australia. In particular, those who are generally most affected are tradies. 


Phoenixing activity is something that does require action. But this is not a new thing. It is not that we have become aware of phoenixing only in the last 12 months. Indeed, there have been a suite of inquiries, of consultations and of previous pieces of legislation that have gone toward addressing phoenixing activity. Unfortunately, though, because this bill was not put to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics—or, rather, was put to it but was then discharged by the Labor members of the committee—we were not able to investigate in any way whether these increases in ASIC's powers to notionally address the issue of phoenixing activity are actually the right medicine for the problem. We were not able to take into account the concerns of, for example, the Australian Institute of Company Directors, among others. We were not able to take into account feedback from the small business sector. We were not able to take into account feedback from across the corporate community about whether the big increase in ASIC's powers that would be provided for under this legislation is in fact what is required to address phoenixing activity. We know that there are already at ASIC's disposal a raft of corporate powers to deal with the phoenixing activity. We know that ASIC has the ability to, for example, ban company directors for up to five years—or longer, with a court order—if that is what they seek to do, and they can do that with phoenixing activity.


Why has that not proven to be effective? We do not know. We have not been given the opportunity to know, because this bill was discharged from the economics committee. That is the reason the coalition has adopted what I think is a good approach to this piece of legislation—that is, that the government is required to live up to a certain burden of proof to demonstrate why ASIC's powers should be expanded and why this will be effective at addressing phoenixing activity. In the absence of robust arguments put forward by the Labor Party about why this is a requirement and why it will be effective this time—as opposed to previous occasions when it was, apparently, shown to be ineffective—the coalition cannot stand by and enable ASIC's powers to be significantly increased. That would have a consequent impact across the Australia community—in particular on small businesses, due to the raft of additional compliance burdens and concerns when dealing with ASIC.


In many respects it is that difference in approach that underscores the difference in philosophy between the Labor Party and the coalition. We stand ready and willing to help to address the issue of phoenixing activity, but we need to hear solid arguments. We need to hear robust proposals about why certain initiatives that are being looked at with a view to being undertaken will prove to be effective. I know that many in the corporate sector take the view that the principal problem here is not so much the powers available to ASIC or that there is not scope already available under the Corporations Act, for example, to deal with phoenixing activity but, rather, an inability for ASIC to appropriately tackle the issue of phoenixing because perhaps they are not appropriately resourced. The government wants to avoid scrutiny on this. The government does not want to 'let the sun shine in', which I believe were the words the Prime Minister used. It seems unfortunate that that would be the approach adopted by the Labor Party—an 'our way or the highway' attitude towards this bill. The fact is that there could easily be a bipartisan approach to this issue. There could easily be the coalition and the Labor Party working together. 


It is not good enough for the Labor Party to say, 'It's our way or the highway'. It is not good enough for the Labor Party to say, 'We're going to introduce this raft of new powers for ASIC and you should get on board.' The fact is that powers exist already. The regulator has at its disposal a number of initiatives that can be undertaken. Company directors can be prosecuted for phoenixing activity. If phoenixing activity is rampant, why is it not working? Why is ASIC not already using the powers at its disposal? We have not heard those arguments being put forward by the Labor Party. Instead, we are just told: 'This suite of new powers should be delivered up to ASIC and if the consequences are that it's a massive additional piece of compliance for the small business sector across Australia, tough luck.' We disagree. We will always stand on the side of small business. We will always stand on the side of those who take the view that there are and should be, appropriately, curbs on the power of government and on its regulators because they need to demonstrate why additional powers are required. It is a basic approach that we apply to policing, so why should it not be a basic approach that we apply to company policing?


The bill before the House today gives ASIC significant new discretionary powers—I emphasise 'discretionary powers'—to place a company into liquidation, and these powers can be used in a range of circumstances: where a company is six months late responding to a compliance notice and has not lodged other Corporations Act documents in the preceding 18 months; where ASIC has no reason to believe a company is carrying on a business and no objection to liquidation is received from directors; where a company's review fee has not been paid within 12 months; and where a company has been reregistered in the preceding six months and ASIC has reason to believe it is in the public interest to place the company into liquidation. Those are broad powers, especially the last one. Many would say, 'Look, don't be concerned. ASIC's never going to do the wrong thing. We just need to trust the regulator to always make the correct decision.' I think a higher level of responsibility is owed. I believe that regulators are accountable, back to this chamber. It is my belief that companies have a responsibility to comply with the law. Where you have rogue companies that are not complying and where you have company directors who are participating in phoenixing activity, of course everyone on the coalition side and I suspect on the Labor Party side would take the view that those company directors should be disqualified. But that is not a good enough justification to give a broadbrush power to ASIC because ASIC takes a view that it is in the public interest that there should be an ability to liquidate a company. We think it is important that the regulator understands that we are willing to work with it, if resourcing is the issue; but we need to know what the problem is. The laws exist now. Why are they not effective? Do not simply hand down, like Moses on the mountain, a new template that says, 'These are the new laws and they shall be obeyed.' Rather, the obligation is upon the Labor Party to demonstrate why these new laws are necessary. 


Incidentally, Senator Nick Sherry, a previous Assistant Treasurer with the Labor Party—one of the five or six that Labor has had in the past four years—outlined, I believe, 11 recommendations to deal with phoenixing activity. None of them, not a single one, is incorporated in this bill. This was a Labor Assistant Treasurer—perhaps that is why they have gone through five or six in the past four years—who put forward recommendations on how to deal with phoenixing activity, and those recommendations are absent from this bill. If that does not underscore what a completely ad hoc approach the Labor Party has taken to this issue then I do not know a more compelling argument than that. The fact is that there is scope to take a much more logistically appropriate and strategic approach to phoenixing activity. 


I am also concerned about comments that were made, for example, by the chairman of the law committee for the Australian Institute of Company Directors. Professor Bob Baxt, who is a distinguished competition law expert. He made some comments to a previous inquiry that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics undertook at the end of last year—when I was not the deputy chair—which was dealing with the issue of phoenixing activity. He said:


There is too much legislation introduced on the basis of, 'It's a good idea; let's do something and we will see where it takes us.' … For the phoenix company and the phoenix director, there are processes in place which suggest that the regulator has the power to deal with them. Why should all of us be subject to those rather burdensome laws just because there are one or two who may have escaped the safety net? 


That illustrates the difference in the philosophical approach between the Labor Party and the coalition. When we say we are trying to get the monkey off the back of small business, when we say we are trying to nurture an entrepreneurial spirit within the Australian community and when we say we understand the trials and tribulations of being a small business person, we mean it. That is the reason we take positions on, for example, this bill. We have not heard the threshold being met by the Labor Party in its justification for why these additional powers are warranted. The Labor Party is devoid of any motivation, it seems, to outline the case. That is why we say: put this legislation now to a Senate inquiry, given that it was discharged from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics. Let us put it to a Senate inquiry and let us get the evidence out there. Let us understand why this suite of new powers is a requirement. 


Perhaps the reason the Labor Party just does not get small business is that there is no small business man or woman among them. There may have been one or two who have walked into a small business. I am sure the member for Kingsford-Smith, who is at the table, has walked into a couple of small businesses in his time. In fact, he is actually probably the closest thing they have got to a small businessman on that side of the chamber—although it was a little bit more than a small business, wasn't it? There is no doubt that those opposite just do not understand the mind of a small business man or woman. They do not understand that compliance is a big issue. Small business people do not have people working away in offices in tall towers making sure that they can tick all the boxes and dot all the i's and cross all the t's when it comes to compliance; rather, the compliance burden is something that is met by the small business principal themselves. More often than not it is a husband and wife team and more often than not there is only one employee in the business, and that is the owner. These are the people who face the consequences of big increases in ASIC powers and big increases in compliance. For this reason, we say there is a burden of proof that must be met by the Labor Party if they want to increase those powers. 


Let us put this legislation through the Senate inquiry process. I say to the government: it is time to stop running away from scrutiny; it is time to actually justify why additional powers are required, if, indeed, they are required; and it is time to show why existing laws are falling short, if, indeed, they are falling short. On each of these basic tests, I believe any reasonable Australian would understand that these are not high thresholds to meet. They are basic questions that should be answered. If they were answered by the government then I have no doubt that we would actually have a bipartisan position on the legislation. Until such time as the government answers those questions and until such time as the government meets that burden of proof, we will stand opposed to additional compliance. We will stand opposed to broadbrush increases in powers for ASIC, until the government has demonstrated why they are necessary and how they will work.

"Grierson, Sharon, MP",ALP,2012-03-01,"



Ms GRIERSON
 (Newcastle) (10:20):  I rise to speak in support of the Corporations Amendment (Phoenixing and Other Measures) Bill 2012. I particularly commend the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer for his efforts in developing this legislation, as it is another significant step in our proud Labor tradition of standing up for and protecting the rights of Australian workers. As its namesake, the bird from Greek mythology suggests, the practice of 'phoenixing' in business refers to collapsed and abandoned companies with outstanding debts to creditors and employees, and then these companies later 'rise from the ashes', usually disguised, thinly, under a new trading name.


I have heard many of the opposition speakers oppose this bill. They say that there is no need for this new legislation. That is not true. ASIC was under-resourced under the Howard government. I think it worked out of a broom cupboard—and I say that from my experience on the Public Accounts and Audit Committee. It was starved of resources. What did we see as a result of that? We saw a global financial crisis that unfortunately saw bad practice. We saw many people lose their livelihoods, their savings, their superannuation entitlements and their holiday entitlements. We saw contractors who were never paid. We saw bad business. 


I heard the member the Moncrieff say that his party will always stand up for small business. Well, we will always stand up for good business. Good business is what we need in this country—good entrepreneurs. So many times through the GFC we saw good businesses disclose their problems to their workers, their employees and their suppliers and contractors, and work hand in hand to make things work. There is a spirit of goodwill out there in the workplace with business. There are good representative groups and bodies that, when consulted, can offer good advice. We saw many examples of good business making supreme efforts so that workers would not lose everything. We also saw workers give up hours and go to part time to get through those times.


We are talking today about phoenixing companies. Apparently it is not a big problem—there is no evidence. Well, I quote from the Age of 3 January: 


According to the Australian Taxation Office, there are about 6000 phoenix companies in Australia …


If that is correct, that is far too many. The practice costs our economy billions of dollars a year, and I believe it must be dealt with firmly. In 2010, our Labor government made the election commitment to provide the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, ASIC, with additional administrative powers to wind up companies that have been abandoned with workers and creditors left high and dry.


This bill is a key element of our government's Protecting Workers' Entitlements 2010 election commitment, and we honour that in this legislation. This legislation is a critical step in assisting the remuneration of employees for work that they have carried out in instances where a company has failed in its duty to make payments. Employees in affected companies have in many cases unfairly lost pay they are entitled to and benefits such as their accrued long service leave, holiday pay and superannuation due to cowboy practices and the abandonment of companies.


The federal government's GEERS is currently only able to assist employees in accessing their entitlements once an abandoned company has been formally placed into liquidation. It is a loophole that has existed for far too long. As the law stands, ASIC is required to undertake lengthy court procedures and incur associated legal costs in order to wind up a company and place it into liquidation. Only then may employees access GEERS.


Through the phoenixing and other measures bill, corporate watchdog ASIC will be given the authority to directly place an abandoned company into liquidation where it is believed that the company has ceased operation or where a company has deregistered but not formally liquidated. Currently, if an abandoned company has deregistered with ASIC, employees seeking their entitlements, or ASIC itself, must first apply through the courts to officially reinstate the company so that then, and only then, can it be placed into liquidation. This is unnecessary and complicated red tape that does little to help the immediate needs of unpaid employees or contractors who simply want what they are entitled to—a fair go and fair payment.


To address this frustrating and costly complication, the legislation will provide ASIC with the additional power to place a company into liquidation in cases where ASIC is currently only able to deregister a company. Not only will it give ASIC the power to reinstate deregistered companies, immediately place them into liquidation and thereby render employees eligible for GEERS; the legislation allows ASIC to place a company into liquidation without the need to provide notice where there is reasonable objective evidence that the company is no longer carrying on business as usual. Such evidence may, for example, be failure to pay a review fee. It is an important step that we amend the Corporations Act. Workers and contractors, but particularly employees, should expect to receive what they are entitled to without a second thought.


Another key aspect of the phoenixing and other measures bill sets down regulations regarding the publication of notices relating to the events before, during and after a company's administration. Currently, throughout the course of administration, there are a range of notices that are required to be published in either print media or the ASICGazette. In complying with these requirements, this publication obligation means substantial costs to external administrators, which is then of course passed on to already out-of-pocket creditors. In addition to this, the creditors also incur the cost associated with monitoring media activity, searching numerous newspapers for notices that may be relevant. Of course, they are often just national newspapers; regional newspapers are often overlooked. There is no set day of the week that those notices would appear. It is a confusing system.


This legislation aims to amend that, with the establishment of one central and publicly available website by ASIC. Being the direct point of publication for notices relating to corporate insolvency, the website will be accessible, searchable and ever-present, removing the need for hard-copy publication. The legislation establishes a coherent and affordable means by which to inform creditors, in a prescribed manner, through the publication of those notices online. This legislation is about ensuring information is easily and readily accessible, particularly for employees. This is a modern and necessary reform of the way in which we protect the entitlements of working people. The website will be established through ASIC by 1 July 2012. This legislation is another measure in harmonising Australia's insolvency industry. Over the coming four years, approximately 53,000 newspaper advertisements will be placed with the website, cutting the red tape, cutting costs for external administrators and reducing the burden on already affected creditors. Over this period, the use of the website will save around $15 million in print media advertising fees. I know the print media may not be pleased about that, but certainly we need to make those savings. This is a positive step our government is taking towards reducing the costs associated with compliance and regulation obligations.


There have been some serious cases locally, in and around my electorate of Newcastle, involving phoenixing activity. In 2006 I raised in the parliamentary committee process the Chinese-backed development and construction company Hightrade with ASIC. At that time, under the Howard government, ASIC had, as I said, very little powers to pursue such companies. The Newcastle Herald's Joanne McCarthy and the CFMEU's Andrew Ferguson went after the elusive Hightrade throughout that time, and I commend them for what was a sustained and consistent effort on their part towards making the company accountable to its creditors and employees through their public campaign. Contractors and suppliers, investors and workers all lost out. At the time, the ATO brought a case against Hightrade before the Federal Court—another very costly exercise. The behaviour of phoenix companies, such as Hightrade and other development and construction companies, has in the past demonstrated a failure to meet superannuation obligations as well. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit has consistently pursued the behaviour of such companies with the Commissioner of Taxation, something I am very proud of. At the time that the Herald were pursuing these matters, I stated in the Herald that the commissioner had agreed with me that 10 prosecutions of company executives for phoenix-type behaviour since 2000 was not satisfactory, and that this area of corporate behaviour was deserving of further attention from the ATO as well as ASIC.


I am pleased that legislative reform to combat phoenix companies has been considered and that in this parliament we are now seeing practical measures brought forward in legislation to combat phoenix companies and mitigate the negative effect they have on our community. Bad corporate behaviour can never be justified for any reason. I draw attention to the case of the roof contractor and former Australian Wallaby, Michael Martin, who lost hundreds of thousands of dollars when Hightrade company Reica Constructions avoided their tax and creditor debts and was wound up in 2006 during the construction of the Hunter Valley Resort at Pokolbin. As Joanne McCarthy reported in the Herald on 3 November 2009, 'The Tax Office was left the biggest creditor, owed $36 million'. That is us—every taxpayer being taken down by a bad company. There have been far too few powers for authorities to act in a timely and cost-effective manner to benefit those who have lost out due to corporate mischief. I am pleased that this legislation is working towards a better system.


As stated, the Corporations Amendment (Phoenixing and Other Measures) Bill 2012 is a key component of the government's Protecting Workers' Entitlements Package, announced at the last election. Other elements at the core of the government's package are the Fair Entitlements Guarantee, Securing Super, and Strengthening Corporate and Taxation Law, under which this and other legislation fall. Through no fault of their own, workers are losing their entitlements when companies are abandoned or where business behaves badly. Why should workers—people we know—have to worry about being paid an honest salary for an honest day's work? We will continue to pursue these sorts of reforms.


The Fair Entitlements Guarantee, which is currently undergoing a rigorous consultation process with stakeholders before being introduced as legislation, will alter the existing GEERS program so that employee entitlements cannot be abolished or amended easily by employers. In supporting these commitments, changes have already been made to the GEERS scheme prior to the guarantee being enshrined in legislation. Our government has removed the previous 16-week cap on redundancy pay and 'excluded employees', such as company directors, are no longer able to access assistance under GEERS. If an employee is owed money, they should be paid in full—not just 16 weeks and be left out of pocket. This is about fairness and some certainty. It is about cutting the red tape and ensuring quick and easy access to entitlements.


The second core element of the Protecting Workers' Entitlements Package is securing superannuation. Our government is strengthening compliance measures and ensuring that employees receive what they are entitled to. The Australian Taxation Office and the Fair Work Ombudsman have been given greater enforcement powers, ensuring that businesses pay their employees' superannuation guarantee. We also introduced legislation this morning to make it compulsory for employers to show on a payslip the anticipated date that an employee's superannuation contribution will be paid. Previously, it was only required that the amount be known. There have been too many cases of people who, when a company goes into liquidation and closes down, find their superannuation payments have not been made.


Thirdly, we are strengthening corporate and taxation law, giving ASIC more muscle by increasing the penalties against companies that wrong their employees and wrong their creditors. The Corporations Amendment (Phoenixing and Other Measures) Bill is a component of this. Again, in addition to this bill, the Corporations Amendment (Similar Names) Bill will be brought before the House in the near future. Currently out for consultation, the similar names bill will aim to further crack down on practices whereby company directors establish a phoenix company using a similar name to the initial failed company. The bill will fairly and justly impose personal liability upon those directors for the creditor debts of the failed company.


Certainly, under that similar names bill and those penalties for directors, there is nothing wrong with establishing a new business after a business has failed. We understand that. It is fine to have a second chance, as long as creditors and employees have been treated fairly, debts have been dealt with and directors have acted in a responsible fashion. Outlaw directors should be held liable for their exploitative behaviour. Unfortunately, in some cases, there does seem to be very deliberate actions with no intent to ever pay the workers or the creditors.


The suite of bills and action that this government is taking will ensure that directors cannot continue to sink deeper and deeper into debt through phoenixing practice and shirk their obligations. I thank again the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer for their work on this bill and know it will be of immense benefit to working people in my electorate and those small creditors often existing week-by-week around the country. It is legislation that only a Labor government would deliver. Sadly, it was not in place during the GFC when we saw so much burden placed on people, when they chose those sorts of options to get out of debt—options that saw people suffer—rather than take responsible action. It is legislation that is very much needed and, unfortunately, we have had to deliver and we will deliver. It is ultimately about a fair go for working Australians. I commend this bill to the House.

"Irons, Steve, MP",LP,2012-03-01,"



Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (10:35):  I rise to speak on the Corporations Amendment (Phoenixing and Other Measures) Bill 2012. I have heard the contribution of the member for Newcastle during which she said this legislation would deal with bad company directors. The problem with the legislation, which goes to the nub of it, is that there is no direct definition of 'phoenixing'. This is the argument that the coalition makes.


I say at the outset that I have a background in small business and own a small business that I started in Perth in 1988. The member for Wentworth is present in the chamber, but my business is in no way relevant to the size of his business and his background in business. I was fortunate enough to be mentored and advised in business by Rob Dunn. One of the many lessons I learnt was fiscal discipline, along with 'don't be afraid to build up assets in the company', which is the company's strength, particularly when dealing with banks and creditors. This bill also goes to the nub of dealing with assets of companies.


There are not that many people in this parliament who have business experience, which is disappointing. I know that there are members on this side of the House who have run their own business, like the member for Fadden, who will speak on this bill later on. We have heard from the member for Moncrieff who put the coalition's position so well and spoke of our attitude towards phoenixing and how that should be dealt with in the legislation. If we look across to the Labor benches we see that there are very few who have the experience of running a business. Certainly, being a lawyer for a union does not qualify you to say that you have run a business. Unfortunately, unless you have walked the walk you are sadly behind the eight ball about how business works and how insolvencies in business come about. It shows in the quality of the bill that we are debating today. Before I turn to the bill, I want to speak on this government's record on small business. Before the 2007 election, the Labor Party made a commitment, a promise to the Australian people that there would be a 'one in, one out' approach to regulating business in order to cut red tape. Since Labor was elected it has introduced 16,173 new regulations and only repealed 79, clearly breaking its 'one in, one out' promise to cut red tape. That is 204 new or amended regulations for every one repealed. This is a spectacular broken promise by this government, to go with the carbon tax and the private health insurance broken promises, and it is one that is being felt by many thousands of businesses around Australia and in my electorate of Swan.


In the area of compliance, there is a clear difference between the coalition's approach and the Labor Party's approach to small business. The coalition has a deregulation task force and is committed to reducing red tape to encourage employment in this sector during a tough time. The Labor Party, as I said, have introduced over 16,000 regulations in just four years. They just do not understand business, its difficulties and its importance to the economy during difficult trading conditions. I heard the member for Robertson saying that their side of the House do get business and that they value that small businesses are the major employers of people in Australia. Well, I ask the member and all members on the other side of the House to come into this place and explain to small business why you keep punishing them with new regulations and taxes.  


As an example of more punishment to small business, I quote from an article in the Australian, about the sudden decision to wind up the $320 million solar hot-water program, which:


… left the industry reeling and sparked warnings that up to 7200 jobs were in jeopardy. 


The Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change, Mark Dreyfus, angered the solar hot-water industry by giving five minutes' notice on Tuesday night that no more applications for solar hot-water rebates would be accepted under the Renewable Energy Bonus Scheme.


The report went on to say:


The latest solar row follows turmoil in the insulation industry after the pink batts scheme was scrapped in the wake of poor installations, training and accountability, and the blowout in the Green Loans scheme, where the assessors were swamped with demand.


The government was also forced to act to end a glut in renewable energy certificates sparked by generous subsidies for rooftop solar panels. The glut forced down the price of renewable energy certificates and sparked an investment strike in big clean energy projects.


Clean Energy Council acting chief executive Kane Thornton said the ""unexpected"" winding up of the solar hot-water program would immediately hit sales and ""put more than 1200 manufacturing jobs and 6000 installation jobs at risk … Cutting this program without warning in the middle of a financial year is yet another example of stop-start policymaking that continues to plague the entire clean energy sector"".


…   …   …


Rheem Australia government relations manager Gareth Jennings said his company, which makes the Solarhart range, was left holding millions of dollars in stock for which there may no longer be a market.


…   …   …


Solar hot-water system manufacturer Dux said it had been expecting the scheme to end on June 30 and many dealers and plumbers around Australia had expressed ""disbelief"" at the decision. ""This was completely out of the blue,"" general manager Simon Terry said.


Unfortunately, the bill before the House today is yet another messy example of the government's lack of understanding, and it needs some serious work before it should be allowed through the House of Representatives. This bill attempts to tackle the practice of 'phoenixing' or 'phoenix activity', which, as the shadow minister has said, is typically associated with directors who transfer the assets of an indebted company into a new company of which they are also directors. The directors then place the initial company into administration or liquidation, with no assets to pay employee entitlements or to pay creditors such as contractors and the ATO. Meanwhile the same  directors continue the business using the new company structure.


The coalition is strongly opposed to fraudulent phoenix activity as it undermines confidence in Australia's business community and damages its reputation. However, we are concerned that the government's approach to this important public policy matter is confused, ad hoc, piecemeal and not appropriately targeted. As such, we believe this bill needs redrafting and suggest that the government goes back to the drawing board. If the government is not prepared to do this, this current legislation we are discussing today needs at the very least a thorough examination by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee.


I note that shadow minister Cormann has suggested that this legislation is so poor that a wider inquiry should be undertaken by the Senate Economics References Committee to canvass all options of reforming the law surrounding phoenix activity and make recommendations to the parliament for comprehensive and coherent legislative change. Madam Deputy Speaker, I know it is a strong call to suggest that this legislation go back to the drawing board, that even amending it will not suffice, so let me take you through some of the reasons that have led the coalition to take this position.


There are at least seven problematic areas which need to be addressed, and I think at the outset it is worth reminding the House that this is not the first attempt by this government to get these laws right. Last year, the government introduced a series of different measures targeting some aspects of phoenix activity, in the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 8) Bill 2011 and the Pay As You Go Withholding Non-compliance Tax Bill 2011. After examining these bills, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics made the unanimous and bipartisan recommendation that the government not proceed with those provisions, with the committee in particular noting the concerns from the business community and its representatives that the bills potentially apply to the broad range of directors, whether engaged in phoenix activity or not. As a result of this, the government withdrew the legislation, supposedly to take this on board. However, it would appear from this legislation before the House today that the government has not attempted or managed to solve this problem it set out to solve. In fact, it has yet to provide any indication as to how it will tighten the provisions to better target phoenix activity as recommended by the committee.


 Government speakers such as the member for Wills, who is speaking next, need to explain why this issue has not been solved as per the unanimous decision of the Senate committee. The bill should not progress until this matter is addressed. This is the first problem with the legislation. Part of this problem might be the fact that there has been no attempt to define 'phoenix activities' in any of the bills the government has introduced dealing with this area. A  proper definition is needed, not only to better target the legislation but to avoid costly legal disputes down the track and give confidence to the sector. We have seen the embarrassment caused to Australia by the legal disputes this government has landed us in. The Malaysian deal High Court fiasco, which the member for Griffith called a 'walk on the policy wild side' was reported around the world—in Asia and on the BBC—and cost our international reputation dearly. There is another storm brewing with the High Court case considering the tobacco plain packaging legislation, and it is difficult to have full confidence in the government's assertion that its legislation is constitutional and will not cost billions of dollars. To have no definition of 'phoenix' in the Corporations Amendment (Phoenixing and Other Measures) Bill 2012 is quite frankly unbelievable, and for this reason alone this bill should not proceed. At present the Australian Institute of Company Directors does not have confidence in this legislation because of this very point. If we refer back to the speech by the member for Parramatta yesterday, she said:


I will go back to some of the comments that the shadow Treasurer made. His comments were about phoenixing more generally. Of course this piece of legislation does not deal with the entire phoenixing behaviour. Of course this legislation does not involve all of the changes that need to be made in order to reduce phoenix activity and protect consumers and creditors from that activity. Of course there is other work to be done.


If the member for Parramatta is saying that, why are we even debating this bill? The member for Parramatta has admitted that this bill is not sufficient.


However, there are other reasons why this bill should not be passed through the House, and these should also be considered by members in the House today as they decide which way they will vote. One of them relates to schedule 1 of the bill, an amendment that allows ASIC to put a company into liquidation in a series of specific circumstances. These circumstances include where a company is at least six months late responding to a compliance notice issued by ASIC under section 348A, 'return of particulars', and has not lodged any other documents under the Corporations Act in the preceding 18 months; ASIC has no reason to believe the company is carrying on a business; and ASIC has reason to believe that it is in the public interest. They include where the company's review fee has not been paid in full within 12 months of the due date. They also include where a company has been reregistered under section 601AH(1) within the preceding six months, and ASIC has reason to believe that it is in the public interest. And they include where ASIC has no reason to believe that the company is carrying on a business, ASIC gives 20 days notice to the company and its directors of the liquidation and no objection is received from the directors or the company within the specified time limits. Before making such an order, ASIC must give notice on the ASIC database as well as publish its intention. ASIC cannot put a company into liquidation under this schedule if an application for the winding up of the company is before the courts.


The coalition is concerned about the significant increase in ASIC power represented by the bill and, in particular, the lack of provisions relating to the parliamentary scrutiny of these proposed powers. One of the major issues identified as contributing to the phoenix activity is that the regulators are not fully utilising the existing powers available to them. Other issues include a lack of prosecutions, under-resourced regulators, insufficient follow-up on complaints and inadequate penalties to act as a deterrent. ASIC is Australia's corporate regulator and has a very important role to play; however, the need for new and additional powers appears superfluous given that the regulators are not fully utilising their existing powers because of a lack of resources or otherwise. There certainly does not seem to be much clear thinking by the government in the way it is proposing to grant these powers over the course of many different pieces of federal legislation and in an uncoordinated manner.


As the shadow minister said, we strongly recommend that the government ceases this ad hoc and piecemeal approach, withdraws the current bill and instead engages in meaningful consultation with stakeholders to address their legitimate concerns and to determine a comprehensive and coordinated legislative approach to this important public policy matter.


There are a number of other, broader issues with this bill, in particular relating to the government's approach to phoenix activity, which have been raised by members speaking prior to me on this matter. These include how effective previous regulatory efforts have been in combating this practice, the appropriateness of available penalties and the lack of recognition by the government of the role and capacity of liquidators in tackling phoenix activity. These unresolved issues also detract from the legislation and should be considered by members.


So where should the government go from here? It should withdraw this legislation and go back to the drawing board. If not, at the very least this government should refer the matter to the economics committee and in fact, given that through its ad hoc approach the government has clearly demonstrated that it has a poor understanding of this area of business, the Senate committee should be drafted in to help consider these issues in a full and holistic way.


For future legislation, the government might consider the proposals paper on combating phoenix activities released in November 2009 by Nick Sherry, who was then Assistant Treasurer. None of the 11 proposals in that paper are reflected in the new ASIC powers outlined in this legislation. It reminds me of the review conducted by the member for Oxley, the Ripoll review, which, sadly for that member, was almost completely ignored by the government. I note that the member for Oxley has also spoken on this bill.


As I and other members on this side of the House have said, this is a poor bill and we will not be supporting it.


Debate adjourned.

"O'Neill, Deb, MP",ALP,2012-03-01,"



Ms O'NEILL
 (Robertson) (10:02):  As we drew towards the adjournment debate last night, I was speaking about this legislation, the Corporations Amendment (Phoenixing and Other Measures) Bill 2012, and how it makes modern sense of the previous regulations requiring companies that had become failed companies to advise people, the public, through the usual broadsheet method of getting that advice into a regular publication. However, the world has moved on somewhat since broadsheets were the only way of communicating about businesses that had become insolvent and the reality is that Australians use the internet to find very important information that impacts on their lives. That is one of the key things that this bill will bring into being: the opportunity for ordinary Australian citizens who have been impacted by a failed business to be able, in a free and easily accessible way, to go to a website and find out about the company that they might have a particular interest in. This is very important for the sorts of people that we are seeking to represent here, ordinary working families who, through no fault of their own, have found themselves with an unscrupulous sort of employer who has sought to use their labour and not pay for that labour. So this is a very significant modernisation dimension that is embedded in the bill.


Obviously, one of the things that we hope this bill will achieve is to make sure that power is given to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission to ensure that people have the security that they need in this situation where companies fail. Our concern, as a Labor Party putting forward this piece of legislation, is particularly as to the employees of such companies as those that become failed companies. We understand that when a company fails employees can miss out on some or all of their entitlements: unpaid wages and other accrued benefits. The General Employee Entitlements and Redundancy Scheme, GEERS, will certainly protect those workers' entitlements in these situations and make sure that the workers can actually recoup as much as possible of their entitlements as quickly as possible.


The reality is that some companies will fail. At that time when they fail, if it is a genuine failure and not one that has been orchestrated, the reality is that they might not have quite the agency to go through the proper processes to wind up their own company. This bill will give ASIC the power that it needs to place a company into liquidation and to deregister a company where the company itself has failed to take that action. So, in essence, this bill, which I commend to the House, is one that will certainly benefit the business sector and employees. It paves the way for a much more streamlined and cost-effective process involving the publication of insolvency notices via a single, publicly available website and it gives the benefit to creditors of companies in external administration by absolutely reducing the costs of complying with their regulatory obligations. So for those particular reasons and many other good elements that are embedded in the bill I commend it to the House.

"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2012-03-01,"



Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff) (10:05):  I am certainly pleased to rise to speak on the Corporations Amendment (Phoenixing and Other Measures) Bill 2012. As the Deputy Chair of the Standing Committee on Economics, I note the committee was a tipping point in terms of the discussion and debate surrounding whether or not the coalition would support this particular piece of legislation and whether or not we would support the initiative that the government has taken.


Let us start with the areas that we have in common. The reality is that the coalition, like the government, is concerned about phoenixing activity. There can be no doubt that directors participating in knowingly setting up companies whereby they transfer assets from indebted company A to unindebted company B—with the full intent, by doing so, of avoiding their obligations and indebtedness from company A—is among the worst types of activities that companies can participate in. The consequences of phoenixing activity are significant. Unfortunately, we see it all too often on the Australian economic landscape. There are estimations that the economic cost to the Australian economy of phoenixing activity is around $2½ billion a year. As well, there is a very real human cost associated with phoenixing activity. There are those who are left without access to entitlements and there are creditors who are left without access to cash flow, which of course has a cascading effect across corporate Australia. In particular, those who are generally most affected are tradies. 


Phoenixing activity is something that does require action. But this is not a new thing. It is not that we have become aware of phoenixing only in the last 12 months. Indeed, there have been a suite of inquiries, of consultations and of previous pieces of legislation that have gone toward addressing phoenixing activity. Unfortunately, though, because this bill was not put to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics—or, rather, was put to it but was then discharged by the Labor members of the committee—we were not able to investigate in any way whether these increases in ASIC's powers to notionally address the issue of phoenixing activity are actually the right medicine for the problem. We were not able to take into account the concerns of, for example, the Australian Institute of Company Directors, among others. We were not able to take into account feedback from the small business sector. We were not able to take into account feedback from across the corporate community about whether the big increase in ASIC's powers that would be provided for under this legislation is in fact what is required to address phoenixing activity. We know that there are already at ASIC's disposal a raft of corporate powers to deal with the phoenixing activity. We know that ASIC has the ability to, for example, ban company directors for up to five years—or longer, with a court order—if that is what they seek to do, and they can do that with phoenixing activity.


Why has that not proven to be effective? We do not know. We have not been given the opportunity to know, because this bill was discharged from the economics committee. That is the reason the coalition has adopted what I think is a good approach to this piece of legislation—that is, that the government is required to live up to a certain burden of proof to demonstrate why ASIC's powers should be expanded and why this will be effective at addressing phoenixing activity. In the absence of robust arguments put forward by the Labor Party about why this is a requirement and why it will be effective this time—as opposed to previous occasions when it was, apparently, shown to be ineffective—the coalition cannot stand by and enable ASIC's powers to be significantly increased. That would have a consequent impact across the Australia community—in particular on small businesses, due to the raft of additional compliance burdens and concerns when dealing with ASIC.


In many respects it is that difference in approach that underscores the difference in philosophy between the Labor Party and the coalition. We stand ready and willing to help to address the issue of phoenixing activity, but we need to hear solid arguments. We need to hear robust proposals about why certain initiatives that are being looked at with a view to being undertaken will prove to be effective. I know that many in the corporate sector take the view that the principal problem here is not so much the powers available to ASIC or that there is not scope already available under the Corporations Act, for example, to deal with phoenixing activity but, rather, an inability for ASIC to appropriately tackle the issue of phoenixing because perhaps they are not appropriately resourced. The government wants to avoid scrutiny on this. The government does not want to 'let the sun shine in', which I believe were the words the Prime Minister used. It seems unfortunate that that would be the approach adopted by the Labor Party—an 'our way or the highway' attitude towards this bill. The fact is that there could easily be a bipartisan approach to this issue. There could easily be the coalition and the Labor Party working together. 


It is not good enough for the Labor Party to say, 'It's our way or the highway'. It is not good enough for the Labor Party to say, 'We're going to introduce this raft of new powers for ASIC and you should get on board.' The fact is that powers exist already. The regulator has at its disposal a number of initiatives that can be undertaken. Company directors can be prosecuted for phoenixing activity. If phoenixing activity is rampant, why is it not working? Why is ASIC not already using the powers at its disposal? We have not heard those arguments being put forward by the Labor Party. Instead, we are just told: 'This suite of new powers should be delivered up to ASIC and if the consequences are that it's a massive additional piece of compliance for the small business sector across Australia, tough luck.' We disagree. We will always stand on the side of small business. We will always stand on the side of those who take the view that there are and should be, appropriately, curbs on the power of government and on its regulators because they need to demonstrate why additional powers are required. It is a basic approach that we apply to policing, so why should it not be a basic approach that we apply to company policing?


The bill before the House today gives ASIC significant new discretionary powers—I emphasise 'discretionary powers'—to place a company into liquidation, and these powers can be used in a range of circumstances: where a company is six months late responding to a compliance notice and has not lodged other Corporations Act documents in the preceding 18 months; where ASIC has no reason to believe a company is carrying on a business and no objection to liquidation is received from directors; where a company's review fee has not been paid within 12 months; and where a company has been reregistered in the preceding six months and ASIC has reason to believe it is in the public interest to place the company into liquidation. Those are broad powers, especially the last one. Many would say, 'Look, don't be concerned. ASIC's never going to do the wrong thing. We just need to trust the regulator to always make the correct decision.' I think a higher level of responsibility is owed. I believe that regulators are accountable, back to this chamber. It is my belief that companies have a responsibility to comply with the law. Where you have rogue companies that are not complying and where you have company directors who are participating in phoenixing activity, of course everyone on the coalition side and I suspect on the Labor Party side would take the view that those company directors should be disqualified. But that is not a good enough justification to give a broadbrush power to ASIC because ASIC takes a view that it is in the public interest that there should be an ability to liquidate a company. We think it is important that the regulator understands that we are willing to work with it, if resourcing is the issue; but we need to know what the problem is. The laws exist now. Why are they not effective? Do not simply hand down, like Moses on the mountain, a new template that says, 'These are the new laws and they shall be obeyed.' Rather, the obligation is upon the Labor Party to demonstrate why these new laws are necessary. 


Incidentally, Senator Nick Sherry, a previous Assistant Treasurer with the Labor Party—one of the five or six that Labor has had in the past four years—outlined, I believe, 11 recommendations to deal with phoenixing activity. None of them, not a single one, is incorporated in this bill. This was a Labor Assistant Treasurer—perhaps that is why they have gone through five or six in the past four years—who put forward recommendations on how to deal with phoenixing activity, and those recommendations are absent from this bill. If that does not underscore what a completely ad hoc approach the Labor Party has taken to this issue then I do not know a more compelling argument than that. The fact is that there is scope to take a much more logistically appropriate and strategic approach to phoenixing activity. 


I am also concerned about comments that were made, for example, by the chairman of the law committee for the Australian Institute of Company Directors. Professor Bob Baxt, who is a distinguished competition law expert. He made some comments to a previous inquiry that the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics undertook at the end of last year—when I was not the deputy chair—which was dealing with the issue of phoenixing activity. He said:


There is too much legislation introduced on the basis of, 'It's a good idea; let's do something and we will see where it takes us.' … For the phoenix company and the phoenix director, there are processes in place which suggest that the regulator has the power to deal with them. Why should all of us be subject to those rather burdensome laws just because there are one or two who may have escaped the safety net? 


That illustrates the difference in the philosophical approach between the Labor Party and the coalition. When we say we are trying to get the monkey off the back of small business, when we say we are trying to nurture an entrepreneurial spirit within the Australian community and when we say we understand the trials and tribulations of being a small business person, we mean it. That is the reason we take positions on, for example, this bill. We have not heard the threshold being met by the Labor Party in its justification for why these additional powers are warranted. The Labor Party is devoid of any motivation, it seems, to outline the case. That is why we say: put this legislation now to a Senate inquiry, given that it was discharged from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics. Let us put it to a Senate inquiry and let us get the evidence out there. Let us understand why this suite of new powers is a requirement. 


Perhaps the reason the Labor Party just does not get small business is that there is no small business man or woman among them. There may have been one or two who have walked into a small business. I am sure the member for Kingsford-Smith, who is at the table, has walked into a couple of small businesses in his time. In fact, he is actually probably the closest thing they have got to a small businessman on that side of the chamber—although it was a little bit more than a small business, wasn't it? There is no doubt that those opposite just do not understand the mind of a small business man or woman. They do not understand that compliance is a big issue. Small business people do not have people working away in offices in tall towers making sure that they can tick all the boxes and dot all the i's and cross all the t's when it comes to compliance; rather, the compliance burden is something that is met by the small business principal themselves. More often than not it is a husband and wife team and more often than not there is only one employee in the business, and that is the owner. These are the people who face the consequences of big increases in ASIC powers and big increases in compliance. For this reason, we say there is a burden of proof that must be met by the Labor Party if they want to increase those powers. 


Let us put this legislation through the Senate inquiry process. I say to the government: it is time to stop running away from scrutiny; it is time to actually justify why additional powers are required, if, indeed, they are required; and it is time to show why existing laws are falling short, if, indeed, they are falling short. On each of these basic tests, I believe any reasonable Australian would understand that these are not high thresholds to meet. They are basic questions that should be answered. If they were answered by the government then I have no doubt that we would actually have a bipartisan position on the legislation. Until such time as the government answers those questions and until such time as the government meets that burden of proof, we will stand opposed to additional compliance. We will stand opposed to broadbrush increases in powers for ASIC, until the government has demonstrated why they are necessary and how they will work.

Ms GRIERSON
 (Newcastle) (10:20):  I rise to speak in support of the Corporations Amendment (Phoenixing and Other Measures) Bill 2012. I particularly commend the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer for his efforts in developing this legislation, as it is another significant step in our proud Labor tradition of standing up for and protecting the rights of Australian workers. As its namesake, the bird from Greek mythology suggests, the practice of 'phoenixing' in business refers to collapsed and abandoned companies with outstanding debts to creditors and employees, and then these companies later 'rise from the ashes', usually disguised, thinly, under a new trading name.


I have heard many of the opposition speakers oppose this bill. They say that there is no need for this new legislation. That is not true. ASIC was under-resourced under the Howard government. I think it worked out of a broom cupboard—and I say that from my experience on the Public Accounts and Audit Committee. It was starved of resources. What did we see as a result of that? We saw a global financial crisis that unfortunately saw bad practice. We saw many people lose their livelihoods, their savings, their superannuation entitlements and their holiday entitlements. We saw contractors who were never paid. We saw bad business. 


I heard the member the Moncrieff say that his party will always stand up for small business. Well, we will always stand up for good business. Good business is what we need in this country—good entrepreneurs. So many times through the GFC we saw good businesses disclose their problems to their workers, their employees and their suppliers and contractors, and work hand in hand to make things work. There is a spirit of goodwill out there in the workplace with business. There are good representative groups and bodies that, when consulted, can offer good advice. We saw many examples of good business making supreme efforts so that workers would not lose everything. We also saw workers give up hours and go to part time to get through those times.


We are talking today about phoenixing companies. Apparently it is not a big problem—there is no evidence. Well, I quote from the Age of 3 January: 


According to the Australian Taxation Office, there are about 6000 phoenix companies in Australia …


If that is correct, that is far too many. The practice costs our economy billions of dollars a year, and I believe it must be dealt with firmly. In 2010, our Labor government made the election commitment to provide the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, ASIC, with additional administrative powers to wind up companies that have been abandoned with workers and creditors left high and dry.


This bill is a key element of our government's Protecting Workers' Entitlements 2010 election commitment, and we honour that in this legislation. This legislation is a critical step in assisting the remuneration of employees for work that they have carried out in instances where a company has failed in its duty to make payments. Employees in affected companies have in many cases unfairly lost pay they are entitled to and benefits such as their accrued long service leave, holiday pay and superannuation due to cowboy practices and the abandonment of companies.


The federal government's GEERS is currently only able to assist employees in accessing their entitlements once an abandoned company has been formally placed into liquidation. It is a loophole that has existed for far too long. As the law stands, ASIC is required to undertake lengthy court procedures and incur associated legal costs in order to wind up a company and place it into liquidation. Only then may employees access GEERS.


Through the phoenixing and other measures bill, corporate watchdog ASIC will be given the authority to directly place an abandoned company into liquidation where it is believed that the company has ceased operation or where a company has deregistered but not formally liquidated. Currently, if an abandoned company has deregistered with ASIC, employees seeking their entitlements, or ASIC itself, must first apply through the courts to officially reinstate the company so that then, and only then, can it be placed into liquidation. This is unnecessary and complicated red tape that does little to help the immediate needs of unpaid employees or contractors who simply want what they are entitled to—a fair go and fair payment.


To address this frustrating and costly complication, the legislation will provide ASIC with the additional power to place a company into liquidation in cases where ASIC is currently only able to deregister a company. Not only will it give ASIC the power to reinstate deregistered companies, immediately place them into liquidation and thereby render employees eligible for GEERS; the legislation allows ASIC to place a company into liquidation without the need to provide notice where there is reasonable objective evidence that the company is no longer carrying on business as usual. Such evidence may, for example, be failure to pay a review fee. It is an important step that we amend the Corporations Act. Workers and contractors, but particularly employees, should expect to receive what they are entitled to without a second thought.


Another key aspect of the phoenixing and other measures bill sets down regulations regarding the publication of notices relating to the events before, during and after a company's administration. Currently, throughout the course of administration, there are a range of notices that are required to be published in either print media or the ASICGazette. In complying with these requirements, this publication obligation means substantial costs to external administrators, which is then of course passed on to already out-of-pocket creditors. In addition to this, the creditors also incur the cost associated with monitoring media activity, searching numerous newspapers for notices that may be relevant. Of course, they are often just national newspapers; regional newspapers are often overlooked. There is no set day of the week that those notices would appear. It is a confusing system.


This legislation aims to amend that, with the establishment of one central and publicly available website by ASIC. Being the direct point of publication for notices relating to corporate insolvency, the website will be accessible, searchable and ever-present, removing the need for hard-copy publication. The legislation establishes a coherent and affordable means by which to inform creditors, in a prescribed manner, through the publication of those notices online. This legislation is about ensuring information is easily and readily accessible, particularly for employees. This is a modern and necessary reform of the way in which we protect the entitlements of working people. The website will be established through ASIC by 1 July 2012. This legislation is another measure in harmonising Australia's insolvency industry. Over the coming four years, approximately 53,000 newspaper advertisements will be placed with the website, cutting the red tape, cutting costs for external administrators and reducing the burden on already affected creditors. Over this period, the use of the website will save around $15 million in print media advertising fees. I know the print media may not be pleased about that, but certainly we need to make those savings. This is a positive step our government is taking towards reducing the costs associated with compliance and regulation obligations.


There have been some serious cases locally, in and around my electorate of Newcastle, involving phoenixing activity. In 2006 I raised in the parliamentary committee process the Chinese-backed development and construction company Hightrade with ASIC. At that time, under the Howard government, ASIC had, as I said, very little powers to pursue such companies. The Newcastle Herald's Joanne McCarthy and the CFMEU's Andrew Ferguson went after the elusive Hightrade throughout that time, and I commend them for what was a sustained and consistent effort on their part towards making the company accountable to its creditors and employees through their public campaign. Contractors and suppliers, investors and workers all lost out. At the time, the ATO brought a case against Hightrade before the Federal Court—another very costly exercise. The behaviour of phoenix companies, such as Hightrade and other development and construction companies, has in the past demonstrated a failure to meet superannuation obligations as well. The Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit has consistently pursued the behaviour of such companies with the Commissioner of Taxation, something I am very proud of. At the time that the Herald were pursuing these matters, I stated in the Herald that the commissioner had agreed with me that 10 prosecutions of company executives for phoenix-type behaviour since 2000 was not satisfactory, and that this area of corporate behaviour was deserving of further attention from the ATO as well as ASIC.


I am pleased that legislative reform to combat phoenix companies has been considered and that in this parliament we are now seeing practical measures brought forward in legislation to combat phoenix companies and mitigate the negative effect they have on our community. Bad corporate behaviour can never be justified for any reason. I draw attention to the case of the roof contractor and former Australian Wallaby, Michael Martin, who lost hundreds of thousands of dollars when Hightrade company Reica Constructions avoided their tax and creditor debts and was wound up in 2006 during the construction of the Hunter Valley Resort at Pokolbin. As Joanne McCarthy reported in the Herald on 3 November 2009, 'The Tax Office was left the biggest creditor, owed $36 million'. That is us—every taxpayer being taken down by a bad company. There have been far too few powers for authorities to act in a timely and cost-effective manner to benefit those who have lost out due to corporate mischief. I am pleased that this legislation is working towards a better system.


As stated, the Corporations Amendment (Phoenixing and Other Measures) Bill 2012 is a key component of the government's Protecting Workers' Entitlements Package, announced at the last election. Other elements at the core of the government's package are the Fair Entitlements Guarantee, Securing Super, and Strengthening Corporate and Taxation Law, under which this and other legislation fall. Through no fault of their own, workers are losing their entitlements when companies are abandoned or where business behaves badly. Why should workers—people we know—have to worry about being paid an honest salary for an honest day's work? We will continue to pursue these sorts of reforms.


The Fair Entitlements Guarantee, which is currently undergoing a rigorous consultation process with stakeholders before being introduced as legislation, will alter the existing GEERS program so that employee entitlements cannot be abolished or amended easily by employers. In supporting these commitments, changes have already been made to the GEERS scheme prior to the guarantee being enshrined in legislation. Our government has removed the previous 16-week cap on redundancy pay and 'excluded employees', such as company directors, are no longer able to access assistance under GEERS. If an employee is owed money, they should be paid in full—not just 16 weeks and be left out of pocket. This is about fairness and some certainty. It is about cutting the red tape and ensuring quick and easy access to entitlements.


The second core element of the Protecting Workers' Entitlements Package is securing superannuation. Our government is strengthening compliance measures and ensuring that employees receive what they are entitled to. The Australian Taxation Office and the Fair Work Ombudsman have been given greater enforcement powers, ensuring that businesses pay their employees' superannuation guarantee. We also introduced legislation this morning to make it compulsory for employers to show on a payslip the anticipated date that an employee's superannuation contribution will be paid. Previously, it was only required that the amount be known. There have been too many cases of people who, when a company goes into liquidation and closes down, find their superannuation payments have not been made.


Thirdly, we are strengthening corporate and taxation law, giving ASIC more muscle by increasing the penalties against companies that wrong their employees and wrong their creditors. The Corporations Amendment (Phoenixing and Other Measures) Bill is a component of this. Again, in addition to this bill, the Corporations Amendment (Similar Names) Bill will be brought before the House in the near future. Currently out for consultation, the similar names bill will aim to further crack down on practices whereby company directors establish a phoenix company using a similar name to the initial failed company. The bill will fairly and justly impose personal liability upon those directors for the creditor debts of the failed company.


Certainly, under that similar names bill and those penalties for directors, there is nothing wrong with establishing a new business after a business has failed. We understand that. It is fine to have a second chance, as long as creditors and employees have been treated fairly, debts have been dealt with and directors have acted in a responsible fashion. Outlaw directors should be held liable for their exploitative behaviour. Unfortunately, in some cases, there does seem to be very deliberate actions with no intent to ever pay the workers or the creditors.


The suite of bills and action that this government is taking will ensure that directors cannot continue to sink deeper and deeper into debt through phoenixing practice and shirk their obligations. I thank again the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer for their work on this bill and know it will be of immense benefit to working people in my electorate and those small creditors often existing week-by-week around the country. It is legislation that only a Labor government would deliver. Sadly, it was not in place during the GFC when we saw so much burden placed on people, when they chose those sorts of options to get out of debt—options that saw people suffer—rather than take responsible action. It is legislation that is very much needed and, unfortunately, we have had to deliver and we will deliver. It is ultimately about a fair go for working Australians. I commend this bill to the House.

"Irons, Steve, MP",LP,2012-03-01,"



Mr IRONS
 (Swan) (10:35):  I rise to speak on the Corporations Amendment (Phoenixing and Other Measures) Bill 2012. I have heard the contribution of the member for Newcastle during which she said this legislation would deal with bad company directors. The problem with the legislation, which goes to the nub of it, is that there is no direct definition of 'phoenixing'. This is the argument that the coalition makes.


I say at the outset that I have a background in small business and own a small business that I started in Perth in 1988. The member for Wentworth is present in the chamber, but my business is in no way relevant to the size of his business and his background in business. I was fortunate enough to be mentored and advised in business by Rob Dunn. One of the many lessons I learnt was fiscal discipline, along with 'don't be afraid to build up assets in the company', which is the company's strength, particularly when dealing with banks and creditors. This bill also goes to the nub of dealing with assets of companies.


There are not that many people in this parliament who have business experience, which is disappointing. I know that there are members on this side of the House who have run their own business, like the member for Fadden, who will speak on this bill later on. We have heard from the member for Moncrieff who put the coalition's position so well and spoke of our attitude towards phoenixing and how that should be dealt with in the legislation. If we look across to the Labor benches we see that there are very few who have the experience of running a business. Certainly, being a lawyer for a union does not qualify you to say that you have run a business. Unfortunately, unless you have walked the walk you are sadly behind the eight ball about how business works and how insolvencies in business come about. It shows in the quality of the bill that we are debating today. Before I turn to the bill, I want to speak on this government's record on small business. Before the 2007 election, the Labor Party made a commitment, a promise to the Australian people that there would be a 'one in, one out' approach to regulating business in order to cut red tape. Since Labor was elected it has introduced 16,173 new regulations and only repealed 79, clearly breaking its 'one in, one out' promise to cut red tape. That is 204 new or amended regulations for every one repealed. This is a spectacular broken promise by this government, to go with the carbon tax and the private health insurance broken promises, and it is one that is being felt by many thousands of businesses around Australia and in my electorate of Swan.


In the area of compliance, there is a clear difference between the coalition's approach and the Labor Party's approach to small business. The coalition has a deregulation task force and is committed to reducing red tape to encourage employment in this sector during a tough time. The Labor Party, as I said, have introduced over 16,000 regulations in just four years. They just do not understand business, its difficulties and its importance to the economy during difficult trading conditions. I heard the member for Robertson saying that their side of the House do get business and that they value that small businesses are the major employers of people in Australia. Well, I ask the member and all members on the other side of the House to come into this place and explain to small business why you keep punishing them with new regulations and taxes.  


As an example of more punishment to small business, I quote from an article in the Australian, about the sudden decision to wind up the $320 million solar hot-water program, which:


… left the industry reeling and sparked warnings that up to 7200 jobs were in jeopardy. 


The Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change, Mark Dreyfus, angered the solar hot-water industry by giving five minutes' notice on Tuesday night that no more applications for solar hot-water rebates would be accepted under the Renewable Energy Bonus Scheme.


The report went on to say:


The latest solar row follows turmoil in the insulation industry after the pink batts scheme was scrapped in the wake of poor installations, training and accountability, and the blowout in the Green Loans scheme, where the assessors were swamped with demand.


The government was also forced to act to end a glut in renewable energy certificates sparked by generous subsidies for rooftop solar panels. The glut forced down the price of renewable energy certificates and sparked an investment strike in big clean energy projects.


Clean Energy Council acting chief executive Kane Thornton said the ""unexpected"" winding up of the solar hot-water program would immediately hit sales and ""put more than 1200 manufacturing jobs and 6000 installation jobs at risk … Cutting this program without warning in the middle of a financial year is yet another example of stop-start policymaking that continues to plague the entire clean energy sector"".


…   …   …


Rheem Australia government relations manager Gareth Jennings said his company, which makes the Solarhart range, was left holding millions of dollars in stock for which there may no longer be a market.


…   …   …


Solar hot-water system manufacturer Dux said it had been expecting the scheme to end on June 30 and many dealers and plumbers around Australia had expressed ""disbelief"" at the decision. ""This was completely out of the blue,"" general manager Simon Terry said.


Unfortunately, the bill before the House today is yet another messy example of the government's lack of understanding, and it needs some serious work before it should be allowed through the House of Representatives. This bill attempts to tackle the practice of 'phoenixing' or 'phoenix activity', which, as the shadow minister has said, is typically associated with directors who transfer the assets of an indebted company into a new company of which they are also directors. The directors then place the initial company into administration or liquidation, with no assets to pay employee entitlements or to pay creditors such as contractors and the ATO. Meanwhile the same  directors continue the business using the new company structure.


The coalition is strongly opposed to fraudulent phoenix activity as it undermines confidence in Australia's business community and damages its reputation. However, we are concerned that the government's approach to this important public policy matter is confused, ad hoc, piecemeal and not appropriately targeted. As such, we believe this bill needs redrafting and suggest that the government goes back to the drawing board. If the government is not prepared to do this, this current legislation we are discussing today needs at the very least a thorough examination by the Senate Economics Legislation Committee.


I note that shadow minister Cormann has suggested that this legislation is so poor that a wider inquiry should be undertaken by the Senate Economics References Committee to canvass all options of reforming the law surrounding phoenix activity and make recommendations to the parliament for comprehensive and coherent legislative change. Madam Deputy Speaker, I know it is a strong call to suggest that this legislation go back to the drawing board, that even amending it will not suffice, so let me take you through some of the reasons that have led the coalition to take this position.


There are at least seven problematic areas which need to be addressed, and I think at the outset it is worth reminding the House that this is not the first attempt by this government to get these laws right. Last year, the government introduced a series of different measures targeting some aspects of phoenix activity, in the Tax Laws Amendment (2011 Measures No. 8) Bill 2011 and the Pay As You Go Withholding Non-compliance Tax Bill 2011. After examining these bills, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics made the unanimous and bipartisan recommendation that the government not proceed with those provisions, with the committee in particular noting the concerns from the business community and its representatives that the bills potentially apply to the broad range of directors, whether engaged in phoenix activity or not. As a result of this, the government withdrew the legislation, supposedly to take this on board. However, it would appear from this legislation before the House today that the government has not attempted or managed to solve this problem it set out to solve. In fact, it has yet to provide any indication as to how it will tighten the provisions to better target phoenix activity as recommended by the committee.


 Government speakers such as the member for Wills, who is speaking next, need to explain why this issue has not been solved as per the unanimous decision of the Senate committee. The bill should not progress until this matter is addressed. This is the first problem with the legislation. Part of this problem might be the fact that there has been no attempt to define 'phoenix activities' in any of the bills the government has introduced dealing with this area. A  proper definition is needed, not only to better target the legislation but to avoid costly legal disputes down the track and give confidence to the sector. We have seen the embarrassment caused to Australia by the legal disputes this government has landed us in. The Malaysian deal High Court fiasco, which the member for Griffith called a 'walk on the policy wild side' was reported around the world—in Asia and on the BBC—and cost our international reputation dearly. There is another storm brewing with the High Court case considering the tobacco plain packaging legislation, and it is difficult to have full confidence in the government's assertion that its legislation is constitutional and will not cost billions of dollars. To have no definition of 'phoenix' in the Corporations Amendment (Phoenixing and Other Measures) Bill 2012 is quite frankly unbelievable, and for this reason alone this bill should not proceed. At present the Australian Institute of Company Directors does not have confidence in this legislation because of this very point. If we refer back to the speech by the member for Parramatta yesterday, she said:


I will go back to some of the comments that the shadow Treasurer made. His comments were about phoenixing more generally. Of course this piece of legislation does not deal with the entire phoenixing behaviour. Of course this legislation does not involve all of the changes that need to be made in order to reduce phoenix activity and protect consumers and creditors from that activity. Of course there is other work to be done.


If the member for Parramatta is saying that, why are we even debating this bill? The member for Parramatta has admitted that this bill is not sufficient.


However, there are other reasons why this bill should not be passed through the House, and these should also be considered by members in the House today as they decide which way they will vote. One of them relates to schedule 1 of the bill, an amendment that allows ASIC to put a company into liquidation in a series of specific circumstances. These circumstances include where a company is at least six months late responding to a compliance notice issued by ASIC under section 348A, 'return of particulars', and has not lodged any other documents under the Corporations Act in the preceding 18 months; ASIC has no reason to believe the company is carrying on a business; and ASIC has reason to believe that it is in the public interest. They include where the company's review fee has not been paid in full within 12 months of the due date. They also include where a company has been reregistered under section 601AH(1) within the preceding six months, and ASIC has reason to believe that it is in the public interest. And they include where ASIC has no reason to believe that the company is carrying on a business, ASIC gives 20 days notice to the company and its directors of the liquidation and no objection is received from the directors or the company within the specified time limits. Before making such an order, ASIC must give notice on the ASIC database as well as publish its intention. ASIC cannot put a company into liquidation under this schedule if an application for the winding up of the company is before the courts.


The coalition is concerned about the significant increase in ASIC power represented by the bill and, in particular, the lack of provisions relating to the parliamentary scrutiny of these proposed powers. One of the major issues identified as contributing to the phoenix activity is that the regulators are not fully utilising the existing powers available to them. Other issues include a lack of prosecutions, under-resourced regulators, insufficient follow-up on complaints and inadequate penalties to act as a deterrent. ASIC is Australia's corporate regulator and has a very important role to play; however, the need for new and additional powers appears superfluous given that the regulators are not fully utilising their existing powers because of a lack of resources or otherwise. There certainly does not seem to be much clear thinking by the government in the way it is proposing to grant these powers over the course of many different pieces of federal legislation and in an uncoordinated manner.


As the shadow minister said, we strongly recommend that the government ceases this ad hoc and piecemeal approach, withdraws the current bill and instead engages in meaningful consultation with stakeholders to address their legitimate concerns and to determine a comprehensive and coordinated legislative approach to this important public policy matter.


There are a number of other, broader issues with this bill, in particular relating to the government's approach to phoenix activity, which have been raised by members speaking prior to me on this matter. These include how effective previous regulatory efforts have been in combating this practice, the appropriateness of available penalties and the lack of recognition by the government of the role and capacity of liquidators in tackling phoenix activity. These unresolved issues also detract from the legislation and should be considered by members.


So where should the government go from here? It should withdraw this legislation and go back to the drawing board. If not, at the very least this government should refer the matter to the economics committee and in fact, given that through its ad hoc approach the government has clearly demonstrated that it has a poor understanding of this area of business, the Senate committee should be drafted in to help consider these issues in a full and holistic way.


For future legislation, the government might consider the proposals paper on combating phoenix activities released in November 2009 by Nick Sherry, who was then Assistant Treasurer. None of the 11 proposals in that paper are reflected in the new ASIC powers outlined in this legislation. It reminds me of the review conducted by the member for Oxley, the Ripoll review, which, sadly for that member, was almost completely ignored by the government. I note that the member for Oxley has also spoken on this bill.


As I and other members on this side of the House have said, this is a poor bill and we will not be supporting it.

Mr BILLSON
 (Dunkley) (13:45):  COSBOA, Family Business Australia and some of the government's own advisers have really belled the cat that the political turmoil wreaking havoc through this government is actually damaging small business. It is distracting this divided and dysfunctional government from addressing the key issues that the small business community is confronting: the carbon tax, workplace relations, competition policy reform and the need for a small business ombudsman. Perhaps the alert that the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Queensland should have rung bells with this government—but it has not. Three in four Queensland businesses surveyed by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Queensland believe the carbon tax will have a negative effect on their business. Eighty-four per cent of those surveyed urged the scrapping of the carbon tax. These small businesses are not looking for a handout. They are looking for some support and some encouragement. They are looking for someone who is looking out for them. Perhaps this is the time to remind this Labor government that it is long past time for a small business minister to be in cabinet, a minister that will have a role and an important contribution to make at important decision-making times when the big cabinet table need small business represented, not sent off to the kids' table. It is important that the member for Griffith note this. He was out there advocating for 'new work' and he was told that new work, including work in the small business area, ran against Labor's values. I remember what Kim Beazley said, that 'we never pretended to be a small business party, the Labor Party; we have never pretended that '. By golly, isn't this crowd proving it! (Time expired)

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:00):  Two weeks ago the Leader of the Opposition and I joined the Governor-General in the Northern Territory to mark the 70th Anniversary of the Bombing of Darwin. The member for Solomon, amongst others, was there. The member for Lingiari was also there with me. This was the first time this anniversary had been observed as a national day of commemoration. In my remarks on that day I noted that the events of that day began a series of raids across Northern Australia, which lasted almost two years. One of the saddest and most destructive of those raids was in Broome on 3 March 1942, a day when that very quiet coastal outpost joined the front lines of a global war. I know the member for Robertson has been a forceful advocate for ensuring that this story is told. I also thank the Special Minister of State, who will be representing me at the ceremonies in Broome this coming Sunday.


The circumstances in Broome that summer were tragic and unusual. A large number of Dutch citizens had fled from the Netherlands East Indies, now of course Indonesia, to the safety of Australia as the Japanese advanced. Many of them came in flying boats, which stopped to refuel at Broome. When the nine Japanese Zero fighter planes launched a lightening raid on 3 March, a number of those flying boats were in Roebuck Bay for refuelling, where they were sitting ducks for an attack, as was the nearby airfield where six large planes were destroyed.


This attack was horrific. Japanese strafing runs destroyed over 20 aircraft, many of them packed with Dutch women and children as well as with military personnel. An Australian observer described the civilians trapped on one of the flying boats in the following words: 'The faces at the window were contorted with panic, terror-stricken fingers clawing at the glass. Two of the women and one of the children were badly burned. Their clothes flaked and black, their skin cracking and lifting. What a slaughter.' The total number of casualties may never be known but it is estimated that up to 88 people lost their lives that day, including as many as 48 on those flying boats and, among them, 20 believed to be children.


They were our allies and our friends who came to seek shelter but found only death as the war they tried to outrun caught them unawares. For those who survived, many owed their lives to courageous individuals like Charles D'Antoine, a local Indigenous man, who swam through burning fuel and wreckage to rescue two Dutch women and was awarded a Silver Medal for Humane Assistance by the Queen of the Netherlands. It was a day of terror but it was a day of valour too.


The attacks on Northern Australia taught us painfully just how much effort would be required by the whole nation to turn the tide. It is to the lasting credit of our nation that we did that and found the strength and unity of purpose to do so, led by our greatest wartime Prime Minister, John Curtin. It was the battle for Australia when the world-wide war came to our shores and summoned the very best from our nation and our people. From the dark days of Darwin and Broome in 1942 to the days of victory 3½ years later, Australia passed its greatest test, served and sustained by a great generation. They will not be forgotten and they will be remembered this weekend in Broome.

 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:06):  My question is to the Prime Minister. I remind her of the statement of Don Argus that the carbon tax is 'badly designed, hurriedly implemented' and will not achieve its core aims. What is the Prime Minister's response?

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:07):  To the Leader of the Opposition I say the government has a very different view about the future of the nation. First, our nation has been debating the impact of climate change and the need for a price on carbon for the better part of a decade. Indeed, the former Howard government developed a plan for an emissions trading scheme which, had the former Howard government been elected in 2007, it would have legislated for to commence by now. If the former Howard government had been re-elected in 2007, under the platform the Leader of the Opposition took to that election as a senior minister, there would be a carbon price in place by now.



The SPEAKER:  Order! The Prime Minister will return to the question.




Ms GILLARD:
  So any claim that this has been hurried in development of course does not stand the test of looking at that history.


In terms of the impact of carbon pricing, we know that the most efficient way of cutting carbon pollution is to put a price on carbon. That is what the legislation does. We know that it will cut the amount of carbon pollution—




Mr Abbott:
  Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Don Argus said that it was badly designed and would not achieve its core aim. She should be directly relevant to that question in her response.



The SPEAKER:  I am sure the Prime Minister is imminently about to address the substance of the question. The honourable the Prime Minister continues to have the call.




Ms GILLARD:
  I am answering the claim that the scheme is badly designed by explaining why the scheme is well designed and will achieve its purpose. A price on carbon will cut carbon pollution at the least possible cost to the economy. A price on carbon will reduce the amount of carbon pollution that is in the atmosphere by 160 million tonnes in 2020. A price on carbon will enable us to increase pensions, to increase family payments and to triple the tax-free threshold. What that means is that there will be better rewards for people to going to work, particularly second income earners who are perhaps making a choice to return to work part-time—overwhelmingly women. What this means is we will see our economy transform to a cleaner energy future whilst Australian families are supported. Millions of families will actually come out better off as a result of putting a price on carbon and seeing a pension increase of family payments or a tax cut.



Mr Van Manen interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The honourable member for Forde will remain silent.




Ms GILLARD:
  This is therefore a well-designed—indeed, the best designed—scheme.


It is a sharp contrast to the scheme advocated for by the Leader of the Opposition, which of course is the most efficient way to do it, would impose huge costs on Australian businesses and would require Australian—



Mr Simpkins interjecting—




Ms GILLARD:
  families to stump up a payment of $1,300 per year each, having lost their tax cuts, family payment increases and pension increases. We stand by seizing a clean energy future. The Leader of the Opposition knows nothing except scare campaigns.

 (Curtin—Deputy Leader of the Opposition) (14:47):  I move:


That so much of standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Deputy Leader of the Opposition from moving—



Honourable members interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  Members on both sides will return to silence, including the Leader of the House.




Ms JULIE BISHOP:
  I move:


That so much of the standing and sessional orders be suspended as would prevent the Member for Curtin moving immediately—That this House call on the Prime Minister to explain the circumstances surrounding the botched attempt to install Bob Carr as Foreign Minister, the role of the Defence Minister in vetoing it and how the Australian people can have any trust in a Prime Minister with a pattern of behaviour that calls into question her integrity and who lacks the authority to control the faceless men of the Labor Party.


Standing orders must be suspended—



Government members interjecting—



Mr Laming interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The member for Bowman will leave the chamber under the provisions of standing order 94(a).




The member for Bowman then left the chamber.





Ms JULIE BISHOP:
  Standing orders must be suspended, and this motion must take precedence, because overnight more revelations have emerged that contradict the Prime Minister's version of events over the Bob Carr fiasco. The pattern of behaviour that is emerging borders on the pathological. The Prime Minister has turned denying the undeniable into an art form. The Prime Minister, when confronted with indisputable facts, manufactures a version of events that invariably turns out to be the opposite of what is true. She is a fabricator. That is why standing orders must be suspended—so that the Prime Minister can explain to this House and to the Australian people why she said that an article in the Australian was completely untrue, when the salient facts in the story have been confirmed by none other than Bob Carr himself. The Prime Minister did not claim that parts of it were untrue or that there was an incorrect nuance; she said it was completely untrue.


But we now know that Bob Carr was offered the foreign minister's spot. She said that was completely untrue. We know Bob Carr was contacted by the Prime Minister. She said that was completely—



The SPEAKER:  The Deputy Leader will return to the motion she has moved.




Ms JULIE BISHOP:
  That is why standing orders must be suspended—so that the Prime Minister can explain how it is that she claims that the offer being withdrawn after the intervention of the factions was completely untrue. These matters require the Prime Minister's explanation. Legitimate questions are arising about the Prime Minister's respect for the truth. Even those who are desperate to give the Prime Minister the benefit of the doubt admit that she has a passing acquaintance with the truth. I would say that the Prime Minister and the truth are total strangers. That fact is—



The SPEAKER:  Order! The Deputy Leader will withdraw that. I point out that this is not a motion of censure. The Deputy Leader must focus on the substance of the motion, and the sorts of things that she could talk about in a substantive motion cannot be talked about in a motion to suspend standing and sessional orders.




Ms JULIE BISHOP:
  I withdraw. Standing orders must be suspended so that the Prime Minister can explain her behaviour. I have spoken about the pattern of behaviour which is part of the motion, and that is why standing orders must be suspended. For example, the member for Griffith learned, to his great personal cost, that the Prime Minister's word cannot be relied upon—that her word is worthless. For months leading up to 23 June 2010 she declared loyally that she would not challenge the Prime Minister. Even on the night she betrayed him she promised she would give him more time, only to go back on her word moments later. That is why standing and sessional orders must be suspended.


The member for Denison learned to his great cost that the Prime Minister's written word cannot be relied upon, and she must explain this. The member for Denison was strung along for months, seduced into believing that her written word was worth something—but then he was betrayed. There is a pattern of behaviour here. The Australian people learned this when she made her promise that there would be no need for concern over the erosion of the private health insurance rebate. Now this Prime Minister is eroding that very same rebate. The Prime Minister also told the Australian people that, if they voted for her, there would be no carbon tax under the government she led. This is part of the pattern of behaviour that she must explain. The Prime Minister betrayed their trust and standing orders must be suspended so she can explain why she makes these statements that are then shown to be false.


We will recall that before the last election the Prime Minister announced the East Timor processing centre. She said she had spoken to the East Timorese President. She was subsequently ridiculed for poor judgment, for her diplomatic failing, and then she denied that she had nominated East Timor for the processing centre. In fact, she said:


I'm not going to leave undisturbed the impression that I made an announcement about a specific location.


So are we led to believe that she was speaking to President Ramos Horta about a processing centre in Antarctica? No wonder Laurie Oakes said of the Prime Minister—




The SPEAKER:
  The deputy leader will return to the substance of her motion.




Ms JULIE BISHOP:
  I am speaking about the pattern of behaviour, Mr Speaker, which is why the suspension motion should be carried.




The SPEAKER:
  The deputy leader must focus on why standing and sessional orders should be suspended.




Ms JULIE BISHOP:
  That is right, Mr Speaker. Standing and sessional orders must be suspended so that the Prime Minister can answer the charge from Laurie Oakes that she is silly and slippery and slimy and shifty. She must be given the opportunity to come into this place and explain this same behaviour that emerged over the Australia Day riot. When the truth would have done just fine, this Prime Minister gave a version of events that has proven not to be true. Even on the most straightforward issues the Prime Minister seems incapable of calling it as it is. After unleashing her dogs of war with a most personal and vitriolic attack on the member for Griffith, she now wants to believe that she was not publicly humiliating him—she was in fact honouring him. Standing orders must be suspended so she can explain this behaviour. The Prime Minister could not even get it right when she was talking about his achievements, saying that the member for Griffith created the G20 and created the East Asia Summit. Not even the member for Griffith would claim such grandiosity. That is why the Prime Minister must explain herself. 


Standing orders must be suspended so that the Prime Minister can give her version of the events of the Carr wreck. We will recall that the Prime Minister said she was not involved in the toppling of the member for Griffith; that she was not in any plot to overthrow the Prime Minister. We now know she was hawking around polling; she was having speeches written in her own office. Her version of events is simply implausible. Last week the Prime Minister's version of why the member for Griffith had to be removed was revealed as not sustainable. She said she believed that it was a good government that had lost its way, but we now know that she did not believe it was a good government. She in fact thought it was chaotic and disorganised and paralysed and not focused on the national interest. In fact her deputy said—and this is what she should be called in to explain and this is why standing orders must be suspended—that this was a government that had contempt for the cabinet, contempt for the caucus, contempt for the parliament and contempt for the public. So, far from the Prime Minister's version that it was a good government that lost its way, she now admits that it was a bad government getting worse. That is why standing orders must be suspended. 


The Prime Minister wanted us to believe that she did not tell the truth about the events of 23 and 24 June because she did not want to hurt the feelings of the member for Griffith. Spare us, Mr Speaker! Do we have to have any more of this? Having unleashed the most personal abuse on the former Prime Minister of this country, she now wants us to believe that she did not want to hurt his feelings. The fact is that the Prime Minister's instinct is to manufacture and to fabricate to suit her political purpose. No wonder a third of her caucus decided that she was not worthy of their vote.


Standing orders must be suspended so the Prime Minister can explain the circumstances surrounding the role of the Minister for Defence in vetoing the Prime Minister's choice of Bob Carr for foreign minister. The Prime Minister says that allegation is completely untrue, but we will soon know. If the Prime Minister appoints the defence minister to be the foreign minister, that is evidence of his veto. Surely the Prime Minister would not otherwise want to appoint the fourth Labor defence minister in four years. We have learned that the minister for regional Australia has also vetoed the Prime Minister's choice of Bob Carr, so both ministers want the job. The Prime Minister is faced with a choice between the member for Perth and the member for Hotham—a choice between a rooster and a feather duster, so wipe the floor with that one. Standing orders must be suspended so the Prime Minister can explain how she can claim a new assertiveness one day when the next day she is completely and comprehensively undermined by the factions.


Standing orders must be suspended so the Prime Minister can explain matters that go to her very character, to her personal integrity and to her fitness to hold office. We are seeking the opportunity for the Prime Minister to explain why she seeks to construct versions of events when the truth will do. Members will recall the Prime Minister telling us that she was a prize winner in Bible studies. Perhaps she might remember Matthew 12:37: by your words you will be justified; by your words you will be condemned. (Time expired)

"Pyne, Christopher, MP",LP,2012-03-01,"



Mr PYNE
 (Sturt—Manager of Opposition Business) (14:58):  I second the motion, Mr Speaker. Standing orders must be suspended because the Prime Minister says you cannot believe everything you read, but the real problem with this Prime Minister is that you cannot believe anything she says. The Prime Minister should be required to come into the House and explain the extraordinary circumstances surrounding the botched attempt to appoint Bob Carr as the foreign minister. The Prime Minister is condemned by her own words. In question time today the Prime Minister said, in answer to a question from the opposition:


I believe that it is appropriate for me as Prime Minister to have discussions with people about having the best possible team. I have got a great team, but when we are seeking to add to the team of course you have a range of conversations.


The reason the Prime Minister was speaking to Bob Carr on Monday night is that she was seeking to bring him in from the outside to add to the team. It does not stack up with her statement yesterday that the Australian's report of this story was completely untrue. Again, she was condemned by her own words. In question time today she was asked a very straightforward question.



The SPEAKER:  The Manager of Opposition Business will return to the substance of the motion.




Mr PYNE:
  The reason standing orders should be suspended to give this motion precedence is that we on this side of the House would like to give the Prime Minister the opportunity to explain to the House her answer today to a question from the opposition, which was that, if her statement to the Australian at a press conference that the story was 'completely untrue' was in fact true, would she repeat the statement in the House. Do you know what she did? She did not repeat it in the House. She left out a crucial word. She left out the word 'completely' from her statement today. We know why. It is because they are weasel words. She knows that if she tells the truth in this place, if she misleads the House in this place, it is a sackable offence, whereas misleading the press and misleading the people is just more Labor spin, which she has been getting away with for 4½ years in government.


The reason standing orders must be suspended to give this motion precedence is the pitiful truth that the faceless men used this Prime Minister to politically assassinate the former Prime Minister in 2010. They did it again on Monday and they don't need her any more. The circus has moved on and the Prime Minister is going to be left in the litter as the faceless men divide up the spoils of a new government under a new leader.


The facts that have been agreed in this case were well put by Dennis Shanahan today in the Australian. He said:


These are the agreed facts … Carr was offered the Senate vacancy and the position of foreign minister; Gillard spoke personally to him at least twice on Monday night; after the conversation Carr believed he was going to be foreign minister; Carr was prepared to come to Canberra on Tuesday for an announcement; Stephen Smith and Simon Crean objected; and finally the offer of foreign minister was withdrawn on Tuesday morning and the alternative of defence (Smith’s portfolio) or trade (Craig Emerson’s) was offered. 


None of those facts has been disputed by anyone in the government. The Prime Minister has been left like a shag on a rock with nothing to protect her from the truth in this case. The opposition will prosecute this case, and we are getting plenty of help from the Labor Party. Even this morning backbenchers and frontbenchers were throwing up their hands in horror about the performance of the Prime Minister.



The SPEAKER:  The Manager of Opposition Business will return to the motion.




Mr PYNE:
  There was this brief shining moment of independence for the Prime Minister on Monday. She was like a hostage briefly freed.



The SPEAKER:  Order! The Manager of Opposition Business will talk to the substance of the motion.




Mr PYNE:
  The reason this motion should be given precedence is that, like a hostage freed briefly on Monday, the Prime Minister tasted freedom but she was quickly wrapped up by the faceless men and put back in the dark where they think she belongs.


The Australian people deserve better than this. They deserve a government that will restore hope, reward and opportunity—not the self-indulgent rabble that now occupies the government benches. That is why standing orders should be suspended. There is nothing more important before the House than discussing the integrity and honesty of a flawed and broken Prime Minister.

Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler—Leader of the House and Minister for Infrastructure and Transport) (15:04):  Today I rise for the 44th time to a suspension of standing orders motion moved by the opposition. Every day they come in here and stop question time in order to move a suspension of standing orders, because they have nothing to say about the future of this nation. Not only do they have nothing to say about the future of this nation, they do not even bother to try to hold the government to account on any of the major issues of the day that confront Australia—not on the economy, not on social policy, not on health policy and not on education policy. I have had one question in years on infrastructure and transport, even though the Leader of the National Party is the shadow minister. It shows—and this is the reason we should not support the suspension motion moved by the opposition—that every day this is just an act of self-indulgence. Every time they do this they say that they just care about themselves and not about those they purport to represent. Every time they do it they remind the Australian people that they are not interested in issues. They remind Australians that, in today's case, they are pushing off the matter of public importance debate, which is about a price on carbon. Remember that. They thought it was important, but today they move a motion that, if carried, will mean we will not have a debate today about the price on carbon. We on this side of the House are very happy to debate a clean energy future, what it will mean for our economy, what it will provide in terms of support for pensioners, what it will provide in terms of the support for working Australians through tax cuts, what it will mean for families in the suburbs and what it will mean for future jobs as we move to a carbon constrained economy.


Regarding the resolution today moved by the shadow minister for foreign affairs, you would think that she would just be embarrassed. The only questions that we have had from the shadow minister for foreign affairs have been ones that have sought to play politics and make fun. They are the only things that have been raised. There is never anything serious. There has never been anything about famine in Africa, the great global issues confronting the G20 or the European economy and there has never been anything about the implications for this nation of all those great global issues.


It is no wonder that the Leader of the Opposition said about the member for Kooyong on 28 August last year, 'I've got to say it's nice to have someone in the parliamentary party who understands foreign affairs at last.' What an endorsement! And he heard his name: he thought it was a call from the Leader of the Opposition. I am sorry, Josh, it is not my decision; it is the decision of the bloke in front of me. And this bloke in front of me is quite happy to have a lame duck who is not interested in foreign affairs as the shadow minister. We want to debate the substantial issues. That is why we do not support the suspension of standing orders. The member for Kooyong came in with some hope and he did not last a minute! That says it all about those opposite.


We are happy to debate the great issues of the day, such as our stance as enhancers of opportunity versus their stance of entrenchers of privilege, or our stance as builders of the nation versus their stance as wreckers, or our stance on a return to surplus versus their stance, with their $70 billion black hole, or what we stand for with our positive vision for the future versus their stance as a bunch of negative hollow opportunists.



The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the House will return to the question before the chair.




Mr ALBANESE:
  I am speaking on the question, Mr Speaker. During question time, I want to continue to debate our politics of conviction versus their politics of convenience. I want to have questions asked of us about the great issues of the day and the fact that we are focused on the big picture: infrastructure, skills and climate change. I want to debate how we put the national interest first while they just play politics and put their party first. I want to debate how we stand for a fair share for working people while they stand for special deals for the big end of town.


We saw this in the last question asked by this side of the House of the minister for workplace relations about safe rates. I also had the privilege of meeting today the families of those who have lost loved ones in accidents involving heavy vehicles. This is a big issue. It is one on which the member for Hinkler produced a seminal report many years ago—a decade ago. But it was not acted upon. We on this side of the House have given this issue a very considered response. We have consulted independent contractors.



The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the House will talk about why standing orders ought not be suspended.




Mr ALBANESE:
  Yes, Mr Speaker. These are the issues that we could have got more questions on this afternoon rather than this petty politics. These are the issues that matter. I bet that if this suspension had not occurred I would have got the next question. This is a very good argument for why we should not suspend standing orders. I care about these issues. This parliament should not just be concerned with the negative. This parliament has to be concerned with the positive and with the future issues facing our nation, such as the need for safe rates for people who drive our trucks and keep this country going.


We very firmly believe that we have a strong, positive agenda across the policy spectrum. Day after day, ministers come in here and they may as well bring in novels, because there is no chance of them getting—




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. In relation to the defence of why standing orders should not be suspended, is it appropriate for the Leader of the House, who did not support the Prime Minister, to stand and defend her?



The SPEAKER:  The honourable member for Mackellar will remove herself from the House under the provisions of standing order 94(a).




The member for Mackellar then left the chamber.





Mr ALBANESE:
  Mr Speaker, that decision is a very popular one on both sides of the chamber!



The SPEAKER:  The Leader of the House will return to the substance of the motion before the chair.




Mr ALBANESE:
  I will, Mr Speaker. I have nothing more to say about the future of the modern Liberal Party, who leaves the chamber as we speak. The fact of the matter is this: we oppose this suspension because we want to discuss positive issues. Those opposite just want to muckrake during question time and during these daily suspensions. When we do discuss issues, those opposite say no to a surplus, no to jobs, no to action on climate change, no to a future for manufacturing, no to the NBN, no to helping working people, no to tax cuts for small business, no to better superannuation for workers and no to pension increases. That is all that they have to say about the issues facing this nation. That is why every day they come in here and move these motions. They have done so on 44 occasions.


I will conclude with a Robert Menzies quote, who said this:


…on far too many questions we have found our role to be simply that of the man who says 'No.' … There is no room in Australia for a party of reaction. There is no useful place for a policy of negation. 


All those years ago, in 1944, Robert Menzies had figured this bloke out. Robert Menzies was indeed a visionary, because he knew what his party would become. Frankly, the Australian people deserve better and that is why this ridiculous suspension motion—the daily suspension motion typed up in advance, typed up in the morning and moved like clockwork at 2.48 pm every day—should be rejected. (Time expired)



The SPEAKER:  Order! The time allotted for this debate has expired. The question before the chair is that the motion for suspension of standing and sessional orders, moved by the honourable Deputy Leader of the Opposition, be agreed to.

Cheryl served in the Royal Australian Navy for 15 years from 1972 till 1987. She reached the rank of chief petty officer. She became a defence civilian after her military service from 1987 to 1993 and was awarded the Assistant Chief of Naval Staff's personal commendation in 1991 for her work in setting up a call centre for family and friends for service personnel involved in Australia's contribution to the 1991 Gulf War. So there is a story behind the story there which I think we need to reflect. She had an outstanding service prior to her coming to this place, and that additional 11 years here has been, I think, a wonderful contribution and a great service to this parliament and to the people who sit in it.

One of the things that I first learnt when I came into this place in 1998 was the wonderful calibre of the people here who serve us, the politicians. I know I can speak for both sides of the House about the wonderful contribution that Cheryl has made to her country in many, many ways. She must have had an enormous amount of tolerance to keep up that beautiful friendly smile of hers day in and day out. Well done, Cheryl. Good luck and thank you for making me look good by being one of the lovely people that lives in the electorate.

Mr WINDSOR
 (New England) (15:33):  Mr Speaker, on indulgence: if I could add my thanks to Cheryl for the work that she has done. On behalf of the cross-benchers, could I say that she has been an outstanding individual and a great representative. I was just saying to her at the door before this discussion began that we are very lucky in this parliament to have people of the calibre that we do have here. We have all recognised that today. But I think we have to really ensure that we maintain that calibre and that appreciation of the people who work within this building. I have been in two parliaments and the member for Hume has been in two as well. I have seen the loss of esteem of the people who actually work within one building. We have it here and it will be up to the members of this chamber and those who administer it to make sure that those people are shown the appreciation they absolutely deserve. Cheryl is an outstanding example of the calibre of people that we have within this building. 



The SPEAKER:  Cheryl, once again, thank you very, very much. On behalf of all honourable members, I wish you a long and happy retirement and thank you for your service to all of us.

Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (15:36):  Mr Speaker, on indulgence: I want to very briefly acknowledge the very good news that Pat Farmer, the former member for Macarthur, recently completed his run from the North Pole to the South Pole. He lost his preselection, reacted appropriately and decided to run from the top of the earth to the bottom of the earth. It was a 21,000-kilometre odyssey, an enormous amount of pain, a great adventure and a great Australian achievement. He marked it with a simple message via text to anybody who was on his list—'Job done'. So, well done, Pat, and congratulations. 



The SPEAKER:  I am sure that all honourable members would associate themselves with the congratulations to the former member for Macarthur.

"Hunt, Greg, MP",LP,2012-03-01,"



Mr HUNT
 (Flinders) (15:38):  This matter is urgent because this week the very people who are proposing to implement in four months time the world's biggest carbon tax blew up the solar sector. The people who want to implement the world's biggest carbon tax could not even protect the solar sector; they blew it up. They also blew up their own house, but, more importantly, they blew up the solar sector. But don't take out word for this. Let's listen to what the Clean Energy Council said:


The clean energy industry says the unexpected cut of a key government solar hot water program late yesterday will put jobs under threat … 


The CEO of the council said that the:


… decision will immediately affect sales and will put more than 1200 manufacturing jobs and 6000 installation, sales and back office jobs in jeopardy.


… … …


Cutting this program without warning in the middle of a financial year is yet another example of stop-start policy making that continues to plague the entire clean energy sector.


That is what they do to their friends. This is a government that seeks to implement in four months time the most complex, most far-reaching, heaviest and widest carbon tax in the world, and they cannot even run a solar hot water program. It is important to note this program was the successor to—wait for it—the Pink Batts program. So they replaced the Home Insulation Program on 19 February 2010 and they blew up its successor this week, on 28 February 2012. That is what they do to their friends.


Let's look at the carbon tax and how in their hands this measure is going to be destructive to the Australian economy and damaging to families and, above all else, it is going to fail to achieve its purpose. Very simply, we have had matters of great urgency this week, when the most senior people in the industry have made it clear that we are facing a real and significant threat to jobs, to competition, to viability and to electricity prices.


Let me start with what the CEO of Australia's largest power producer, Macquarie Generation, said. Sir Russell Skelton made it absolutely clear on the front of the Australian Financial Review yesterday. The article reads:


The head of Australia’s largest power generator has warned that electricity prices will rise more than the federal government predicts under an option to ration output in order to stay profitable under the carbon tax.


There are two fundamental things in what the head of Macquarie Generation has said. Firstly, power prices will rise more than the government has said. The government has already said it will be a 10 per cent price rise. That is what the government has said, and the Electricity Supply Association of Australia has said it will be 20 per cent. And here we have the head of the largest power generator in Australia belling the cat, calling the government to account and making it absolutely clear that power prices will rise by more than the already high 10 per cent—on top of the 50 per cent price rise across Australia over the last five years.


But there is something even more concerning than the price rises which will have a huge impact on industry, whether it is on aluminium, cement, steel, other forms of heavy industrial production, small businesses or families. The question is: what could have more of an impact? That is the issue of energy security. And it is not us that say that. It is the government itself and the key generators. In recent days we have seen that InterGen, one of Australia's most significant power providers has been reported as facing huge refinancing issues directly as a consequence of the carbon tax. We have seen that Loy Yang is having enormous trouble refinancing, directly as a consequence of the carbon tax. And Macquarie Generation has warned of rationing power.


Let's understand this. In the 21st century, in a developed economy, in a country with extraordinary resources, the consequence of the carbon tax on power supply is, according to the CEO of the largest generator, that we are looking at facing rationing of power supplies. That is the sign of a government that could not manage a home insulation program, could not manage a Green Loans Program, could not manage a solar hot water rebate program and certainly could not manage the world's largest and widest carbon tax. There is real and present danger to the supply of energy in Australia.


If the government doubts what we say, why did they have to create an Energy Supply Council? Why did they have to create a fund which will give a billion dollars directly to the largest Victorian brown coal power producers between 31 May and 30 June this year—cash, no strings attached? Because their balance sheets are at such a risk that this government is giving not $100 million, $200 million or $300 million of cash to the largest companies in the power generation sector just so as they can keep the lights on.


We have a situation where prices will go up, by more than the 10 per cent that the government has argued, and there is a reason for that. Because of the system that they have set in place, companies will have to make forward purchases because they have to make long-term contracts to deal with the carbon tax that is being imposed on them, and therefore there price rises will be higher than the government has said. Again, not us. That is what the Electricity Supply Association of Australia said. So power prices are going to skyrocket. If energy security is being put at risk, something is deeply, profoundly wrong. The history, the practice, the reality of the way this government has managed—green loans, pink batts, solar hot water, solar panels, cash for clunkers and citizens assembly—gives you a sense that all of these pale into insignificance when compared with what will be a $27 billion tax over three years with profound impacts on industry right across the country.


The next thing, though, is that it is not just this detail from the CEO of Macquarie Generation, but also something far more significant than that. We have Professor Warwick McKibbin, a former Reserve Bank board member, an ANU professor, and what did he say this week? He predicted the carbon tax would push up prices more than Treasury forecast. That is what a former Reserve Bank board member said. But he is not the only Reserve Bank board member: Graham Kraehe in the last week has given deep warnings about the impact of the carbon tax. Graham Kraehe and Warwick McKibbin together have made it absolutely clear that the design, the construction and the intent of this tax is deeply and profoundly flawed.


Don Argus, one of Australia's most senior business people, just today said this: 


The carbon tax was the result of political expediency. I am concerned that we have a badly designed, hurriedly implemented tax that imposes significant costs on the economy but that may not achieve its core aim.


That is absolutely right. It will not achieve its core aim because what happens to Australian emissions between now and 2020? They go up from 578 million tonnes to 621 million tonnes—a 43 million tonne increase in domestic emissions, almost two tonnes per person. How do we meet the government's objective? We have to go offshore and buy 94 million tonnes of foreign carbon credits by 2020 but at a carbon price which by their own reckoning will be $37 in actual dollars at that time. That makes $3½ billion of expenditure on top of the carbon tax.


Let us be clear here. The likely carbon tax liability to the Australian economy will be about $14½ billion by 2020 but on top of that they then have to go and purchase 94 million tonnes or $3½ billion worth of foreign carbon credits, which are paid for by Australian companies. So that money is in addition because the carbon tax does not achieve its purpose. Why does it not work? Because Australians have historically shown that if you increase electricity prices they do not change their consumption significantly; they substitute out of other things. The pensioner substitutes out of the once-a-month meal at a restaurant; the parent substitutes out of the swimming lessons; the self-funded retiree might not be able to give the present they want to their grandchildren at the end of the year. It is a reality that there is that substitution. 


On every observation, electricity is an inelastic good in Australia. The fact that electricity prices have risen 50 per cent with barely any significant change in demand over the last five years ought to say to the government, 'This is not the right mechanism to reduce emissions.' All it does is increase the cost of living, destroys jobs in companies such as Alcoa, in places such as the Kurri Kurri smelter, in places such as Tomago, in places such as Gladstone where the QAL smelter is at risk in the alumina area precisely because of the carbon tax. That is what others have made absolutely clear.


Again, do not take our word or industry's word. Let us hear what the Minister for Resources and Energy, Martin Ferguson, says. This is what he said this week, reported in the Age on 27 February:


I think there's a lot of concern in industry at the moment about the price we've locked in given where Europe is at the moment in terms of price of carbon—whether we've locked in a price that's to our disadvantage as a nation.


That was the Minister for Resources and Energy, the minister in charge of Australia's power sector, sending a message to the Prime Minister: 'This system is bunk; this system is broke; this system will not work; it won't achieve our emissions reduction outcome, but it will drive up our prices. It will not work in comparison with our competitors and therefore it is a dud, it's a fix, it's a fraud, it's a failure and it will not achieve the outcomes. But it will hurt Australian families and it will hurt Australian workers.'


That is the problem. It will send jobs to India, China and Indonesia but it will not reduce global emissions. Just today we have seen reports that council rates will also be forced up. Councils right across my home state of Victoria are talking about an increase in council rates of three per cent in the first year alone, because of the carbon tax. So every time you take out the rubbish bin, every time you seek additional work on a drain, you are going to pay more because council rates will be up. That will happen in the first year.


What we see is a tax that is profoundly flawed because it does not achieve its core outcome and is not in line with what the rest of the world is doing. Only this week, Japan has made it clear there will be no carbon tax under any government that the current Japanese Prime Minister leads. So Japan has walked away from a carbon tax. Canada held an election and ditched the carbon tax. The US President said while he was here in Australia that heading forwards there would be no carbon tax or equivalent scheme in the United States. So the rest of the world is running away from this proposal at 1,000 miles an hour. Even in Europe, you find that the European scheme averaged out at $1 per head across the continent while the Australian scheme will average out at $400 per head. We are almost 400 times heavier in our first five years than the experience under the European scheme in its first five years. There is no comparison.


I return to where I began—on the issue of competency. The structure, the nature, the purpose, the intent and the effect of the carbon tax are all deeply and profoundly flawed because of the impact on electricity prices and electricity security. The competency of those who seek to implement it is fundamentally broken. This week they could not even run a solar hot-water scheme. That scheme, which was the successor to something announced by the coalition, was announced on 19 February 2010 by, guess who, the former minister for the environment and current Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth, as the successor to the Home Insulation Program. It was terminated 48 hours ago, without notice, without warning, by the man sitting next to the government dispatch box, the Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency.


The Clean Energy Council have denounced the termination. Numerous people within the industry have denounced it. The government has tried to make it clear that the money ran out. Two weeks ago, the portfolio budget statement showed there was $24½ million in the forward estimates for next year—so this program was extended a year ago with an additional $24½ million. That was done in the budget papers in 2011. It was reconfirmed by Treasury two weeks ago, and now that money has mysteriously gone. The government has ripped the solar sector off. It cannot manage the carbon tax, and this tax should be abolished immediately. (Time expired)

"Dreyfus, Mark, MP",ALP,2012-03-01,"



Mr DREYFUS
 (Isaacs—Cabinet Secretary, Parliamentary Secretary for Industry and Innnovation and Parliamentary Secretary for Climate Change and Energy Efficiency) (15:53):  I want to put on the record that we will not abandon the pricing of carbon. That is the one thing that was raised here by the member for Flinders which he did not actually want to go to in his remarks. We will not abandon the pricing of carbon. This parliament, the parliament elected by the people of Australia, has legislated for the pricing of carbon, and we will not be abandoning the pricing of carbon. It is a mark of the extraordinary extreme economic irresponsibility of the opposition that they would propose even a delay or a modification of the pricing of carbon. But in fact they are proposing here its abandonment.



Mr Hunt interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  The member for Flinders was heard in silence!




Mr DREYFUS:
  I need to make clear that we have joined the world effort to combat climate change, which the Howard government dragged its feet on until the last minute before the 2007 election. But even the Howard government finally got there, agreeing with Labor's policy of introducing a price on carbon, agreeing with Labor's policy of introducing an emissions trading scheme, agreeing with Labor's policy to take action to fight climate change. It was led in that agreement—dragging the rest of the government along with him kicking and screaming—by the member for Wentworth, as the last Liberal minister for the environment.


This gives me an opportunity to put the record straight in relation to some of the fictions that the member for Flinders has been advancing here in the House about the solar hot-water rebate scheme that was closed this week—or closed with effect from 30 June 2012, because rebates will continue to be paid in respect of applications made through to 30 June 2012 provided there was a contract entered into by 28 February 2012. That scheme, far from having being introduced just recently, far from being in some way—as I think the member for Flinders colourfully put it—a successor to the Home Insulation Program, was in fact a scheme commenced on 17 July 2007, when it was announced by the then Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, the member for Wentworth. I had an occasion to look for the press release, because I wanted to check when it was announced and I wanted to check the way in which it was announced. The member for Wentworth said:


Funding of $252.2 million over five years will also be provided for up to 225,000 solar hot water rebates of $1,000 for households which install eligible solar and heat pump water heaters in their homes.


That is what the then Liberal minister for the environment, the member for Wentworth, said on 17 July 2007.



Mr Hunt interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Flinders will be silent or he will leave the chamber!




Mr DREYFUS:
  We in 2009 extended the program to $320 million and have in fact delivered this program. It has now provided rebates in respect of some 250,000 installations and it has been in four budgets. This should be no surprise to any member of this House. It is certainly no surprise to the member for Flinders that this was a time-limited program that has been at all times described as a program for five years. It was described as a program for five years when introduced by the Liberal minister for the environment and it has been described by us as a program running for five years. It has been in four successive federal budgets, there for all to read. Because it was coming to an end in 2012, we have also provided, for run-off purposes, another $24.5 million in respect of rebates that are claimed right up to the last day, 30 June. We will need some funding to make sure that those rebate claims made by Australians are able to be paid. That is the reality of this program. It is a Liberal government initiative continued by us.


But I want to get to the context for this initiative rolled out by the member for Wentworth when he was the last Liberal minister for the environment. The 17 July 2007 media release was headed—and this shows how far the Liberal Party has fallen from economic responsibility and from any real attempt to take action on climate change—'Australia leading the world on climate change'. In it, the last Liberal minister for the environment—and I hope we do not have another one anytime soon—is quoted:


The Australian Government will commence work on a world-leading greenhouse gas emissions trading scheme with careful analysis on a long-term goal for emissions reduction, the Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, Malcolm Turnbull, said today. 


'Australia's emissions trading scheme will be the most comprehensive in the world,' said Mr Turnbull.


How far has the Liberal Party fallen from economic responsibility since 2007? A very long way. This is now the party of the $70 billion black hole. It is the party that wants to put up taxes, as demonstrated by the Leader of the Opposition's paid parental leave scheme, which he says he is welded to, that is going to be funded by a new tax on business.


The last Liberal government of this country was completely committed to the pricing of carbon. We remain completely committed to the pricing of carbon, and the parliament elected by the people of Australia has legislated for the pricing of carbon. The opposition needs to realise that abandoning the pricing of carbon—which the member for Flinders calls for in this matter of public importance—would condemn Australia to future economic disruption as we get closer to 2020, because the world is now on track to an agreement to reduce the world's emissions. This is a world problem. Once upon a time the Liberal Party actually understood that. We have it clear that abandonment of sound policy is now a hallmark of the opposition. We have it, for example, in seeing that the opposition would abandon the minerals resource rent tax as well because they do not want the people of Australia to have a boost to superannuation and they do not want the people of Australia to have a boost to infrastructure—they do not want the people of Australia, indeed, to share in the benefits of the mining boom.


I have to admit that, like most Australians, I am getting very, very sick of the opposition's endless negativity. We saw confected outrage this week in relation to the orderly closure of a five-year time-limited program for solar hot-water rebates. We saw it again today from the member for Flinders. We need to be clear about this: climate change is happening, climate change is real, and we have to act. The opposition say that they believe this. They say that they support our emission reduction targets. But instead of supporting policy that is in the national interest they engage in an utterly unprincipled scare campaign. What a joke.


Last time I spoke on this issue in this chamber, I noted just how astounding it was to see how those on the other side of this chamber have wilfully perpetuated their own ignorance. They have deliberately ignored the benefits of our clean energy future plan for reasons of political expediency. They try to maintain that we should not put a price on carbon. I remind the House that those opposite do not even believe what they are saying—and, in particular, the member for Flinders does not believe what he is saying. The member for Flinders is very familiar with the benefits of pricing carbon. After all, he did win a prize for his 1990 university thesis entitled 'A tax to make the polluter pay'.



Mr Hunt interjecting—




Mr DREYFUS:
  The member for Flinders is saying he did not win a prize for the essay, but in fact he did write his 1990 thesis on 'A tax to make the polluter pay'. The member for Flinders, back when he had intellectual integrity, even pointed out the benefits of pricing carbon, including that it produces a strong incentive for firms to engage in research and development. But now he goes on and talks about the opposition's so-called direct action plan, toeing the party line. Indeed, this so-called direct action plan is a policy that he is well aware would cost Australians dearly, because this is the substitute that the opposition puts forward for the economically responsible and environmentally responsible policy of pricing carbon.


To reach the five per cent reduction target using the coalition's so-called direct action plan would impose a cost on taxpayers of something in the order of $30 billion between now and 2020. The so-called direct action plan would lead to bigger costs for households than a broad carbon price, and that is something that the member for Flinders and most of those opposite who have any kind of economic understanding understand. That is well understood by all responsible commentators and all responsible economists. The member for Flinders has had a complete loss of credibility, and he has clearly taken lessons from the Leader of the Opposition, who is, as we all know, the master of negativity.


Because our government is focused on actually governing rather than just playing politics and taking positions, because our government is focused on actually governing as opposed to the bizarre and confected hysteria of those opposite, let me explain why our policy is the best way to address climate change. The clean energy future plan is in fact a huge opportunity for Australian workers and a huge opportunity for Australian business. It is a plan which will cut pollution. It is a plan which will drive investment and create jobs in clean energy technologies and infrastructure like solar, gas and wind. It will help build the clean energy future that future Australians deserve.


Action on climate change can help position Australia to take full advantage of the opportunities presented by a future carbon-constrained global economy. The world is taking action. The world is continuing to take action on climate change. Failing to act, which is what those opposite would have us do, will mean that Australia will not be able to fully participate in the new global economy. Failing to act now would mean missing out on access to new markets. It would mean missing out on the benefits that will flow from a more innovative Australia and it would risk the economic costs imposed by late action.


That is what those opposite seem to have failed to understand. If, as it is now agreed that we will work towards, the world reaches an agreement by 2020 that imposes a legally binding obligation on Australia to achieve very major cuts in our emissions and we have not, as we intend to do, embarked on the path of cutting Australia's emissions—and we are a very carbon-intensive economy—if we have not embarked now, in 2012, on the path of reducing Australia's emissions, then the cost to Australia, the cost to the whole of the economy, to Australian workers and to Australian businesses, will be immense. It will cause immense disruption to our economy. But that is the path that the opposition would have us now embark on. That is what they are calling for when they are saying that we should abandon the pricing of carbon.


The clean energy future plan is one of the most significant industry and innovation policies that this nation has seen. It is over $15 billion invested in creating the jobs of tomorrow, most notably in manufacturing. Those opposite would have our industries stand still as their overseas competitors reduce their pollution intensity and get a head start in competing with the low-carbon global economy, because that is where the world is headed.


Of course, because we are the Labor Party, we are a party that represents working people. We will be making sure that low- and middle-income earners receive assistance as we make these changes. In none of the speeches that one hears from those opposite do we ever hear about the assistance part of the clean energy future package. They never talk about assistance, only hysterically inflated estimates of the costs of imposing a price on carbon. It is important to keep the assistance in mind. We have tax cuts. We have increased payments which are targeted at those who need them most. Labor will make sure that pensioners, low- and middle-income earners and families doing it tough are looked after. The rest of the world is acting. Our economy and our environment will be badly damaged unless Australia acts too. It really must take a lot of collective effort to deny reality so comprehensively as the opposition seeks to do. We do know that many of those opposite like to pretend that climate change is not happening. Perhaps one of the people sitting opposite me at the ministerial table—the member for Flinders, I think—is prepared to accept that climate change is happening, but many of those opposite simply ignore the facts, the overwhelming weight of evidence from the scientific community, that climate change is happening, and they have cobbled together a policy which they have got no intention of pursuing if they ever hold office—their so-called direct action policy. Do not be fooled: this is a policy which is not designed to reduce emissions; it is simply a policy that is designed to give an appearance of action. It is a fig leaf to cover the fact that they do not actually want to take any action in respect of climate change. (Time expired)

"Mirabella, Sophie, MP",LP,2012-03-01,"



Mrs MIRABELLA
 (Indi) (16:08):  We need to start at the very beginning. Why do we have a carbon tax? Did the Prime Minister say before the election: 'We need this carbon tax so we can be competitive. We need this carbon tax so new industries can develop'? No. As we, infamously, are now all too often reminded by people in the street, the Prime Minister said, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead.' So all the reasons that the member for Isaacs has given—this feigned moral high ground—are an absolute farce. It is just another excuse to hide—he mentioned a fig leaf, so I will perhaps borrow—behind the fig leaf of responsible government. 


This Prime Minister has pursued a carbon tax not because our competitors are going down this path, because they are not, and we have just recently heard that Japan has categorically ruled it out, and not because our industries are demanding it. The only reason that this Prime Minister has pursued a carbon tax is that the Prime Minister, in her poor, pathetic judgment, thought that that is the price she had to give to the Greens in order to retain power. It is as simple as that. I ask members on the other side: for goodness sake, how could you keep the Prime Minister in her job when her judgment was so lacking? As if the Greens would ever have supported the coalition to form government! All the Prime Minister had to do was throw the Greens a few carrots and say, 'Either you support me or you will end up with the coalition, the mainstream political party, that you hate.' That is all she had to do. She did not have to sell Australian families, Australian power generators, Australian manufacturers and Australian industry down the drain. That poor political judgment is her crime. That poor political judgment will be the nail in her political coffin. 


The member for Isaacs talked about the solar hot water rebate. His words yesterday, as they were reported in the media, were astounding. He said that it was actually good economic practice, good budget practice, not to tell anyone you were going to gut a program. So here are Australian retailers and Australian manufacturers saying, 'We believe you, Prime Minister, when you say you want to provide incentives for Australians to move to renewable energy, to alternative energies, so we will invest. We will mortgage our home. We will take out leases on vehicles and on warehouses. We will do all of that because we believe you,' and they did. So now there are small businesses across this country—and we have read about some of them in the media—who are saying: 'What a disgrace. The government has betrayed us. They have removed a scheme that we invested in and now we are going to have to sell up our home because we relied on the word of this government.' And that is an absolute disgrace.


For this government to totally mismanage the economy, to pour billions down the drain with a whole litany of programs and then try to scramble and find a few savings to fulfil the myth that they are going to deliver a surplus, begs the question: if they cannot manage a program like the solar hot water rebate, how on earth can they adequately manage an economy-wide carbon tax? How on earth can we believe them when they make predictions that electricity prices will only go up by 10 per cent, when we have had contrary evidence in the last couple of days with power firms facing a $4 billion carbon slug and predictions that electricity prices will blow out of the water? You cannot trust them. They cannot manage a program like pink batts. There are still warehouses full to the ceiling with pink batts, and the solar hot water rebate program is just pink batts mark II. These people could not organise a party in a tent let alone manage an economy-wide carbon tax.


Even some of the most respectable people on that side know that the carbon tax is a dud. It is no coincidence that we had several members in heavy manufacturing seats—like the member for Corangamite, the member for La Trobe, as well as the current manufacturing minister, Kim Carr—voted for the member for Griffith in the leadership ballot this week. Labor's position on the carbon tax further unravels with the member for Griffith calling for a review after six months, and Martin Ferguson saying in February, 'There is a lot of concern in industry about the price we have locked in and whether we have locked in a price that is to our disadvantage as a nation.' At least he is speaking some truth. At least the Australian people can say that there is at least one person in the Labor Party who is stating the bleeding obvious. Talking about the bleeding obvious, how can a political party that is engaged in an absolute blood feud with the faceless men who are still the puppeteers and holding back the Prime Minister from anointing the foreign minister of her choice—a party that cannot govern itself and cannot administer the solar hot water rebate program—be trusted to administer an economy-wide carbon tax?


The real myth with the carbon tax is that it will grow new jobs, that it will be great for our economy. Well, it is not going to be, because we are going it alone. With this carbon tax we are putting lead in the saddle bags of industries that are already doing it tough. There are challenges: a high dollar, high commodity prices—so why on earth, at this time, would you impose this additional tax?


We have heard from a multitude of industry leaders that the carbon tax will not make a difference to worldwide emissions. Why is that? It is because our industries are relatively efficient. Industries like cement, aluminium and steel have adopted world's best practice and have reduced their emissions. When they have to compete with imported products that do not have a carbon tax imposed upon them, investment is going to go offshore and jobs are going to go offshore. And that investment and those jobs will go to countries that will create more emissions making the things we used to make.


So, hey presto: here we have a carbon tax that has the very real potential of actually increasing worldwide emissions, and the government is still refusing to publicly acknowledge this. How many brownie points would the Prime Minister get by saying: 'You know what? I shouldn't have listened to the Greens. I should have listened to Australian workers. I should have listened to Australian businesses that have done the right thing and become more energy efficient. I should have listened to common sense and actually governed in the national interest.'


The reason they cannot admit they are wrong is that the Prime Minister used to work for the former Premier of Victoria, and his rule was, 'Never admit you're wrong'—never admit you are wrong; just plough through and get through it. That is why this Prime Minister is losing so much respect.


We have heard not just from the heavy industries. We have heard also from food and grocery manufacturing. Kate Carnell said:


For Julia Gillard to say that food companies who aren’t in the top 1000 emitters won’t be affected by carbon tax is simply wrong.


Manufacturers will be impacted right across the supply chain from higher costs in transport, power, refrigeration and food and grocery manufacturing.



That is the reality for so many industries across the board. This government talks about compensation, but you do not compensate people unless you injure them. As Graham Kraehe said, any compensation will be like a bandaid over a bullet wound. These people cannot add up basic figures on the back of an envelope. Does anyone really believe that their compensation to the industries it goes to will actually be adequate? Absolutely not. (Time expired)

"Thomson, Kelvin, MP",ALP,2012-03-01,"



Mr KELVIN THOMSON
 (Wills) (16:18):  The opposition wants us to say no to a price on carbon. But I believe we should say yes to a price on carbon, because human-caused climate change is confirmed by every academy of science in the world and 97 per cent—I repeat, 97 per cent—of practicing climate scientists. No study that contradicts the fundamentals of climate change has not been rebutted.


The opposition peddles climate change denial. The Leader of the Opposition last year described carbon as an 'invisible, odourless, weightless, tasteless, substance'. Apparently carbon dioxide is some kind of damned elusive scarlet pimpernel, impossible to find or capture. Yet the government of which he was a member enacted legislation—the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act—requiring businesses to measure, monitor and report this allegedly weightless and elusive substance.


The fact is that average air temperature at the Earth's surface has continued on an upward trajectory at a rate of 0.17 degrees Celsius per decade over the past three decades. The fact is that the extent of arctic sea ice cover continues on a long-term downward trend, and recent observations confirm net loss of ice from the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets. The fact is that the sea level has risen at a higher rate over the past two decades.


We should say yes to a price on carbon because climate change will have major impacts on Australia in the future, both on our environment and on our economy. We in Melbourne got a real taste of the future in February 2009 when the Black Saturday bushfires took advantage of Melbourne's 46.4 degrees—it was the hottest day we have ever had—and took advantage of the second driest January since records began. In pre-industrial times, CO2 concentrations were 280 parts per million. They are now 380 parts per million and rising. We are pumping into our atmosphere more carbon than it can deal with, leaving behind a debt for our children—for future generations.


The planet's weather system is a very complex thing, and the changes vary from place to place, from country to country. But the headline impacts are rising temperature, melting polar ice caps, rising sea levels, inundation of low-lying coastal regions, movement of tropical diseases and more frequent extreme weather events, such as droughts, bushfires, cyclones and floods. In Australia, coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef is of particular concern. The drought we saw in southern Australia during the first decade of this century and the floods we have seen in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria will be our future if we do not put a price on carbon. I am intrigued that the opposition completely ignores the insurance industry, which is very clear about the impact of climate change on so-called natural disasters and on insurance premiums.


We should say yes to a price on carbon because a price on carbon will cut carbon emissions and drive investment in clean energy technologies and infrastructure like solar, gas and wind. It will help build the clean energy future that Australia—and the planet—needs. It establishes a long-term economy-wide target to reduce emissions by 80 per cent from 2000 levels by 2050. That is a bold but science based target which Australia and Australians should be proud of. 


We should say yes to a price on carbon because with it will come a $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation which will invest in the commercialisation and deployment of renewable energy and low-emissions technologies. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation will play an important role in removing the barriers to investment and encouraging private investors. It is a shame that Australia's world quality renewable energy research has not led to more Australian manufacturing and Australian jobs. The Clean Energy Finance Corporation will be about changing that.


We should say yes to a price on carbon because it will be paid by around 500 of the biggest carbon polluters. It will not be paid by ordinary Australians. It is not a tax on ordinary Australians; indeed, millions of Australians will pay less tax as a consequence of the carbon price. We should say yes to a price on carbon because the government has gone out of its way to protect those industries and jobs that could potentially be adversely affected by the carbon price. There is a $1.3 billion coal sector jobs package to preserve local communities by providing transitional assistance to emissions-intensive coal mines; a $70 million Coal Mining Abatement Technology Support Package to support technologies to fight fugitive emissions from coal mines; a $300 million Steel Transformation Plan to help the steel industry transition to a clean energy future; a $200 million fund for regional workers in the event they are affected by the introduction of a carbon price; a $200 million Clean Technologies Food and Foundries Investment Program which will provide grants for manufacturers in the food processing and metal forging and foundry sectors; and $5.5 billion of transitional assistance for highly emissions-intensive coal fired electricity generators to promote a smooth transition and maintain energy security.


We should say yes to a price on carbon because all of the money raised from it will go to jobs, clean energy and households. The government will not make a cent from it. Nine in 10 households will receive assistance through tax cuts and/or payment increases. Almost six million households will get tax cuts or increases in payments that cover the entire average price impact. Over four million Australian households will get an extra buffer with assistance that covers 120 per cent of the average price impact of the carbon price.


Over one million Australians will no longer need to lodge a tax return. This is fantastic reform, with the tax-free threshold being trebled from $6,000 to $18,000 per year. While on average the carbon price will cost households $9.90 per week, they will get back even more—an average $10.10 per week—in government assistance. This assistance is permanent and will increase. It is not like the Howard government's one-off compensation to pensioners for the GST. The government will review the adequacy of assistance each year and increase it further if necessary. Pensioners will receive an extra $338 per year if they are single and up to $510 per year for couples combined. This increase will be delivered as a new, permanent and tax exempt Clean Energy Supplement.


We should say yes to a price on carbon because the price will help rural communities benefit from carbon farming, and our birds, plants and animals will benefit from measures to protect biodiverse landscapes. Under the Carbon Farming Futures program $276 million over the forward estimates will help farmers and other landholders to benefit from carbon farming. Through the Biodiversity Fund $572 million over the forward estimates will restore and protect Australia's biodiverse landscape. Under the Indigenous Carbon Farming Fund $10 million over the forward estimates will support Indigenous participation in carbon farming. There will be $40 million for the Regional Natural Resource Management Planning for Climate Change Fund, and there is a carbon farming skills package to support green jobs and ensure that landholders have access to credible high quality advice and carbon services. All up, there will be $1.7 billion over seven years for these really important land and biodiversity measures.


We should say yes to a price on carbon because this is what the world is moving to do. Ten American states, including New York, have already put a price on carbon pollution from their electricity generators. California, the world's eighth largest economy, will start a carbon trading scheme this year. China has announced that it will introduce emissions trading commencing in key cities and provinces including Beijing, Shanghai and Guangdong, and India has introduced a clean energy tax on coal. Europe of course has an emissions trading scheme—that is, a price on carbon. I acknowledge that there are plenty of countries around the world that could be doing more, but the idea that we should stand back and wait until everyone else has moved is incredibly short-sighted and irresponsible. Finally, we should say yes to a price on carbon because, as a garden sign in a house in Brunswick in my electorate puts it, 'Say yes to a price on carbon, because my kids are worth it'.

Mr CHRISTENSEN
 (Dawson) (16:28):  The clock is ticking on the discussion of this matter of public importance, and it should be ticking on the carbon tax too. The carbon tax symbolises the stark difference between what people were told before the last election—that there would be no carbon tax under the government the Prime Minister led—and what people are now having shoved down their necks. It is a symbol of deception, but in reality it is also a hit for Australian working families. The Prime Minister claims that most families will have to pay $9.90 per week, but I can assure the Prime Minister and government members opposite that families in my electorate are going to be paying a lot more than that under the carbon tax. 


Deloittes says that Mackay will be basically ground zero—the hardest-hit region in the hardest-hit state in Australia. As a result of the carbon tax, Mackay families will be paying, for their high use of electricity through air conditioners, somewhere around $10 a week, if you use the figure of a 20 per cent rise in energy costs that the energy providers are saying the carbon tax will cause. That is just the start. Families will also have to fork out for council rate rises. Rates are a huge impost on many families, and the Deputy Mayor of Mackay claims there will be a two per cent rate rise. That is why local people in the Dawson region do not want this carbon tax. They want it repealed. I have a petition here from 1,100 signatories calling for an election on the carbon tax. That is the least the government can do. I seek leave to table that petition.




The SPEAKER:
  My understanding is that the petition has not been approved as a petition and so the honourable  member is seeking leave to table the petition as a document. Is leave granted?


Leave not granted.

Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayo) (16:30):  Let's hope the rain does not wash away the road, so we can get to the airport! I rise this evening to speak on this Year of the Farmer, a very worthwhile and appropriate nomination this year which gives us time to reflect upon the importance of regional Australia to our country, our economy and our very existence. Mayo is a regional area in South Australia. It has—and I am sure the Leader of the National Party will agree—some of the finest agricultural land in the country. We produce some of the best food in the country. I can see the Leader of the National Party at the table nodding his head vigorously, and I am sure my constituents appreciate his support. It is true. I agree with the Leader of the National Party that we do produce some of the best food in Australia. It is a great thing. We have dairy. We have wheat. We have sheep and beef. We have some of the very best wine in the world, and we produce a range of other fresh produce.


There are challenges, we know, in the agricultural sector in the boom-and-bust cycle of it. We went through, sadly, in the 2000s some of the most horrific times in drought and it caused significant challenges. We forget now with all this rain coming down how bad it was, particularly towards the last part of the last decade. Some of those issues are still being worked through.


There are additional challenges and structural changes. We have seen that the price of land for people trying to enter the farming community has been a prohibiting factor. We are now dealing with the challenges of ensuring that we have a sustainable Murray-Darling Basin. That is a contentious issue. It is something which has no easy solution. We have a very strong Australian dollar which is making it more difficult for our farm producers to compete globally. Added to that, we have a government who is intent on trying to damage the farming sector with the world's largest carbon tax, a tax that my farming community certainly does not want. I am constantly being lobbied by those people who can see the damage this carbon tax will do. Farmers are very practical people. They know that this is the world's largest carbon tax, without any genuine environmental benefit for our country.


There are some real challenges but I think the future has never been as bright as it now is for our agricultural sector either. The growth and the opportunities in our region are quite staggering. The OECD tells us that in 2010 there were some 550 million of the world's middle class in our region, in Asia. By 2030 the OECD predicts there will be 3.2 billion of the world's middle class—2.7 billion new people in the middle class. We know that as they move into the middle class they will wish to enjoy the same lifestyle that we benefit from so much. That means consumption of food and fibre will continue to grow at rates never seen in human history, which creates great opportunities for the highest quality food producers in the world. That is what Australian farmers are. We should celebrate that in the Year of the Farmer. We should celebrate the contribution our regional sector and our agricultural sector make to our country and to our globe. They produce some of the finest, safest, most high-quality food in the world. We should genuinely appreciate what they do.



There are 10,000 people in my electorate who are employed directly in this industry. It is the third-highest employer in my electorate. It is an area of potential growth not only in my electorate but across our country as we seek to service these markets. What I do greatly fear, as we play to our strengths in this area, is that government will get in the way with inappropriate regulation or by intervening in the markets to make it harder for people to compete on an international scale. We know that we import half as much as we export to China when it comes to food. That is a great thing because there is a great and growing opportunity for us to do more. I say, in the Year of the Farmer, let's reward the farmer. Let's have a new government that will offer hope and reward as this country moves towards a great opportunity for our regional sector and for our regional people in this year, the Year of the Farmer.

Mr O'DOWD
 (Flynn) (09:30):  I rise to table a petition, which has gone through the Standing Committee on Petitions, on behalf of the aggrieved people of my electorate regarding the recent closure of over-the-counter services at the Chapple Street Post Office in Gladstone. A rather large number of people in the area, 1,676 to be exact, found reason to support this cause by signing the petition exercising their democratic rights by registering their objections to this very short-sighted decision by Australia Post. The stealth attack by Australia Post was made during the Christmas period, when the public eye was focused on other things.


The petition against the closure was supported by every level of government: the Gladstone Regional Council Mayor, Gail Sellers; the state member for Gladstone, Liz Cunningham; and me. All levels of government in Gladstone opposed this decision because we recognise the rapid growth occurring in the city, the importance this service has provided and the impact this decision has had on other post offices in the area. In correspondence dated 22 December 2011 the shadow minister, the member for Wentworth, sought through the minister advice from Australia Post as to which outlets had been under review. To date this request has not been responded to. The correspondence also stated:


The fact that I have been unable to obtain the full list of retail outlets affected by Australia Post's review highlights the unsatisfactory level of consultation and disregard for the dramatic effect closing a local Australia Post outlet can have on the community.


In conjunction with the petition, I wrote to both Australia Post and the minister for communications. Both Australia Post and the minister's office were of little use to me as they were unable to provide me with what could only be described as a pathetic excuse. Unfortunately, the minister's response to my inquiry came after the closure had occurred, which only brought me to the conclusion that the communication minister appears to be a poor communicator. My office continues to receive correspondence regarding the closure and the impact it is having on businesses and services at other post offices. I sincerely hope that, as a result of tabling this petition, we are able to reverse this poor decision and return the post office to its original status.




The petition read as follows—



To the Honourable The Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives


This petition of Residents and Citizens of Gladstone and District, Queensland draws to the attention of the House the unsatisfactory closure of the over-the-counter facilities at Chapple Street Post Office and Business Centre which is an indispensable regional service provided to Gladstone residents and businesses and the rapidly growing Gladstone region.


We therefore ask the House to ensure that the over-the-counter facilities at the Chapple Street Post Office and Business Centre remain open and accessible to Gladstone residents.

"Robb, Andrew, MP",LP,2012-03-01,"



Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein) (10:01):  I rise today to speak on the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 2012. This bill seeks to amend four acts and repeal two acts across three portfolios. It is part of an ongoing program of updating and enhancing the Commonwealth's financial framework. This is the ninth financial framework legislation amendment bill since 2004. These bills generally seek to correct misdescribed provisions, add clarity where required and enhance acts to make them consistent with complementary legislation. They also seek to repeal redundant components of the financial framework, such as prior programs that have expired.


Schedule 1 seeks to amend the Auditor-General Act 1997 to clarify that the Auditor-General may accept an appointment under the Corporations Act 2001 as the auditor of any company that the Commonwealth controls. This will align the act with the definitions of Commonwealth control which were made in 2008 for the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 2007. We of course support this amendment.


There is though, in my view, a case for placing stronger obligations on government departments and agencies, including the minister's own department, to more strictly adhere to the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines. We are seeing far too many instances where guidelines are being flouted. That is not conducive to achieving best value outcomes. To this end, I wrote some time ago to the Auditor-General of Australia, Mr McPhee, to seek some clarity on just what is happening with regard to the purchase of property and services, the whole procurement process and the efficiency of that process, and to ascertain whether we as a community are seeing the government and its agencies doing things in a way which best meets the responsibilities they have to handle public moneys. As part of his response the Auditor-General says:


Your letter also sought advice on whether further reform of procurement could provide savings of 5 to 10 per cent over the forward estimates without compromising the standard of property and services purchased by the Commonwealth.


He goes on:


Because our audit was only focused on direct sourcing and whether agencies were adhering to the CPGs, we did not seek to quantify the potential saving that could be achieved.


He says, though:


Nevertheless, our audit work indicates that better value for money outcomes could be achieved through improvements to the procurement practices.


He talks about the fact that direct source procurement, which may include a competitive process, accounted for 43 per cent or $10.2 billion of the total reported value of contracts for the calendar year. But among the key findings of the audit was a 'lack of documentation' of agencies' value-for-money considerations for 74 per cent of the audit sample of direct source procurements, that agencies 'did not seek multiple quotes' in 85 per cent of the direct source procurements examined and that agencies could not consistently ensure that covered 'direct source procurements examined met the limited circumstances' in the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines which permit direct sourcing. For the Auditor-General to use this language, to be this direct and to record such significant, in my view, oversights in the procurement process suggests an area of spending that is just startling. We are talking about a contract worth $23.5 billion, and in 74 per cent of the audit sample there was a lack of documentation on how they could show value for money out of that process. I have run public companies. If you took to a board proposals for capital expenditure of sums much smaller than this which did not convince the board of a value-for-money outcome, you would not be in a job long. Yet here we have startling results from the piece of work done by the Auditor-General and, when I raised it with the government, I got a perfunctory response—no response, really, of any consequence; just politics. It is a legitimate question. We are here as an opposition to ensure the accountability of governments. An Auditor-General is prepared to write back to me and report those sorts of findings, and the minister for finance treats it as just a political act by me. It is unacceptable and it does reflect, I think, mismanagement on a much wider scale or bad supervision by a minister on a much wider scale.


It helps explain the waste that the community understands that this government has become a symbol of. This government's waste, debt and deficits have become, I think, a matter of great embarrassment to this community. It is one of the reasons we got 750,000 more votes than the Labor Party at the last election, in spite of being the first—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  The member will refer his remarks to the bill. He will be relevant to the bill before us.




Mr ROBB:
  The bill—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The bill has nothing to do with the votes at the last election. I draw you back to the bill, please.




Mr ROBB:
  I was reinforcing my point, Madam Deputy Speaker, about the waste, which is very much a part of this bill. These provisions—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Yes, and I allowed you to make comments that I think were pretty borderline on the Audit Office as well, so I would heed the warning and be relevant to the bill.




Mr Husic:
  Or just be relevant generally.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member has the call.




Mr ROBB:
  I will restrain myself, Madam Deputy Speaker. Schedule 2 would amend the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act itself to ensure that directors of Commonwealth authorities and wholly owned government companies and enterprises prepare budget estimates as directed by the finance minister rather than the responsible portfolio minister. This would make the act consistent with longstanding practice.


The most significant component of schedule 2 is the new obligation on the directors of Commonwealth authorities and wholly owned companies to notify their responsible minister of decisions about significant events immediately after a decision has been taken. Significant events include forming a company or participating in the formation of a company, acquiring or disposing of a significant shareholding in a company, acquiring or disposing of significant business or commencing or ceasing a significant business activity.


I strongly support this provision. It is consistent with the obligations of public companies, with continuous disclosure required, which makes eminent sense in the case of public companies, which are responsible to shareholders and prospective shareholders to advise what really is going on with the company. There is no good reason why the minister and the government of the day should not be similarly informed about the major organisations that they are responsible for. That raises the question of accountability. I welcome measures to make the directors of government linked entities more accountable. However, they are somewhat meaningless if the Minister for Finance and Deregulation is powerless to stop poor quality spending outcomes based on what the minister could suspect in advance were bad decisions. I will provide an example. Recently, I sent the finance minister a very detailed letter seeking clarity on a number of concerns regarding government due diligence and the oversight of the wholly government owned NBN corporation. The minister responded with literally pages of bureaucratic gobbledegook, yet failed to answer the key questions. It was one of the best examples of a Yes, Minister response I have seen in all my life. There were four pages of processes which, we are led to believe or are to be convinced, show the extraordinary accountability of NBN. Yet in all of these so-called safety provisions for accountability the minister was unable to identify or outline the red flag measures she has in place to identify problematic NBN company decisions that could result in wasteful spending. There were four pages of different procedures that supposedly outlined transparency and accountability, but none of it specified her ability to red-flag measures, which is a very standard risk management procedure of any company worth its salt.


Nor could she say that she had a veto authority over the company's spending activities, regardless of how questionable they might be. The government is the sole shareholder of what is the biggest infrastructure project, at $50 billion, in the history of Australia—virtually all borrowed money. At the moment, after 2½ years, it has 4,000 customers; it has more employees than customers. At Smithton, where it started, only seven people have taken it up even though they got a free offer. The technology that was put in place there two years ago no longer connects properly to the rest of the system. It is a dynamic sector, which they were warned about.


But in relation to the financial framework surrounding the NBN project, which this bill is particularly looking to improve, the original standard was set when the government refused to subject the proposal to a cost-benefit analysis. If you have got no cost-benefit analysis, which provides some reference point against which you can judge future implementation, no wonder there is no capacity for a red flag process. To not have the potential to veto any decision, no matter how problematic or misguided activities might be, is an extraordinary situation for a 100 per cent shareholder, the minister, who is ultimately responsible for the largest project in Australian history. It is the most disgraceful example of poor governance and it is becoming a symbol around the world of how not to manage a major public project. We are becoming a laughing stock over the implementation, the inefficiency, the costs, the timing and the fact that we are the only country in the world, that I am aware of, that is now renationalising the telecommunications sector at a time when that sector is the most dynamic of any sector in any economy. It is the last sector that you would want to renationalise with a bureaucratic culture. Taxpayers' money is at risk in an area where technology is changing by the day. Schedule 3 of this bill is devoted to—




Ms Owens:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I have a point of order on relevance—that is all I need to say.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Goldstein has strayed quite a lot. I have let him get away with it, but if he does not come back to the bill I will sit him down. You cannot in any way, shape or form tell me that what you just said about the NBN was relevant to this bill. The member for Goldstein has the call.




Mr ROBB:
  This bill— 



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Goldstein went off the track. I let him. If he does not come back, I will sit him down.




Mr ROBB:
  Schedule 3 of this bill is devoted to correcting two misdescribed provisions in the Financial Framework Legislation Act 2010, which are contained in section 27a of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act that is replacing references to 'at common law and inequity' and 'at common law or inequity' with 'under the general law'. Schedule 4 relates in part to the special accounts appropriation under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. This provision applies to special account appropriations which relate to either the COAG Reform Fund Act 2008 or a special account established under the Nation-building Funds Act.


Determination for such appropriations are done by way of disallowable instrument. As it stands, such a determination takes effect after the five sitting days in which the parliament can move to disallow pass. Such appropriations may be used by new government agencies once they are established. For the purpose of practicality this amendment allows the minister to prescribe a date in the instrument for which the appropriation takes effect. This allows a future date to be set which corresponds with the establishment date of a new agency. It has no material effect and serves to add clarity to the act to confirm such an instrument can come into effect at a nominated date beyond and immediately after the expiry of the disallowable instrument. At is a sensible measure.


Offsetting debt—the other key feature of schedule 4—is the provision to give the finance minister the discretionary power to offset debts owed to the Commonwealth by an individual or entity against payments owed to the same individual or entity. As it stands, Commonwealth payments must be paid in full regardless of debts owing. This new section provides a mechanism for the Commonwealth to recover debts in a cost neutral way and more efficient manner than allowed under current provisions. It is a sensible measure given the budget's vulnerability on account of this government's mismanagement and spiralling debt. 


I have sought assurances from the minister, however, that this authority will not be used in a way to unreasonably disadvantage business whether big or small. For example, if a business has an arrangement in place with the ATO in relation to paying off a taxation debt, I was seeking comfort that the minister would honour such agreements. In other words, not override them but denying a business payments owed as a means of accelerated settlement of payment to the Commonwealth, because, by definition, if they sought an arrangement they have got a cash-flow problem. If this measure was used to recover the Commonwealth debt more quickly, it cuts across what has already been a decision to help that company meet its financial taxation commitment to the Commonwealth, but also not put itself in the position where it has a cash-flow problem and might face receivership or other difficulties. I do thank the minister for assurances that this measure would not lead to such eventualities.


Schedule 5 of this bill also proposes to repeal two redundant special appropriations to clean up the statute book. These include the Appropriation (Development Bank) Act 1975 and the Car Dealership Financing Guarantee Appropriation Act 2009. 


The process of ongoing maintenance and enhancement of the Commonwealth's financial framework commenced under the coalition. We support this endeavour in principle, including the changes outlined in this bill. However, we do feel in many respects it is a missed opportunity. I have taken the opportunity during my comments to point out some of those missed opportunities, which I think are highly relevant to the Commonwealth's financial framework, and in particular that NBN example. There has been $100 billion of public works, of infrastructure projects, that have been authorised by this government, none of which have had a benefit-cost analysis and certainly none which has been published. That was despite the assurances when the infrastructure Australia was set up. When infrastructure Australia was set up, the government said that it would publically conduct benefit-cost analyses that would be released. It is another example of where promises have been broken with the most blatant and brazen examples.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member is straying.




Mr ROBB:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, it goes very much to the financial framework, the financial management, which is at the heart of this bill. It is a missed opportunity. To avoid a benefit-cost analysis on $100 billion of infrastructure when it was promised and promised and never delivered is absolute disgrace.




Mr Husic:
  You talk the talk and you don't walk the walk.




Mr ROBB:
  I support the bill, but I do not support the dereliction of duty and the mismanagement of this government in regard to infrastructure.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Chifley is not helping the situation.

Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (10:21):  I am actually pleased to speak on the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012. It is another one of those bills that we deal with in this House which looks like it is a behind-the-scenes bill. It deals with the way the government handles and manages the people's money. I want to make a few comments before I go specifically to the bill about a number of things that the shadow finance minister had to say today. Can I start by saying how disappointing it is that the opposition, if they really did feel that there were serious issues in this bill to deal with, did not use the time honoured tradition of moving amendments and trying to contribute to the development of the financial framework. 


We have currently, as everybody knows because it is covered endlessly, a hung parliament in the lower house. We have, as we nearly always have in Australia's modern history, a Senate in which minor parties have the balance of power. Having been both in opposition and in government, I know full well that one of the ways that oppositions contribute to governance is to actually work with the government to negotiate amendments through, particularly under the conditions that we have in the lower house. If, as the shadow finance minister says, they believed that there were changes that could have been made to this bill to in fact make it better, it is a shame it is in this Federation Chamber where bills go which have bipartisan support. The fact that it is in this chamber seems to indicate that the opposition is making political points rather than considering governance issues, because if it was a governance issue, there would be an amendment and it would be in the other chamber.


But the shadow minister is right in that we must always be vigilant in finding areas that are not working as effectively as they should in regard to the government's control of the people's money. The financial framework, as it is called, underpins the appropriation expenditure and the use of money and resources within the Australian government. It is a very important feature of a government being accountable and providing transparency in their daily work with agencies, office holders and their employees. It deals with things like the framework governing the conduct of banking by government bodies, competitive neutrality, procurement guidelines, cost recovery, foreign exchange and special accounts appropriations made under the FMA Act. It covers an incredibly broad range of activity. It is very, very complex by its nature. 


But because the amount of money that governments deal with is in the billions, the hundreds of billions of dollars, small errors and small changes in the guidelines in the financial framework have profound impacts in the way that government manages its money and in its relation to business. It is incredibly important that we keep an eye on this and make these kinds of adjustments on an ongoing basis. 


There have in fact been nine bills since 2004. This bill is the ninth financial framework legislation amendment since 2004. It forms part of that ongoing program to address financial framework issues as they arise and assist in ensuring that specific provisions in existing legislation remain clear and up to date. It is particularly important given the growing commitment and expectation of transparency. It is particularly important, as there is more and more scrutiny of government activity, that the rules under which our public servants operate are completely clear so that when members such as the member for Goldstein do find something that they feel is not as right as it should be, they can look at the rules and the rules are clear and transparent.


Six out of nine bills have become law, with the first and the sixth bills lapsing on the prorogation of the Australian parliament for the 2004 and 2010 federal elections. The first bill focused on amending legislation to reflect the creation of special accounts, and this bill covers a range of matters, some quite significant and some less so. Firstly, it amends the Auditor-General Act 1997 to clarify that the Auditor-General may accept an appointment under the Corporations Act 2001 as the auditor of any company that the Commonwealth controls within the meaning of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997. Again, it seems when you read it that one would have expected that to already have been the case. This simply clarifies that that is the case. 


It amends the CAC Act to ensure that directors of Commonwealth and wholly owned companies other than government business enterprises prepare budget estimates as directed by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation and that directors of Commonwealth authorities, including interjurisdictional authorities and wholly owned companies, notify their responsible minister of decisions to undertake certain significant events. Both of those provisions are ones that most people would expect are already in existence—so, again, quite a mechanical amendment.


It also amends two misdescribed provisions in the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Act 2010. Essentially in the two provisions it replaces references to 'at common law and inequity' with the phrase 'under the general law'. Again, this is a fairly administrative amendment.


It makes four other changes to amend the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 to clarify commencement dates and amend the operation of drawing rights. Some of them are quite significant in their own way, but I will not go into them here. It also does something which is quite interesting. The shadow minister for finance has already spoken about this a little. It inserts a new section 35 to enable the Commonwealth to set off in whole or in part an amount owing to the Commonwealth by a person with an amount owing by the Commonwealth to the same person and make regulations with respect to this section. The shadow minister has already raised the issue of what might happen if a company had entered into an agreement with the tax office. I am glad he has raised that. By going to the minister and seeking clarification on that one he has done exactly what one expects a good opposition to do, which is to look at a bill and find areas where it can be improved or where there may be unintended consequences. I commend him for that action. It is a shame he did not take similar actions if he has concerns about other sections of this bill. Whingeing is one thing; contributing to governance from opposition is another. I would hope, quite frankly, that they would improve their performance in that area if they genuinely do have concerns.


This is an interesting new section. I have had a number of discussions with businesses lately about the cash flow ramifications when sections of the economy get locked up—one person owes this person, that person owes another one, that person owes another one. We joke sometimes about having a clearing house where everyone can come into the same room and exchange cheques or transfer electronically and essentially free up what is currently sometimes quite blocked cash flow accounts as it trickles down to the next one. I have also heard from businesses how they get into that blocked situation with government departments, where they quite legitimately owe one government department under their normal course of actions but another government department owes them for a contract and somehow they get stuck in this 'You owe us so we won't pay you' kind of scenario, which generally blocks cash flow and in many cases is quite unnecessary. With businesses which are on the negative side of this, this is quite an extraordinary, very small addition that will make their lives a whole lot easier. We do, of course, have to be concerned about the possible opposite consequences. Again, I am very pleased to have heard from the shadow minister for finance that he has clarified with the minister that the tax office will honour the arrangements that it has with business. They do involve serious cash flow issues for business and that is a good result.


The other sections of the bill involve repealing some redundant special appropriations, which is just about cleaning up the statute books. There is always a lot of stuff in the laws of Australia which is redundant. We have a constant process of trying to clean those out. This repeals two of them: the Appropriation (Development Bank) Act 1975 and the Car Dealership Financing Guarantee Appropriation Act 2009, which was the Car Dealership Act. Again, just a bit of housekeeping there. 


I will finish by returning to where I started, that these bills appear to be very dry when you read them. They are in a language which I do not think is English, personally. Sometimes I have to read the paragraphs a couple of times. I am sure you get better at it if you deal in this area more often. But they are essentially about making sure that the way government operates is fair in its relationship with business, that it does not interfere in the market with a competitive advantage where that is not the intent, that when handling large amounts of money its processes are very clear. If you are handling large amounts of money, small changes have very, very large impacts. The changes make sure that transparency is continuing to improve and that the rules for people who manage people's money on our behalf in the Public Service have a very clear set of guidelines. And they make sure that the natural tendency to increase the complex of defensiveness by our Public Service as the transparency guidelines improve and there is more interest, along with a natural tendency perhaps to proliferation, is kept in check. This is an important bill, even though a little dry one. I commend it to the House.

"Ciobo, Steven, MP",LP,2012-03-01,"



Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff) (10:32):  I rise too to speak to the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1). It is, as the member for Parramatta remarked, not the most existing piece of legislation that has ever gone through the chambers. Notwithstanding that, it is an important one. Like so many things in life, the important stuff is perhaps not as exciting. That notwithstanding, this bill seeks to amend four acts and repeal two acts across three portfolios. It is part of an ongoing move that is being undertaken by government, as I understand it, with respect to tidying up and updating the Commonwealth's financial framework. This is in fact the ninth financial framework legislation amendment bill since 2004. The bill operates to effectively through the various schedules of the bill clarify a number of matters. I will just walk through them, because there are some aspects that I would like to focus on and others that are purely technical that I would move to quite quickly.


Schedule 1 of the bill seeks to amend the Auditor-General Act of 1977 and effectively operates such that the Auditor-General may accept an appointment under the Corporations Act 2001 as the auditor of any company that the Commonwealth controls. As I understand it, the operation of schedule 1 moves to ensure that the definitions of the act with the definitions of Commonwealth control, which were made in 2008 through the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 2007, will be aligned. I know the shadow minister has taken the view that there is a case for placing stronger obligations on government departments and agencies, indeed including the minister's own department, to more strictly adhere to Commonwealth procurement guidelines. There have been concerns that have been raised by the shadow minister and by others about procurement guidelines not being appropriately followed or not followed as closely as should be when it comes to achieving best value outcomes. This is an important aspect for taxpayers. There should be procurement obligations and concern for value for money when it comes to dealing with the taxpayer dollar. 


Schedule 2 amends the CAC Act itself to ensure that directors of Commonwealth authorities and wholly owned government companies and enterprises prepare budget estimates as directed by the finance minister rather than by their responsible portfolio minister. This is effectively just a formalisation of actual longstanding practice. In this respect, it is a tightening or a clarifying measure. The most significant component of schedule 2 is the obligation on directors of Commonwealth authorities and wholly owned companies to notify their responsible minister of decisions about significant events immediately after taking those decisions. Significant events have been defined to include forming a company or participating in the formation of a company, acquiring or disposing of a significant shareholding in a company, acquiring or disposing of a significant business or commencing or ceasing a significant business activity. There are measures that make directors of government linked entities more accountable for their decisions. I think this is perhaps the single most important aspect of this particular piece of legislation.


The reality is that we have seen too many examples of very poor quality spending when it comes to the current government. We have seen, both under Prime Minister Rudd and under Prime Minister Gillard, example after example of very poor quality spending decisions where the government has engaged, through its agencies, in spending that frankly has not delivered value for money for taxpayers. There are many examples I could talk about with respect to the so-called Building the Education Revolution. How many covered outdoor learning areas did we see that were purchased at taxpayer expense for two or three times the estimated cost of acquiring that particular COLA, as they are called.


The reality is that this government has become synonymous with a government that wastes money. This government does in fact waste money. This is a government that has undertaken a number of spending initiatives that have led to very poor outcomes. It is a great shame that we have not seen more emphasis placed on achieving value for money. If this particular piece of legislation can help to reinforce a culture that says there should be value for money then I think it is a good move. It is somewhat meaningless though if the finance minister is powerless to stop poor-quality spending outcomes on what they could in advance suspect are based on bad decisions.


Take, for example, what is Australia's single largest spend with respect to a new government agency—that is, the creation of NBN Co. NBN Co. represents the nationalisation of telecommunications in this country. NBN Co. represents, at the cost of some $40 billion of taxpayer funds, the rollout of almost a Soviet era approach to national infrastructure. You can see how proud they would be to stand up in their caucus and, in the great Soviet tradition, say, 'Look at this magnificent new project that we are building across Australia.'




Mr Husic:
  Reds under the optic fibre. Not reds under the bed but reds under the optic fibre.




Mr CIOBO:
  The fact that there are so many commercial marketplaces that exist in our metropolitan areas where private operators would be more than willing to spend private company money to achieve exactly the same outcome seems to be lost on those opposite.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Dr Leigh
):  Order! I remind the member for Moncrieff that we are debating the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 2011 and ask him to keep his remarks relevant to that. I urge the member for Chifley to ensure that those remarks are heard in silence.




Mr CIOBO:
  I take this opportunity to highlight that this underscores why there is some confusion. Nothing could be more relevant to the bill than talking about the need to achieve good quality spending for taxpayers. The NBN Co. is an example of not achieving good quality spending for taxpayers because NBN Co. is about nationalisation of telecommunications in this country. It is not about good quality spending—




Mr Husic:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point order: I heard a very clear direction from you and I am concerned that the member for Moncrieff is challenging your ruling. I urge him to be relevant to the bill.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I thank the member for Chifley. The member for Moncrieff will return to his remarks.




Mr CIOBO:
  I will continue my remarks because, as I am very certain the Deputy Speaker understands, the financial framework legislation that is before us is about ensuring that government agencies are spending taxpayers' money appropriately. It is about accountability processes in government. The NBN Co. is a classic case of a new government agency. We are seeing some $40 billion of taxpayers' money going into NBN Co. and we are now seeing the rollout of this spending across the Australian community. I think—and I would caution that I am not absolutely certain of these figures because I am going on memory—that it has been put forward by the government that by the end of this calendar year there will be fibre rolled out to some 700,000 homes across Australia. It will be rolled out—I will come back to the bill because I can see the member opposite getting all excited—by a Commonwealth government agency to 700,000 homes.


At this point in time, as I understand it, there are 20,000 to 30,000 homes that have had fibre rolled out to them. So we are talking about 670,000 homes that are apparently going to be reached between now, February, and December this year. That kind of environment creates a recipe for disaster when it comes to good-quality spending by a government agency. That kind of environment masks a multitude of spending decisions that no doubt will run entirely contrary to the spirit of this bill and entirely contrary to good purchasing decisions when it comes to taxpayer dollars.




Mr Husic:
  I rise on a point of order. This is clearly outside what the bill is proposing to do.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Moncrieff is reminded that I have read the bill and the second reading speech. I am struggling, though I have given him a long bow, to work out how discussions of the National Broadband Network are relevant to the bill. The Speaker, at the beginning of this week, issued a new ruling on relevance. It is that new ruling on relevance that I am seeking to uphold in this debate.




Mr CIOBO:
  I always seek to comply with the chair. I am trying to be helpful, because I am not sure if the member for Oxley is intending to speak on the bill. I will move, with great swiftness now, to a conclusion and outline just a couple of additional aspects of the bill.


Schedule 3 of the bill corrects two misdescribed provisions in the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Act 2010. The two provisions sought to update section 27A of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act, by replacing references to 'at common law and in equity' and 'at common law or in equity' with 'under the general law'.


Schedule 4 relates to special account appropriations under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. Effectively this is a very minor change but one that is profoundly important. As it currently rests, determinations for appropriations are done by way of a disallowable instrument which takes effect five sitting days after the determination was effectively moved through the parliament. Such appropriations are often used by new government agencies once they are established. For practical purposes this act will now, under schedule 4, move to allow the minister to prescribe a date in the instrument on which the appropriation takes effects. It is a small change but an important change, because it enables the appropriations for new government agencies to effectively not take place five sitting days after it has gone in but rather on a prescribed day, which is a key thing.


In addition there is an area that raises specific concerns for me—that is, with respect to the schedule 4 initiative to offset debt. Effectively it is a provision to give the finance minister the discretionary power to offset debts owed to the Commonwealth by an individual or entity against payments owed to the same individual or entity. As it stands currently, the Commonwealth must pay in full regardless of debts owing. This new provision will ensure that there is a mechanism for the Commonwealth to recover debts in a cost-neutral way and in a more efficient manner than is allowed under provisions.


I want to put very clearly on the record my very profound concerns about this. I think that this is not a good provision. The reason is this: I know of numerous examples where the Commonwealth asserts—I emphasise 'asserts'—that there is a debt owing to the Commonwealth. Under this provision, opportunity will arise for the Commonwealth to not make a payment or a net payment to an individual, company or a recipient of the Commonwealth, an amount that the Commonwealth merely asserts it is owed. My concern is that this could have a very significant impact upon those who have dealings with the Commonwealth, on the basis of a mere assertion. The fact is that there are numerous instances where the Commonwealth's word is not sacrosanct—where the Commonwealth's word is not holier than thou, is not like Scripture from the Bible that goes without challenge.


There are numerous instances where the Commonwealth can assert that a debt is owed to it and be wrong. There are numerous instances where the Commonwealth can assert that a certain quantum of money is owed when in reality it is owed a different quantum of money. My concern is that, where there is already a pervasive culture that I am constantly hearing about from members of my community—that government departments engage in a form of bullying when it comes to payments—this provision will entrench that attitude. I suspect it will be an approach that says: 'It's my way or the highway. We allege that you owe us $500. We owe you $600, so you're only getting $100,' to use a basic example. I think there is very good reason for those two processes to be entirely separate. There is very good reason for the Commonwealth to pay the $600 and invoice the $500, to continue the example.


I believe it is not good enough, in what often is the case—and I particularly emphasise this to the member of the executive at the table—to simply say that the Commonwealth has the right to net out the difference between an assertion of an amount owed to the Commonwealth and an amount that the Commonwealth does in fact owe to an external party. For that reason, I say that I as an individual member of this House significantly disagree with the provisions of this act that go to that particular matter. It is simply, I believe, going to be abused by Commonwealth government bureaucrats to reinforce an assertion they make where a debt is owed, and I do not believe it is appropriate that that should be contained in the legislation.


The final schedule is schedule 5 of the act, which proposes to repeal two redundant special appropriations to clean up the statute book; they are the Appropriation (Development Bank) Act 1975 and the Car Dealership Financing Guarantee Appropriation Act 2009. With that, I conclude my remarks.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2012-03-01,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley—Government Whip) (10:46):  I thank the member for Moncrieff for his contribution, both said and otherwise. I am pleased to speak on this bill because it does have significance and reflects the fact that it is part of an ongoing process to change appropriations, governance and financial management issues. The Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1), if enacted as was indicated in the second reading speech, potentially amends four acts and will repeal two others over three portfolio areas. This is all designed as part of the ongoing process of clarifying aspects of the Commonwealth's financial framework. As I indicated earlier, it is not the first time this has been done. In fact, since 2004, there have been nine different versions of this bill. It is designed as part of the overall process to take a collaborative, whole-of-government approach to looking at the way in which we can improve the management of finances.


The breadth of appropriation, governance and financial management issues means that we do need to keep looking at how we can best improve on those matters. That is the reason why the Department of Finance and Deregulation works with all parts of government to help address financial framework issues once they emerge. If there are things that do need to be dealt with it is important that they are dealt with quickly and that, as part of that process of departments being able to appreciate changes to the way they need to operate in order to provide better value for money and better management of our finances, we do move swiftly to encourage a different focus and a different operating approach by departments.


The act will amend four acts. First, it will amend the Auditor-General Act 1997. By doing so it will clarify, for instance, that the Auditor-General may accept an appointment under the Corporations Act 2001 as the auditor of any company that the Commonwealth controls. There are a number of government business enterprises. We have heard reference to the National Broadband Network Co., NBN Co., but Australia Post is another GBE that may be affected by this. This will align the Auditor-General Act 1997 with amendments made in 2008 to expand the meaning of 'Commonwealth control' in the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997, an act that is followed closely by the GBEs that I mentioned earlier, as they are compelled to do.


The other aspect of the changes proposed is that the bill will amend the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997, which I have just referred to. It will ensure that the directors of these authorities and of wholly-owned Commonwealth companies, other than GBEs, will prepare budget estimates as directed by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. The significance of this is that departments will be compelled to follow direction from the finance minister as opposed to their own minister. Again, this is a signal sending an important directive about the way in which finances will be managed into the future. It is also consistent with an ongoing practice over many years. As a result of the amendments to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act, it will ensure that directors of authorities and wholly-owned Commonwealth companies notify their responsible minister of any decisions regarding certain significant events, such as creating a subsidiary.


During the member for Moncrieff's contribution, I was particularly active in attempting to bring him back to relevance to the bill, specifically because some of the matters he was raising in reference to NBN will be dealt with by this bill. For example, if NBN were to change anything that it indicated it would do under its corporate plan, it would need to notify the minister for communications accordingly. This bill will have the effect of doing that just that. If NBN Co. decided to change its direction in a significant way, this would trigger the significant event provisions that are dealt with under this bill and it would need to notify the minister accordingly. I think it is important for that to happen, particularly if there is an impact on the financial elements of NBN Co.'s operations. For example, if the change were going to affect its stated returns on investment or if it were to affect the way in which the rollout is to occur and that would have a financial implication, I would imagine that that should be notified. The changes that we are making here today will ensure that that occurs.


The bill will amend two other minor misdescribed provisions, as they are called, that appear in the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Act 2010. Those provisions sought to update the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 to replace references to 'at common law and in equity' and 'at common law or in equity' with the phrase 'under the general law.' 


The bill will amend the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 to make four changes. It will clear up the commencement date for the determination of special accounts and it will also make sure that certain determinations will start on a date specified, outlined in that determination if that day is later than the last day upon which a disallowance resolution is passed by the parliament. It will also ensure that we concentrate on the operating of drawing rights on payments, and it will remove the penalty relating to those drawing rights. In addition, it will insert a new whole-of-government element that would make sure that the finance minister could set-off, in whole or in part, an amount owing to the Commonwealth by a person with an amount owing by the Commonwealth to the same person. Finally, it will increase certain limits around which the finance minister could delegate to officials in relation to the making of certain instruments.


The bill that we are debating will repeal two acts that include special appropriations that no longer have any effect or are redundant. They are the Appropriation (Development of Bank) Act 1975 and the Car Dealership Financing Guarantee Appropriation Act 2009. When taken in their breadth, all the changes that are occurring, as I said earlier, are designed to ensure that we are keeping up to date with events as they are occurring on the ground. They are also important in ensuring that departments are finetuning the way that they are approaching the management of finances. 


This government is proud that it has been able to oversee the fastest rate of fiscal consolidation in, I think, four decades. Anything that can be done at a micro level within departments needs to be encouraged. As I said before, this is not the first time that this has been done. The coalition, when it was in government, also embarked on similar sorts of changes in a similar vein. Again, these changes need to be made to ensure that departments are moving with the times and that we are prudently oversighting the expenditure of funds. To not do so would see the compounding of potential problems or difficulties in the management of finances so that we would be unable to halt or better and efficiently manage finances within departments. I indicated earlier that I have been concerned about the breadth of criticism of NBN Co. These bills ensure that significant events are picked up and that they require notification to the government of anything that would change, for example, the way NBN Co. operates. That has an impact on the rate of return or the stage at which expenditure would be required to be outlaid as part of the rollout over a significant period of time, and it has an impact on the size of that infrastructure project, where we are renewing the nation's technological infrastructure in a way that has not been done before. If there is any significant change to the way that that project is done outside the corporate plan, bearing in mind that this corporate plan is submitted to the shareholding ministers—the minister for communications and the minister for finance—which would ultimately, in some major way, change the rollout, then that should be picked up. That is why the member for Goldstein and the member for Moncrieff, who both made this point when was talking about the NBN, should rest assured, as should the coalition, that any changes to those corporate plans will be picked up by this bill.


Also, bills will be repealed. For example, as I mentioned at the tail end of my contribution, we would be repealing the Car Dealership Financing Guarantee Appropriation Act 2009 and the Appropriation (Development Bank) Act 1975. They have either been in existence for some considerable period of time and are simply redundant or the events which required the establishment of certain acts, such as the Car Dealership Financing Guarantee Appropriation Act 2009, which flowed out of the fact that during the GFC car financing was directly affected. We needed to act quickly to ensure that, for the auto sector, customers who were purchasing vehicles had some sort of security and ability to procure finance. As has been previously described in the House, 46,000 Australians are employed within the sector. That act at that point in time was useful. I notice that the member for Corio and the parliamentary secretary, whose electorates are deeply affected by these issues, would have been two of many electorates that benefited from the Car Dealership Financing Guarantee Appropriation Act 2009. However, as times have changed, we no longer require that act. There has been stabilisation within that sector with people being able to obtain finance and it is clear we no longer need those acts. As I said, this fits within the broader attempt by government that we change acts and repeal them when they are no longer required.


I was particularly pleased to see in the bill, and I made reference to this earlier, that the Department of Finance and Deregulation approaches these things within the spirit of collaboration. It does so clearly to ensure that departments have buy-in in the way in which these regulations are introduced because it will have an impact when rolled out within departments. These types of finance provisions and the impact they may have on programs or people within the department should be managed in a way that there is buy-in at a fairly early stage. It will ensure that we are able to quickly address financial framework issues. Once those issues emerge we are able to design solutions in the repealing of those two acts.


The other thing is that directors get clear signals. It is not just departments, but directors of Commonwealth authorities or wholly owned Commonwealth companies get a clear signal that they, ultimately, in managing finances within GBEs are accountable and are required to report to the finance minister. GBEs themselves are subjected to quite a degree of oversight. There are not too many companies in Australia required to appear before Senate estimates committees and have their entire operations scrutinised to the finest detail in a very public way. A lot of this would occur behind closed doors. Auditors or authorities like APRA, for example, would have the ability to scrutinise finances or issues closely. 


If the Minister for Finance and Deregulation requires that budget estimates be compiled instead of going through the responsible minister, it is entirely appropriate that the Department of Finance and Deregulation be involved in this process to ensure that there is consistency across departments and that we are better able to scrutinise, and for the accountability of parliament and what is expected of parliament—in particular the Senate—it is only right that that occur.


While a lot of people will say that there are a lot of things in here that are dry and not necessarily the stuff that would attract significant debate within the House, I would actually counter that by saying that the things that we are doing in here are absolutely consistent with what we on this side of the chamber are focused on, which is, as I said, the finer and the efficient management of funds and spending within government. I commend the bill to the chamber.

Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Government Whip) (11:01):  Mr Deputy Speaker Leigh, I commence my contribution to this debate on the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012 by acknowledging that this is the first time you have been in the chair as Deputy Speaker when I have spoken. I am sure that in your role as Deputy Speaker you are going to bring great wisdom, make some great rulings and, at the same time, be entertained by some very edifying speeches that will be put to the parliament. I know that you have a deep interest in the economy and economic institutions, and I am sure that you as a member of parliament find this financial framework legislation imperative and riveting and the kind of legislation that we as a parliament need to be passing. 


The Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012 seeks to amend four acts and to repeal two acts across three portfolio areas, as was so eloquently put to the chamber by the previous speaker, to clarify the Commonwealth's financial framework, among other related measures. The bill also seeks to amend the Auditor-General Act 1997 to clarify that the Auditor-General may accept an appointment as the auditor of any company that the Commonwealth controls as defined under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997. It also seeks to amend the CAC Act to ensure that directors of Commonwealth authorities and wholly owned Commonwealth companies may prepare budget estimates as directed by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation and notify the responsible minister of any decision. This is a very important aspect of the CAC Act and it really goes to the core of financial management and government authorities. 


The bill also amends the Financial Management and Accountability Act to clarify the commencement day for special account determinations and the operation of drawing rights to clarify the financial delegations power. It updates, clarifies and aligns related financial management provisions and repeals two redundant acts that contain special appropriations, the Appropriation (Development Bank) Act 1975 and Car Dealership Financing Guarantee Appropriation Act 2009.


This legislation is all about openness and transparency and ensuring that our financial framework works in the way that it should. It has given me great pleasure to be able to make this contribution to the debate. I wholeheartedly support the legislation.

Mr MARLES
 (Corio—Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs) (11:05):  I thank all members who have contributed to the debate on the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012. Firstly, as a matter of clarification regarding the implementation of the proposed section 35 of the FMA Act regarding set-off, I would like to make a couple of comments in response to queries from the member of Goldstein's office regarding the interaction of this general provision with existing detailed specific statutory provisions. The government does not intend that this provision be used in relation to a tax liability that may be payable to the Australian Taxation Office within the broad meaning of a tax liability under the Tax Administration Act 1953. I wish to also offer a further point of clarification with regard to the retrospective commencement of items 1 and 2 of schedule 3, which seek to amend misdescribed provisions in the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Act 2010 that would have made technical amendments to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997. These items seek merely to substitute references to 'at common law and in equity' and 'at common law or in equity' with the phrase 'under the general law'. The Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Act 2010 added a definition of 'general law' in the CAC Act as meaning 'the principles and rules of the common law and equity'.


As explained in the explanatory memorandum to the bill, the retrospective commencement of these items would not cause detriment to any person, as substantively the connection to common law and equity are retained within the meaning of general law. Moreover, consistent with the request from the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills in their Alert Digest No. 2 of 2012, I also advise the parliament that the changes could not possibly cause detriment to any person. This bill, if enacted, will clarify specific provisions in four acts and repeal two acts across three portfolios. This bill reflects an ongoing commitment to ensuring that financial framework laws remain clear and up to date. I commend the bill to the House.


Question agreed to. 


Bill read a second time. 


Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment.

Mr ROBB
 (Goldstein) (10:01):  I rise today to speak on the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 2012. This bill seeks to amend four acts and repeal two acts across three portfolios. It is part of an ongoing program of updating and enhancing the Commonwealth's financial framework. This is the ninth financial framework legislation amendment bill since 2004. These bills generally seek to correct misdescribed provisions, add clarity where required and enhance acts to make them consistent with complementary legislation. They also seek to repeal redundant components of the financial framework, such as prior programs that have expired.


Schedule 1 seeks to amend the Auditor-General Act 1997 to clarify that the Auditor-General may accept an appointment under the Corporations Act 2001 as the auditor of any company that the Commonwealth controls. This will align the act with the definitions of Commonwealth control which were made in 2008 for the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 2007. We of course support this amendment.


There is though, in my view, a case for placing stronger obligations on government departments and agencies, including the minister's own department, to more strictly adhere to the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines. We are seeing far too many instances where guidelines are being flouted. That is not conducive to achieving best value outcomes. To this end, I wrote some time ago to the Auditor-General of Australia, Mr McPhee, to seek some clarity on just what is happening with regard to the purchase of property and services, the whole procurement process and the efficiency of that process, and to ascertain whether we as a community are seeing the government and its agencies doing things in a way which best meets the responsibilities they have to handle public moneys. As part of his response the Auditor-General says:


Your letter also sought advice on whether further reform of procurement could provide savings of 5 to 10 per cent over the forward estimates without compromising the standard of property and services purchased by the Commonwealth.


He goes on:


Because our audit was only focused on direct sourcing and whether agencies were adhering to the CPGs, we did not seek to quantify the potential saving that could be achieved.


He says, though:


Nevertheless, our audit work indicates that better value for money outcomes could be achieved through improvements to the procurement practices.


He talks about the fact that direct source procurement, which may include a competitive process, accounted for 43 per cent or $10.2 billion of the total reported value of contracts for the calendar year. But among the key findings of the audit was a 'lack of documentation' of agencies' value-for-money considerations for 74 per cent of the audit sample of direct source procurements, that agencies 'did not seek multiple quotes' in 85 per cent of the direct source procurements examined and that agencies could not consistently ensure that covered 'direct source procurements examined met the limited circumstances' in the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines which permit direct sourcing. For the Auditor-General to use this language, to be this direct and to record such significant, in my view, oversights in the procurement process suggests an area of spending that is just startling. We are talking about a contract worth $23.5 billion, and in 74 per cent of the audit sample there was a lack of documentation on how they could show value for money out of that process. I have run public companies. If you took to a board proposals for capital expenditure of sums much smaller than this which did not convince the board of a value-for-money outcome, you would not be in a job long. Yet here we have startling results from the piece of work done by the Auditor-General and, when I raised it with the government, I got a perfunctory response—no response, really, of any consequence; just politics. It is a legitimate question. We are here as an opposition to ensure the accountability of governments. An Auditor-General is prepared to write back to me and report those sorts of findings, and the minister for finance treats it as just a political act by me. It is unacceptable and it does reflect, I think, mismanagement on a much wider scale or bad supervision by a minister on a much wider scale.


It helps explain the waste that the community understands that this government has become a symbol of. This government's waste, debt and deficits have become, I think, a matter of great embarrassment to this community. It is one of the reasons we got 750,000 more votes than the Labor Party at the last election, in spite of being the first—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  The member will refer his remarks to the bill. He will be relevant to the bill before us.




Mr ROBB:
  The bill—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The bill has nothing to do with the votes at the last election. I draw you back to the bill, please.




Mr ROBB:
  I was reinforcing my point, Madam Deputy Speaker, about the waste, which is very much a part of this bill. These provisions—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  Yes, and I allowed you to make comments that I think were pretty borderline on the Audit Office as well, so I would heed the warning and be relevant to the bill.




Mr Husic:
  Or just be relevant generally.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member has the call.




Mr ROBB:
  I will restrain myself, Madam Deputy Speaker. Schedule 2 would amend the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act itself to ensure that directors of Commonwealth authorities and wholly owned government companies and enterprises prepare budget estimates as directed by the finance minister rather than the responsible portfolio minister. This would make the act consistent with longstanding practice.


The most significant component of schedule 2 is the new obligation on the directors of Commonwealth authorities and wholly owned companies to notify their responsible minister of decisions about significant events immediately after a decision has been taken. Significant events include forming a company or participating in the formation of a company, acquiring or disposing of a significant shareholding in a company, acquiring or disposing of significant business or commencing or ceasing a significant business activity.


I strongly support this provision. It is consistent with the obligations of public companies, with continuous disclosure required, which makes eminent sense in the case of public companies, which are responsible to shareholders and prospective shareholders to advise what really is going on with the company. There is no good reason why the minister and the government of the day should not be similarly informed about the major organisations that they are responsible for. That raises the question of accountability. I welcome measures to make the directors of government linked entities more accountable. However, they are somewhat meaningless if the Minister for Finance and Deregulation is powerless to stop poor quality spending outcomes based on what the minister could suspect in advance were bad decisions. I will provide an example. Recently, I sent the finance minister a very detailed letter seeking clarity on a number of concerns regarding government due diligence and the oversight of the wholly government owned NBN corporation. The minister responded with literally pages of bureaucratic gobbledegook, yet failed to answer the key questions. It was one of the best examples of a Yes, Minister response I have seen in all my life. There were four pages of processes which, we are led to believe or are to be convinced, show the extraordinary accountability of NBN. Yet in all of these so-called safety provisions for accountability the minister was unable to identify or outline the red flag measures she has in place to identify problematic NBN company decisions that could result in wasteful spending. There were four pages of different procedures that supposedly outlined transparency and accountability, but none of it specified her ability to red-flag measures, which is a very standard risk management procedure of any company worth its salt.


Nor could she say that she had a veto authority over the company's spending activities, regardless of how questionable they might be. The government is the sole shareholder of what is the biggest infrastructure project, at $50 billion, in the history of Australia—virtually all borrowed money. At the moment, after 2½ years, it has 4,000 customers; it has more employees than customers. At Smithton, where it started, only seven people have taken it up even though they got a free offer. The technology that was put in place there two years ago no longer connects properly to the rest of the system. It is a dynamic sector, which they were warned about.


But in relation to the financial framework surrounding the NBN project, which this bill is particularly looking to improve, the original standard was set when the government refused to subject the proposal to a cost-benefit analysis. If you have got no cost-benefit analysis, which provides some reference point against which you can judge future implementation, no wonder there is no capacity for a red flag process. To not have the potential to veto any decision, no matter how problematic or misguided activities might be, is an extraordinary situation for a 100 per cent shareholder, the minister, who is ultimately responsible for the largest project in Australian history. It is the most disgraceful example of poor governance and it is becoming a symbol around the world of how not to manage a major public project. We are becoming a laughing stock over the implementation, the inefficiency, the costs, the timing and the fact that we are the only country in the world, that I am aware of, that is now renationalising the telecommunications sector at a time when that sector is the most dynamic of any sector in any economy. It is the last sector that you would want to renationalise with a bureaucratic culture. Taxpayers' money is at risk in an area where technology is changing by the day. Schedule 3 of this bill is devoted to—




Ms Owens:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I have a point of order on relevance—that is all I need to say.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Goldstein has strayed quite a lot. I have let him get away with it, but if he does not come back to the bill I will sit him down. You cannot in any way, shape or form tell me that what you just said about the NBN was relevant to this bill. The member for Goldstein has the call.




Mr ROBB:
  This bill— 



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Goldstein went off the track. I let him. If he does not come back, I will sit him down.




Mr ROBB:
  Schedule 3 of this bill is devoted to correcting two misdescribed provisions in the Financial Framework Legislation Act 2010, which are contained in section 27a of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act that is replacing references to 'at common law and inequity' and 'at common law or inequity' with 'under the general law'. Schedule 4 relates in part to the special accounts appropriation under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. This provision applies to special account appropriations which relate to either the COAG Reform Fund Act 2008 or a special account established under the Nation-building Funds Act.


Determination for such appropriations are done by way of disallowable instrument. As it stands, such a determination takes effect after the five sitting days in which the parliament can move to disallow pass. Such appropriations may be used by new government agencies once they are established. For the purpose of practicality this amendment allows the minister to prescribe a date in the instrument for which the appropriation takes effect. This allows a future date to be set which corresponds with the establishment date of a new agency. It has no material effect and serves to add clarity to the act to confirm such an instrument can come into effect at a nominated date beyond and immediately after the expiry of the disallowable instrument. At is a sensible measure.


Offsetting debt—the other key feature of schedule 4—is the provision to give the finance minister the discretionary power to offset debts owed to the Commonwealth by an individual or entity against payments owed to the same individual or entity. As it stands, Commonwealth payments must be paid in full regardless of debts owing. This new section provides a mechanism for the Commonwealth to recover debts in a cost neutral way and more efficient manner than allowed under current provisions. It is a sensible measure given the budget's vulnerability on account of this government's mismanagement and spiralling debt. 


I have sought assurances from the minister, however, that this authority will not be used in a way to unreasonably disadvantage business whether big or small. For example, if a business has an arrangement in place with the ATO in relation to paying off a taxation debt, I was seeking comfort that the minister would honour such agreements. In other words, not override them but denying a business payments owed as a means of accelerated settlement of payment to the Commonwealth, because, by definition, if they sought an arrangement they have got a cash-flow problem. If this measure was used to recover the Commonwealth debt more quickly, it cuts across what has already been a decision to help that company meet its financial taxation commitment to the Commonwealth, but also not put itself in the position where it has a cash-flow problem and might face receivership or other difficulties. I do thank the minister for assurances that this measure would not lead to such eventualities.


Schedule 5 of this bill also proposes to repeal two redundant special appropriations to clean up the statute book. These include the Appropriation (Development Bank) Act 1975 and the Car Dealership Financing Guarantee Appropriation Act 2009. 


The process of ongoing maintenance and enhancement of the Commonwealth's financial framework commenced under the coalition. We support this endeavour in principle, including the changes outlined in this bill. However, we do feel in many respects it is a missed opportunity. I have taken the opportunity during my comments to point out some of those missed opportunities, which I think are highly relevant to the Commonwealth's financial framework, and in particular that NBN example. There has been $100 billion of public works, of infrastructure projects, that have been authorised by this government, none of which have had a benefit-cost analysis and certainly none which has been published. That was despite the assurances when the infrastructure Australia was set up. When infrastructure Australia was set up, the government said that it would publically conduct benefit-cost analyses that would be released. It is another example of where promises have been broken with the most blatant and brazen examples.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member is straying.




Mr ROBB:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, it goes very much to the financial framework, the financial management, which is at the heart of this bill. It is a missed opportunity. To avoid a benefit-cost analysis on $100 billion of infrastructure when it was promised and promised and never delivered is absolute disgrace.




Mr Husic:
  You talk the talk and you don't walk the walk.




Mr ROBB:
  I support the bill, but I do not support the dereliction of duty and the mismanagement of this government in regard to infrastructure.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Chifley is not helping the situation.

Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (10:21):  I am actually pleased to speak on the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012. It is another one of those bills that we deal with in this House which looks like it is a behind-the-scenes bill. It deals with the way the government handles and manages the people's money. I want to make a few comments before I go specifically to the bill about a number of things that the shadow finance minister had to say today. Can I start by saying how disappointing it is that the opposition, if they really did feel that there were serious issues in this bill to deal with, did not use the time honoured tradition of moving amendments and trying to contribute to the development of the financial framework. 


We have currently, as everybody knows because it is covered endlessly, a hung parliament in the lower house. We have, as we nearly always have in Australia's modern history, a Senate in which minor parties have the balance of power. Having been both in opposition and in government, I know full well that one of the ways that oppositions contribute to governance is to actually work with the government to negotiate amendments through, particularly under the conditions that we have in the lower house. If, as the shadow finance minister says, they believed that there were changes that could have been made to this bill to in fact make it better, it is a shame it is in this Federation Chamber where bills go which have bipartisan support. The fact that it is in this chamber seems to indicate that the opposition is making political points rather than considering governance issues, because if it was a governance issue, there would be an amendment and it would be in the other chamber.


But the shadow minister is right in that we must always be vigilant in finding areas that are not working as effectively as they should in regard to the government's control of the people's money. The financial framework, as it is called, underpins the appropriation expenditure and the use of money and resources within the Australian government. It is a very important feature of a government being accountable and providing transparency in their daily work with agencies, office holders and their employees. It deals with things like the framework governing the conduct of banking by government bodies, competitive neutrality, procurement guidelines, cost recovery, foreign exchange and special accounts appropriations made under the FMA Act. It covers an incredibly broad range of activity. It is very, very complex by its nature. 


But because the amount of money that governments deal with is in the billions, the hundreds of billions of dollars, small errors and small changes in the guidelines in the financial framework have profound impacts in the way that government manages its money and in its relation to business. It is incredibly important that we keep an eye on this and make these kinds of adjustments on an ongoing basis. 


There have in fact been nine bills since 2004. This bill is the ninth financial framework legislation amendment since 2004. It forms part of that ongoing program to address financial framework issues as they arise and assist in ensuring that specific provisions in existing legislation remain clear and up to date. It is particularly important given the growing commitment and expectation of transparency. It is particularly important, as there is more and more scrutiny of government activity, that the rules under which our public servants operate are completely clear so that when members such as the member for Goldstein do find something that they feel is not as right as it should be, they can look at the rules and the rules are clear and transparent.


Six out of nine bills have become law, with the first and the sixth bills lapsing on the prorogation of the Australian parliament for the 2004 and 2010 federal elections. The first bill focused on amending legislation to reflect the creation of special accounts, and this bill covers a range of matters, some quite significant and some less so. Firstly, it amends the Auditor-General Act 1997 to clarify that the Auditor-General may accept an appointment under the Corporations Act 2001 as the auditor of any company that the Commonwealth controls within the meaning of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997. Again, it seems when you read it that one would have expected that to already have been the case. This simply clarifies that that is the case. 


It amends the CAC Act to ensure that directors of Commonwealth and wholly owned companies other than government business enterprises prepare budget estimates as directed by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation and that directors of Commonwealth authorities, including interjurisdictional authorities and wholly owned companies, notify their responsible minister of decisions to undertake certain significant events. Both of those provisions are ones that most people would expect are already in existence—so, again, quite a mechanical amendment.


It also amends two misdescribed provisions in the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Act 2010. Essentially in the two provisions it replaces references to 'at common law and inequity' with the phrase 'under the general law'. Again, this is a fairly administrative amendment.


It makes four other changes to amend the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 to clarify commencement dates and amend the operation of drawing rights. Some of them are quite significant in their own way, but I will not go into them here. It also does something which is quite interesting. The shadow minister for finance has already spoken about this a little. It inserts a new section 35 to enable the Commonwealth to set off in whole or in part an amount owing to the Commonwealth by a person with an amount owing by the Commonwealth to the same person and make regulations with respect to this section. The shadow minister has already raised the issue of what might happen if a company had entered into an agreement with the tax office. I am glad he has raised that. By going to the minister and seeking clarification on that one he has done exactly what one expects a good opposition to do, which is to look at a bill and find areas where it can be improved or where there may be unintended consequences. I commend him for that action. It is a shame he did not take similar actions if he has concerns about other sections of this bill. Whingeing is one thing; contributing to governance from opposition is another. I would hope, quite frankly, that they would improve their performance in that area if they genuinely do have concerns.


This is an interesting new section. I have had a number of discussions with businesses lately about the cash flow ramifications when sections of the economy get locked up—one person owes this person, that person owes another one, that person owes another one. We joke sometimes about having a clearing house where everyone can come into the same room and exchange cheques or transfer electronically and essentially free up what is currently sometimes quite blocked cash flow accounts as it trickles down to the next one. I have also heard from businesses how they get into that blocked situation with government departments, where they quite legitimately owe one government department under their normal course of actions but another government department owes them for a contract and somehow they get stuck in this 'You owe us so we won't pay you' kind of scenario, which generally blocks cash flow and in many cases is quite unnecessary. With businesses which are on the negative side of this, this is quite an extraordinary, very small addition that will make their lives a whole lot easier. We do, of course, have to be concerned about the possible opposite consequences. Again, I am very pleased to have heard from the shadow minister for finance that he has clarified with the minister that the tax office will honour the arrangements that it has with business. They do involve serious cash flow issues for business and that is a good result.


The other sections of the bill involve repealing some redundant special appropriations, which is just about cleaning up the statute books. There is always a lot of stuff in the laws of Australia which is redundant. We have a constant process of trying to clean those out. This repeals two of them: the Appropriation (Development Bank) Act 1975 and the Car Dealership Financing Guarantee Appropriation Act 2009, which was the Car Dealership Act. Again, just a bit of housekeeping there. 


I will finish by returning to where I started, that these bills appear to be very dry when you read them. They are in a language which I do not think is English, personally. Sometimes I have to read the paragraphs a couple of times. I am sure you get better at it if you deal in this area more often. But they are essentially about making sure that the way government operates is fair in its relationship with business, that it does not interfere in the market with a competitive advantage where that is not the intent, that when handling large amounts of money its processes are very clear. If you are handling large amounts of money, small changes have very, very large impacts. The changes make sure that transparency is continuing to improve and that the rules for people who manage people's money on our behalf in the Public Service have a very clear set of guidelines. And they make sure that the natural tendency to increase the complex of defensiveness by our Public Service as the transparency guidelines improve and there is more interest, along with a natural tendency perhaps to proliferation, is kept in check. This is an important bill, even though a little dry one. I commend it to the House.

Mr CIOBO
 (Moncrieff) (10:32):  I rise too to speak to the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1). It is, as the member for Parramatta remarked, not the most existing piece of legislation that has ever gone through the chambers. Notwithstanding that, it is an important one. Like so many things in life, the important stuff is perhaps not as exciting. That notwithstanding, this bill seeks to amend four acts and repeal two acts across three portfolios. It is part of an ongoing move that is being undertaken by government, as I understand it, with respect to tidying up and updating the Commonwealth's financial framework. This is in fact the ninth financial framework legislation amendment bill since 2004. The bill operates to effectively through the various schedules of the bill clarify a number of matters. I will just walk through them, because there are some aspects that I would like to focus on and others that are purely technical that I would move to quite quickly.


Schedule 1 of the bill seeks to amend the Auditor-General Act of 1977 and effectively operates such that the Auditor-General may accept an appointment under the Corporations Act 2001 as the auditor of any company that the Commonwealth controls. As I understand it, the operation of schedule 1 moves to ensure that the definitions of the act with the definitions of Commonwealth control, which were made in 2008 through the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 2007, will be aligned. I know the shadow minister has taken the view that there is a case for placing stronger obligations on government departments and agencies, indeed including the minister's own department, to more strictly adhere to Commonwealth procurement guidelines. There have been concerns that have been raised by the shadow minister and by others about procurement guidelines not being appropriately followed or not followed as closely as should be when it comes to achieving best value outcomes. This is an important aspect for taxpayers. There should be procurement obligations and concern for value for money when it comes to dealing with the taxpayer dollar. 


Schedule 2 amends the CAC Act itself to ensure that directors of Commonwealth authorities and wholly owned government companies and enterprises prepare budget estimates as directed by the finance minister rather than by their responsible portfolio minister. This is effectively just a formalisation of actual longstanding practice. In this respect, it is a tightening or a clarifying measure. The most significant component of schedule 2 is the obligation on directors of Commonwealth authorities and wholly owned companies to notify their responsible minister of decisions about significant events immediately after taking those decisions. Significant events have been defined to include forming a company or participating in the formation of a company, acquiring or disposing of a significant shareholding in a company, acquiring or disposing of a significant business or commencing or ceasing a significant business activity. There are measures that make directors of government linked entities more accountable for their decisions. I think this is perhaps the single most important aspect of this particular piece of legislation.


The reality is that we have seen too many examples of very poor quality spending when it comes to the current government. We have seen, both under Prime Minister Rudd and under Prime Minister Gillard, example after example of very poor quality spending decisions where the government has engaged, through its agencies, in spending that frankly has not delivered value for money for taxpayers. There are many examples I could talk about with respect to the so-called Building the Education Revolution. How many covered outdoor learning areas did we see that were purchased at taxpayer expense for two or three times the estimated cost of acquiring that particular COLA, as they are called.


The reality is that this government has become synonymous with a government that wastes money. This government does in fact waste money. This is a government that has undertaken a number of spending initiatives that have led to very poor outcomes. It is a great shame that we have not seen more emphasis placed on achieving value for money. If this particular piece of legislation can help to reinforce a culture that says there should be value for money then I think it is a good move. It is somewhat meaningless though if the finance minister is powerless to stop poor-quality spending outcomes on what they could in advance suspect are based on bad decisions.


Take, for example, what is Australia's single largest spend with respect to a new government agency—that is, the creation of NBN Co. NBN Co. represents the nationalisation of telecommunications in this country. NBN Co. represents, at the cost of some $40 billion of taxpayer funds, the rollout of almost a Soviet era approach to national infrastructure. You can see how proud they would be to stand up in their caucus and, in the great Soviet tradition, say, 'Look at this magnificent new project that we are building across Australia.'




Mr Husic:
  Reds under the optic fibre. Not reds under the bed but reds under the optic fibre.




Mr CIOBO:
  The fact that there are so many commercial marketplaces that exist in our metropolitan areas where private operators would be more than willing to spend private company money to achieve exactly the same outcome seems to be lost on those opposite.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Dr Leigh
):  Order! I remind the member for Moncrieff that we are debating the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill (No.1) 2011 and ask him to keep his remarks relevant to that. I urge the member for Chifley to ensure that those remarks are heard in silence.




Mr CIOBO:
  I take this opportunity to highlight that this underscores why there is some confusion. Nothing could be more relevant to the bill than talking about the need to achieve good quality spending for taxpayers. The NBN Co. is an example of not achieving good quality spending for taxpayers because NBN Co. is about nationalisation of telecommunications in this country. It is not about good quality spending—




Mr Husic:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, on a point order: I heard a very clear direction from you and I am concerned that the member for Moncrieff is challenging your ruling. I urge him to be relevant to the bill.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  I thank the member for Chifley. The member for Moncrieff will return to his remarks.




Mr CIOBO:
  I will continue my remarks because, as I am very certain the Deputy Speaker understands, the financial framework legislation that is before us is about ensuring that government agencies are spending taxpayers' money appropriately. It is about accountability processes in government. The NBN Co. is a classic case of a new government agency. We are seeing some $40 billion of taxpayers' money going into NBN Co. and we are now seeing the rollout of this spending across the Australian community. I think—and I would caution that I am not absolutely certain of these figures because I am going on memory—that it has been put forward by the government that by the end of this calendar year there will be fibre rolled out to some 700,000 homes across Australia. It will be rolled out—I will come back to the bill because I can see the member opposite getting all excited—by a Commonwealth government agency to 700,000 homes.


At this point in time, as I understand it, there are 20,000 to 30,000 homes that have had fibre rolled out to them. So we are talking about 670,000 homes that are apparently going to be reached between now, February, and December this year. That kind of environment creates a recipe for disaster when it comes to good-quality spending by a government agency. That kind of environment masks a multitude of spending decisions that no doubt will run entirely contrary to the spirit of this bill and entirely contrary to good purchasing decisions when it comes to taxpayer dollars.




Mr Husic:
  I rise on a point of order. This is clearly outside what the bill is proposing to do.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Moncrieff is reminded that I have read the bill and the second reading speech. I am struggling, though I have given him a long bow, to work out how discussions of the National Broadband Network are relevant to the bill. The Speaker, at the beginning of this week, issued a new ruling on relevance. It is that new ruling on relevance that I am seeking to uphold in this debate.




Mr CIOBO:
  I always seek to comply with the chair. I am trying to be helpful, because I am not sure if the member for Oxley is intending to speak on the bill. I will move, with great swiftness now, to a conclusion and outline just a couple of additional aspects of the bill.


Schedule 3 of the bill corrects two misdescribed provisions in the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Act 2010. The two provisions sought to update section 27A of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act, by replacing references to 'at common law and in equity' and 'at common law or in equity' with 'under the general law'.


Schedule 4 relates to special account appropriations under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997. Effectively this is a very minor change but one that is profoundly important. As it currently rests, determinations for appropriations are done by way of a disallowable instrument which takes effect five sitting days after the determination was effectively moved through the parliament. Such appropriations are often used by new government agencies once they are established. For practical purposes this act will now, under schedule 4, move to allow the minister to prescribe a date in the instrument on which the appropriation takes effects. It is a small change but an important change, because it enables the appropriations for new government agencies to effectively not take place five sitting days after it has gone in but rather on a prescribed day, which is a key thing.


In addition there is an area that raises specific concerns for me—that is, with respect to the schedule 4 initiative to offset debt. Effectively it is a provision to give the finance minister the discretionary power to offset debts owed to the Commonwealth by an individual or entity against payments owed to the same individual or entity. As it stands currently, the Commonwealth must pay in full regardless of debts owing. This new provision will ensure that there is a mechanism for the Commonwealth to recover debts in a cost-neutral way and in a more efficient manner than is allowed under provisions.


I want to put very clearly on the record my very profound concerns about this. I think that this is not a good provision. The reason is this: I know of numerous examples where the Commonwealth asserts—I emphasise 'asserts'—that there is a debt owing to the Commonwealth. Under this provision, opportunity will arise for the Commonwealth to not make a payment or a net payment to an individual, company or a recipient of the Commonwealth, an amount that the Commonwealth merely asserts it is owed. My concern is that this could have a very significant impact upon those who have dealings with the Commonwealth, on the basis of a mere assertion. The fact is that there are numerous instances where the Commonwealth's word is not sacrosanct—where the Commonwealth's word is not holier than thou, is not like Scripture from the Bible that goes without challenge.


There are numerous instances where the Commonwealth can assert that a debt is owed to it and be wrong. There are numerous instances where the Commonwealth can assert that a certain quantum of money is owed when in reality it is owed a different quantum of money. My concern is that, where there is already a pervasive culture that I am constantly hearing about from members of my community—that government departments engage in a form of bullying when it comes to payments—this provision will entrench that attitude. I suspect it will be an approach that says: 'It's my way or the highway. We allege that you owe us $500. We owe you $600, so you're only getting $100,' to use a basic example. I think there is very good reason for those two processes to be entirely separate. There is very good reason for the Commonwealth to pay the $600 and invoice the $500, to continue the example.


I believe it is not good enough, in what often is the case—and I particularly emphasise this to the member of the executive at the table—to simply say that the Commonwealth has the right to net out the difference between an assertion of an amount owed to the Commonwealth and an amount that the Commonwealth does in fact owe to an external party. For that reason, I say that I as an individual member of this House significantly disagree with the provisions of this act that go to that particular matter. It is simply, I believe, going to be abused by Commonwealth government bureaucrats to reinforce an assertion they make where a debt is owed, and I do not believe it is appropriate that that should be contained in the legislation.


The final schedule is schedule 5 of the act, which proposes to repeal two redundant special appropriations to clean up the statute book; they are the Appropriation (Development Bank) Act 1975 and the Car Dealership Financing Guarantee Appropriation Act 2009. With that, I conclude my remarks.

Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley—Government Whip) (10:46):  I thank the member for Moncrieff for his contribution, both said and otherwise. I am pleased to speak on this bill because it does have significance and reflects the fact that it is part of an ongoing process to change appropriations, governance and financial management issues. The Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1), if enacted as was indicated in the second reading speech, potentially amends four acts and will repeal two others over three portfolio areas. This is all designed as part of the ongoing process of clarifying aspects of the Commonwealth's financial framework. As I indicated earlier, it is not the first time this has been done. In fact, since 2004, there have been nine different versions of this bill. It is designed as part of the overall process to take a collaborative, whole-of-government approach to looking at the way in which we can improve the management of finances.


The breadth of appropriation, governance and financial management issues means that we do need to keep looking at how we can best improve on those matters. That is the reason why the Department of Finance and Deregulation works with all parts of government to help address financial framework issues once they emerge. If there are things that do need to be dealt with it is important that they are dealt with quickly and that, as part of that process of departments being able to appreciate changes to the way they need to operate in order to provide better value for money and better management of our finances, we do move swiftly to encourage a different focus and a different operating approach by departments.


The act will amend four acts. First, it will amend the Auditor-General Act 1997. By doing so it will clarify, for instance, that the Auditor-General may accept an appointment under the Corporations Act 2001 as the auditor of any company that the Commonwealth controls. There are a number of government business enterprises. We have heard reference to the National Broadband Network Co., NBN Co., but Australia Post is another GBE that may be affected by this. This will align the Auditor-General Act 1997 with amendments made in 2008 to expand the meaning of 'Commonwealth control' in the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997, an act that is followed closely by the GBEs that I mentioned earlier, as they are compelled to do.


The other aspect of the changes proposed is that the bill will amend the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997, which I have just referred to. It will ensure that the directors of these authorities and of wholly-owned Commonwealth companies, other than GBEs, will prepare budget estimates as directed by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation. The significance of this is that departments will be compelled to follow direction from the finance minister as opposed to their own minister. Again, this is a signal sending an important directive about the way in which finances will be managed into the future. It is also consistent with an ongoing practice over many years. As a result of the amendments to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act, it will ensure that directors of authorities and wholly-owned Commonwealth companies notify their responsible minister of any decisions regarding certain significant events, such as creating a subsidiary.


During the member for Moncrieff's contribution, I was particularly active in attempting to bring him back to relevance to the bill, specifically because some of the matters he was raising in reference to NBN will be dealt with by this bill. For example, if NBN were to change anything that it indicated it would do under its corporate plan, it would need to notify the minister for communications accordingly. This bill will have the effect of doing that just that. If NBN Co. decided to change its direction in a significant way, this would trigger the significant event provisions that are dealt with under this bill and it would need to notify the minister accordingly. I think it is important for that to happen, particularly if there is an impact on the financial elements of NBN Co.'s operations. For example, if the change were going to affect its stated returns on investment or if it were to affect the way in which the rollout is to occur and that would have a financial implication, I would imagine that that should be notified. The changes that we are making here today will ensure that that occurs.


The bill will amend two other minor misdescribed provisions, as they are called, that appear in the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Act 2010. Those provisions sought to update the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997 to replace references to 'at common law and in equity' and 'at common law or in equity' with the phrase 'under the general law.' 


The bill will amend the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 to make four changes. It will clear up the commencement date for the determination of special accounts and it will also make sure that certain determinations will start on a date specified, outlined in that determination if that day is later than the last day upon which a disallowance resolution is passed by the parliament. It will also ensure that we concentrate on the operating of drawing rights on payments, and it will remove the penalty relating to those drawing rights. In addition, it will insert a new whole-of-government element that would make sure that the finance minister could set-off, in whole or in part, an amount owing to the Commonwealth by a person with an amount owing by the Commonwealth to the same person. Finally, it will increase certain limits around which the finance minister could delegate to officials in relation to the making of certain instruments.


The bill that we are debating will repeal two acts that include special appropriations that no longer have any effect or are redundant. They are the Appropriation (Development of Bank) Act 1975 and the Car Dealership Financing Guarantee Appropriation Act 2009. When taken in their breadth, all the changes that are occurring, as I said earlier, are designed to ensure that we are keeping up to date with events as they are occurring on the ground. They are also important in ensuring that departments are finetuning the way that they are approaching the management of finances. 


This government is proud that it has been able to oversee the fastest rate of fiscal consolidation in, I think, four decades. Anything that can be done at a micro level within departments needs to be encouraged. As I said before, this is not the first time that this has been done. The coalition, when it was in government, also embarked on similar sorts of changes in a similar vein. Again, these changes need to be made to ensure that departments are moving with the times and that we are prudently oversighting the expenditure of funds. To not do so would see the compounding of potential problems or difficulties in the management of finances so that we would be unable to halt or better and efficiently manage finances within departments. I indicated earlier that I have been concerned about the breadth of criticism of NBN Co. These bills ensure that significant events are picked up and that they require notification to the government of anything that would change, for example, the way NBN Co. operates. That has an impact on the rate of return or the stage at which expenditure would be required to be outlaid as part of the rollout over a significant period of time, and it has an impact on the size of that infrastructure project, where we are renewing the nation's technological infrastructure in a way that has not been done before. If there is any significant change to the way that that project is done outside the corporate plan, bearing in mind that this corporate plan is submitted to the shareholding ministers—the minister for communications and the minister for finance—which would ultimately, in some major way, change the rollout, then that should be picked up. That is why the member for Goldstein and the member for Moncrieff, who both made this point when was talking about the NBN, should rest assured, as should the coalition, that any changes to those corporate plans will be picked up by this bill.


Also, bills will be repealed. For example, as I mentioned at the tail end of my contribution, we would be repealing the Car Dealership Financing Guarantee Appropriation Act 2009 and the Appropriation (Development Bank) Act 1975. They have either been in existence for some considerable period of time and are simply redundant or the events which required the establishment of certain acts, such as the Car Dealership Financing Guarantee Appropriation Act 2009, which flowed out of the fact that during the GFC car financing was directly affected. We needed to act quickly to ensure that, for the auto sector, customers who were purchasing vehicles had some sort of security and ability to procure finance. As has been previously described in the House, 46,000 Australians are employed within the sector. That act at that point in time was useful. I notice that the member for Corio and the parliamentary secretary, whose electorates are deeply affected by these issues, would have been two of many electorates that benefited from the Car Dealership Financing Guarantee Appropriation Act 2009. However, as times have changed, we no longer require that act. There has been stabilisation within that sector with people being able to obtain finance and it is clear we no longer need those acts. As I said, this fits within the broader attempt by government that we change acts and repeal them when they are no longer required.


I was particularly pleased to see in the bill, and I made reference to this earlier, that the Department of Finance and Deregulation approaches these things within the spirit of collaboration. It does so clearly to ensure that departments have buy-in in the way in which these regulations are introduced because it will have an impact when rolled out within departments. These types of finance provisions and the impact they may have on programs or people within the department should be managed in a way that there is buy-in at a fairly early stage. It will ensure that we are able to quickly address financial framework issues. Once those issues emerge we are able to design solutions in the repealing of those two acts.


The other thing is that directors get clear signals. It is not just departments, but directors of Commonwealth authorities or wholly owned Commonwealth companies get a clear signal that they, ultimately, in managing finances within GBEs are accountable and are required to report to the finance minister. GBEs themselves are subjected to quite a degree of oversight. There are not too many companies in Australia required to appear before Senate estimates committees and have their entire operations scrutinised to the finest detail in a very public way. A lot of this would occur behind closed doors. Auditors or authorities like APRA, for example, would have the ability to scrutinise finances or issues closely. 


If the Minister for Finance and Deregulation requires that budget estimates be compiled instead of going through the responsible minister, it is entirely appropriate that the Department of Finance and Deregulation be involved in this process to ensure that there is consistency across departments and that we are better able to scrutinise, and for the accountability of parliament and what is expected of parliament—in particular the Senate—it is only right that that occur.


While a lot of people will say that there are a lot of things in here that are dry and not necessarily the stuff that would attract significant debate within the House, I would actually counter that by saying that the things that we are doing in here are absolutely consistent with what we on this side of the chamber are focused on, which is, as I said, the finer and the efficient management of funds and spending within government. I commend the bill to the chamber.

Ms HALL
 (Shortland—Government Whip) (11:01):  Mr Deputy Speaker Leigh, I commence my contribution to this debate on the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012 by acknowledging that this is the first time you have been in the chair as Deputy Speaker when I have spoken. I am sure that in your role as Deputy Speaker you are going to bring great wisdom, make some great rulings and, at the same time, be entertained by some very edifying speeches that will be put to the parliament. I know that you have a deep interest in the economy and economic institutions, and I am sure that you as a member of parliament find this financial framework legislation imperative and riveting and the kind of legislation that we as a parliament need to be passing. 


The Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012 seeks to amend four acts and to repeal two acts across three portfolio areas, as was so eloquently put to the chamber by the previous speaker, to clarify the Commonwealth's financial framework, among other related measures. The bill also seeks to amend the Auditor-General Act 1997 to clarify that the Auditor-General may accept an appointment as the auditor of any company that the Commonwealth controls as defined under the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997. It also seeks to amend the CAC Act to ensure that directors of Commonwealth authorities and wholly owned Commonwealth companies may prepare budget estimates as directed by the Minister for Finance and Deregulation and notify the responsible minister of any decision. This is a very important aspect of the CAC Act and it really goes to the core of financial management and government authorities. 


The bill also amends the Financial Management and Accountability Act to clarify the commencement day for special account determinations and the operation of drawing rights to clarify the financial delegations power. It updates, clarifies and aligns related financial management provisions and repeals two redundant acts that contain special appropriations, the Appropriation (Development Bank) Act 1975 and Car Dealership Financing Guarantee Appropriation Act 2009.


This legislation is all about openness and transparency and ensuring that our financial framework works in the way that it should. It has given me great pleasure to be able to make this contribution to the debate. I wholeheartedly support the legislation.

Mr MARLES
 (Corio—Parliamentary Secretary for Pacific Island Affairs) (11:05):  I thank all members who have contributed to the debate on the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2012. Firstly, as a matter of clarification regarding the implementation of the proposed section 35 of the FMA Act regarding set-off, I would like to make a couple of comments in response to queries from the member of Goldstein's office regarding the interaction of this general provision with existing detailed specific statutory provisions. The government does not intend that this provision be used in relation to a tax liability that may be payable to the Australian Taxation Office within the broad meaning of a tax liability under the Tax Administration Act 1953. I wish to also offer a further point of clarification with regard to the retrospective commencement of items 1 and 2 of schedule 3, which seek to amend misdescribed provisions in the Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Act 2010 that would have made technical amendments to the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997. These items seek merely to substitute references to 'at common law and in equity' and 'at common law or in equity' with the phrase 'under the general law'. The Financial Framework Legislation Amendment Act 2010 added a definition of 'general law' in the CAC Act as meaning 'the principles and rules of the common law and equity'.


As explained in the explanatory memorandum to the bill, the retrospective commencement of these items would not cause detriment to any person, as substantively the connection to common law and equity are retained within the meaning of general law. Moreover, consistent with the request from the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills in their Alert Digest No. 2 of 2012, I also advise the parliament that the changes could not possibly cause detriment to any person. This bill, if enacted, will clarify specific provisions in four acts and repeal two acts across three portfolios. This bill reflects an ongoing commitment to ensuring that financial framework laws remain clear and up to date. I commend the bill to the House.


Question agreed to. 


Bill read a second time. 


Ordered that the bill be reported to the House without amendment.

Dr STONE
 (Murray) (11:09):  I wish to speak on what was indeed an excellent report undertaken by the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs. It is called In the wake of disasters. What the committee did was to enquire into the insurance industry's response to the 2010-11 extreme weather events that occurred around Australia. These included fire and flood. We travelled extensively and spoke to insurance companies and the victims of these disasters. We were often quite shocked by the level of distress and concern still being felt by people who had insurance. This was many months after the disaster itself.


We therefore came up with a series of recommendations that we believe will substantially assist the people who take out insurance and also the insurance companies themselves through better regulation, better communication with policy holders and better transparency and clarity across the sector. The recommendations include, for example, that the Insurance Contracts Act 1984 be amended so that there is an obligatory option of full loss replacement and flood cover. This sounds like common sense but it is needed very much. We also said that, should there be a deviation from the standard cover, it be at least communicated to policy holders. Again, you would expect that to be common sense, but we found that was not occurring. We also want to see a standard definition of flood and I am pleased to say that is already being taken up by this government to ensure that, if you have flood cover on your policy, it does not vary from that of your neighbour who experiences the same event but has different flood cover from a different insurance company.


We recommended that we also amend legislation to remove the general insurers' exemption from unfair contract terms. It seems extraordinary that in Australia we exempt any sector or component of service delivery from unfair contract terms, but we do. More than that, we allow, should there be a disaster in play, that the insurers can set aside the code standards. Just when you most need your insurance company to be talking to you in a timely way, when you most need them to have expert hydrologists or loss assessors to deal with your claim, in fact general insurers are exempt from conforming to the code standards. We are saying that is a nonsense. There should not be an exemption. We are also saying that the whole business of voluntary conformity to codes of practice clearly has not worked when it comes to the insurance industry in Australia and therefore there should be mandated compliance with codes on issues such as time standards for when you first have your insurer respond to you, for sending assessors, in making sure that any disputes are dealt with and that customers are given information about where to go if they move from internal dispute resolution to, for example, the Financial Ombudsman Service or the external dispute process.


We have a case in Australia of good policy intent on the part of insurers but real failure when it comes to dealing in a timely and professional way with individual claims. I will give you some of the examples of the distress we found. In my electorate of Murray we experienced some of the worst floods on record over the Christmas-New Year period last year, January and February 2011. We had farms inundated. A lot of livestock were lost. Over $2 billion worth of livestock and infrastructure such as fencing and shedding was lost. We also had whole towns like Bridgewater, Rochester, Serpentine and Pyramid Hill, completely inundated by floods. As you always find, there was a variety of different insurers who had been selling policies into those communities for a very long time. In some cases there had been more than 20 or 30 years of policy purchasing from some companies and there was an expectation that the insurance companies would be there to help at this time of extreme distress. We found that some insurance companies told people whose homes had been flooded, for example in Rochester: 'Whatever you do, do not touch any of your soft furnishings, carpets or curtains. Do not remove mattresses or anything that is in your home that you wish to make a contents insurance claim about. Do not touch any of that sodden material until your insurance assessor visits and makes an assessment.' Can you imagine week after week of your home being full of this wet and mouldy bed linen, mattresses, carpets and curtains?


There was a disease hazard fairly soon with the incidence of moulds and fungi. However, nearby to that particular individual who was told, 'Don't touch any of the internal contents of your house,' the neighbour with a different insurance company was told, 'Just take photos. Make sure you take a lot of photos of the flood damage in your home or in your garden shed. We trust you. We will do the right thing by you, and by all means get all of the wet mess inside your house outside and dispose of it as soon as you can.' You can see the common sense of that response. You can also understand the despair of those who were told, 'Do not touch the contents of your home until we get there.'


The business of 'until we get there' was problematic because of the huge number of claims being made all of a sudden. You had assessors who did not arrive for weeks. You had hydrologists whose actual qualifications were suspect. When we went into Queensland flood affected areas, we were told of hydrologists who claimed that the flood was clearly from a river from the west when the locals could tell you, 'No, it was from the river from the south.' In one street with different insurance companies with policies sold into the street, we had five or six different interpretations of what the event actually was all about: the directions of flooding, the severity of flooding, the timeliness of the flooding. This is just a nonsense. You can imagine, as I said before, the stress put on victims of these floods when they are not only dealing with the huge losses in front of them: loss of irreplaceable things like old photos, children's clothing, perhaps the loss of pets, or the loss of their livelihood if they had a home based industry. Not only did they have to deal with those losses but they were at war with their insurance companies, who were treating them like enemies rather than as valued customers.


We have made a significant number of recommendations which we believe will help change that situation. We have recommended a code of practice that is no longer voluntary but is mandated, and conformity must be required. We want to make sure that external dispute resolution processing for claims includes looking at the effectiveness of the Financial Ombudsman Service. We are quite sure the Financial Ombudsman Service means well, but they were missing in action when it came in particular to the Victorian floods. They did not make any local public statements in the media; they did not attend in emergency centres. Most people we spoke to in the inquiry did not know who they were or what they did. Their name does not help, of course—there is no mention of insurance or emergency in their actual title.


We also found a lot of the customers of insurers were not told about dispute resolution. It was a very serious omission on the part of the insurance companies not to make it clear that, if they rejected the claim in the first instance, there were other places the customers could go to have their claims reviewed or queried. We found that some insurance companies simply put onto their phones in their call centres casually employed novices who knew nothing about the insurance industry or about the traumatic event itself. So, with the first phone contact, those claiming insurance cover were often told quite blatantly, 'You have got no claim possibility here. You are not going to get any payout, so don't bother ringing again.' This is quite an appalling situation. We believe there must be in every instance the right of a person with an insurance policy to have their claim properly assessed and for them to go to a review process if they do not get the outcome that they are after. So we want minimum standards for claims handling in times of exceptional circumstances, such as a declared disaster.


We want a time frame for informing clients of the progress of their claim; a time frame for advising claimants if an external expert has been appointed to look at their particular claim situation. They could be the assessors or the hydrologists. We also want assurance that the external experts are fully qualified to undertake assessments. We had evidence where we were told that, while there was an expectation a qualified hydrologist or a qualified assessor would come and look at the claim, in fact there was a great deal of suspicion that the person was not qualified or there was a query about whether the person actually visited the premise or the farm to do on-the-ground assessment; it was done from afar. And you can imagine the outcomes for the person with the claim.


We want information provided to the claimants about the qualifications, the employer and the role of the external experts insurers appoint to assist with their claim. There is not always satisfaction for the claimant if they understand the hydrologist or the assessor is employed by the insurance company. Clearly it is in that insurance company's interest to have a particular outcome from their paid external experts. We want a maximum time frame for accepting or denying the claim, and we want a time frame for responding to requests for information. These are such basic consumer rights but they are rights that have been neglected by the insurance companies, particularly at a time of crisis.


We want an undertaking that all decisions about insurance claims are communicated to the claimant in writing, with clear and explicit reasons relating to their particular claim. We do not want to see again a call centre casual employee making, it would appear, a decision over the phone and telling the claimant, 'Don't bother ringing again. There's no way you're going to get cover.' We want a time frame for informing claimants of the progress of their complaint or dispute.


So there are a range of common sense, simple requirements in our inquiry recommendations. They are not necessarily expensive requirements. They are not going to add greatly to the cost of insurance, we do not believe. They are simply about the rights of claimants, to try to minimise the distress for people in these extraordinary circumstances.


We also believe that insurance companies that have breached the code or that are involved in systemic issues and any types of breach should be named, that they do not go anonymously onto the record if they are found to be a problem by the Financial Ombudsman Service, as is currently the case. They should be named so that the consumer can see where there is a company they may not wish to buy a policy from.


We recommend that the Australian Securities and Investments Commission amend the regulatory guidelines 139 by 1 July 2012 to require the Financial Ombudsman Service to report regularly to ASIC and then to make public those breaches, as I have just mentioned.


We also want to make sure that the Australian government empowers ASIC to regulate claims handling and settlement of financial service providers. The voluntary regulation that has been the hallmark of this industry, as I said earlier, just does not work. You cannot have voluntary compliance with codes of conduct and practice where it is a case of the insurer being able not to pay a claim, obviously at a great commercial advantage to them, when paying the claim was the right thing to do. We want to make sure ASIC is comprehensively involved monitoring and regulating claims-handling and settlement processes—imposing sanctions on insurance companies under ASIC licence remedies on behalf of consumers; and we want them to negate the current exemption of claims handling and settlement from the definition of 'financial services' for the purposes of the Corporations Act 2001. These exemptions simply should not exist.


We conducted this inquiry in an environment where there were still victims suffering greatly from the poor practice of their insurers. In the case of Northern Victoria we still have individuals waiting for claim resolution. We have now a new set of flood dangers, as we speak, occurring in Northern Victoria and in parts of the Mallee. These issues have to be resolved. We have to have insurance companies that are fair and are not able to voluntarily defer from behaving properly.

We are also saying that the whole business of voluntary conformity to codes of practice clearly has not worked when it comes to the insurance industry in Australia and therefore there should be mandated compliance with codes on issues such as time standards for when you first have your insurer respond to you, for sending assessors, in making sure that any disputes are dealt with and that customers are given information about where to go if they move from internal dispute resolution to, for example, the Financial Ombudsman Service or the external dispute process.


We have a case in Australia of good policy intent on the part of insurers but real failure when it comes to dealing in a timely and professional way with individual claims. I will give you some of the examples of the distress we found. In my electorate of Murray we experienced some of the worst floods on record over the Christmas-New Year period last year, January and February 2011. We had farms inundated. A lot of livestock were lost. Over $2 billion worth of livestock and infrastructure such as fencing and shedding was lost. We also had whole towns like Bridgewater, Rochester, Serpentine and Pyramid Hill, completely inundated by floods. As you always find, there was a variety of different insurers who had been selling policies into those communities for a very long time. In some cases there had been more than 20 or 30 years of policy purchasing from some companies and there was an expectation that the insurance companies would be there to help at this time of extreme distress. We found that some insurance companies told people whose homes had been flooded, for example in Rochester: 'Whatever you do, do not touch any of your soft furnishings, carpets or curtains. Do not remove mattresses or anything that is in your home that you wish to make a contents insurance claim about. Do not touch any of that sodden material until your insurance assessor visits and makes an assessment.' Can you imagine week after week of your home being full of this wet and mouldy bed linen, mattresses, carpets and curtains?


There was a disease hazard fairly soon with the incidence of moulds and fungi. However, nearby to that particular individual who was told, 'Don't touch any of the internal contents of your house,' the neighbour with a different insurance company was told, 'Just take photos. Make sure you take a lot of photos of the flood damage in your home or in your garden shed. We trust you. We will do the right thing by you, and by all means get all of the wet mess inside your house outside and dispose of it as soon as you can.' You can see the common sense of that response. You can also understand the despair of those who were told, 'Do not touch the contents of your home until we get there.'


The business of 'until we get there' was problematic because of the huge number of claims being made all of a sudden. You had assessors who did not arrive for weeks. You had hydrologists whose actual qualifications were suspect. When we went into Queensland flood affected areas, we were told of hydrologists who claimed that the flood was clearly from a river from the west when the locals could tell you, 'No, it was from the river from the south.' In one street with different insurance companies with policies sold into the street, we had five or six different interpretations of what the event actually was all about: the directions of flooding, the severity of flooding, the timeliness of the flooding. This is just a nonsense. You can imagine, as I said before, the stress put on victims of these floods when they are not only dealing with the huge losses in front of them: loss of irreplaceable things like old photos, children's clothing, perhaps the loss of pets, or the loss of their livelihood if they had a home based industry. Not only did they have to deal with those losses but they were at war with their insurance companies, who were treating them like enemies rather than as valued customers.


We have made a significant number of recommendations which we believe will help change that situation. We have recommended a code of practice that is no longer voluntary but is mandated, and conformity must be required. We want to make sure that external dispute resolution processing for claims includes looking at the effectiveness of the Financial Ombudsman Service. We are quite sure the Financial Ombudsman Service means well, but they were missing in action when it came in particular to the Victorian floods. They did not make any local public statements in the media; they did not attend in emergency centres. Most people we spoke to in the inquiry did not know who they were or what they did. Their name does not help, of course—there is no mention of insurance or emergency in their actual title.


We also found a lot of the customers of insurers were not told about dispute resolution. It was a very serious omission on the part of the insurance companies not to make it clear that, if they rejected the claim in the first instance, there were other places the customers could go to have their claims reviewed or queried. We found that some insurance companies simply put onto their phones in their call centres casually employed novices who knew nothing about the insurance industry or about the traumatic event itself. So, with the first phone contact, those claiming insurance cover were often told quite blatantly, 'You have got no claim possibility here. You are not going to get any payout, so don't bother ringing again.' This is quite an appalling situation. We believe there must be in every instance the right of a person with an insurance policy to have their claim properly assessed and for them to go to a review process if they do not get the outcome that they are after. So we want minimum standards for claims handling in times of exceptional circumstances, such as a declared disaster.


We want a time frame for informing clients of the progress of their claim; a time frame for advising claimants if an external expert has been appointed to look at their particular claim situation. They could be the assessors or the hydrologists. We also want assurance that the external experts are fully qualified to undertake assessments. We had evidence where we were told that, while there was an expectation a qualified hydrologist or a qualified assessor would come and look at the claim, in fact there was a great deal of suspicion that the person was not qualified or there was a query about whether the person actually visited the premise or the farm to do on-the-ground assessment; it was done from afar. And you can imagine the outcomes for the person with the claim.


We want information provided to the claimants about the qualifications, the employer and the role of the external experts insurers appoint to assist with their claim. There is not always satisfaction for the claimant if they understand the hydrologist or the assessor is employed by the insurance company. Clearly it is in that insurance company's interest to have a particular outcome from their paid external experts. We want a maximum time frame for accepting or denying the claim, and we want a time frame for responding to requests for information. These are such basic consumer rights but they are rights that have been neglected by the insurance companies, particularly at a time of crisis.


We want an undertaking that all decisions about insurance claims are communicated to the claimant in writing, with clear and explicit reasons relating to their particular claim. We do not want to see again a call centre casual employee making, it would appear, a decision over the phone and telling the claimant, 'Don't bother ringing again. There's no way you're going to get cover.' We want a time frame for informing claimants of the progress of their complaint or dispute.


So there are a range of common sense, simple requirements in our inquiry recommendations. They are not necessarily expensive requirements. They are not going to add greatly to the cost of insurance, we do not believe. They are simply about the rights of claimants, to try to minimise the distress for people in these extraordinary circumstances.


We also believe that insurance companies that have breached the code or that are involved in systemic issues and any types of breach should be named, that they do not go anonymously onto the record if they are found to be a problem by the Financial Ombudsman Service, as is currently the case. They should be named so that the consumer can see where there is a company they may not wish to buy a policy from.


We recommend that the Australian Securities and Investments Commission amend the regulatory guidelines 139 by 1 July 2012 to require the Financial Ombudsman Service to report regularly to ASIC and then to make public those breaches, as I have just mentioned.


We also want to make sure that the Australian government empowers ASIC to regulate claims handling and settlement of financial service providers. The voluntary regulation that has been the hallmark of this industry, as I said earlier, just does not work. You cannot have voluntary compliance with codes of conduct and practice where it is a case of the insurer being able not to pay a claim, obviously at a great commercial advantage to them, when paying the claim was the right thing to do. We want to make sure ASIC is comprehensively involved monitoring and regulating claims-handling and settlement processes—imposing sanctions on insurance companies under ASIC licence remedies on behalf of consumers; and we want them to negate the current exemption of claims handling and settlement from the definition of 'financial services' for the purposes of the Corporations Act 2001. These exemptions simply should not exist.


We conducted this inquiry in an environment where there were still victims suffering greatly from the poor practice of their insurers. In the case of Northern Victoria we still have individuals waiting for claim resolution. We have now a new set of flood dangers, as we speak, occurring in Northern Victoria and in parts of the Mallee. These issues have to be resolved. We have to have insurance companies that are fair and are not able to voluntarily defer from behaving properly.


Debate adjourned.

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2012-03-01,"



Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (11:25):  Mr Deputy Speaker Leigh, just before I walked in here, I heard the member for Shortland congratulating you on your elevation to the Speaker's panel. I offer my congratulations to you as well. Certainly there is a new ceremonial spirit in these roles and I hope you will consider how you might personally imbue that new spirit. I will be waiting with bated breath to see how that spirit manifests itself.


Turning to the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Powers and Offences) Bill 2011, the report on this bill by the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs was presented to the House yesterday and now we are discussing it in the Federation Committee. While the coalition does not have any problems with the government's response to that committee report, in terms of whether it is best practice to leave not even 24 hours between the report of that committee and then discussing it in the parliament, I think it is fair to say that it would have been more ideal had we been given more time, even though we do not object to what the government is proposing to do. While I do appreciate the rationale for the urgency given to me by government advisers this morning, I want to flag that we would prefer to legislate in a more orderly way. It seems there has been a small element of chaos this week in the government's legislative agenda and I hope that they can rectify this in future sittings.


The House Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs also tabled their recommendations in relation to this legislation yesterday. I want to address what they said because I know the report was issued on behalf of all members of the committee. When any parliamentary committee, where both sides of the chamber are represented, manages to come together to make recommendations as a whole committee I think it is very important that this parliament takes serious note of the recommendations. I am sure the government has done that. So I want to talk about the government's record on law enforcement and then talk directly about the provisions in this bill and the recommendations made by the committee.


Labor's record on criminal issues in general and on border protection has been consistent in its disrespect for Australia's law enforcement agencies. Those agencies have been subject year after year, through the budgetary process, to extensive cuts in a way that is certainly detrimental to their ability to do what they are supposed to do, which is to fight crime and to win. When the Labor Party came to power they abolished the success National Community Crime Prevention Program and replaced it with what is called the Safer Suburbs Plan, essentially the same thing but with a lot less money. The Safer Suburbs program is only a vehicle for Labor to implement its election commitments in this area. Sadly, it is not ongoing beyond the three years and only $15 million was allocated to it.


In contrast, the coalition had funded $65 million for local community crime prevention initiatives. Some of those initiatives were in my electorate of Stirling and I am happy to report that they were very successful and very useful in fighting local crime in my community. I think scrapping that very successful program when they came to office was a dreadful mistake for the Labor Party and is to the detriment of law enforcement all around our country. It is particularly grievous considering the money this government has wasted since 2007. They have taken the axe to what should be considered other high priorities to make up for the fact that so much money went to things which should not have been a priority and have been exposed as scandalous government waste.


Unfortunately under this government we have also seen very serious and sustained cuts to one of the agencies which this bill addresses—that is, the Australian Crime Commission. This agency has, quite frankly, been savaged by Labor. The staffing cuts have been in the order of almost 20 per cent. These savage budget cuts have severely hampered the ability of the ACC to carry out their duties. Staff in that agency has been reduced from 688 to 556. I also note that 100 officers seconded from state and territory police forces have also been sent home. Labor's cuts to the ACC budget equate to an 8.9 per cent reduction over the forward estimates. As I said, that has resulted in almost a 20 per cent reduction in staffing numbers available to that agency. You cannot savage an agency like that and expect it to be able to continue to do its job in a professional way and at the same level as it did when it had 20 per cent more people available. Clearly, these very serious and grievous cuts are going to have an impact on the ability of that agency to fight crime. I am very disappointed that Labor's priorities have meant that they have not fully funded the ACC. Clearly this could be a challenge for us if the government does change and we get into power.


The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service have been similarly savaged by this government and it has happened to them at a time when the strain on their resources is already immense because of the border protection catastrophe that Labor have created because of the silly changes they made to the successful border protection regime they inherited when they came to office. Customs and Border Protection are the country's premier agency in the protection of Australia's borders. One of the core Customs functions is to stop illicit material and other contraband entering Australia. Obviously, if their ability to do that is hampered then we are going to find more weapons on our streets and more precursors to drugs, or those drugs themselves, being smuggled into the country. Clearly, the likelihood of intercepting contraband before it gets to Australia has been vastly diminished since that agency has had its funding cut so significantly by Labor.


The cuts have resulted in Customs axing 20 per cent of its senior executive service. One in five senior executive officers have been axed as a result of Labor's spending decisions. We have a new Minister for Home Affairs in this portfolio, the member for Blaxland. I believe the test for him becoming a successful minister is whether he can carry weight with his colleagues and reinstate the savage cuts that have been made to the agencies that he is responsible for.


I want to list some of those cuts because it is vitally important that these are addressed. Labor have cut aerial surveillance within the portfolio by almost $21 million, which means that there are 2,215 fewer surveillance hours available for Customs to patrol our borders. That equates to 90 fewer days for surveillance by Customs and Border Protection to look at what is going on around our borders, particularly our northern borders where that agency is so heavily involved in dealing with Labor's border protection failures. Ninety staff were cut from Customs in the last budget on top of the 250 staff that were cut in the 2010-11 budget, and $9.3 million has been taken out of Customs in the financial year 2014-15, apparently in a plan to reduce capital spending in what is classified as low-risk organisational activities. 


Labor have cut $34 million over four years for passenger facilitation at Australia's eight major international airports. When Australians are waiting in line to be processed by Customs—and those queue times are increasing—they can directly blame the Labor government for the cuts they made to the Customs budget to process passengers coming into Australia. Clearly, when you are making such enormous cuts, they are going to have a severe impact on the ability of Customs to provide that service. In last year's MYEFO, it was estimated that about $35 million will be cut from Customs over the forward estimates. This is on top of the budget cut to Customs for cargo inspection outlined earlier that has resulted in savage cuts to Customs' ability to screen cargo when it comes into Australia. There was $58.1 million cut from that budget, and that cut has meant that 25 per cent less sea cargo is inspected when it comes into Australia. A staggering 75 per cent less air cargo is inspected because of that enormous cut.


As I have outlined, what this means is that it is much harder for our law enforcement agencies to their job because the federal government are not doing theirs. The federal government are not properly screening cargo when it comes into Australia. That means that organised crime has the ability to bring things into our country, and it means that it is much harder for not only federal crime fighting agencies but also state and territory police forces to do their jobs because the federal Labor government are not doing theirs. I think that is a damning indictment on this government, and I really believe the test for the new minister is whether he has the ability to convince his colleagues that these cuts need to be reversed and that these cuts have hampered his agencies' ability to do their jobs. That is the absolute test for the new Minister for Home Affairs.


Sadly, it is not just Customs and the ACC that have attracted the savage cuts that Labor have made to our law enforcement agencies. The Australian Federal Police have also been hit hard by cuts. Labor imposed their so-called efficiency dividend, which I think is the worst form of budget management, on the AFP. This has resulted in $23.5 million being cut from the AFP's operating budget. This is on top of the staff and budget cuts that they have been forced to absorb in previous years. When Labor take the axe to Customs and Border Protection and to the Australian Federal Police, it makes their job more difficult to do and it also hampers the ability of state police forces to do their job.


It is very important that states recognise that the Commonwealth is not pulling its weight in our national law enforcement efforts and it is making the jobs of the states and territories even harder. That filters down to all of our electorates. When we see crime related to drugs, we can look directly at the federal government and say that they are not doing their job in stopping drugs or the precursors of drugs coming into Australia. That filters its way down into every area of law enforcement and every area of criminal activity, because we know that criminal activity is so heavily related to drugs.


Following on from my preliminary comments about the terrible things that Labor are doing to our law enforcement agencies and the coalition's disappointment in the way they have made these savage cuts to our law enforcement agencies: in light of the fact that they have wasted so much money in other areas, if this were a disciplined government that had exercised physical restraint then these cuts probably would not be so egregious. But the reality is that they are a government that are fiscally reckless and have wasted an enormous amount of money, and yet they have still managed not to fund these agencies properly and they have savaged the existing budget that these agencies had when they came to office. That is a shame, and that is affecting all of us in our electorates. The new Minister for Home Affairs has come into the chamber and I reiterate my call for him to look at these savage cuts, to look at the effect that they are having on the agencies that are under his control and to do all he can to reverse these cuts so that these crime-fighting agencies can do their job of fighting and stopping the crime which is such a scourge in our communities.


I will just talk about the amendments in the bill. The explanatory memorandum to the bill notes that the bill will increase transparency and reduce the complexities surrounding the procedures governing the collection, use and analysis of DNA forensic material. This is a sensible amendment and it is fully supported by the coalition. I note that it was also supported by the House committee that inquired into this bill. Secondly, the bill aims to enhance the Australian Crime Commission's information-sharing capabilities to enable the agency to share information with Commonwealth, state and territory agencies and international law enforcement intelligence bodies. Again, I think these are sensible amendments. They attract the support of the coalition and they attract the unanimous support of the committee also.


It clearly makes sense for the ACC to have the ability to share information with relevant law enforcement agencies when it is appropriate for them to do so. I was informed in my briefing this morning that the ACC suffers from some of the most restrictive rules in relation to the information that it can share and how it can share that information. I support this bill's attempts to liberalise the ability of the ACC to share information when it is appropriate. The bill also makes an amendment to provide the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity with a contempt power and to enhance the commission's capability to investigate corruption. This amendment aims to deter uncooperative witnesses by providing a quick and powerful mechanism for the integrity commissioner to deal with uncooperative witnesses. Again, this is a sensible amendment endorsed by the coalition and endorsed unanimously by the committee.


Measures in this bill also aim to combat the emergence of new and illicit substances such as meow meow and special K. The reality is that the drugs we find on our streets are constantly evolving, particularly drugs that are created through a chemical process in backyard labs. Clearly the legislative framework needs to keep up with changes that are made. I understand from my briefing this morning that it is that particular aspect of the bill that warrants the urgency with which this House has been asked to deal with the bill. I accept at face value what I was told and that is why we have been happy to debate this bill at such short notice, with the caveat that I mentioned earlier on that it is not best practice to force the chamber to look at it so quickly after the committee has completed its deliberations.


The bill also seeks to make amendments that will list additional drug substances and the quantities to be subject to the full range of serious Commonwealth drug offences. That is the measure I was just discussing about the changes that we see in relation to chemically synthetically created drugs.


The bill also makes amendments to Commonwealth parole. Currently there is no ability to refuse parole to a federal offender who is serving a sentence of imprisonment of less than 10 years, even if the corrective services agencies believe the offender should not be granted parole.


On the same subject of parole, the bill's amendments will allow the release on parole of all federal offenders to be a discretionary decision, which would be consistent with the approach the states and territories take on granting parole. Further amendments are also being made to ensure that the federal offender's parole period ends on the same day as his or her sentence and that the parole supervision period may extend to the end of the federal offender's parole period. The situation currently is that for federal offences, other than life imprisonment, the maximum parole supervision period is only three years.


If I talk about all of those changes as a whole, this was the area of controversy that the committee raised in its report that has not been accepted by the government. The committee largely accepted the provisions of this bill, but there were two things they were concerned about and the retrospective nature of the changes that were made to parole was one of them. The government has not accepted the committee's concerns that were raised in the report that they tabled yesterday, and I do support the government's approach to this particular issue. I think it does make sense for the government to have the discretion that it is seeking.


I spoke to the deputy chair of the committee—the senior coalition member of that committee, the member for Pearce—and she reiterated to me the concerns that the committee had. I know that she takes her committee work very seriously. When she endorses a recommendation for a committee that she is on, and particularly one that she is deputy chair of, she is serious about it. She raised with me that she still shared the concerns that the committee raised yesterday about the retrospective nature of these changes. But I did respectfully agree to disagree with her on that particular issue and the coalition supports the government's approach to these changes.


The bill makes an amendment that will empower state and territory fine enforcement agencies to enforce Commonwealth fines through non-judicial enforcement actions without first obtaining a court order, which is costly and time consuming. That is supported by the coalition and was supported unanimously by the committee.


Finally, the bill makes an amendment to allow a court to restrict the publication of certain matters in relation to applications for freezing orders and restraining orders to prevent the publication of information that could compromise the proceeds of crime or related criminal investigation. Again, the coalition considers that to be uncontroversial, and the committee endorsed the government's approach unanimously also. There were two issues the committee raised within its report yesterday. I have dealt with the first issue about the concerns they had about the retrospective nature of the changes to federal parole. The second issue related to the safeguards around the ACC sharing information with private sector agencies. The government have accepted the concerns that the committee raised. I note that they are going to move amendments that add to those safeguards. Again, we support the government's approach on that and I am pleased that they have taken into account what the committee raised yesterday. It obviously makes sense for there to be appropriate safeguards around the ACC sharing such information. We were briefed this morning that the ACC felt that the amendments that were being made did create a workable framework for them, so I believe that this is a sensible way for the parliament to proceed. The opposition supports this bill and we also support the minor amendments that the government will be moving at a later stage.


If I could just be indulged, I acknowledge that today represents the 150th anniversary of policing in New South Wales. I want to congratulate the New South Wales Police Force on the good work that it does. It is a police force with a very distinguished history, indeed sometimes even a colourful history, over the 150 years that it has provided policing for the state of New South Wales. I note that the Member for Fowler is very familiar with the New South Wales Police Force. I am sure that he would join with me in offering these congratulations. I note that he takes all issues of law enforcement very seriously in his role as chair of the Joint Committee on Law Enforcement. I also congratulate the Minister for Police and Emergency Services, the Honourable Mike Gallacher, for the work that he has done over the past year for policing in New South Wales and pass on my congratulations to the whole force through the New South Wales police commissioner, Mr Andrew Scipione. I am sure that everyone in the parliament will join with me in offering our good wishes on what is a very significant anniversary for that police force. I will conclude my remarks there.


Whilst the minister is in the chamber, I will repeat my call. The agencies that he has inherited from his predecessor have been savaged by cuts that his party have made to them since they came to office in 2007. That has directly hampered their ability to do their job. We will reverse some of those cuts when we come to office. That is our policy, although it is very difficult to reverse them all within the limited budgetary environment that we would inherit. I would ask him very seriously to do his job in convincing his colleagues that making those cuts was an error and to do all he can within his ability to reinstate that funding. We have had cuts of 25 per cent to sea cargo inspections. We have had cuts of 75 per cent to air cargo inspections. Every member of this House will see the results of those savage cuts in the crime statistics in their home electorates. I do not say that as a political point; I say it very genuinely. I hope that he does all he can to reverse the savage cuts that have been made to Customs, to the ACC and to the Australian Federal Police. I will conclude my remarks there.

"Clare, Jason, MP",ALP,2012-03-01,"



Mr CLARE
 (Blaxland—Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Justice) (11:48):  I congratulate the New South Wales police on their 150th anniversary. Like the member for Fowler, I too have a close association with the New South Wales police. I have had the opportunity to work with them and with a number of police commissioners over the last two decades. I congratulate commissioner Scipione on his good work and the work of his team. The Australian Federal Police, the Australian Crime Commission and the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service work very closely with the New South Wales Police Force on many, many areas. It is with great pleasure that I rise today to congratulate them on their 150th anniversary.


I note the comments that the shadow minister made about cuts. I would ask him to urge the shadow Treasurer to contemplate his words as well, because I note the shadow minister in the press this week said that the cutting of 11 SES positions in Customs was, as he described it, 'drastic,' yet he represents a party which is proposing, if elected at the next election, to cut the Public Service by at least 12,000 positions. That is what the shadow Treasurer said, if I recall correctly, and I am assisted by the transcript. On Q&A on 27 June last year, the shadow Treasurer said:


Well, for a start—


I emphasise the words 'for a start'—


12,000 public servants in Canberra will be made redundant over a two year period immediately upon us being elected.


I ask the shadow minister to consider the hypocrisy of the words he has uttered in this debate, criticising the government in this area and describing the cuts of 11 positions as drastic, when their own position here is to cut 12,000 positions. I would ask him to reflect on the hypocrisy of those statements.


This bill amends a number of acts that I as the Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Justice administer. They include the Australian Crimes Commission Act 2002, the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006 and the Customs Act 1901. The bill enhances the powers and capabilities of our law enforcement agencies to carry out their important work and includes a range of tools to fight crime. It enhances the information-sharing abilities of the Australian Crime Commission, it improves the ability of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service to seize illicit substances and it provides the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity with a contempt power. These are all very good amendments and I encourage members to support them. I am very glad to see the opposition supporting this legislation.


Later in the debate the government will formally move amendments to the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act to allow the term of any Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner to be extended for two years. As the minister responsible for the administration of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, I take this opportunity in this debate to explain why this amendment is important. There is no place for corruption of any kind in the public sector. The responsibility of the government is to make the public sector as corruption resistant as possible. It is an unfortunate truth that organised criminals will particularly target people working in law enforcement because of the nature of their work. The Commonwealth Organised Crime Strategic Framework identifies corruption of law enforcement officers as a method used by organised criminals to undertake and conceal illicit activities. It is therefore critically important that we put in place the right measures to address this risk. It is essential that our law enforcement agencies are leaders in mitigating corruption risks and in promoting a culture of integrity. A lot has been done in this respect in recent years, but there is always more work that can, should and needs to be done.


The role of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity is to detect, disrupt and deter potential corruption in federal law enforcement agencies, including the Australian Crime Commission, the Australian Federal Police and the former National Crime Authority. Last year, the government extended the jurisdiction of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity to cover the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. Last week, I announced that I have commissioned an independent review into the first year of ACLEI's oversight of Customs. I have commissioned this review to ensure that the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity is implementing this new responsibility effectively and is properly equipped to discharge this crucial function. The Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity and Customs have been working closely together over the past 12 months to build a partnership to detect, disrupt and deter corruption. After a year in operation, it is now important to examine progress and consider whether improvements are necessary.


The amendment that the government will be moving in this debate will allow the government to extend the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner's term by another two years. It will provide the flexibility for situations where the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity is bedding down big reforms or undergoing extensive change, as is the case right now. The amendment will help ensure that the new responsibility of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity is fully and properly implemented and that, where corruption is found, it is weeded out. It also implements a recommendation of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity. The current commissioner is Mr Philip Moss, whose five-year term is due to expire in July of this year. This amendment will allow the government to consider an extension to his term.


Our law enforcement agencies do a very good job but, as I outlined, like law enforcement agencies around the world, they potentially become the targets of organised criminals. That is why, in addition to the action I have just outlined, I have also written to the Australian Crime Commission, the Australian Federal Police and Customs outlining my expectations of them in detecting, disrupting and preventing corruption. I also sought their advice about what further action they believe is required to mitigate corruption risks and promote corruption resistance. The more corruption-resilient our law enforcement agencies are, and the better equipped they are, the more effective they will be in fighting organised crime. Therefore, I commend this amendment and commend the bill to the House.

Mr MORRISON
 (Cook) (11:55):  I rise to speak in this second reading debate on the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Powers and Offences) Bill 2011. On some indulgence in addressing the matters before us today, given that today is the 150th anniversary of the New South Wales Police Force, I would like to make a few remarks about that anniversary.


As the proud son of a retired police officer—I recognise also here the member for Fowler and the member for McArthur—I know only too well the sacrifice of those who wear the blue in New South Wales. It is a distinguished service. It is populated by brave men and women who put themselves in harm's way on a daily basis for us. For that reason I think they hold a very special place in our community. 


I commend the 15,993 police officers currently serving in the New South Wales Police Force. I particularly want to recognise the 150 officers who are attached to the Miranda Local Area Command with Superintendent Greg Antonjuk, as well as Superintendent Dave Donohue from the Sutherland Local Area Command. Both the Sutherland Local Area Command and the Miranda Local Area Command look after our shire community. 


On this very important day 150 years ago, 800 officers were combined into a single police force in New South Wales. It was probably one of the toughest states in which to be a police officer—certainly back then, 150 years ago. That job has remained tough and dangerous ever since. 


I particularly want to pay tribute to Commissioner Andrew Scipione. In my time I have not come across a finer man than Commissioner Scipione. He is an extraordinarily talented, gifted but gracious individual who has done an outstanding job as the Commissioner of the New South Wales Police Force. It was one of his initiatives to call the New South Wales Police Force by that name. My father, in particular, was incredibly pleased when that decision was taken, because it is a force. We need a force in our communities to combat the insidious nature of crime that would seek to rob the property, lives and liberties of our citizens. So it is incredibly important that we recognise the contribution of those who have done so much in this area.


Commissioner Scipione has probably done more than any other commissioner to lift the level of integrity within the New South Wales Police Force—only exceeding the efforts of Commissioner Avery, many years ago. I pay tribute to Commissioner Scipione and I pay tribute to Minister Mike Gallacher, and the work that he is doing in that area, but most importantly I acknowledge the work of the good and faithful officers of the New South Wales Police Force. I also want to acknowledge their families. Being a police officer is tough, and it is tough on families. Police officers find it difficult to deal with the things they see every day, and it is almost impossible not to bring that back home. They do everything they can, I think, to shield their families from the things that they have to deal with every day. For that they pay a very high emotional price. 


It is important that we acknowledge that they are not only protecting community members but also trying to protect their families, and their family life, from the impact of what they have to deal with on a daily basis. I know that that was something my father did on a daily basis. I remember particularly the day that my father, who was working for the CIB at the time as a fingerprint expert, had to attend the scene at the Luna Park fires. On that occasion there were a number of young boys who had perished in those fires. They were all from my local community and they were the same age as my brother and I. My father had to go to that scene and identify the bodies. They are the things police officers have to do. It is a tough job. We commend them here in this place.


But to the matter of the bill, I rise to speak in support of the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Powers and Offences) Bill 2011. The proposed amendments are far-reaching. They span a range of scenarios and issues faced by our law enforcement agencies, from forensics and DNA testing to illicit drugs to parole conditions and the proceeds of crime. This bill goes to the heart of policing and the way our nation manages the issues of crime and justice.


Fundamentally, this bill deals with the axis of crime, punishment and jurisprudence, and where these areas inevitably overlap this bill seeks to rationalise the intersecting roles, responsibilities and capabilities of law enforcement agencies across all levels and jurisdictions of governance.


I echo the disappointment of my colleague, the member for Stirling, that the report of the House Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs has sat in this place for less than 24 hours before this debate has been brought into this parliament, but on this side of the chamber we get fairly used to the chaotic nature with which bills are often addressed.


The areas that this bill seeks to address are very serious and do require full, careful consideration by all parties concerned. That said, though, the coalition does support the measures that would enhance the capacity of our law enforcement agencies to do their job to the best of their ability. The one thing we can do in this place to support those who put themselves at risk is to ensure they have the laws and they have the support to back them up.


We support the aims of this bill to enhance and empower our law enforcement agencies as they seek to combat crime. The coalition will support the amendments to this bill, as per the recommendations of the House standing committee, but I understand we will be rejecting recommendation 8. I also understand from the comments by the member for Stirling that the additional amendments that the government has sought to move now would also be supported by the coalition.


In government, the coalition provided more than $65 million over four years to fund the National Community Care Crime Prevention Program. That was abolished by this government. They installed in its place the Safer Suburbs program, with a meagre $15 million over three years—less than a quarter of the funding. The AFP is also no stranger to funding cuts. Labor slashed more than $23 million from the operating budget of the Australian Federal Police in 2011-12 at a time when their services are in great need. Not only have we noticed that in the general community but we know of the demands placed on the Australian Federal Police as we have gone through the conduct of our detention inquiry over recent months. There are demands upon our Australian Federal Police and they need our support to do the job with which they have been tasked.


Customs has also suffered under this government's incompetence. In addition to 250 jobs being cut by Labor in the 2010-11 budget, another 90 staff have been shown the door. In the Mid-year Economic and Fiscal Outlook it was revealed that an estimated $35 million would be cut from Customs over the forward estimates. 


These decisions serve to fundamentally overstretch and critically undermine the capacity of Australia's key frontline crime enforcement agencies. I acknowledge that there is a new Minister for Home Affairs in the chair. I know him well; he is a good friend of mine. I would hope that he will significantly better the performance of his predecessor in this role, and I think one of the things he will be judged upon will be his ability to ensure that these agencies get the resources they need to do the job, which was done so appallingly by his predecessor. But I look forward with hope to the opportunity that there will be a reward for the Australia Customs and Border Protection Service and the Australian Federal Police from the activities of the new minister.


It is on top of this record and against this concerning backdrop that these matters are before us today. The bill is about consolidated law—removing obstacles like jurisdictional difficulties and legal loopholes, and overcoming barriers to information sharing to enable our law enforcement officers to do their job to the best of their ability and ensure they have access to the intelligence, resources, cooperative tools and legal protections they need to perform their role. This bill builds upon discussions and constructive dialogue that has taken place for some years, adding further insult to injury when you consider that years of debate and constructive investigation of these matters has now come in such a rushed manner towards us today. But the bill does raise valid amendments and it is worth reflecting briefly on these. One of the key issues addressed in the bill is the collection and use of DNA forensic material. As science moves in leaps and bounds, there is a need—but, more than that, a responsibility—for us to keep up. As policing incorporates and relies more heavily on forensic testing—a world away from the forensic procedures and technologies that were available when my father was involved in these sorts of things many years ago—we need to keep up. It is imperative that the legal parameters within which our organisations operate are clearly defined, up to date, accessible and consolidated.


It is also critical, in short, that there is consistency across our various jurisdictions and that we are all on the same page. This bill will increase the transparency and reduce the complexity that surrounds procedures governing the collection, use and analysis of DNA material. It brings clarity. The amendments go towards reducing the inconsistencies that currently exist between the Crimes Act and the legislation in the states and territories. Furthermore, some of the amendments are concerned with reclassifying the methods used—for example, defining a blood sample as a prick-to-the-finger test. This bill also strives to bolster the capacity of the Australian Crime Commission to share information and intelligence with agencies across all tiers of law enforcement from Commonwealth, state and territory agencies to internal enforcement and intelligence bodies. This is critically important, because what we have learned over many years is that the better we can manage, capture, share and analyse data, the better chance we have of focusing our efforts on getting the crooks. That is something that our police are tasked with on our behalf every day. The opportunity to share this information and share its analysis and target our efforts will, I think, yield a significant dividend, not just in the area of policing but, more broadly, in the security responsibilities that we have as a national parliament and that the government has as an executive.


We are talking here about things that will put right these matters. The Australian Crime Commission has been forced to cut staff numbers from 688 to 556. That is almost 20 per cent. Another 100 officers seconded to the union from state and territory police forces have been returned home. Over the forward estimates for the ACC, Labor has cut more than eight per cent. On the issue of crime prevention, Labor's record also speaks volumes. These amendments would also permit the chief executive officer of the Crime Commission to share information with the private sector under certain circumstances, which is a worthy measure that is deemed necessary and appropriate. As with any organisation, transparency and accountability is a must, and that need could hardly be more pressing than in the area of crime prevention and law enforcement. This amendment will provide the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity with a contempt power, as well as enhancing the commission's ability to investigate corruption. The crux of this is to act as a deterrent for uncooperative witnesses and, where they arise, provide a quick and potent mechanism for the integrity commissioner to handle the situation and deal with it accordingly.


Furthermore, there are measures in this bill that aim to combat new and illicit substances that, sadly, have crept onto Australian streets with devastating consequences, substances like meow meow and Special K. As a father of two young girls—they are under five—I shudder to think what they will be exposed to by the time they enter their teenage years. Sadly, those threats, I am sure, will present themselves even before their teenage years. Staying on top of the quick movement of this is something that I will support strongly in this House. The amendment will clearly articulate the additional drug substances and quantities to be subject to the full range of Commonwealth serious drug offences. This bill should assist our Customs and Border Protection Service in intercepting and seizing illicit drugs detected at the Australian border, by overcoming an existing legal anomaly, allowing customs officers to seize all illicit drugs regardless of whether they are proscribed under customs regulations or the Criminal Code. Again, this goes to consolidation and consistencies. Our law enforcement agencies, officers in the Customs And Border Protection Service and the AFP perform a tremendous job under difficult circumstances, and it is important that we ensure that the law is there to support the work they do. This bill also makes amendments to Commonwealth parole. At present there is no ability to refuse parole to a federal offender who is serving a sentence of imprisonment of less than 10 years even if corrective services believe that the offender should not be granted parole. This bill's amendments will allow the release on parole of all federal offenders to become a discretionary decision consistent with the approach currently taken by the states and territories on the granting of parole. At present the maximum parole supervision for federal sentences other than life imprisonment is just three years.


This is a worthy bill. While it has been rushed into this place, it is an opportunity on this special day to recognise what is taking place even as we speak in New South Wales with the special march in the city of Sydney. Today is a day for police officers to stand tall and proud in New South Wales as they can all around the country. It is a day when their families can celebrate their service along with all the citizens of New South Wales and all of those who support their good works.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Murphy
):  Before I call the member for Fowler I take the opportunity to associate myself with the comments about police made by the honourable member for Cook. As late as last Friday, Minister Mike Gallacher and Commissioner Andrew Scipione visited the new, refurbished Burwood Police Station. I had the opportunity to speak to Commissioner Scipione, and on that occasion many laudatory statements were made about the fine work that he and Minister Mike Gallacher were doing. It was a welcome visit to my electorate. I thank the member for Cook.

"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2012-03-01,"



Mr HAYES
 (Fowler) (12:11):  I would like also to follow in the same vein on this 150th anniversary of the New South Wales Police. I thank the member for Cook, whom I know is also the son of a police officer, for his very fine remarks. One thing I do know from growing up, particularly growing up in the back blocks of Sydney, is that it was not necessarily all that popular to boast that you were a son of a police officer in New South Wales. I also know that one of the things that really did differentiate policing and still does now is the reasons that people choose to wear the uniform of a police officer. I had occasion to ask my dad that once, but I will come back to that a little bit later.


I wanted to say that, in addition to being a son of a police officer, I have also had the opportunity over many years to represent police in every state and territory of this country as their advocate in various tribunals, which has given me a very broad insight into policing generally. One thing that does unite police officers—I have asked many in the witness box, 'Why did you choose to become a police officer?'—is that, oddly enough, they were almost the exact words that my dad said to me: they joined the police to make a difference. I think that is really what is the case. It did not matter when I started acting as advocate for police—in whatever state I was in, the men and women who take the responsibility of protecting our nation and ensuring there is safety on our streets were all motivated by one thing: making a difference.


I really think it takes a special type of person with, quite, frankly, a special courage to put their hand up to do that. It is a profession in itself that is much demeaned. I am sure nobody likes being pulled over. No-one likes to be cautioned. But, without people being so selfless as to go take on an occupation such as policing with a view to protecting our community, there would be anarchy. Police officers, quite frankly, are a microcosm of our greater community. They are the ones who uphold the law. Perhaps in many instances they may not like everything they have to do, but they get up, work their shifts, go out day or night and experience dangers and see various things out there that, thankfully, none of us here will probably ever have to experience in our lifetimes. And yet they do that.


Regrettably and unfortunately, it does take a toll on police officers. Across the nation we only hold our male police officers for 12½ years, which is a lot different from when Scott's and my dad were in the force. For female police officers it is about nine years. It is an occupation that has a very high burnout rate, and that is something we need to stay focused on. We need to protect the people who are protecting our community.


Andrew Scipione is a very good friend of mine, and he is doing a fantastic job as New South Wales Police Commissioner. He has been a very unifying force—and not in the New South Wales Police Force. I oversee the law enforcement committee, which oversees the Australian Crime Commission, so I have regular contact with all the police commissioners. I have seen the spirit of unification Andrew brings to that august body and his role in promoting the idea that you cannot have criminal loopholes because that migrates crime around the country. He is a strong believer in consistency and also in the profession of policing itself. To Andrew and all his colleagues, all the men and women of the New South Wales Police Force, I wish you well on the 150th anniversary of the force. I think Andrew did the right thing by bringing back the word 'force'. My dad, in his retirement, reeled when it became the police 'service'. He reckoned that was akin to it being the Public Service. He said the police must be a force to be reckoned with. Those sorts of comments have been put forward around the kitchen table to most of us who have grown up in police families.


It would be remiss of me not to take a moment to mention Scott Webber and the New South Wales Police Association, with whom I have had a very strong association for many years. They represent everyone from probationary constables to the Commissioner of Police. They do so properly, they do so with respect and dignity, and they put police officers in New South Wales first and foremost. I congratulate them and their members on the sterling job the association does in New South Wales.


This bill amends a number of criminal justice legislation aspects which need to be revised. In particular, it is critical for making sure we have contemporary methods to combat crime. Crime is not static; it is ever-changing. As a consequence, if we are going to empower those to whom we want to give responsibility for enforcing our laws, we as legislators must be vigilant in ensuring that they have the appropriate tools and regulatory support to do their jobs. The majority of the amendments before us deal with collecting and using DNA in criminal investigations and enshrining the protection of persons whose DNA samples are being investigated. These amendments will ensure our criminal legislation is effectively on par with the 2010 DNA forensic procedures review of the Crimes Act by Peter Ford. The amendments in the bill will ensure a more transparent and simplified process of collecting and using DNA forensic material in criminal matters. They will also ensure the protection of the privacy of all those involved in an investigation, particularly in relation to children.


It is critical to nail this down and get it right. I was around when the former government some time back, to their credit, brought in a national DNA database. The whole idea was to have national consistency associated with that. That was a very good thing; it is a very good policing tool. But it was highly regrettable when, in the Peter Falconio case, a person was swabbed and their DNA was collected in Adelaide and then it was found that it was not admissible in a court in the Northern Territory. Regrettably, although everyone left Canberra with their hands over their hearts saying we will have a national DNA database supported by consistent state and territory based regulation, the amount of customisation that occurred simply meant that the investigative procedures applicable in one state were inadmissible in another territory. That could have jeopardised a very serious murder investigation. In terms of policing generally, I do not think there is anyone in law enforcement now that would take their position that they are state rightists. As I said at the outset, crime is an export commodity. Criminals do not look at the Constitution, nor do they read a geographical map when they want to plan or commission crime. They certainly look for windows of opportunity. That is why we should strive to have national consistency in our laws when they relate to crime and to ensure that we do not provide incentives and opportunities for those who seek to profit from the misery of others by the commissioning of crime itself.


In terms of the issues about forensic materials, I think that is good. It certainly takes leadership and it will make a significant difference. In respect to schedule 2, the amendments to the Australian Crime Commission Act of 2002, the bill will ensure more efficient cooperation and sharing of information between the Australian Crime Commission; Commonwealth, state and territory agencies; and the private sector. The ACC CEO will be given the ability to share information with various industries exposed to serious and organised crime threats. This is very important in terms of the ACC and its extensive powers. It is a question of authority. It has very stringent standards put on it as to the security of its information and where it cannot be taken. However, to do its job effectively as our premier criminal intelligence agency, if you like, it must be in a position not only to notify and advise its partner groups, and each of the state and territory police agencies—Australian Taxation, Customs, et cetera—but also to actually advise organisations that are being infected or are highly suspected of being infected by serious and organised crime groups themselves. This will give the CEO of the Australian Crime Commission the protection and ability to do that.


I will be very brief in finishing up, because I know the minister is in here at the moment. In terms of extending the maximum term for the integrity commissioner, apart from being Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Law Enforcement, I also sit on the Joint Standing Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity and I see firsthand the good work that Philip Moss, as Commissioner for Law Enforcement Integrity, and his team do. Some time ago, the committee unanimously moved that there should be an extension—that the government should give consideration to extending the term from a five-year to a seven-year appointment. That has occurred as a consequence of that recommendation; I am very pleased the minister took that up. Philip Moss, having initiated the procedures of the commission itself, has done much to set the framework of law enforcement integrity. We strongly support his activities and are particularly pleased that the minister has sought to pick up that recommendation. As I have been given the wind-up, I will hand over to the minister.

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (12:23):  I will be very brief, because I know the importance of getting the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Powers and Offences) Bill 2011 through today. The coalition are glad to support these changes. One point worth mentioning about the bill is that it makes certain new drugs illegal. One particular drug is known as meow meow, which is actually mephedrone. This is a very dangerous drug which has resulted in over 100 deaths in the UK. Its current use is not illegal but this bill will make it illegal. It is very important that we have the legislative powers to act quickly so that any new drugs that come onto the system—our scene—that are very dangerous, like this new drug, can quickly be made illegal.


I would also like to congratulate our local superintendent of the Liverpool area, Ray King. He is doing a fantastic job cleaning up Liverpool. Ray was previously the superintendent who did the excellent work in Cabramatta using CCTV cameras. I would like to note that it was the coalition's commitment in 2010 to get three quarters of a million dollars to fund the CCTV cameras in the Hughes electorate and we hope that they can be put in soon. However, I would like to quickly express my disappointment that the government has been cutting back in many areas of our policing, particularly our customs service where we have seen reductions in the number of cargo screenings. This is very detrimental and makes Ray King's job on the streets of Liverpool all the more difficult. 


It is great to have these bills to increase the powers of our police, but we cannot at the same time be cutting back other areas of expenditure and customs, which we have seen this government doing, and also in the Australia Federal Police. We support the bill and we hope it gets through quickly.

Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (11:25):  Mr Deputy Speaker Leigh, just before I walked in here, I heard the member for Shortland congratulating you on your elevation to the Speaker's panel. I offer my congratulations to you as well. Certainly there is a new ceremonial spirit in these roles and I hope you will consider how you might personally imbue that new spirit. I will be waiting with bated breath to see how that spirit manifests itself.


Turning to the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Powers and Offences) Bill 2011, the report on this bill by the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs was presented to the House yesterday and now we are discussing it in the Federation Committee. While the coalition does not have any problems with the government's response to that committee report, in terms of whether it is best practice to leave not even 24 hours between the report of that committee and then discussing it in the parliament, I think it is fair to say that it would have been more ideal had we been given more time, even though we do not object to what the government is proposing to do. While I do appreciate the rationale for the urgency given to me by government advisers this morning, I want to flag that we would prefer to legislate in a more orderly way. It seems there has been a small element of chaos this week in the government's legislative agenda and I hope that they can rectify this in future sittings.


The House Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs also tabled their recommendations in relation to this legislation yesterday. I want to address what they said because I know the report was issued on behalf of all members of the committee. When any parliamentary committee, where both sides of the chamber are represented, manages to come together to make recommendations as a whole committee I think it is very important that this parliament takes serious note of the recommendations. I am sure the government has done that. So I want to talk about the government's record on law enforcement and then talk directly about the provisions in this bill and the recommendations made by the committee.


Labor's record on criminal issues in general and on border protection has been consistent in its disrespect for Australia's law enforcement agencies. Those agencies have been subject year after year, through the budgetary process, to extensive cuts in a way that is certainly detrimental to their ability to do what they are supposed to do, which is to fight crime and to win. When the Labor Party came to power they abolished the success National Community Crime Prevention Program and replaced it with what is called the Safer Suburbs Plan, essentially the same thing but with a lot less money. The Safer Suburbs program is only a vehicle for Labor to implement its election commitments in this area. Sadly, it is not ongoing beyond the three years and only $15 million was allocated to it.


In contrast, the coalition had funded $65 million for local community crime prevention initiatives. Some of those initiatives were in my electorate of Stirling and I am happy to report that they were very successful and very useful in fighting local crime in my community. I think scrapping that very successful program when they came to office was a dreadful mistake for the Labor Party and is to the detriment of law enforcement all around our country. It is particularly grievous considering the money this government has wasted since 2007. They have taken the axe to what should be considered other high priorities to make up for the fact that so much money went to things which should not have been a priority and have been exposed as scandalous government waste.


Unfortunately under this government we have also seen very serious and sustained cuts to one of the agencies which this bill addresses—that is, the Australian Crime Commission. This agency has, quite frankly, been savaged by Labor. The staffing cuts have been in the order of almost 20 per cent. These savage budget cuts have severely hampered the ability of the ACC to carry out their duties. Staff in that agency has been reduced from 688 to 556. I also note that 100 officers seconded from state and territory police forces have also been sent home. Labor's cuts to the ACC budget equate to an 8.9 per cent reduction over the forward estimates. As I said, that has resulted in almost a 20 per cent reduction in staffing numbers available to that agency. You cannot savage an agency like that and expect it to be able to continue to do its job in a professional way and at the same level as it did when it had 20 per cent more people available. Clearly, these very serious and grievous cuts are going to have an impact on the ability of that agency to fight crime. I am very disappointed that Labor's priorities have meant that they have not fully funded the ACC. Clearly this could be a challenge for us if the government does change and we get into power.


The Australian Customs and Border Protection Service have been similarly savaged by this government and it has happened to them at a time when the strain on their resources is already immense because of the border protection catastrophe that Labor have created because of the silly changes they made to the successful border protection regime they inherited when they came to office. Customs and Border Protection are the country's premier agency in the protection of Australia's borders. One of the core Customs functions is to stop illicit material and other contraband entering Australia. Obviously, if their ability to do that is hampered then we are going to find more weapons on our streets and more precursors to drugs, or those drugs themselves, being smuggled into the country. Clearly, the likelihood of intercepting contraband before it gets to Australia has been vastly diminished since that agency has had its funding cut so significantly by Labor.


The cuts have resulted in Customs axing 20 per cent of its senior executive service. One in five senior executive officers have been axed as a result of Labor's spending decisions. We have a new Minister for Home Affairs in this portfolio, the member for Blaxland. I believe the test for him becoming a successful minister is whether he can carry weight with his colleagues and reinstate the savage cuts that have been made to the agencies that he is responsible for.


I want to list some of those cuts because it is vitally important that these are addressed. Labor have cut aerial surveillance within the portfolio by almost $21 million, which means that there are 2,215 fewer surveillance hours available for Customs to patrol our borders. That equates to 90 fewer days for surveillance by Customs and Border Protection to look at what is going on around our borders, particularly our northern borders where that agency is so heavily involved in dealing with Labor's border protection failures. Ninety staff were cut from Customs in the last budget on top of the 250 staff that were cut in the 2010-11 budget, and $9.3 million has been taken out of Customs in the financial year 2014-15, apparently in a plan to reduce capital spending in what is classified as low-risk organisational activities. 


Labor have cut $34 million over four years for passenger facilitation at Australia's eight major international airports. When Australians are waiting in line to be processed by Customs—and those queue times are increasing—they can directly blame the Labor government for the cuts they made to the Customs budget to process passengers coming into Australia. Clearly, when you are making such enormous cuts, they are going to have a severe impact on the ability of Customs to provide that service. In last year's MYEFO, it was estimated that about $35 million will be cut from Customs over the forward estimates. This is on top of the budget cut to Customs for cargo inspection outlined earlier that has resulted in savage cuts to Customs' ability to screen cargo when it comes into Australia. There was $58.1 million cut from that budget, and that cut has meant that 25 per cent less sea cargo is inspected when it comes into Australia. A staggering 75 per cent less air cargo is inspected because of that enormous cut.


As I have outlined, what this means is that it is much harder for our law enforcement agencies to their job because the federal government are not doing theirs. The federal government are not properly screening cargo when it comes into Australia. That means that organised crime has the ability to bring things into our country, and it means that it is much harder for not only federal crime fighting agencies but also state and territory police forces to do their jobs because the federal Labor government are not doing theirs. I think that is a damning indictment on this government, and I really believe the test for the new minister is whether he has the ability to convince his colleagues that these cuts need to be reversed and that these cuts have hampered his agencies' ability to do their jobs. That is the absolute test for the new Minister for Home Affairs.


Sadly, it is not just Customs and the ACC that have attracted the savage cuts that Labor have made to our law enforcement agencies. The Australian Federal Police have also been hit hard by cuts. Labor imposed their so-called efficiency dividend, which I think is the worst form of budget management, on the AFP. This has resulted in $23.5 million being cut from the AFP's operating budget. This is on top of the staff and budget cuts that they have been forced to absorb in previous years. When Labor take the axe to Customs and Border Protection and to the Australian Federal Police, it makes their job more difficult to do and it also hampers the ability of state police forces to do their job.


It is very important that states recognise that the Commonwealth is not pulling its weight in our national law enforcement efforts and it is making the jobs of the states and territories even harder. That filters down to all of our electorates. When we see crime related to drugs, we can look directly at the federal government and say that they are not doing their job in stopping drugs or the precursors of drugs coming into Australia. That filters its way down into every area of law enforcement and every area of criminal activity, because we know that criminal activity is so heavily related to drugs.


Following on from my preliminary comments about the terrible things that Labor are doing to our law enforcement agencies and the coalition's disappointment in the way they have made these savage cuts to our law enforcement agencies: in light of the fact that they have wasted so much money in other areas, if this were a disciplined government that had exercised physical restraint then these cuts probably would not be so egregious. But the reality is that they are a government that are fiscally reckless and have wasted an enormous amount of money, and yet they have still managed not to fund these agencies properly and they have savaged the existing budget that these agencies had when they came to office. That is a shame, and that is affecting all of us in our electorates. The new Minister for Home Affairs has come into the chamber and I reiterate my call for him to look at these savage cuts, to look at the effect that they are having on the agencies that are under his control and to do all he can to reverse these cuts so that these crime-fighting agencies can do their job of fighting and stopping the crime which is such a scourge in our communities.


I will just talk about the amendments in the bill. The explanatory memorandum to the bill notes that the bill will increase transparency and reduce the complexities surrounding the procedures governing the collection, use and analysis of DNA forensic material. This is a sensible amendment and it is fully supported by the coalition. I note that it was also supported by the House committee that inquired into this bill. Secondly, the bill aims to enhance the Australian Crime Commission's information-sharing capabilities to enable the agency to share information with Commonwealth, state and territory agencies and international law enforcement intelligence bodies. Again, I think these are sensible amendments. They attract the support of the coalition and they attract the unanimous support of the committee also.


It clearly makes sense for the ACC to have the ability to share information with relevant law enforcement agencies when it is appropriate for them to do so. I was informed in my briefing this morning that the ACC suffers from some of the most restrictive rules in relation to the information that it can share and how it can share that information. I support this bill's attempts to liberalise the ability of the ACC to share information when it is appropriate. The bill also makes an amendment to provide the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity with a contempt power and to enhance the commission's capability to investigate corruption. This amendment aims to deter uncooperative witnesses by providing a quick and powerful mechanism for the integrity commissioner to deal with uncooperative witnesses. Again, this is a sensible amendment endorsed by the coalition and endorsed unanimously by the committee.


Measures in this bill also aim to combat the emergence of new and illicit substances such as meow meow and special K. The reality is that the drugs we find on our streets are constantly evolving, particularly drugs that are created through a chemical process in backyard labs. Clearly the legislative framework needs to keep up with changes that are made. I understand from my briefing this morning that it is that particular aspect of the bill that warrants the urgency with which this House has been asked to deal with the bill. I accept at face value what I was told and that is why we have been happy to debate this bill at such short notice, with the caveat that I mentioned earlier on that it is not best practice to force the chamber to look at it so quickly after the committee has completed its deliberations.


The bill also seeks to make amendments that will list additional drug substances and the quantities to be subject to the full range of serious Commonwealth drug offences. That is the measure I was just discussing about the changes that we see in relation to chemically synthetically created drugs.


The bill also makes amendments to Commonwealth parole. Currently there is no ability to refuse parole to a federal offender who is serving a sentence of imprisonment of less than 10 years, even if the corrective services agencies believe the offender should not be granted parole.


On the same subject of parole, the bill's amendments will allow the release on parole of all federal offenders to be a discretionary decision, which would be consistent with the approach the states and territories take on granting parole. Further amendments are also being made to ensure that the federal offender's parole period ends on the same day as his or her sentence and that the parole supervision period may extend to the end of the federal offender's parole period. The situation currently is that for federal offences, other than life imprisonment, the maximum parole supervision period is only three years.


If I talk about all of those changes as a whole, this was the area of controversy that the committee raised in its report that has not been accepted by the government. The committee largely accepted the provisions of this bill, but there were two things they were concerned about and the retrospective nature of the changes that were made to parole was one of them. The government has not accepted the committee's concerns that were raised in the report that they tabled yesterday, and I do support the government's approach to this particular issue. I think it does make sense for the government to have the discretion that it is seeking.


I spoke to the deputy chair of the committee—the senior coalition member of that committee, the member for Pearce—and she reiterated to me the concerns that the committee had. I know that she takes her committee work very seriously. When she endorses a recommendation for a committee that she is on, and particularly one that she is deputy chair of, she is serious about it. She raised with me that she still shared the concerns that the committee raised yesterday about the retrospective nature of these changes. But I did respectfully agree to disagree with her on that particular issue and the coalition supports the government's approach to these changes.


The bill makes an amendment that will empower state and territory fine enforcement agencies to enforce Commonwealth fines through non-judicial enforcement actions without first obtaining a court order, which is costly and time consuming. That is supported by the coalition and was supported unanimously by the committee.


Finally, the bill makes an amendment to allow a court to restrict the publication of certain matters in relation to applications for freezing orders and restraining orders to prevent the publication of information that could compromise the proceeds of crime or related criminal investigation. Again, the coalition considers that to be uncontroversial, and the committee endorsed the government's approach unanimously also. There were two issues the committee raised within its report yesterday. I have dealt with the first issue about the concerns they had about the retrospective nature of the changes to federal parole. The second issue related to the safeguards around the ACC sharing information with private sector agencies. The government have accepted the concerns that the committee raised. I note that they are going to move amendments that add to those safeguards. Again, we support the government's approach on that and I am pleased that they have taken into account what the committee raised yesterday. It obviously makes sense for there to be appropriate safeguards around the ACC sharing such information. We were briefed this morning that the ACC felt that the amendments that were being made did create a workable framework for them, so I believe that this is a sensible way for the parliament to proceed. The opposition supports this bill and we also support the minor amendments that the government will be moving at a later stage.


If I could just be indulged, I acknowledge that today represents the 150th anniversary of policing in New South Wales. I want to congratulate the New South Wales Police Force on the good work that it does. It is a police force with a very distinguished history, indeed sometimes even a colourful history, over the 150 years that it has provided policing for the state of New South Wales. I note that the Member for Fowler is very familiar with the New South Wales Police Force. I am sure that he would join with me in offering these congratulations. I note that he takes all issues of law enforcement very seriously in his role as chair of the Joint Committee on Law Enforcement. I also congratulate the Minister for Police and Emergency Services, the Honourable Mike Gallacher, for the work that he has done over the past year for policing in New South Wales and pass on my congratulations to the whole force through the New South Wales police commissioner, Mr Andrew Scipione. I am sure that everyone in the parliament will join with me in offering our good wishes on what is a very significant anniversary for that police force. I will conclude my remarks there.


Whilst the minister is in the chamber, I will repeat my call. The agencies that he has inherited from his predecessor have been savaged by cuts that his party have made to them since they came to office in 2007. That has directly hampered their ability to do their job. We will reverse some of those cuts when we come to office. That is our policy, although it is very difficult to reverse them all within the limited budgetary environment that we would inherit. I would ask him very seriously to do his job in convincing his colleagues that making those cuts was an error and to do all he can within his ability to reinstate that funding. We have had cuts of 25 per cent to sea cargo inspections. We have had cuts of 75 per cent to air cargo inspections. Every member of this House will see the results of those savage cuts in the crime statistics in their home electorates. I do not say that as a political point; I say it very genuinely. I hope that he does all he can to reverse the savage cuts that have been made to Customs, to the ACC and to the Australian Federal Police. I will conclude my remarks there.

"Clare, Jason, MP",ALP,2012-03-01,"



Mr CLARE
 (Blaxland—Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Justice) (11:48):  I congratulate the New South Wales police on their 150th anniversary. Like the member for Fowler, I too have a close association with the New South Wales police. I have had the opportunity to work with them and with a number of police commissioners over the last two decades. I congratulate commissioner Scipione on his good work and the work of his team. The Australian Federal Police, the Australian Crime Commission and the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service work very closely with the New South Wales Police Force on many, many areas. It is with great pleasure that I rise today to congratulate them on their 150th anniversary.


I note the comments that the shadow minister made about cuts. I would ask him to urge the shadow Treasurer to contemplate his words as well, because I note the shadow minister in the press this week said that the cutting of 11 SES positions in Customs was, as he described it, 'drastic,' yet he represents a party which is proposing, if elected at the next election, to cut the Public Service by at least 12,000 positions. That is what the shadow Treasurer said, if I recall correctly, and I am assisted by the transcript. On Q&A on 27 June last year, the shadow Treasurer said:


Well, for a start—


I emphasise the words 'for a start'—


12,000 public servants in Canberra will be made redundant over a two year period immediately upon us being elected.


I ask the shadow minister to consider the hypocrisy of the words he has uttered in this debate, criticising the government in this area and describing the cuts of 11 positions as drastic, when their own position here is to cut 12,000 positions. I would ask him to reflect on the hypocrisy of those statements.


This bill amends a number of acts that I as the Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Justice administer. They include the Australian Crimes Commission Act 2002, the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006 and the Customs Act 1901. The bill enhances the powers and capabilities of our law enforcement agencies to carry out their important work and includes a range of tools to fight crime. It enhances the information-sharing abilities of the Australian Crime Commission, it improves the ability of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service to seize illicit substances and it provides the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity with a contempt power. These are all very good amendments and I encourage members to support them. I am very glad to see the opposition supporting this legislation.


Later in the debate the government will formally move amendments to the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act to allow the term of any Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner to be extended for two years. As the minister responsible for the administration of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, I take this opportunity in this debate to explain why this amendment is important. There is no place for corruption of any kind in the public sector. The responsibility of the government is to make the public sector as corruption resistant as possible. It is an unfortunate truth that organised criminals will particularly target people working in law enforcement because of the nature of their work. The Commonwealth Organised Crime Strategic Framework identifies corruption of law enforcement officers as a method used by organised criminals to undertake and conceal illicit activities. It is therefore critically important that we put in place the right measures to address this risk. It is essential that our law enforcement agencies are leaders in mitigating corruption risks and in promoting a culture of integrity. A lot has been done in this respect in recent years, but there is always more work that can, should and needs to be done.


The role of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity is to detect, disrupt and deter potential corruption in federal law enforcement agencies, including the Australian Crime Commission, the Australian Federal Police and the former National Crime Authority. Last year, the government extended the jurisdiction of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity to cover the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service. Last week, I announced that I have commissioned an independent review into the first year of ACLEI's oversight of Customs. I have commissioned this review to ensure that the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity is implementing this new responsibility effectively and is properly equipped to discharge this crucial function. The Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity and Customs have been working closely together over the past 12 months to build a partnership to detect, disrupt and deter corruption. After a year in operation, it is now important to examine progress and consider whether improvements are necessary.


The amendment that the government will be moving in this debate will allow the government to extend the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner's term by another two years. It will provide the flexibility for situations where the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity is bedding down big reforms or undergoing extensive change, as is the case right now. The amendment will help ensure that the new responsibility of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity is fully and properly implemented and that, where corruption is found, it is weeded out. It also implements a recommendation of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity. The current commissioner is Mr Philip Moss, whose five-year term is due to expire in July of this year. This amendment will allow the government to consider an extension to his term.


Our law enforcement agencies do a very good job but, as I outlined, like law enforcement agencies around the world, they potentially become the targets of organised criminals. That is why, in addition to the action I have just outlined, I have also written to the Australian Crime Commission, the Australian Federal Police and Customs outlining my expectations of them in detecting, disrupting and preventing corruption. I also sought their advice about what further action they believe is required to mitigate corruption risks and promote corruption resistance. The more corruption-resilient our law enforcement agencies are, and the better equipped they are, the more effective they will be in fighting organised crime. Therefore, I commend this amendment and commend the bill to the House.

"Morrison, Scott, MP",LP,2012-03-01,"



Mr MORRISON
 (Cook) (11:55):  I rise to speak in this second reading debate on the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Powers and Offences) Bill 2011. On some indulgence in addressing the matters before us today, given that today is the 150th anniversary of the New South Wales Police Force, I would like to make a few remarks about that anniversary.


As the proud son of a retired police officer—I recognise also here the member for Fowler and the member for McArthur—I know only too well the sacrifice of those who wear the blue in New South Wales. It is a distinguished service. It is populated by brave men and women who put themselves in harm's way on a daily basis for us. For that reason I think they hold a very special place in our community. 


I commend the 15,993 police officers currently serving in the New South Wales Police Force. I particularly want to recognise the 150 officers who are attached to the Miranda Local Area Command with Superintendent Greg Antonjuk, as well as Superintendent Dave Donohue from the Sutherland Local Area Command. Both the Sutherland Local Area Command and the Miranda Local Area Command look after our shire community. 


On this very important day 150 years ago, 800 officers were combined into a single police force in New South Wales. It was probably one of the toughest states in which to be a police officer—certainly back then, 150 years ago. That job has remained tough and dangerous ever since. 


I particularly want to pay tribute to Commissioner Andrew Scipione. In my time I have not come across a finer man than Commissioner Scipione. He is an extraordinarily talented, gifted but gracious individual who has done an outstanding job as the Commissioner of the New South Wales Police Force. It was one of his initiatives to call the New South Wales Police Force by that name. My father, in particular, was incredibly pleased when that decision was taken, because it is a force. We need a force in our communities to combat the insidious nature of crime that would seek to rob the property, lives and liberties of our citizens. So it is incredibly important that we recognise the contribution of those who have done so much in this area.


Commissioner Scipione has probably done more than any other commissioner to lift the level of integrity within the New South Wales Police Force—only exceeding the efforts of Commissioner Avery, many years ago. I pay tribute to Commissioner Scipione and I pay tribute to Minister Mike Gallacher, and the work that he is doing in that area, but most importantly I acknowledge the work of the good and faithful officers of the New South Wales Police Force. I also want to acknowledge their families. Being a police officer is tough, and it is tough on families. Police officers find it difficult to deal with the things they see every day, and it is almost impossible not to bring that back home. They do everything they can, I think, to shield their families from the things that they have to deal with every day. For that they pay a very high emotional price. 


It is important that we acknowledge that they are not only protecting community members but also trying to protect their families, and their family life, from the impact of what they have to deal with on a daily basis. I know that that was something my father did on a daily basis. I remember particularly the day that my father, who was working for the CIB at the time as a fingerprint expert, had to attend the scene at the Luna Park fires. On that occasion there were a number of young boys who had perished in those fires. They were all from my local community and they were the same age as my brother and I. My father had to go to that scene and identify the bodies. They are the things police officers have to do. It is a tough job. We commend them here in this place.


But to the matter of the bill, I rise to speak in support of the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Powers and Offences) Bill 2011. The proposed amendments are far-reaching. They span a range of scenarios and issues faced by our law enforcement agencies, from forensics and DNA testing to illicit drugs to parole conditions and the proceeds of crime. This bill goes to the heart of policing and the way our nation manages the issues of crime and justice.


Fundamentally, this bill deals with the axis of crime, punishment and jurisprudence, and where these areas inevitably overlap this bill seeks to rationalise the intersecting roles, responsibilities and capabilities of law enforcement agencies across all levels and jurisdictions of governance.


I echo the disappointment of my colleague, the member for Stirling, that the report of the House Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs has sat in this place for less than 24 hours before this debate has been brought into this parliament, but on this side of the chamber we get fairly used to the chaotic nature with which bills are often addressed.


The areas that this bill seeks to address are very serious and do require full, careful consideration by all parties concerned. That said, though, the coalition does support the measures that would enhance the capacity of our law enforcement agencies to do their job to the best of their ability. The one thing we can do in this place to support those who put themselves at risk is to ensure they have the laws and they have the support to back them up.


We support the aims of this bill to enhance and empower our law enforcement agencies as they seek to combat crime. The coalition will support the amendments to this bill, as per the recommendations of the House standing committee, but I understand we will be rejecting recommendation 8. I also understand from the comments by the member for Stirling that the additional amendments that the government has sought to move now would also be supported by the coalition.


In government, the coalition provided more than $65 million over four years to fund the National Community Care Crime Prevention Program. That was abolished by this government. They installed in its place the Safer Suburbs program, with a meagre $15 million over three years—less than a quarter of the funding. The AFP is also no stranger to funding cuts. Labor slashed more than $23 million from the operating budget of the Australian Federal Police in 2011-12 at a time when their services are in great need. Not only have we noticed that in the general community but we know of the demands placed on the Australian Federal Police as we have gone through the conduct of our detention inquiry over recent months. There are demands upon our Australian Federal Police and they need our support to do the job with which they have been tasked.


Customs has also suffered under this government's incompetence. In addition to 250 jobs being cut by Labor in the 2010-11 budget, another 90 staff have been shown the door. In the Mid-year Economic and Fiscal Outlook it was revealed that an estimated $35 million would be cut from Customs over the forward estimates. 


These decisions serve to fundamentally overstretch and critically undermine the capacity of Australia's key frontline crime enforcement agencies. I acknowledge that there is a new Minister for Home Affairs in the chair. I know him well; he is a good friend of mine. I would hope that he will significantly better the performance of his predecessor in this role, and I think one of the things he will be judged upon will be his ability to ensure that these agencies get the resources they need to do the job, which was done so appallingly by his predecessor. But I look forward with hope to the opportunity that there will be a reward for the Australia Customs and Border Protection Service and the Australian Federal Police from the activities of the new minister.


It is on top of this record and against this concerning backdrop that these matters are before us today. The bill is about consolidated law—removing obstacles like jurisdictional difficulties and legal loopholes, and overcoming barriers to information sharing to enable our law enforcement officers to do their job to the best of their ability and ensure they have access to the intelligence, resources, cooperative tools and legal protections they need to perform their role. This bill builds upon discussions and constructive dialogue that has taken place for some years, adding further insult to injury when you consider that years of debate and constructive investigation of these matters has now come in such a rushed manner towards us today. But the bill does raise valid amendments and it is worth reflecting briefly on these. One of the key issues addressed in the bill is the collection and use of DNA forensic material. As science moves in leaps and bounds, there is a need—but, more than that, a responsibility—for us to keep up. As policing incorporates and relies more heavily on forensic testing—a world away from the forensic procedures and technologies that were available when my father was involved in these sorts of things many years ago—we need to keep up. It is imperative that the legal parameters within which our organisations operate are clearly defined, up to date, accessible and consolidated.


It is also critical, in short, that there is consistency across our various jurisdictions and that we are all on the same page. This bill will increase the transparency and reduce the complexity that surrounds procedures governing the collection, use and analysis of DNA material. It brings clarity. The amendments go towards reducing the inconsistencies that currently exist between the Crimes Act and the legislation in the states and territories. Furthermore, some of the amendments are concerned with reclassifying the methods used—for example, defining a blood sample as a prick-to-the-finger test. This bill also strives to bolster the capacity of the Australian Crime Commission to share information and intelligence with agencies across all tiers of law enforcement from Commonwealth, state and territory agencies to internal enforcement and intelligence bodies. This is critically important, because what we have learned over many years is that the better we can manage, capture, share and analyse data, the better chance we have of focusing our efforts on getting the crooks. That is something that our police are tasked with on our behalf every day. The opportunity to share this information and share its analysis and target our efforts will, I think, yield a significant dividend, not just in the area of policing but, more broadly, in the security responsibilities that we have as a national parliament and that the government has as an executive.


We are talking here about things that will put right these matters. The Australian Crime Commission has been forced to cut staff numbers from 688 to 556. That is almost 20 per cent. Another 100 officers seconded to the union from state and territory police forces have been returned home. Over the forward estimates for the ACC, Labor has cut more than eight per cent. On the issue of crime prevention, Labor's record also speaks volumes. These amendments would also permit the chief executive officer of the Crime Commission to share information with the private sector under certain circumstances, which is a worthy measure that is deemed necessary and appropriate. As with any organisation, transparency and accountability is a must, and that need could hardly be more pressing than in the area of crime prevention and law enforcement. This amendment will provide the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity with a contempt power, as well as enhancing the commission's ability to investigate corruption. The crux of this is to act as a deterrent for uncooperative witnesses and, where they arise, provide a quick and potent mechanism for the integrity commissioner to handle the situation and deal with it accordingly.


Furthermore, there are measures in this bill that aim to combat new and illicit substances that, sadly, have crept onto Australian streets with devastating consequences, substances like meow meow and Special K. As a father of two young girls—they are under five—I shudder to think what they will be exposed to by the time they enter their teenage years. Sadly, those threats, I am sure, will present themselves even before their teenage years. Staying on top of the quick movement of this is something that I will support strongly in this House. The amendment will clearly articulate the additional drug substances and quantities to be subject to the full range of Commonwealth serious drug offences. This bill should assist our Customs and Border Protection Service in intercepting and seizing illicit drugs detected at the Australian border, by overcoming an existing legal anomaly, allowing customs officers to seize all illicit drugs regardless of whether they are proscribed under customs regulations or the Criminal Code. Again, this goes to consolidation and consistencies. Our law enforcement agencies, officers in the Customs And Border Protection Service and the AFP perform a tremendous job under difficult circumstances, and it is important that we ensure that the law is there to support the work they do. This bill also makes amendments to Commonwealth parole. At present there is no ability to refuse parole to a federal offender who is serving a sentence of imprisonment of less than 10 years even if corrective services believe that the offender should not be granted parole. This bill's amendments will allow the release on parole of all federal offenders to become a discretionary decision consistent with the approach currently taken by the states and territories on the granting of parole. At present the maximum parole supervision for federal sentences other than life imprisonment is just three years.


This is a worthy bill. While it has been rushed into this place, it is an opportunity on this special day to recognise what is taking place even as we speak in New South Wales with the special march in the city of Sydney. Today is a day for police officers to stand tall and proud in New South Wales as they can all around the country. It is a day when their families can celebrate their service along with all the citizens of New South Wales and all of those who support their good works.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Murphy
):  Before I call the member for Fowler I take the opportunity to associate myself with the comments about police made by the honourable member for Cook. As late as last Friday, Minister Mike Gallacher and Commissioner Andrew Scipione visited the new, refurbished Burwood Police Station. I had the opportunity to speak to Commissioner Scipione, and on that occasion many laudatory statements were made about the fine work that he and Minister Mike Gallacher were doing. It was a welcome visit to my electorate. I thank the member for Cook.

"Hayes, Chris, MP",ALP,2012-03-01,"



Mr HAYES
 (Fowler) (12:11):  I would like also to follow in the same vein on this 150th anniversary of the New South Wales Police. I thank the member for Cook, whom I know is also the son of a police officer, for his very fine remarks. One thing I do know from growing up, particularly growing up in the back blocks of Sydney, is that it was not necessarily all that popular to boast that you were a son of a police officer in New South Wales. I also know that one of the things that really did differentiate policing and still does now is the reasons that people choose to wear the uniform of a police officer. I had occasion to ask my dad that once, but I will come back to that a little bit later.


I wanted to say that, in addition to being a son of a police officer, I have also had the opportunity over many years to represent police in every state and territory of this country as their advocate in various tribunals, which has given me a very broad insight into policing generally. One thing that does unite police officers—I have asked many in the witness box, 'Why did you choose to become a police officer?'—is that, oddly enough, they were almost the exact words that my dad said to me: they joined the police to make a difference. I think that is really what is the case. It did not matter when I started acting as advocate for police—in whatever state I was in, the men and women who take the responsibility of protecting our nation and ensuring there is safety on our streets were all motivated by one thing: making a difference.


I really think it takes a special type of person with, quite, frankly, a special courage to put their hand up to do that. It is a profession in itself that is much demeaned. I am sure nobody likes being pulled over. No-one likes to be cautioned. But, without people being so selfless as to go take on an occupation such as policing with a view to protecting our community, there would be anarchy. Police officers, quite frankly, are a microcosm of our greater community. They are the ones who uphold the law. Perhaps in many instances they may not like everything they have to do, but they get up, work their shifts, go out day or night and experience dangers and see various things out there that, thankfully, none of us here will probably ever have to experience in our lifetimes. And yet they do that.


Regrettably and unfortunately, it does take a toll on police officers. Across the nation we only hold our male police officers for 12½ years, which is a lot different from when Scott's and my dad were in the force. For female police officers it is about nine years. It is an occupation that has a very high burnout rate, and that is something we need to stay focused on. We need to protect the people who are protecting our community.


Andrew Scipione is a very good friend of mine, and he is doing a fantastic job as New South Wales Police Commissioner. He has been a very unifying force—and not in the New South Wales Police Force. I oversee the law enforcement committee, which oversees the Australian Crime Commission, so I have regular contact with all the police commissioners. I have seen the spirit of unification Andrew brings to that august body and his role in promoting the idea that you cannot have criminal loopholes because that migrates crime around the country. He is a strong believer in consistency and also in the profession of policing itself. To Andrew and all his colleagues, all the men and women of the New South Wales Police Force, I wish you well on the 150th anniversary of the force. I think Andrew did the right thing by bringing back the word 'force'. My dad, in his retirement, reeled when it became the police 'service'. He reckoned that was akin to it being the Public Service. He said the police must be a force to be reckoned with. Those sorts of comments have been put forward around the kitchen table to most of us who have grown up in police families.


It would be remiss of me not to take a moment to mention Scott Webber and the New South Wales Police Association, with whom I have had a very strong association for many years. They represent everyone from probationary constables to the Commissioner of Police. They do so properly, they do so with respect and dignity, and they put police officers in New South Wales first and foremost. I congratulate them and their members on the sterling job the association does in New South Wales.


This bill amends a number of criminal justice legislation aspects which need to be revised. In particular, it is critical for making sure we have contemporary methods to combat crime. Crime is not static; it is ever-changing. As a consequence, if we are going to empower those to whom we want to give responsibility for enforcing our laws, we as legislators must be vigilant in ensuring that they have the appropriate tools and regulatory support to do their jobs. The majority of the amendments before us deal with collecting and using DNA in criminal investigations and enshrining the protection of persons whose DNA samples are being investigated. These amendments will ensure our criminal legislation is effectively on par with the 2010 DNA forensic procedures review of the Crimes Act by Peter Ford. The amendments in the bill will ensure a more transparent and simplified process of collecting and using DNA forensic material in criminal matters. They will also ensure the protection of the privacy of all those involved in an investigation, particularly in relation to children.


It is critical to nail this down and get it right. I was around when the former government some time back, to their credit, brought in a national DNA database. The whole idea was to have national consistency associated with that. That was a very good thing; it is a very good policing tool. But it was highly regrettable when, in the Peter Falconio case, a person was swabbed and their DNA was collected in Adelaide and then it was found that it was not admissible in a court in the Northern Territory. Regrettably, although everyone left Canberra with their hands over their hearts saying we will have a national DNA database supported by consistent state and territory based regulation, the amount of customisation that occurred simply meant that the investigative procedures applicable in one state were inadmissible in another territory. That could have jeopardised a very serious murder investigation. In terms of policing generally, I do not think there is anyone in law enforcement now that would take their position that they are state rightists. As I said at the outset, crime is an export commodity. Criminals do not look at the Constitution, nor do they read a geographical map when they want to plan or commission crime. They certainly look for windows of opportunity. That is why we should strive to have national consistency in our laws when they relate to crime and to ensure that we do not provide incentives and opportunities for those who seek to profit from the misery of others by the commissioning of crime itself.


In terms of the issues about forensic materials, I think that is good. It certainly takes leadership and it will make a significant difference. In respect to schedule 2, the amendments to the Australian Crime Commission Act of 2002, the bill will ensure more efficient cooperation and sharing of information between the Australian Crime Commission; Commonwealth, state and territory agencies; and the private sector. The ACC CEO will be given the ability to share information with various industries exposed to serious and organised crime threats. This is very important in terms of the ACC and its extensive powers. It is a question of authority. It has very stringent standards put on it as to the security of its information and where it cannot be taken. However, to do its job effectively as our premier criminal intelligence agency, if you like, it must be in a position not only to notify and advise its partner groups, and each of the state and territory police agencies—Australian Taxation, Customs, et cetera—but also to actually advise organisations that are being infected or are highly suspected of being infected by serious and organised crime groups themselves. This will give the CEO of the Australian Crime Commission the protection and ability to do that.


I will be very brief in finishing up, because I know the minister is in here at the moment. In terms of extending the maximum term for the integrity commissioner, apart from being Chair of the Joint Standing Committee on Law Enforcement, I also sit on the Joint Standing Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity and I see firsthand the good work that Philip Moss, as Commissioner for Law Enforcement Integrity, and his team do. Some time ago, the committee unanimously moved that there should be an extension—that the government should give consideration to extending the term from a five-year to a seven-year appointment. That has occurred as a consequence of that recommendation; I am very pleased the minister took that up. Philip Moss, having initiated the procedures of the commission itself, has done much to set the framework of law enforcement integrity. We strongly support his activities and are particularly pleased that the minister has sought to pick up that recommendation. As I have been given the wind-up, I will hand over to the minister.

Mr CRAIG KELLY
 (Hughes) (12:23):  I will be very brief, because I know the importance of getting the Crimes Legislation Amendment (Powers and Offences) Bill 2011 through today. The coalition are glad to support these changes. One point worth mentioning about the bill is that it makes certain new drugs illegal. One particular drug is known as meow meow, which is actually mephedrone. This is a very dangerous drug which has resulted in over 100 deaths in the UK. Its current use is not illegal but this bill will make it illegal. It is very important that we have the legislative powers to act quickly so that any new drugs that come onto the system—our scene—that are very dangerous, like this new drug, can quickly be made illegal.


I would also like to congratulate our local superintendent of the Liverpool area, Ray King. He is doing a fantastic job cleaning up Liverpool. Ray was previously the superintendent who did the excellent work in Cabramatta using CCTV cameras. I would like to note that it was the coalition's commitment in 2010 to get three quarters of a million dollars to fund the CCTV cameras in the Hughes electorate and we hope that they can be put in soon. However, I would like to quickly express my disappointment that the government has been cutting back in many areas of our policing, particularly our customs service where we have seen reductions in the number of cargo screenings. This is very detrimental and makes Ray King's job on the streets of Liverpool all the more difficult. 


It is great to have these bills to increase the powers of our police, but we cannot at the same time be cutting back other areas of expenditure and customs, which we have seen this government doing, and also in the Australia Federal Police. We support the bill and we hope it gets through quickly.

 (Gellibrand—Attorney-General) (12:25):  In my speech in reply, I want to thank the previous speakers, particularly the member for Fowler, who significantly cut short his speech as have a number of members of the opposition. We are trying to make sure that this bill, with the amendments that were recommended by the committee, is able to be passed through the chamber today. I will say nothing in my summing up speech other than that I welcome the comments. I thank the house committee for its recommendations. I will, after the bill has been read a third time, move the amendments. There are a number which have been agreed to as recommended by the committee. I would like to note that my representative in the other place will go through in a little more detail why one of those recommendations unfortunately is not able to be picked up. We have had consultations with the opposition and I understand that they are supportive of that.

"O'Dwyer, Kelly, MP",LP,2012-03-01,"



Ms O'DWYER
 (Higgins) (12:41):  I am very keen to resume my discussion in the adjournment debate on a speech I delivered regarding the government's response to the Gonski report. Earlier this week I spoke in the chamber about some concerns I have with respect to what the government is not saying about the Gonski report. I want to continue by talking about the fact that the government has given very little indication as to how it is going to approach these very important educational issues, particularly with respect to funding. It is very likely that we will see a Henry tax review style of response, which means that the government will cherry-pick those aspects of the report that it wants and otherwise leave the rest of it gathering dust.


In considering this issue further I thought it very timely to reread the Prime Minister's maiden speech. After all, it was she who as education minister initiated the review and it will be she as Prime Minister who will have the final say in cabinet when they continue the future federal funding of education. The Prime Minister exclusively referred to her own personal story and the opportunities provided by Australia that 'would have been beyond my parents' understanding when they stepped off the boat in Adelaide in 1966'. The Prime Minister also said:


It would have been inconceivable to them that their child, and a daughter at that, could be offered the opportunity to obtain two degrees from a university and to serve in the nation's parliament.


Yet, in her next paragraph the Prime Minister refers to 'the inequality in our education system' and 'raising educational standards for all, not just the lucky few'. Indeed her maiden speech contains a great deal of what one would call good old-fashioned class rhetoric. She says that the people of Lalor, her electorate, 'have always had to try harder.' She also said that in Lalor 'there is a sense of community and a fighting spirit often missing from the sleeker suburbs'.


Whilst the Prime Minister did not specifically mention these so-called sleeker suburbs by name, she does mention my electorate of Higgins in a later paragraph. I would say to the Prime Minister that I invite her to come and meet the 108,000 people that make their homes within Higgins. I would invite her to meet with my constituents in suburbs such as Carnegie, Ashburton, Glen Iris, Malvern or Windsor. You will not find people who work harder or care for their community more than the people within the electorate of Higgins. Yet we see here that she is motivated instead by the idea that the government knows best. We saw that when the Prime Minister as shadow education minister drew up with Mark Latham a hit list on schools when it came to education funding.


I do agree with the Prime Minister, though, that education of our children is vital to the future of this country. However, in the absence of any clear response by the government to the Gonski review, I have many concerns. I am concerned that this government will focus on equality of outcomes, which inevitably means lowering of standards rather than equality of opportunity and raising of standards. I am concerned that this government will focus disproportionately on who operates the schools rather than on school outcomes. I am concerned that the lack of clarity over funding beyond the next year will have real implications for schools within Higgins as well as for schools right around the nation. Like business enterprises, social enterprises need certainty to plan and invest for the future. I am concerned that this government does not understand, let alone recognise, the invaluable contribution that parents and communities make to their schools, both government and non-government, by giving generously of their time, expertise and money. Further to this, I am concerned that by discouraging community investment in education the government will create a void that future governments could not hope to quantify, let alone fill. I am concerned that this government is focused on the method and process of funding, to the detriment of other vital educational issues such as teacher quality, parental engagement and school autonomy—all of which, of course, the recent report from the Grattan Institute said was absolutely vital in producing strong student outcomes.


Finally, I am ultimately concerned that this government is more focused on reducing numbers of children in non-government schools than on improving student outcomes in all schools. Currently government funding favours government schools, as it should. In fact, recent productivity figures indicate that non-government school students attract half the government subsidy of those children in government schools. If the federal government's response to the GFC had not been so ham-fisted and wasteful, current and future Australian governments would be in a far better position to increase funding to public education in a manner designed to improve outcomes. However, as we all know, this government has a solid and justifiable reputation for mismanagement, overpromising and underdelivering, to the detriment of all Australians.
