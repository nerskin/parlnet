"McClelland, Robert, MP",ALP,2003-03-03,"—The guarantee of 100 per cent of workers' entitlements in the event of company insolvency is one of the most important reforms yet to be undertaken by an Australian government. Few things are more important to workers who have lost their employment than ensuring they receive the full amount of their pay and legally accrued entitlements. These are often lost when they lose their jobs through the insolvency of their employer. The Employee Protection (Employee Entitlements Guarantee) Bill 2003, which I present to the House today on behalf of the member for Prospect, will secure the full payment of employee entitlements—such as unpaid wages, annual leave, long service leave and redundancy pay—in the case of corporate insolvency. The bill proposes that workers' entitlements be secured through a 0.1 per cent levy on pay-roll. Once again, as in the similar bill that was presented previously, small businesses will not have to meet this expense. Small businesses will have their entitlement costs covered directly by the federal government under this proposal so they will not beaffected by the 0.1 per cent levy. It will not at all be a burden to small businesses.
Since the member for Prospect last introduced this bill, the need for an alternative scheme to the Howard government's taxpayer funded GEERS has become even more apparent. Indeed, when former Minister Reith introduced the predecessor to GEERS, he promised it would only be an interim administrative measure while a better solution was found. Three years later, it is clear that the Howard government has given up and no such better solution has been found. It was promised almost 18 months ago that the government would rerank employee entitlements ahead of the debts to secured creditors—primarily, financial institutions—but, again, this has not occurred. Meanwhile, the Howard government's scheme will this year see a bill for $85 million being handed to taxpayers for lost entitlements to employees. Lost entitlements have often been the result of corporate mismanagement or, in certain circumstances, wrongdoing. This will provide comfort to those employers who continue to avoid securing the entitlements of their employees in the appropriate way, only to have those entitlements picked up by the taxpayers of Australia.
Earlier this year, Australian taxpayers witnessed Air New Zealand using the Howard government's scheme to justify its refusal to secure its Australian employees' entitlements. That is a common phenomenon, I might add, where corporations and liquidators of corporations dig into the public purse before they pursue a guarantee, for instance. Australian workers and their families are increasingly frustrated at having to go cap in hand to the Howard government under GEERS for their lost entitlements.
A recent report by the Auditor-General into the Howard government's scheme painted a sorry picture of incompetence and delay. Despite the Howard government's promise that 80 per cent of entitlements would be resolved within four months, it was found that barely half of the employees obtained their entitlements in that time, with one in five employees being forced to wait more than six months. To add insult to injury, the Howard government will not cover superannuation, will not cover redundancy above eight weeks and will not cover any redundancy pay for the four in 10 Tasmanian workers covered by state awards.
While the Howard government appears determined to defend the sacred right of corporate executives and only mouths any interest in reining in exorbitant executive salaries and severance payments, it is leaving Australian workers and their families in desperate situations with the loss of these important entitlements. There is no question that the Howard government's inadequate scheme is not meeting its task and is leaving taxpayers to foot the bill. Labor's bill is a positive alternative solution to protecting employee entitlements. I commend the bill to the House.

"O'Byrne, Michelle, MP",ALP,2003-03-03,"—I move:
That this House:
(1)	acknowledges that medical practices and individual general practitioners are advising veteran patients that they will no longer be able to recognise the gold card when charging them for medical services;
(2)	acknowledges that veterans are entitled to receive adequate and appropriate medical care in view of their service to this country;
(3)	notes that many practices and practitioners, in particular those with a high percentage of veteran patients, are struggling to provide acceptable levels of medical care and service, given the rebates and fees currently available to them; and
(4)	calls upon the Government immediately to negotiate with medical practitioners to ensure that an appropriate agreement is in place to enable doctors to provide adequate levels of care to gold card recipients.
—Is the motion seconded?
—I second the motion and reserve my right to speak.
—Those who have volunteered or have been required to serve our country in armed conflict are very special Australians. They have been prepared to risk their lives and the livelihoods of their own families to defend our land and to protect the rest of us. They have ensured that we have been able to enjoy the democratic and independent lives that Australia provides us with today, and we owe each and every veteran a very special debt. Whilst it is appropriate that we honour them and remember those who have gone before on occasions such as Anzac Day and Remembrance Day, we must recognise that they should also have other rights and other privileges—and these are not tokens. They are practical acknowledgments on a day-to-day basis that our war veterans and those they have left behind are entitled to some benefits in recognition of their sacrifice and, in the case of many of them, because they have special needs arising from that very sacrifice.
Over the last six months, veterans all over Australia have begun to receive notification from their general practitioners and medical practices that they are no longer able to recognise the gold card, that preciously regarded symbol that shows Australians do care about those who have served us in times of conflict. The gold card is more than just an entitlement to be bulk-billed for medical care. To veterans, it is their contract with the rest of the Australian people, the material recognition that we do acknowledge what they have done for us. In some cases, the doctor's advice has been that the change will be effected immediately, whilst, in the majority of cases, it has taken the form of advance notice of future implementation a few weeks or perhaps a few months later. The practical effect of this is that veterans now have to make a contribution to the cost of their basic medical care. They may also be faced with additional cash flow problems by having to pay the full account prior to receiving reimbursement and/or additional paperwork, postage costs et cetera. This is the result of laziness, indifference and a lack of understanding by a miserly government hell-bent on looking after the top end of town at the expense of our servicemen and our servicewomen. 
The question that we are bound to ask now is: how has this come about? The answer is twofold. Firstly, it is clear that this government does not care about the veteran community. It has allowed the worth of the gold card to diminish. It has also taken hours of home care away from veterans and war widows, forcing them to reconsider their independent lifestyles and look at joining already bursting queues for aged care places. I know my colleague the member for Braddon has been approached by many people who have really suffered through this miserly cut. Secondly, this government has not acted fairly or responsibly in dealing with the medical profession on this issue. Three years ago, the government entered into a memorandum of understanding with the medical profession for the provision of medical services to our veterans. Under the arrangement, the doctors agreed to incorporate health care plans, health assessments and medication re-evaluations in return for an increase in the basic fee. They did so in anticipation of a further improvement in fees when the memorandum was renegotiated. The deal meant that doctors would get $29.45 for a standard consultation with a veteran patient. This is $8.60 less than what they get for seeing a pensioner or a health care card holder. 
Apart from the fact that doctors receive less when seeing a veteran patient, they are also expected to do more. There is more often than not additional paperwork, completion of D904 forms to get access services, authorities et cetera. Under the old arrangement, the Department of Veterans' Affairs used to pay doctors within 12 days or pay interest. Now doctors say that their payment is via a Medicare type reimbursement, usually taking a minimum of six weeks. Doctors say that they remain prepared to subsidise the treatment of veterans to a reasonable degree. They say they have done so willingly for many years. This is done, in effect, by cross subsidy from income from fee paying patients.
Three years on from the signing of the memorandum, where do we find ourselves? What has happened is that, after the agreement's expiry date and with no new deal in sight, doctors were given an ultimatum to sign up for an extension of the old deal with no increase in fees. If they did not sign, they receive even less—a fee of just $25.65, almost exactly half the fee which they receive for a normal consultation. The medical profession says that it needs a substantially better deal not only because it has not had an indexed increase over the past three years but because it has also faced greater pressures and costs through medical indemnity, accreditation documentation and the requirements of the Privacy Act.
Most importantly, where does this leave our ex-service men and women? First and foremost, it leaves them angry. Rightly or wrongly, they believe that they were promised that they would be looked after. Whether they were or not, I—and I am sure that most other Australians would join with me—feel that they are entitled to have this expectation. Veteran patients tend to attend doctors more often for a variety of reasons, most of them obvious. If the average number of attendances at the doctor per annum is seven, then for a veteran it is 10. For many individuals, of course, it is even more than that.
The reality is that many veterans, in anticipation of continuing to receive a fair deal from the government, dropped out of private health cover. They have budgeted for their future lives and retirements accordingly. The majority of veterans are happy with their general practitioners. They feel comfortable that they are seeing a doctor or a practice who knows their personal medical history and their circumstances well. They do not want to change to another doctor. It may be hard for them to even travel to get to another practice. And this is where our next problem arises. The answer given to those veterans who contact the Department of Veterans' Affairs about the advice they have received from their doctor is that they should simply change to a practitioner who will recognise the gold card. A veterans advocate from my electorate has been told on several occasions by the department that it has a list of those practitioners who are continuing to recognise the gold card, yet it refuses to provide him with access to that list. What is the point of having a list if we cannot actually see it?
Apart from that, the reality is that most doctors—certainly those where I come from—simply cannot take on any more patients. Whether they be veterans, pensioners or fully privately covered fee payers, the lists are closed. It is a nonsense to say that the solution is simply to shop around until you can find a doctor who will accept a gold card. What happens six months later when that doctor faces the same pressures already faced by his or her colleagues? It should not be necessary for our servicemen and servicewomen to look further than their preferred doctor of choice. I have been made aware of cases where local practices are so overloaded that veterans have to travel to the next town for their treatment and then they are denied travelling allowance because they apparently could have seen a doctor in their own town.
Some practices and practitioners have substantial numbers and percentages of veterans as patients. The impact for them of a government indifferent to their situation and the entitlements of veterans can be extremely significant. I am advised that some 2,500 doctors out of 14,000 have not signed the government's unilateral contract extension. The real question is whether this 2,500 includes many of those who are currently shouldering the heaviest load. I suspect, particularly in regional communities, that that is the case. I am becoming convinced that this government has no concept of how great the discontent amongst veterans and their families is, and how big these problems are becoming for our community.
I want to acknowledge, in particular, those medical practitioners who are continuing to recognise the gold card in return for the measly reimbursement they get from this stingy government. They are doing the right and proper thing. It is costing them a bit of money, but they are decent community people who are trying to do the best for the people who they care for and for the people they represent. This government, however, is not. Unless it changes soon, this government's attitude to this issue will devalue the gold card to a level where it is meaningless or worthless. That is the message we are sending to our veteran community—that the services we provide you can be diminished at any time. This ought to be unacceptable to any Australian.
I have no doubt that the government's response is probably going to come out something along the lines of: `Oh, well, we cannot afford it.' But, I believe—and, once again, I am sure that this is a feeling held by the majority of Australians, except perhaps the minister responsible—that we cannot afford not to do it. We cannot afford to walk away from these people. For me, some things that are the responsibility of the Commonwealth government are simply non-negotiables. The provision of basic support services to our returned servicemen and servicewomen is one of those things. I ask that the House note these sad developments and implore the government to act to redress the situation without delay. Without action one of the fundamental pillars on which citizenship and the national spirit of this country have been built will be seriously undermined.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Veterans: Gold Card</title>,Private Members' Business,2,1,speech
"Scott, Bruce, MP",NP,2003-03-03,"—I rise to speak on the private members' business today. I do so with the background of having been the minister responsible for veterans for some six years up until the last election. Firstly, I want to say that I take issue with the member who has just spoken when she said that this government does not care about veterans. It is a very cheap political shot and she should know better than to say that this government does not care. I have always taken the position that both sides of the parliament care about the way we look after our veterans. We have always sought to bring a bipartisan debate into this parliament and I have always taken the point that, if anyone wants to use the veteran community as a political football, they stand condemned—not only by this parliament but also by the wider population.
I want to acknowledge those doctors out there who do a wonderful job and recognise the service of this very special group of Australians. I have spoken to many of them during my time in this place who see veterans and war widows as very special people. These doctors know that in so many instances they themselves would not be practising in Australia today, in this lucky country in which we all live, had it not been for the service and the sacrifice of our veterans. They are also aware of all of those who have been left behind because of death in war, and those who subsequently returned to Australia with disabilities. I, and so many people, acknowledge the work that doctors do in caring for our veteran community.
I think it is important to outline in this debate what the gold card does bring, because it does bring many benefits to our veteran community. It brings the choice of doctor; private patient hospital care in public hospitals and contracted private hospitals; and pharmaceuticals at a concessional rate. To the veterans with this eligibility, it brings optical care, physiotherapy, dental care, podiatry care and products, as well as chiropractic services.
In 1999, when I was minister, we extended the gold card automatically to our Second World War veterans who were over the age of 70 years who had qualifying service. We did that in recognition that as veterans grow older there is going to be an increasing demand for health services from them. We believed it was important that the Second World War veterans with qualifying service should receive this gold card eligibility. Prior to the last federal election, we announced that we would be making a further automatic extension of the gold card to veterans who have qualifying service from any theatre of conflict to those over the age of 70 years. I am very pleased to see that we have been able to achieve that core commitment that we gave in this parliament to the veteran community. I want to point out that the gold card is not available only through the automatic extension which is granted by government. There are many veterans out there who have received the gold card on the basis of their disabilities or their service and war widows who have received an automatic entitlement.
I went looking through the Labor Party's policy prior to the last election to see what they said about the gold card. It is important that we contrast what members from the other side of the House are saying now with what they said prior to the last federal election. We need to look at the scrutiny they get from the electorate and make sure that they remain under scrutiny for what they said in terms of commitments prior to the last federal election.
A moment ago I mentioned war widows. Prior to the last federal election, we announced that the government would be extending the gold card to war widows who had remarried prior to 1983—in other words, to war widows who remarried and lost their war widow status and therefore their gold card. We acknowledged that as another one of those anomalies we had to address when we came into government. I am pleased to see that those war widows, who had done no more than remarry prior to 1983, are again able to receive the gold card and all the benefits that go with it. I then pursued the matter by looking at what Labor said prior to the last federal election about the automatic extension of the gold card to war widows. I did not find a single mention of war widows in the policy they took to the last federal election—in other words, they did not acknowledge the existence of some 108,000 war widows who were eligible for veterans' entitlements. The members on the other side of the House should acknowledge that not only have we extended the gold card to veterans with qualifying service and those with levels of disability but we have also extended it to those who remarried prior to 1983. When the members on the other side of the House come into this place they should check their own policy prior to the last federal election, rather than try to create a political debate and put at the centre of that debate a vast number of very special people in our community: the veterans and war widows of our nation.
I mentioned a moment ago that there are other ways to get a gold card—other than having eligibility extended automatically by legislation. For instance, gold card eligibility is available to those veterans who served in East Timor or Afghanistan. As part of the deployments on those operations, service men and women know that they will be eligible for the gold card upon their return to Australia. I know that the gold card is valued not only by veterans over the age of 70 but also by those deployed into hostile environments, such as the two I mentioned. Not only the service men and women themselves but also their families acknowledge the value of the gold card, which underpins the health care of veterans by covering them for any condition they may suffer as a result of their service, including to East Timor and Afghanistan.
I want to touch on some of the initiatives of the federal government since it was elected in 1996. Those initiatives include not only the extension of the gold card but also payments to the service personnel and civilians who were held prisoner by the Japanese during World War II, and to their surviving widows. The veterans who were interned by the Japanese, or their surviving widows, receive from this government a one-off ex gratia payment of $25,000. Once again, this was long overdue but it was achieved by this federal government. Even that very point should demonstrate to the other side of the House that this government does care about veterans, and it will continue to care about how it looks after our veterans. This government will also continue to make sure that it always errs on the side of generosity. I ask the members on the other side of the House to acknowledge what this government has done and to make sure that they do not use the veteran community as a political football in debates in this place. I thank the parliament.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Veterans: Gold Card</title>,Private Members' Business,2,1,speech
"Hall, Jill, MP",ALP,2003-03-03,"—Before starting my speech, I would like to address a couple of points the member for Maranoa made in his speech. Firstly and most importantly, the Labor Party's policy prior to the last election was to ensure that the gold card remained valuable to every veteran in our community. We appreciate how important the gold card is to all veterans throughout Australia and we know that its strength comes from its acceptance by GPs and specialists. Our policy prior to the last election was to ensure that that continued. The previous speaker also took offence at the criticism by the member for Bass of the Howard government's treatment of veterans. I say to the honourable member that the proof is in the pudding. In this case, the fact that many veterans' doctors have stopped accepting the gold card is proof that the government has failed veterans.
The government promised to support veterans and to deliver the care and services that veterans deserve and have earned through their contributions to Australia's safety. Instead of fulfilling this promise to veterans, the Howard government has let a situation develop where many GPs and specialists are no longer accepting the gold card and are charging veterans for basic health care. We on this side of the House say that is not good enough. We say to the Howard government that it should act now and fix this because that is what the Australian community expects and it is what the veterans in our community expect. All Australians know that veterans have higher health care needs. That is one of the effects of war. That is the legacy that protecting Australia has left them. As a country, we should make sure that veterans are taken care of. We now have a situation where the government has failed to negotiate an agreement with doctors—and that is unacceptable.
Out of 14,000 GPs, 2,500 are no longer accepting the gold card. That is unacceptable, as is the fact that the agreement ran out on 13 December last year and the government has failed to renegotiate it—and will not even consider renegotiating it until the end of June. The current agreement runs until 31 June and, although a number of doctors have agreed to extend it, a number have also refused to enter into any agreement with the government to extend it, simply because they do not trust the government. Out of those who have not agreed to extend the agreement, quite a few are still accepting the gold card, but they are doing so at a greatly reduced rate—a fee reduced to 85 per cent plus 60c.
This is not a government that is committed to caring for veterans. If it were, it would have seen that its highest priority was getting a new agreement in place. I attended a forum in the electorate of the member for Bass, and this was the No. 1 issue for veterans there. They were very unhappy with the government. They had been told by the department that there was a list—a list that none of them could manage to get their hands on—that could tell them which doctors were or were not accepting the gold card. Doctors and veterans alike are very unhappy with the government in this area. Veterans do not need inquiries like the one that produced the Clarke report, which actually recommended that the gold card be means tested, something I acknowledge the government has rejected. Veterans do not need inquiries and reports like that, and they do not need procrastination; what they do need is a government that ensures they have the medical support and services they need. They need a government that will immediately negotiate a new agreement with the doctors, thereby ensuring that the value of the gold card is not eroded, as it has been, and that our veterans get the medical treatment that Australia expects for them.

"Washer, Dr Mal, MP",LP,2003-03-03,"—I am delighted that the member for Bass wishes this House to acknowledge that veterans are entitled to receive adequate and appropriate medical care, in view of their services to this country. It is a happy occasion when both sides of the House agree. It is precisely because the government does believe firmly that veterans are entitled to receive adequate and appropriate medical care that significant improvements have been made to veterans' entitlements since the coalition took office in 1996.
In the last seven years, this coalition government has increased the Veterans' Affairs budget from $6.2 billion to $9.2 billion. The government has introduced a range of initiatives and benefits to compensate veterans for their sacrifices and to commemorate their dedication and bravery. The veteran community in Australia deserves our recognition and support. It deserves a properly funded system that offers appropriate care and compensation, and the coalition government has provided these. By increasing the Veterans' Affairs budget by $3 billion over the past seven years, the coalition government has quite publicly made clear its support for, and commitment to, our veteran community.
The gold card remains the mainstay of the repatriation health system. More than a quarter of a million ex-service men and women are gold card holders. These men and women have given selflessly to their country in wars and conflicts, and the gold card represents an assurance that they will have access to medical treatment for all conditions, whether they are related to war service or not. For some time the gold card has been an automatic entitlement for our former prisoners of war, as well as for recipients of totally and permanently incapacitated pensions and for war widows, in recognition of their greater health needs. Since 1996 the federal government has recognised the growing health needs of other veterans as they grow older. In 1999 the government extended the gold card to Australian veterans and mariners aged 70 or over with qualifying service from World War II. In July last year, the government extended the gold card even further to cover all Australian veterans aged 70 or over with qualifying service from any conflict. So, as I said earlier, the gold card is the mainstay of the repatriation health system. That is still most definitely the case.
The vast majority of doctors throughout Australia are continuing to treat gold card holders. The publicity suggesting that this is not so is at best misleading and at worst alarmist. This misinformation is causing a great deal of unnecessary distress and concern among members of the veteran community, who are being misled into believing that their health care is being compromised. This is not the case. Statistics can prove anything. It depends entirely on how you interpret them and what background information you have. The comedian Dave Allen once pointed out that one in 10 motor accidents was caused by drink-driving. He observed that that meant that nine out of 10 motor accidents were caused by sober drivers and asked who, therefore, posed the greater risk. Of course, commonsense prevails, and we know that drink-driving on our roads is far more lethal than driving sober. You can turn statistics on their head and make them prove almost anything.
It is the same with the publicity surrounding the gold card and the supposed refusal of certain doctors to recognise it. The claim that 2,000 letters that were not responded to represented 2,000 doctors withdrawing from the gold card system is quite untrue. The following are the facts. The structure of fees paid to local medical officers—LMOs—was made under a memorandum of understanding between the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the AMA. With the memorandum of understanding due to run out in December last year, the process to negotiate a new agreement began. When it became clear that a new agreement would not be in place by the expiry date of the old agreement, the department sent out 15,000 letters to individual doctors and to practices where doctors had billed the department during the previous 12 months. The letter offered doctors the opportunity to extend their current contracts to 30 June 2003. Doctors were not asked to respond, other than to take up the offer and extend their contracts. The mailing list was not completely up to date. How many mailing lists are? How many members have received an electoral roll update or done a mail-out within the electorate, only to find dozens of letters returned, although the information is allegedly current? So it is with the doctors. Many of these letters would have gone to practices that were no longer open, as some doctors would have died, retired or moved overseas.

"Sidebottom, Sid, MP",ALP,2003-03-03,"—Contrary to the member for Maranoa's comments earlier that raising issues on veterans' affairs is making a political football out of a very special group of people, I believe that in actual fact it is our responsibility to raise issues related to veterans' affairs. If we believe that the system is not doing the right thing by veterans, then we will raise that issue. It is not a matter of this being a political football; it is a matter of our responsibilities. Unlike my friend the member for Moore, for whom I have the highest regard, I think that there is an ongoing crisis in veterans health concerning the use of the gold card, despite the minister's assurances. It cannot be denied. It is affecting veterans across Australia—particularly in my electorate of Braddon and also, as I know from my colleague at the table, in the electorate of Bass.
The Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 enables the provision of full health care benefits—which are administered through the Local Medical Officer Scheme—to certain veterans, widows and orphaned children who may qualify under the VEA. The Department of Veterans' Affairs treatment population of gold card holders is currently 334,442 persons. The gold card crisis continues to worsen, as was clearly and publicly played out on our TV screens recently, with 2,000 GPs—no matter how the member for Moore wants to explain the statistics—refusing to respond to the DVA's proposed extension to their agreements to provide services to gold card holders until 30 June 2003.
The DVA, along with the government, continues to reassure the Australian public that there is good coverage of GPs who extend services to veterans who hold a gold card; however, if you looked at the latest bulk-billing data, you would find this very difficult to believe. Since the Howard government came to office, bulk-billing has fallen 11 per cent, with a 5.6 per cent fall in the past year alone. As a result of this, many veterans and widows have been forced to travel further, at additional cost, to find a new doctor—particularly rural veterans and widows, who must travel greater distances for specialist services, such as orthopedics.
Currently, only 69.6 per cent of GP services are bulk-billed. While the rate of bulk-billing has declined by 11 per cent, the average copayment for someone seeing a GP has increased from $8.32 in 1996 to $12.57 today—an increase of more than 50 per cent. It is a fact that a number of GPs have refused to offer services to veterans who hold a gold card. Increasingly, more GPs state that, unless an acceptable offer is made to them by 30 June 2003, they will also cease to extend services to gold card holders. The reason is simple: they will go broke. Other GPs who have elected not to re-sign their agreements have extended their services to veteran patients at a reduced fee of 85 per cent plus 60c.
For the first time it appears that veterans may have to start paying out of their own pockets for their medical care. We now know that about 15 per cent of GPs who have been involved in this scheme to look after veterans free of charge have pulled out of the scheme. The fee has now been set at an unrealistically low level; it has literally not kept up with the pace of providing medical services. More and more doctors are finding that they are not able to give veterans the care that they need for this unrealistically low fee. Unless this government renegotiates a realistic agreement with doctors, I have concerns that this scheme will fall over.
Despite constant denials by the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the Veterans' Home Care Scheme has been cut. In my electorate of Braddon more than 300 veterans have been affected, with funding cut by one-third. In many cases the services have been reduced by half. I first highlighted these cuts to the home care scheme back in October last year, when my office was inundated with calls from veterans disappointed and angry that they had been notified that their services had been cut. In more recent times, veterans living in the electorate of Bass were sent similar notification.
I noticed in today's Examiner that the minister tried to defend the situation of veterans home care services being cut. It did nothing more than act as a red herring. Veterans are having their services cut by stealth, and it is a crisis in terms of the gold card and the provision of GP services. To raise this is not political meandering; it is our responsibility as an opposition. I hope that the government responds effectively to this very important and valued group of individuals in our community.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Veterans: Gold Card</title>,Private Members' Business,2,1,speech
"Johnson, Michael, MP",LP,2003-03-03,"—I am delighted to speak on the motion today, and I compliment the member for Bass for raising an issue that is important in the community. Of course, I very strongly disagree with the opposition that this government is not one that cares strongly about a very important group in our community. In the electorate of Ryan, where I have the great privilege to be the federal member, we have a veteran community of some 3,000 people. I consider it a great privilege to be able to engage and consult with them and discuss issues like this.
Before I go on to more substantive matters, I will mention that in my electorate of Ryan the RSL sub-branches—in particular the Sherwood-Indooroopilly RSL sub-branch, the Centenary RSL sub-branch, the Toowong RSL sub-branch, the Kenmore-Moggill RSL sub-branch and The Gap RSL sub-branch—have members with a particular interest in this topic. Indeed, I had the great pleasure of talking with them just in the last week about this very important issue. I am delighted to say to the government and to this House that they are very pleased with the government's position and the department's support of them. The Howard government believes very strongly, of course, that the veteran community of this country deserves the nation's applause and the government's full and generous support. The gold card remains very strongly the mainstay of our care for them, and it remains the mainstay of the repatriation health system.
The gold card is held by some 300,000 men and women who make up a very special group of our community, as all of us in this chamber would agree. For some time the gold card has been an automatic entitlement for our former prisoners of war, for our totally and permanently incapacitated pension recipients and for our war widows in recognition of their greater health needs. I mentioned war widows, and it is interesting to note that, in the former opposition leader's plans for the veterans in our community, there was no reference whatsoever to war widows. That is an astonishing point and, indeed, a glaring error on the opposition's part.
Since 1996 the Howard government has recognised very strongly the growing health care needs of our veterans. In 1999 the government extended the gold card to Australian veterans and mariners aged 70 or over with qualifying service from World War II. In July 2002 the Howard government extended the gold card further, to cover all Australian veterans aged 70 or over with qualifying service from any conflict. The gold card represents an assurance that Australian veterans and war widows will have access to treatment for all conditions, whether or not they are related to war service.
Nothing has changed, contrary to the provocative language of the opposition. The overwhelming majority of doctors are continuing to treat gold card holders, and I encourage that small group of doctors who are not doing so to engage in care for our veterans—to respect and salute their contribution to our nation. There is a handful who have declined to do this, but this is a small minority. The overwhelming majority of doctors do this, and they do this in my electorate as well. They are very strongly supportive of the veterans in our community. The Department of Veterans' Affairs has received some complaints from a relatively small number of veterans that doctors have refused to accept the gold card. It is important to put this in perspective; it is important to get the context right. It is only a small group. In those cases, the department is ensuring that the veterans are getting the care they need and that I know all members of this parliament acknowledge they need.
The publicity that has been generated around this issue is highly irresponsible and highly provocative. It is not the way to address this issue. There are better ways of doing it, and I think it is important not to cause unnecessary alarm or stress to an important part of our community. I want to reassure the veterans of our community and the veterans in my electorate of Ryan that this government has the utmost respect and compassion for them. That goes particularly to war widows, an area that has been ignored by the opposition. It is very important that they are fully aware that this government has them at the top of the list in terms of their care in this community. Gold card holders have access to a range of health care, including community nursing, allied health, dental, podiatry and other services. The area of services they have access to is not restricted, and this government's support for them is very strong indeed.

"Mossfield, Frank, MP",ALP,2003-03-03,"—I rise to speak about the Clarke review into veterans' entitlements and in particular about chapter 16 and recommendation No. 45. It was extremely pleasing to read the following:
The committee recommends that: participation by Australian Defence Force personnel in the British atomic tests be declared non-warlike hazardous and that the legislation be amended to ensure that this declaration can have effect in extending VEA coverage.
This is the eighth time I have raised in this place the issue of the victims of atomic tests and their search for just treatment. Finally it seems that somebody has listened. At present, each new illness suffered by an atomic test victim has to be linked to the tests with a new round of doctors visits, specialists visits, paperwork and stress and drama.
If this recommendation is adopted, these victims will be entitled to a gold card and will get the medical treatment they need when they need it without the anguish and stress induced by the former procedures. These soldiers, sailors and airmen were used as human guineapigs. Everybody knows that, just as everybody knows that the reason these men and women have medical problems is that they were needlessly exposed to radiation from the atomic blasts. The Clarke review has recommended that we acknowledge their service and treat them with dignity and justice. It is now imperative that the government act quickly on this recommendation. I call on the minister to provide the victims of this terrible chapter in Australia's history the justice they deserve.

Our first priority ... will be to tackle the current account deficit'. Prime Minister, isn't it a fact that today's figures prove that the foreign debt, at $354 billion, and the current account deficit, at $11.5 billion, are both at the highest levels ever recorded?

"Howard, John, MP",LP,2003-03-03,"—I thank the Leader of the Opposition for reminding me and reminding the House that today is the seventh anniversary of the election of the government. It gives me an opportunity to say something of what this government have achieved. I will take advantage of the opportunity that the Leader of the Opposition has afforded to me. I would have said something to that effect about the current account. I have not looked at the exact words, but of course I would have. I would have also said something about reducing unemployment. I am proud to say to the House that in the time that we have been in government we have generated 1.3 million more jobs in the Australian economy.
I think also I would have said something about interest rates. You do not hear a lot about interest rates from the Australian Labor Party. I am very proud to say that in the time that we have been in government we have reduced the average monthly repayment on a housing loan in this country by a figure of between $300 and $400 a month—a remarkable achievement. Whereas when Labor were in office, including the Leader of the Opposition, the then government used to boast about how they had reduced the real wages of Australian workers, I am very proud to say that in the seven years that we have been in government we have presided over a significant increase in the real wages and the disposable income of Australian workers. The workers' party opposite boasted about cutting the wages of workers. I am proud to report that we have boosted the wages of workers in the time that I have been in office.
The Leader of the Opposition also invites me to say something about debt. I am very proud to remind the Australian Labor Party, to remind the House and, particularly, to remind the Leader of the Opposition that by the end of this financial year the net federal government debt to GDP will be three per cent. That compares with an average of about 49 per cent for all the countries of the OECD, 47 per cent for the United States and 79 per cent for Japan. The strength of the Australian economy now is more evident, more real, more broadly based, more widespread and more internationally recognised than at any time since the late 1960s. Also take into account symbolically that we have recovered our AAA credit rating. When did we lose that? We lost that at the time of the then described banana republic, in the words of the former Treasurer and fellow Prime Minister Mr Keating.

"Ruddock, Philip, MP",LP,2003-03-03,"—I thank the honourable member for Dobell for his question. I know that he is vitally interested in regional migration, representing as he does a very important regional area in New South Wales. He is very much aware, as I am sure most members are, that this government has had a record second to none in relation to obtaining a better dispersal of the migration outcome. In fact, over the last four years or so about 17,000 people have been influenced by the range of programs and initiatives that have been put in place to obtain that outcome.
From 1 March this year the government introduced new business migration criteria to enable greater regional dispersal of business migrants. This initiative has as its key state sponsorship. It provides an opportunity to link prospective business migrants to state-specific economic and development objectives. It improves linkages with state and territory business services to help them successfully establish business ventures. In essence, this measure gives the states greater influence over the number and nature of business migrants who settle within their jurisdictions. Mr Speaker and colleagues, I want to assure you that this innovative approach is one which we will continue to implement, particularly with the assistance of state governments.
—Under the provisions of standing order 304A, the member for McMillan will excuse himself from the House.
The member for McMillan then left the chamber.
—A good deal of interest has been expressed by state governments in working with us on these initiatives. One state that has particularly expressed a degree of interest in these matters is a state that has argued that the immigration program is much larger than it ought to be. In New South Wales the Premier has argued over a long period that Sydney is overburdened by migration and that, as a result, he wants to see a smaller program in New South Wales. He has gone out and argued for that. I met with him last year and I said to him, `I want to work with you on these issues. If there are too many people coming to Sydney, you ought to be working with these initiatives that will get a better dispersal of the migration program and you ought to be encouraging me in looking for as many—and as innovative—ways of achieving that as possible.' What have I heard since that time? There have been a number of meetings, but as I put items for discussion on the agenda he knocks them off.
One of the things that has particularly surprised me is that the New South Wales government wants to be schizophrenic about development. On the one hand it argues that it wants Sydney to be a financial hub and on the other hand it argues that it should be a centre for regional headquarters. But you can do that without people. You can have it as a financial hub and you can have it as a regional headquarters, but you can do it without people. In fact, the only area of the migration program in which Premier Carr has expressed any interest in cutting back is skilled migration. The reality of that is that, even if people have established businesses in Sydney, they are not going to stop bringing in people to do the work that is necessary; they are still going to bring them in, even if they have to bring them from interstate. It will not stop the impact of people in Sydney.
The one area in which the state could have an influence is in relation to other areas of migration. It could, if it wished, focus on, say, enhanced sponsorship arrangements for family migrants if they were prepared to settle regionally as against in New South Wales or Sydney. That measure would have an impact, but I suspect he thinks it would have an impact upon the intentions of voters in the New South Wales election—because sponsors have votes. It really means that Premier Carr is out there arguing, day after day, that you could have some impact on the inability of New South Wales to deal with planning issues and the needs and aspirations of the people of Sydney by reducing migration overall; but, when he is asked to put up in relation to initiatives that could produce an effective dispersal of migration in Sydney, he runs away from them.",REPS,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Immigration</title>,Questions Without Notice,7,1,answer

That this House:
(1)	notes that the percentage of Australian children who are overweight or obese is increasing; and
(2)	commits itself to promoting measures to increase fitness and encourage healthy lifestyles.
Obesity is increasing in Australian children. Almost one in four children is overweight or obese. The numbers of overweight and obese children have increased substantially in recent years, and the health effects for those children as they grow into adulthood are very serious indeed. Of course, we do not want to cause a panic and we do not want to stigmatise overweight children, or overweight people generally, nor contribute to societal pressures which lead other young people to eating disorders such as anorexia or bulimia, but somewhere there has to be a healthy middle ground. As a community, we have to encourage healthier exercise and eating habits and teach our children good habits for the future.
Recent studies looking at adults estimate that 67 per cent of Australian men and 52 per cent of Australian women aged 25 years and over are overweight or obese. It is no wonder then that between 19 and 23 per cent of children, depending on age, are overweight or obese. In the 10-year period from 1985 to 1995, the level of combined overweight and obese children in Australia has more than doubled, whilst the level of obesity tripled in all age groups for both sexes. Obesity costs the whole community due to the increased health costs of associated illnesses and of course the lost productivity also associated with that ill health. Estimates for 1995-96, which are the most recent ones I could lay my hands on, suggest that the cost of obesity to the Australian community is between $680 million and $1.239 billion per annum—very substantial costs indeed. This is a phenomenon that is not limited to Australia and is evident in most developed countries, where the availability of high-calorie foods combined with decreased activity has led to similar outcomes as those here. We are second only to the US, though, in those levels of the overweight and obese. I think that this needs looking at, because countries such as the Netherlands that have similar levels of societal wealth have not seen obesity increase to the same extent.
Children themselves identify the greatest immediate problem associated with obesity as the teasing and social isolation that they face. We have to stop that teasing, but the other effects are equally serious and not as readily identified by the children themselves. The sorts of effects I am talking about are gastrointestinal illnesses, endocrine illnesses or certain orthopaedic problems that children of normal weight are not as likely to develop. Type 2 diabetes, which used to be called late onset diabetes, is becoming evident in adolescence earlier and earlier. Overweight children and obese children are more likely to grow into overweight or obese adults, and there are any number of associated ill health effects that I am sure most of us are aware of.
The New South Wales government took this issue very seriously and instituted a New South Wales Childhood Obesity Summit in September last year. I believe the Victorian government also had a similar summit. The communique from the New South Wales government summit is very well worth reading. It lays out any number of very sensible suggestions for dealing with this problem. It is very important that governments of all levels work with parents and schools to help children develop healthy eating and exercise habits. The best way to do that is for whole families to gradually change the way they eat and the sorts of recreational activities they pursue. To make changes that benefit whole families, firstly we need to help parents better balance work and family. The growth in overtime, particularly unpaid overtime, means that parents have much less time to take kids to sport, to sport practice and to sporting events on the weekend. On the weekends parents are catching up with grocery shopping and cleaning, which means that they are also not able to participate in active recreation with their children. So a cut back in unpaid overtime and making sure that families actually have reasonable time for recreation is probably the first and most important thing that we as governments can do to support families in changing the way they recreate.
We should also consider making it easier for families to afford to have their kids in sporting activities. A lot of families cannot afford the registration and the gear that goes along with joining the local soccer club. We should examine ways of making those sports more affordable, including perhaps looking at exemption from the GST as something to consider. Secondly, governments need to participate in making neighbourhoods safer. Obviously parents who are worried about their children walking to school or playing unsupervised after school are much more likely to drive kids to school or discourage them from riding bikes. This is the way that most people used to get their regular exercise—just walking to school. It is something that a lot of young children are missing out on today. Governments can help with this by improving urban design and by supporting safety house programs, neighbourhood centres and youth services which provide supervised play. Local councils can help support setting up groups for children to walk to school together.
Thirdly, as parents we can turn off the electronic babysitter. There is no question that children who watch a lot of TV are more likely to develop weight problems. Data from the New South Wales Child Health Survey 2001 found that 40 per cent of children aged five to 12 years watched about two hours or more of television or videos a day on average, and 15 per cent reported playing computer games for an hour or more a day on average. A lot of those kids are also snacking in front of the TV. When they are doing that they are more likely to eat more and to eat less healthy foods, especially because of the barrage of advertising that is aimed at kids. The Australian Divisions of General Practice issued a study at the end of February that showed that 99 per cent of food advertisements on TV are for foods with little nutritional value. The study also showed that during the summer holidays children would have watched an average of three hours and 22 minutes of junk food advertising alone. With those sorts of messages it is pretty easy to understand why kids are reaching for unhealthy snacks rather than healthier alternatives.
As governments, we can encourage children to be active while they are at school and provide support for in school programs, after school programs and out of school hours care programs that encourage physical activity. We need to make it clear to kids that you do not have to be perfect at a sport to go out and get some exercise, that just moving is important. If you do not like netball and you do not like soccer, go bushwalking or go ballroom dancing. It does not really matter as long as there is some physical activity involved.
We need to take account of gender and ethnic differences to make sure that groups of kids are not missing out because of a lack of availability of culturally appropriate facilities for them. As parents, we need to teach children healthy eating habits. That starts with supporting breastfeeding, and governments have a very important role to play there. It also means that where parents are not able to provide healthy food for their children—or are not interested in doing so—governments need to support schools that provide breakfast or after-school snack programs and make sure that those programs actually provide healthy food for kids. Those kids are bound to see a dramatic increase in their school performance if they do simple things like have breakfast. There is a great deal of evidence to show that the changes such programs make to children's diets and educational outcomes are quite striking. I know that most parents are striving to do the best they can for their kids, and my comments today are not designed to increase the guilt and worry that many parents have already—at the end of the day, no-one benefits from guilt and stress. But if we work together to raise healthier children, the potential benefits are enormous.

"Billson, Bruce, MP",LP,2003-03-03,"—I rise to support the motion put before the House by the member for Sydney. The motion calls upon us to do two things: note the increase in the percentage of children who are overweight and obese, and promote measures to increase fitness and encourage healthy lifestyles amongst young people. The most recent estimates of the levels of excess weight in the adult population in Australia come from the 1999-2000 Australian diabetes, obesity and lifestyle study. According to that study, about seven million people—or 60 per cent of the adult population—were either overweight or obese and this rate has almost doubled since 1980. Sadly, the situation is similar for children and adolescents. Through a comparison of two national surveys conducted in 1985 and 1995, it was revealed that 20 to 25 per cent of children aged between five and 18 years were considered either overweight or obese. The figure has doubled in that 10-year period. The main issue from that is that the research suggests young people who are obese or overweight carry that condition into their adult life. We know of the huge health risks associated with persistent obesity in adult life and the significant long-term consequences for the individual and for the nation through additional health costs and the like. Obesity in childhood is also associated with high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, high triglyceride levels and high insulin levels. Type 2 diabetes, once thought of as an adult disease, is now appearing in children.
Thankfully, by recognising the positive initiatives that the member for Sydney referred to, there are a number of things that can be done. An excellent article on nutrition by Rosemary Stanton appeared in the 11 October 2002 edition of Australian Doctor. I am encouraged by some of the steps that have already been taken by the Howard government, including an integrated range of measures and initiatives to address the problem in a cross-sector way. There is no one silver bullet for this. There are many elements to a responsible strategy to address childhood obesity, a number of which are already being pursued by the government.
The national clinical guidelines for the management of excess weight and obesity in adults and children is an Australian first that provides doctors and health care professionals with some basic information and an evidence based guide on how best to manage and treat overweight people and obesity. There is also funding through the NHMRC to update the current dietary guidelines for adults, children and adolescents. The National Child Nutrition Program provides $15 million in community grants to improve the nutrition and long-term eating patterns of children aged between one and 12 years. That project addresses some of the concerns the member for Sydney alluded to about the kinds of food and healthy lifestyle messages that are going out to children—not only in their own homes but also in places where others have a responsibility and an input into their care, management and wellbeing.
Programs for before and after school hours have been mentioned. Rosemary Stanton points to an audit of the type of food available through school canteens to children from kindergarten through to year 12. Quite rightly, she also tackles the issue of advertising. Frankly, I find it curious that the food industry does not accept that its advertising influences what children eat and drink and that those choices contribute to the rising incidence of obesity. If it is having no influence on the eating patterns of children, why is the industry advertising? It seems to be a given that something needs to be done. In my view, the General Practitioners Association has put forward some very interesting data.
There is a lot more I could say but, in the time available, let me point to a few things we could do. Two very forward-looking individuals in my electorate, Powell Cooper and Mark Luca, are trying to make healthy food spunky and cool in the eyes of young people. They are trying to counter some of those messages you see in the media that encourage children to eat junk food. My son knows that one junk food day a week is plenty. Maybe giving out the message that junk food or fun food is okay in moderation is an appropriate thing to do, but there is a lot of fun to be had eating healthy food. There are also some issues around encouraging access to drinking water—even making sure that our publicly funded facilities in schools and military installations are available for broader community use. We should provide resources and invest in those things. At the end of the day we need to get one big message out: a healthy lifestyle and healthy eating equals a better life and should be embraced by all.

"King, Catherine, MP",ALP,2003-03-03,"—Childhood obesity is a growing health crisis in this country and it is one that we cannot ignore. Obesity amongst children is increasing not only in prevalence but at a faster rate than ever before. I would like to echo the comments of the member for Sydney when she said that we do not want to stigmatise children who experience obesity or who are overweight. Nor do we want to promote unhealthy body images through some of the programs we implement. But we need to do something. We need to create circumstances where parents are supported to help their children to not only lose weight but also participate in sport and physical activity.
Childhood obesity will have serious implications for our health system both now and in the future with increased rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease and some cancers. It has been estimated that direct health costs of childhood obesity alone are around $830 million per year. A study published in the January edition of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition shows the rate of obesity and being overweight in Australian children aged between seven and 15 years of age has doubled since 1995. Childhood obesity is estimated to be rising at about one per cent per year—a trend which, if continued, will see half of all young Australians overweight by 2025.
A number of causes are cited for the growing epidemic: a more sedentary lifestyle, proliferation of fast foods, decreased outdoor play and leisure opportunities, rising costs of participation in sport, lack of balance in the level of advertising to which children are exposed regarding fast foods and decreased time available to parents to help kids eat well. As with many areas of public health, we have a pretty good idea of what the causes are and we also have a pretty good idea of what the solutions are. Some of them raised recently include encouraging and supporting breastfeeding more actively and promoting maternal nutrition; creating more conducive environments within schools to encourage participation rather than competition in sport and physical activity—this requires us to focus a great deal more of our sport funding on local and community sporting organisations rather than focusing exclusively, as the government does, on elite athletes; creating more conducive environments in schools for healthy eating, including looking at how food is sold in school canteens; supporting food industry efforts that adopt socially responsible methods of advertising to children; and introducing incentives to families to enrol their children in local sporting clubs and other physical activities.
Put simply, we need to direct more money towards creating an environment where people find it easier to eat well and move more. Public health funding in this country, despite the rhetoric, continues at low levels. We spend around two per cent of our total health budget on programs to do with preventing disease—two per cent of the budget is spent on preventing communicable diseases, cancers, cardiovascular disease and injury. In rough terms, this sees the remaining bulk of the health budget being spent on treatment of all diseases, with a smaller proportion being spent on trying to cure people of preventable diseases. It seems a ludicrous situation in the 21st century, where we have the means at our disposal to prevent many diseases and injuries, that we only spend two per cent of our health budget doing so. We have the means at our disposal to reduce the incidence of childhood obesity and subsequent health problems. Each year we talk about it and say that we have to do something; each year we shake our heads and continue to spend proportionally the same small amount on public health as we have for the last 20 years.
In tackling childhood obesity we should not expect any miracle cures, but there are some examples of where our concerted efforts have worked in the past. As a nation we have led the world in reducing communicable diseases and, whilst we have a long way to go, we have led the world in reducing our road toll. Childhood obesity is no less of a challenge, and we should support parents in creating a better environment where children can eat well and move more.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Obese Children</title>,Private Members' Business,11,1,speech
"Draper, Trish, MP",LP,2003-03-03,"—The motion moved by the member for Sydney asks this House to note the increasing problem of childhood obesity and to commit itself to encouraging healthy lifestyles. I commend the member for Sydney for her efforts in this area. However, we can all be encouraged by the fact that, as far back as 1997, the report Acting on Australia's weight: a strategic plan for the prevention of overweight and obesity recognised for the first time at a national level the seriousness of the problem. As a result, the government established the National Obesity Prevention Group, chaired by Professor Ian Caterson of the University of Sydney. Two working groups were established, one dealing specifically with obesity in children and adolescents. In August 1999 a symposium entitled `Acting on Australia's weight: children and families' was held. The symposium brought together people from a variety of backgrounds to discuss and exchange ideas about how to encourage healthier lifestyle choices among Australians, particularly our young people.
To build on the information from these two sources, the government commissioned experts in the field to research and recommend intervention and prevention strategies that would specifically address childhood obesity. Professor Caterson's National Obesity Prevention Group highlighted the problem of the lack of a standard definition of overweight and obesity for children, which made it difficult to properly assess the extent of the problem in this country. As a result, the government commissioned a group of experts to develop an Australian standard.
The National Health and Medical Research Council is also developing national clinical guidelines for weight control and obesity management for use by general practitioners. In this place on 2 December 2002, I reported on the forum on childhood obesity, which I had the honour of attending and opening on 29 November. Organised by Senator Guy Barnett and held in Launceston, the forum highlighted the work that was already being undertaken and canvassed further ideas and suggestions for dealing with this health problem. It was a very productive and worthwhile exercise which, as I again reported in this place on 5 December, led to discussions between the advertising industry, representatives of food and beverage companies and the government's health and ageing policy committee, which I chair, about the possibility of establishing a national advertising campaign to inform and educate the community on the dangers of childhood obesity and to encourage healthy lifestyles with exercise and a balanced diet.
On 22 September 2002, the Hon. Larry Anthony, Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, announced that the first steps had been taken towards establishing a national agenda for early childhood. At that time he provided statistical reasons for establishing an agenda on such matters as child abuse and neglect, child literacy and numeracy, childhood obesity, mental illness and suicide and Indigenous children, among others. A consultation paper has been developed and was released for public comment as recently as 20 February this year. Recognition is given in the introduction to the already considerable investment in services for family and children nationally and by state and local governments. But what is needed is a better understanding of what all of the government and, indeed, non-government sector agencies are doing.
I was pleased to read of support for this agenda by Professor Fiona Stanley, Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Research Alliance for Children and Youth. Professor Stanley has said:
I support the coalition government's decision to work towards a national agenda for early childhood wholeheartedly and, with others, have been advocating for just such an approach to be a government priority for a number of years.
The government made it clear right from the beginning that the welfare of children would be a major priority. It was the first government ever to provide a ministry specifically focusing on children and young people. The development of the National Agenda for Early Childhood is, in no small part, due to this initiative and the hard work and dedication of the minister. I add that, as previous speakers have stated, we do need to be careful about stigmatising children who do have weight problems. We need to support our families and children in achieving a better lifestyle.",REPS,<title>PRIVATE MEMBERS' BUSINESS</title>,<title>Obese Children</title>,Private Members' Business,11,1,speech
"Roxon, Nicola, MP",ALP,2003-03-03,"—I too would like to support the comments made by previous speakers on this important issue of childhood obesity and to make the comment that I think underlies all of the previous speakers' concerns that childhood obesity is an issue for people not just when they are young children but also as they turn into young adults and older people and they carry further into their lives the health issues that arise from having suffered from childhood obesity at a young age. The importance given to, and concern about, the issues raised by other speakers, particularly the member for Sydney, are legitimate. We want to deal with this issue very early on rather than see it turn into an ongoing health problem for a large section of our community. Indeed, the Institute of Health and Welfare has told us that one in five Australian children between the ages of five and 18 are overweight or obese and that that figure has doubled since 1986. So it is a pretty dramatic change and one that we need to be concerned about. We should also be aware of the other health issues that can affect young people if they become overly concerned with body image.
I must say that, although some comments have been made and some positive steps are being taken by the government on this issue, we are not really seeing action at a level that we would expect to see if the one in five children suffering from childhood obesity were one in five businesses going to the wall or one in five executives having heart attacks—the government would be there instantly trying to provide a solution. Sadly for Australian children, there is not the sense of immediacy nor the immediate response that we would like to see from the government. This debate gives us an opportunity to put on the table some of the issues that we would like to see addressed. 
A number of other speakers have raised the concern that we do not want to blame parents and their children but that we do need to provide them active encouragement to participate in their children's and their own health and to look at the barriers that prevent many children from having a healthy and happy childhood. We do need to address this much more actively. Among a number of options that others have spoken about is the research and other work that has been done by the Australian Divisions of General Practice. Their audit of TV advertising looked at the level of exposure that Australian children have to fast food and junk food ads each week. We have a lot of other levers and, particularly at the Commonwealth level, we do put a lot of money into other health programs, child-care programs and sporting programs. We need to build a component into those programs that looks at their capacity to encourage children to be active and to participate in a healthy lifestyle, whether it is by eating nutritiously or the activities that they are involved in.
I would like to comment briefly on two reports. The government's own Youth Pathwaysreport, which has largely been ignored, did undertake extensive consultations with young people across the country and, through that process, young people raised the issue of the lack of sporting and recreational opportunities available to them, particularly in many outer suburban and rural and regional areas, not to mention in the inner city, highly built-up areas. The message from young people was very clear: they want to be out there and be more active but they do not always have the money or the facilities to be able to do so. Our own youth survey, which was conducted during last year's National Youth Week, also indicated that sport was an issue which many young people were interested in. However, it made an important distinction by identifying, as the member for Sydney mentioned, that active participation in things like dance and music and not just in your traditional sporting areas was something that young people were seeking opportunities to do and they were not always getting the support or assistance to participate in them from government programs.
I would also encourage the government to look at the success of existing breakfast programs—ideas such as the walking bus program run by some schools to encourage kids to walk to school in groups; the use of after school or vacation care programs as an opportunity to encourage and introduce kids to sport and dance and other active actions that would help them live a more mobile lifestyle; introducing them to some nutritious ways of eating different types of food; and to encourage parents to participate in looking after the healthy and active lives of their young children. There is something that all of us can do in this area, but governments also have a particular role to play in making sure that they build these ideas into the programs that they fund.

"Plibersek, Tanya, MP",ALP,2003-03-03,"—My grievance is against the Minister for Trade and his refusal to tell the Australian people what he is negotiating away in relation to the General Agreement on Trade in Services and the proposed US-Australia free trade agreement. The General Agreement on Trade in Services is being reviewed at the moment by members of the World Trade Organisation. Like the Multilateral Agreement on Investment several years ago, there is a great deal of concern in the community about the secrecy under which these negotiations are proceeding. The 1998 draft of the OECD Multilateral Agreement on Investment attempted to reduce the powers of governments to regulate transnational investment and gave corporations the power to sue governments. It was to give transnational investors the right to compete for government funding for public services. Part of the reason the MAI collapsed was public resentment at the secrecy with which these negotiations were being carried out. Now the privatisation provisions of the MAI seem to be re-emerging in the current WTO negotiations on trade in services.
The Australian government is also negotiating a bilateral trade agreement with the US—virtually in secret. It is impossible to get any direct answers to direct questions about what is on the table to be bargained away in these negotiations. When it comes to the US-Australia free trade agreement, Minister Vaile has specifically said that nothing is off the table. Indeed, when Mr Downer was asked about the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, local content rules and the Foreign Investment Review Board, he said that if the US requested this `... obviously, that would be part of the negotiating process'.
I am in favour of effective international trade and I do hope that international trade continues to increase. But that trade has to take place in an environment that benefits poor nations as well as wealthy ones, in a way that protects workers' rights and enhances the environment and does not allow a limited number of huge corporations to accrue unlimited profits. Fifty-one of the 100 biggest economies are companies rather than nations today. If the Australian government believes that trade liberalisation will be fair and beneficial to workers and consumers, and that it will be good for the environment and poor countries, those negotiations should be able to take place in public, with public scrutiny. The government should be prepared to trust the Australian public with information about what is being negotiated.
The General Agreement on Trade in Services establishes a framework of rules for international trade in services. GATS was signed by the Australian government and other member nations of the WTO in 1994 and came into force in 1995. Australia has been a signatory since its inception. Under GATS, WTO members can negotiate commitments to open specific service sectors to foreign competition and to afford foreign suppliers the same treatment as domestic suppliers. Members can also make commitments about the operation of their domestic regulation of services.
However, the nature and extent of these commitments are strictly a matter of choice for member governments. Member governments can choose not to make commitments in a particular sector and the structure of commitments can discriminate between foreign and domestic suppliers. The current agreement covers only those services which each government has agreed to list in the agreement. Australia, at the time of the initial negotiations, very sensibly did not list public services like health and education. Of course, with this renegotiation there is no guarantee that public health, education and other services will not be listed in the future. That is what the Australian public really wants to know: are these things up for negotiation?
Unlike most UN resolutions, but like other WTO agreements, GATS rules are legally binding on governments and can be enforced, if other governments complain, through the WTO dispute system. Under GATS negotiations, 22 countries have lodged formal requests for Australia to open up particular service industries to foreign competition, but the Howard government refuses to release those requests to the public. We do not even know what is being asked of us, let alone what we are going to give away. The sorts of things covered might be education, health, postal services, local content rules for film and television, energy, water and telecommunications. The requests may also threaten the public provision of affordable education, health, telephone and postal services, transport and local council services. If you look at the current dispute between UPS, a private American courier service, and Canada Post, you will see that UPS is suing Canada Post for $250 million worth of damages because it claims that Canada Post has anticompetitive provisions. That is just the sort of thing that I fear might happen in Australia if these negotiations go ahead.
The Australian government will make an initial offer to the World Trade Organisation to open up Australia's services to foreign competition by 31 March 2003. That is not far off at all. With those initial offers going out in such a short period of time, we deserve to know what is going to be offered on our behalf. So far, the Australian public has been given no indication of what those offers might be.
Labor are opposed to relinquishing control of the nation's public institutions, such as our health and education services, in GATS negotiations. We will not support changes that undermine affordable access to essential public services or the right of governments to regulate services. Nor will we support changes that require the privatisation or contracting out of federal, state or local government services. Decisions about essential services should be made at local and national levels after open, democratic debate, not negotiated away in secret.
WTO agreements often reflect the interests of not only the big economies—the US, Europe and Japan obviously dominate the negotiations—but also big corporations. Business organisations are frequently represented on government delegations. Indeed, the Australian delegation to Seattle had eight business representatives but no community representatives. Governments are very easily pressured by large global service corporations such as Columbia/HCA, the world's largest private hospital corporation, and Vivendi Water, the global water company which now runs Adelaide's water system. The big corporations organise themselves into regional lobbying groups as well, so that they have even more power. Those groups include the US Coalition of Service Industries and the European Services Forum. They essentially see public services such as health, education and water services as potential multitrillion dollar markets and are all for government deregulation and getting rid of barriers to trade in these services.
I think it is important that we remember that some services are not just commodities to be traded in the market and that access must not be dependent on income when you are talking about services that are essential to human wellbeing, such as health, education and sanitation. Also, some services are essential to the development of an economy. I certainly think that a service such as telecommunications deserves to have very careful thought applied to it when we are making these decisions that will affect the long-term future of the telecommunications industry in Australia.
Core WTO principles require governments to treat foreign firms at least as well as domestic ones and to treat all foreign suppliers equally. Yet GATS rules potentially extend beyond this, restricting governments' abilities to make rules even if they apply equally to both domestic and foreign firms. There has been little discussion on the effects that service liberalisation will have on developing and transitional economies as well. We know that there is a great deal of evidence that shows that there can be disastrous effects with service liberalisation. If you look at the effects of some of the policies enforced by the World Bank and the IMF on developing and transitional economies, you can see that for local consumers they have been harsh indeed. The promises to consumers of increased competition may not materialise. We might just see multinational companies doing much better business and picking up much greater profits rather than any real increase in consumer rights.
I am certainly not against increased international trade, but trade has to be fair and trade negotiations have to take place in a way that is transparent and that takes account of not just the ever-increasing demand for profits but also the rights of workers and protection of the environment and in a way that makes sure that people across the planet benefit equally.",REPS,<title>GRIEVANCE DEBATE</title>,<title>Trade: General Agreement on Trade in Services</title>,Grievance Debate,12,1,speech
"McMullan, Bob, MP",ALP,2003-03-03,"—The opposition obviously will be supporting the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003—we have always supported appropriation bills—but I will be moving a second reading amendment at the end of my speech, which I hope will be circulated to honourable members in the course of the speech. Debates on appropriation bills provide members with opportunities to discuss a broad range of issues. But today I want to focus fairly narrowly on issues to do with the economy and the management of the budget. The government's claims of responsibility in budget policy are growing thinner by the day. By now they are almost completely threadbare.
Let us look at some of the facts. It is now clearly established that this is the highest taxing government in Australian history. It raises a higher proportion of our national income as income tax than any other government in history. If the forward estimates are to be believed, by the end of the forward estimates period, the current Treasurer will be responsible for all of the eight highest income tax to GDP ratios in Australian history. At the moment, he is responsible for the five highest income tax to GDP ratios and the only times in our history that the Commonwealth government has taken more than 17 per cent of our national income in income tax.
In addition to this record high level of income tax, we have the biggest new indirect tax in our history, the GST, and an array of special levies—milk levies, sugar levies, Ansett levies—which proliferate and raise hundreds of millions of dollars. We currently have windfall revenue flowing to the government as a consequence of higher oil prices. It is the highest taxing government in history, yet with the record high level of revenue—higher than any Treasurer has ever had to deal with in peacetime in Australia—the government has failed to deliver on its basic responsibilities to the Australian people. With record high revenues and declining services, the government has failed to keep the budget in surplus after a decade of economic growth. It is on that basis that, as I said, I will be moving a second reading amendment at the end of this speech. It will be a second reading amendment that deals with the government's record as the highest taxing government. It deals with the government's failure to deliver on basic responsibilities to the Australian people. It deals with the government's running the budget into deficit, notwithstanding a decade of economic growth and promises to the contrary.
The government's management of the budget has been a game of smoke and mirrors. The coalition's budget was excessively tough in its first year, but it has been remarkably soft in the years since then. Revenue has been pouring in, but the government has spent virtually every extra dollar. The budget, even in years when it has been in surplus, is sailing much too close to the wind for comfort these days. The surpluses that the Treasurer likes to boast about are extremely slender. In fact, if properly measured—that is, by the measure the Treasurer himself said just two years ago was a superior measure of budget performance; the accruals measure—the budget will be in deficit two years running, notwithstanding the very high level of economic growth. The accruals or fiscal deficit was $3.7 billion last financial year, and the government's forecast for this year in its own budget papers for the fiscal deficit—that is, the deficit measured by accrual accounting measures—is for a deficit of half a billion dollars. 
The Treasurer has suddenly, however, discovered the virtues of the underlying cash measure of a budget deficit, which he used to deplore and decry but which he now says is his preferred method. Under this measure, last year's budget was in deficit to the tune of $1.3 billion. This is an extraordinary performance after a decade of economic growth. It may be, at the end of this year, that we will find the budget position is not quite as bleak as the fiscal deficit that has been predicted, but the Treasurer is certainly crying poor and saying he has no resources to fund key public services that are in crisis, like Medicare. If it does turn out to be the case that the budget circumstance is slightly stronger than anticipated, it will not be the product of good management but because of a few unexpected fiscal windfalls.
First and foremost, it is ripping out higher levels of income tax. Figures released by the finance department last week show that, in the first seven months of this financial year, income tax collections are 13 per cent higher than for the same months in the previous year; that is comparing like with like. It is comparing the same period in the year: the first seven months of this financial year with the first seven months of the last financial year. Income tax collections have grown by 13 per cent—an enormous increase which is hitting every household. There is a windfall too from rising oil and petrol prices. Every Australian household knows it is paying more for petrol. What people are not so immediately aware of is how much of that extra revenue flows back to the government. The Parliamentary Library has estimated that the government will reap at least $600 million as a short-term windfall from rising oil and petrol prices. The increasing oil and petrol prices since the budget was framed in May means GST revenue this financial year will be more than $220 million higher than last year, as measured by the Parliamentary Library on the best figures available at the moment. Revenue from the petroleum resource rent tax will be between $380 million and $410 million higher than forecast at the time of the budget. This makes a total tax windfall from just these two taxes of at least $600 million. If, as some predict, oil prices rise further, these tax windfalls will grow even further because both of them reflect and are proportionate to the increase in the oil price.
But there is more. As well as the oil and petrol tax windfall and the massive increase above already record levels of income tax, the government will next year and in the following years save hundreds of millions of dollars as a result of the deferral of the sale of Telstra. The budget papers show that the government will save $218 million it had budgeted to spend on the costs of marketing the sale. It would have cost $218 million to sell the taxpayers' asset—that is in the forward estimates as expenditures. Given that the government, on the basis of the collapsing Telstra share price, has said it will put off that sale, it will save that $218 million in the next financial year. It is also benefiting to the tune of $259 million per year as a result of the special dividend announced by Telstra last week; that is $259 million extra. Yet, with income tax at record high levels and with all those windfalls—$600 million windfall from oil and petrol prices, $218 million from putting off the sale of Telstra and $259 million in a special windfall—we find the government still crying poor. It is crying poor because it says it has to spend hundreds of millions of dollars on deploying troops to the Persian Gulf, notwithstanding the fact that many—probably, if the polls are to be believed, most—Australians believe that the government has sent too many troops and deployed them too soon as a result of a failure of foreign policy. Even on the basis of having to meet the extra costs of the deployment and the extra costs of the drought, with the windfalls it has been receiving, the government should be able to also turn its attention to the crises facing Australian families in issues such as the collapse of Medicare.
Let me turn now to the question that I referred to earlier about the budget balance. Budget policy under this government has been intellectually moribund and in recent years it has been out of control. The Treasurer has said that his policy is to balance the budget over the economic cycle. I actually think a proper measure of a balanced modern fiscal policy is a bit more sophisticated than that, but let us consider the Treasurer's performance against his own benchmark. Any sophisticated fiscal policy based on some concept of balance over the economic cycle must logically accept that therefore in the appropriate circumstances a budget deficit can be justified. There has been a lot of Australian debate about fiscal policies being in denial about that obvious fact for far too long. The Treasurer obviously thinks that it is appropriate at the right time in the economic cycle for the budget to go into deficit, because he recently advocated deficit funding for the United States. The Treasurer told the parliament on 6 February:
The US President sent his budget to Congress in the last day and has put forward a budget program with a projected deficit of 2.8 per cent of GDP for the United States in 2003—a sum of some $US300 billion. In Australian terms, that would be the equivalent of a deficit in our budget of $A20 billion in the forthcoming year. Obviously, that is very substantial fiscal stimulation, which we welcome. And we welcome the fact that fiscal stimulation, together with monetary policy, is now being put forward to stimulate a return to sustained growth in the United States ...
Whilst I am apprehensive that that budget deficit in the United States is too large and that the nature and extent of the stimulus is inappropriate, I broadly share the view that as an economy slows it is appropriate for a government to look to fiscal stimulus. So let us accept that reality and say we can dispense forever with the argument that no-one in the Australian parliament on either side of the House now believes that it is appropriate to have surpluses in every year whatever the fiscal circumstances are. The Treasurer obviously does not believe that because, first of all, he advocates the opposite in the United States. And then, notwithstanding the economy was growing quite strongly and properly measured by the accruals measure, he delivered a deficit budget last year and this year.
But the Treasurer still tries to maintain the pretence that all deficits are bad, even though his own performance and his policy advocacy for other countries is quite to the contrary. There are some unanswered questions about the government's view on balanced fiscal policy. The one big unanswered question, which leaves the proper analysis of what the Treasurer's goals are and which is almost impossible to answer, is: what is the government's view on a balanced fiscal policy? What is the rate of economic growth that they consider the norm around which that fiscal cycle should be based? I assume the government's policy is based on the figures used by the Secretary for the Commonwealth Treasury when he told the Melbourne Institute dinner on 7 February that the average growth rate in the Australian economy over the past 40 years was 3.75 per cent. That seems the only logical basis to say our historic average is X, therefore, when you blow that average you will start to look towards some stimulus and when you are above it you start to run up surpluses to fund the need for subsequent downturns in the economic cycle. But if that is the case, last year's budget deficit is revealed as a stark failure of policy. Even if you hold the view, as some do—and it is an argument which I think has some merit—that the Australian savings performance is so bad that the Commonwealth government should be a net saver over the cycle instead of striving merely for net balance, it still allows the possibility that when the economy slows below trend it will be appropriate for the budget to be in deficit to respond to that slowing. What worries me about the debate that goes on around these issues of fiscal policy is that at the moment the government's fiscal policy and the debate around it has a very weak intellectual foundation. It does not have any underlying driving logic. It does not even accord with its own purported logic and the arguments that are put for it.
But this is not just some intellectual debate between two sides of the House in parliament. I think it is important that the Australian parliament does have a debate about fiscal policy that is intelligent, informed and principled, and it has been very hard to doso  for the last seven years. Some people would say it has been more years but, in my experience, certainly in this House, it has been difficult since 1996. It is not just an intellectual debate; it is a debate that affects families directly. In an environment where their ability to service their debt is under strain, they still have to find money for services out of their pockets. Household debt in Australia has doubled under this government and credit card debt has trebled. This is imposing significant funding burdens on families as they have to repay this increased debt. It is facile and superficial to look at that only in terms of how much interest they have to pay on those debts. Every family knows that you have to repay the principal as well and as the principal soars so the amount of repayment rises, and that is why families are under pressure in meeting their debts at the moment. At the same time they are having to fund services out of their own pockets, which substantially were met by the government in previous times. That is most obvious in the areas of health and education.
In the area of health insurance, the government has imposed a Clayton's tax. It has passed laws that effectively make it compulsory for some Australians to take out health insurance, because they have to pay an equivalent tax if they do not do so. Through the combination of those and other measures, many families have felt forced into taking out private health insurance. I am sure that other members have had the same experience as me. When you go around your electorate talking to individuals and families, you find them resenting the fact that they felt compelled to take out private health insurance. It costs them a substantial amount each year. The government's penalties, the requirements on high-income earners and the effective penalties on lower to middle-income families that make them feel compelled to take out private health insurance have imposed a substantial burden on families. Those families are paying for higher credit card debts, higher household debts and higher taxes and are having to pay for services that the government previously supplied. A higher proportion of families are having to do the same in the area of education.
Having looked at the budget situation, its broad parameters and, very briefly, its implications for families—which some of my colleagues will talk about later—my concern about the economy as we go into the early years of the 21st century is that the government has no plan and no vision for the future. There is no equivalent to the dynamic plan of the eighties and early nineties that transformed the economy and ensured that for the last 20 years of the 20th century Australia was the leading Western economy in productivity, growth and rising living standards. We are in danger of falling back to the complacent failure of the first 80 years of the 20th century, when Australia was one of the lowest ranking and slowest growing economies in the West—falling from the richest economy in the world at the beginning of the 20th century to No. 15 or so by 1983. We entered the 21st century as the fastest growing economy in the Western world but without a plan or a vision for how we would retain that title. We are at risk of slipping into comfortable mediocrity again. We started the 20th century leading the world in economic performance and we were so confident we would do so forever that we believed we did not need to do anything about it. For 80 years we drifted down the economic table. After 20 years of hard changes, we have gone back to the top of the table of the fastest growing economies—not to the top of the table in terms of income level—over that sustained period, but we are at serious risk of slipping back into comfortable mediocrity again.
Any plan for a successful, modern 21st century economy needs to be based around rigorous fiscal policy and the targeting of low interest rates, but it also needs a program for high productivity, equitable distribution of the benefits of that productivity and long-term sustainability of the economic growth model. This requires investment in education and training and research and development to develop the skills and ideas to be the basis of the new businesses and new jobs of the 21st century. As we enter 2003, the prospects are that economic growth will slow.
All the drivers of economic growth either are indicating a likelihood of slowing or have serious question marks around them. The most obvious problem, particularly today, is the problem with exports. The low dollar, high productivity and the focus on developing new areas of exports such as manufactures and services have led to exports making a substantial contribution to economic growth over the last decade or two; however, this is at risk. Our export performance is falling far beyond that which can be explained merely by the impact of the drought—which has been quite significant and will grow, which everybody has to accept—and far beyond the impact of the world economic slowdown. Our exports in non-agricultural areas are falling and our share of the market in growing areas like China is also falling. This is slowing growth in the short term and creating a potential serious current account deficit problem for the future, which may even impact on future interest rate policies.
Today's figures were the subject of some attempt to engender a little bit of debate during question time. However, the government declined to respond to the figures or to its previous description of current account deficit and foreign debt figures as significant. Today's figures show that our trade performance—or our net exports—will detract 1.7 per cent from growth for the December quarter. Our trade performance is going south. Much of the economic success of Australia in the last two years has been driven by consumption. In the long term, economic growth driven by consumption is not a sustainable strategy; nevertheless, it has carried us well for the last couple of years. This growth is being substantially driven by two things: the housing boom and the boom in household and credit card debt.
The Reserve Bank has been saying for some time that the boom in credit card debt, in particular, is unsustainable. Australia has been on a debt binge that has made families and the economy overall much more vulnerable than they need to be. We have record high household debt, record high credit card debt and a record high foreign debt. All of those essentially revolve around the same weakness: a weakness in Australian savings performance. We are not saving sufficiently to fund our consumption or our investment and we are therefore finding household borrowing and foreign debt escalating.
The third driver of this crisis is housing, one of the most volatile areas of the economy. We have consistently seen a slowing in housing approvals and finance and there is a serious risk of a rapid slowdown in the investment apartment sector. This will flow through into consumption. We all hope it will be a soft landing, although the housing industry does not have a great record of soft landings. Let us hope that it achieves one on this occasion because it is very important directly for that industry, which employs many people, and indirectly for the manufacturers that supply industry and for the retail and consumption activity that flows from it as people furnish new houses.
Business investment is the area to which we are looking for substantial growth, and the indicators are mixed. There are some indicators that should make us cautiously optimistic that business investment will grow and that it will be enough to fill the gap left by the decline in our export performance, in consumption and in housing. It is not possible to tell precisely at this stage, but we can hope so. Some surveys—for example, those conducted by the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry and by the banks—suggest that this business investment may not be as strong as we need and that some of the business investment, such as aircraft investments by Qantas and Virgin Airlines, will not contribute significantly to Australian growth because it is substantially imported. Once the equipment arrives it may contributeto our growth through the way it is used, which should be the case in any rational investment decision, but you do not get the multipliers that you get from equipment investment based on the purchase of Australian manufactured equipment.
The last point on the growth scenario is that the government's profligacy and running down of the surplus has left little room for government action to assist economic growth, should that be necessary. There is little room for action, should growth fall below some reasonable level at which the government believes fiscal stimulus is appropriate—and we cannot discern where that level might be since the government has failed to indicate that.
The government has also badly mismanaged its priorities. It has failed in the area of Medicare and in the area of higher investment. It continues to leave us in the situation where families are vulnerable because they are having to meet the pressures of falling bulk-billing, higher prices for doctors who do not bulk-bill and the higher costs and lack of availability of higher education. This is making families feel threatened and imposing unnecessary stresses on them. We also find that the government is in a clear state of confusion about how it is going to proceed on the key area of paid maternity leave, where there is a clear case not only for action but for government funded action to get paid maternity leave on the road. I do not totally agree with every detail of the proposal put forward by Pru Goward, but I do accept the fundamental tenet that there should be a system of paid maternity leave which should be publicly funded at its core. We also have to do something in Australia to make it easier for Australians to own their own home. This government has no initiative, no plan and no track record in that area. My colleague the member for Werriwa has been putting forward some very interesting and positive propositions in that area.
I want to conclude by talking about the vulnerability of the economy. The Howard government has left the economy extremely vulnerable at a time when it should not be. After more than a decade of economic growth—dating back to the early nineties—and after two decades of economic reform, the Australian economy should be on firm foundations. But we are failing to invest in the future, and we remain much more vulnerable than we should be. We see this most starkly when we consider the levels of household and national debt, to which I referred earlier.
Under this government, household debt has doubled and credit card debt has tripled. Not all of that debt is bad. Some has enabled families to purchase things that they have made an intelligent assessment about, whether those are income producing assets or homes. You cannot say every time a person borrows that it is a bad thing; individuals make borrowing decisions, and in the main they make intelligent borrowing decisions. But much of the surge in debt has been driven by consumption rather than by investment, and this leaves families particularly vulnerable to any local, regional or national economic shocks and to any personal adversity.
In addition, as we were reminded today with the latest release from the Bureau of Statistics, the nation remains vulnerable because of the soaring foreign debt. When they came to office, the Prime Minister and the Treasurer said that reducing foreign debt was their No. 1 priority. The Prime Minister said, `I promise that we will have policies to reduce foreign debt.' I do not know how long we are supposed to wait. After seven years, that promise to reduce foreign debt has led to foreign debt increasing from $180 billion to $350 billion, which is a more than 90 per cent increase—virtually a doubling. At that time, the member for Higgins and then shadow treasurer complained that foreign debt was $10,000 for every man, woman and child in Australia. He thought this was a crisis and a terrible burden. He must be extremely embarrassed today when that debt stands at $18,000 for every man, woman and child. This leaves the whole economy vulnerable to international pressure.
One reason for the addiction to debt—in households and as a nation—is that savings are at record low levels and the government has stalled the one great driver of savings in Australia, which is superannuation. The government came to office with a strategy in place to take superannuation to 15 per cent, but it scrapped the final six per cent of that. We now have a very strong superannuation system, which the government is taxing to the hilt—taxing four times. There is no plan to take the system beyond nine per cent and no plan to reform the tax on superannuation for ordinary Australian families—only for the highest income Australians. So we have a situation where, as a result of the failures of its fiscal and economic policies, the government has left households and the economy extremely vulnerable. It is on the basis of this critique of the economic and fiscal policies of the Treasurer that I move the following second reading amendment:
That all words after “That” be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:
“whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House condemns the Government for its failures in economic management, and in particular its failings in relation to both income and expenditure policies because:
(1)	it is the highest taxing Government in Australian history, and:
(a)	has imposed the highest level ever of income tax;
(b)	is responsible for introducing the biggest new tax in our history; and
(c)	is addicted to imposing ever more taxes and special levies;
(2)	it has failed to deliver on its basic responsibilities to the Australian people, for example:
(a)	bulk billing has collapsed;
(b)	there is chronic under-investment in our public schools, TAFE colleges and universities;
(c)	the struggle to balance work and family life continues to get harder; and
(d)	entry level housing is becoming even less affordable for struggling Australian families; and
(3)	despite the record tax take, and in spite of declining Government services, the Government has failed to keep the Budget in surplus after nearly a decade of strong economic growth in that:
(a)	it broke its unequivocal promise to keep the Budget in surplus in 2001-02;

"Worth, Trish, MP",LP,2003-03-03,"—I welcome the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003. I note that these bills provide funding for a number of important new initiatives, including a package of additional drought measures, a donation to the Farmhand drought appeal, additional funding for the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, support for victims of the Bali disaster and their families, indexation adjustments for Defence and expected continued growth in New Apprenticeships.
This government has an opportunity to make a real contribution to the Australian way of life through preventative health measures, and I believe we are already achieving results in key areas. This debate provides me with the opportunity to speak in some detail on some of them. As Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Ageing, I am fortunate to have had the opportunity to initiate some of these measures, particularly in the areas of food and drugs, including tobacco and alcohol.
The simple adage `prevention is better than cure' holds particular weight in my areas of responsibility. You only need to consider the burden on our health system caused by tobacco and alcohol related diseases to realise that successfully discouraging somebody today from smoking or from the misuse of alcohol has massive benefits in the future. What I have found through working in this area is that the sledgehammer approach rarely works. People are more likely to respond to government initiatives through carefully crafted educational and promotional activities that target key audiences, including young people. It is no good trying to tell people they should not drink too much alcohol without explaining the dangers of doing so. Locking up people who have committed a crime simply to feed their drug addiction is pointless if there is no attempt to offer them the opportunity of rehabilitation. Telling a young girl that smoking is bad for her will not have any impact if she sees her role models doing exactly that.
We need to undertake these measures because of the terrible pressures that drug abuse puts on our society. I recently released a report entitled Counting the cost: estimates of the social cost of drug abuse in Australia in 1998-99. The report estimates that illicit and licit drug abuse costs the Australian community $34.5 billion a year. Smoking is the single greatest cause of preventable disease in Australia and around the world. Smoking related disease kills more than 19,000 Australians every year. One in two lifetime smokers will die from their habit. Smoking is responsible for 30 per cent of all cancers and 25 per cent of all heart disease and costs $12.7 billion a year in health care and other related costs. Yet one in five Australians aged 14 and over still smoke.
The good news is that the prevalence of smoking in Australia is declining. Australia has one of the lowest rates of smoking in the developed world. According to the 2001 National Drug Household Survey by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, the number of Australians aged 14 years or more who smoke tobacco daily has dropped over the past three years to 19.5 per cent. We must continue our leadership role in tobacco control. While Australia was one of the first countries in the world to prohibit tobacco advertising, that legislation is now 10 years old and is showing signs of being out of date. That is why last year I called for a review of the Australian tobacco advertising laws to ensure that they keep pace with emerging advertising and marketing practices that entice people to smoke.
I am particularly committed to taking effective steps to ensure that young people are not influenced to take up smoking by being exposed to indirect forms of promotion of tobacco products. While organisations such as Quit and the cancer councils around Australia have been very good at promoting anti-tobacco messages, we have also received support from some unexpected quarters. A recent report on cigarette smoking among women in Australia suggests that within the next decade smoking will be more common among women than men, and this is a disturbing trend.
However, I am delighted that the Australian fashion industry have recognised that they can play a key role in getting the message across to young people, particularly females, that smoking is not cool. In particular, the 2001 Australian Fashion Week took the issue head-on by launching a smoke-free fashion initiative with the support of the Commonwealth government. There has long been a link between fashion and smoking, with smoking seen to be cool and fashionable. This initiative has helped to dispel this myth and exposed cigarette smoking as an unhealthy and addictive habit. This initiative and a similar alcohol and music industry initiative, which I will outline later, demonstrate how a collaborative approach between government and those who work with and influence young people can make a difference. It provides a more powerful message with a greater reach to target audiences.
The government is highly committed to reducing the harm to Australian families and communities caused by the misuse of alcohol. In July 2001 the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy endorsed the national alcohol strategy in recognition of the effects that alcohol misuse has on a wide range of areas. This has provided the foundation for Commonwealth action focusing on three areas of activity: research, treatment and prevention. The Commonwealth government is aware of recent research that indicates that small amounts of alcohol each day for older people can be beneficial to their health. However, misuse of alcohol can have a devastating effect on a person's health and impact on the lives of those around them.
Two weeks ago, I announced a new education campaign to help drinkers know how much alcohol is safe and just what is a standard drink. These days many people who have a few drinks at a bar or at a friend's place are aware of the dangers and consequences of drink-driving and therefore tend to keep track of the number of drinks consumed. However, a quick survey at the local pub soon reveals that few people know how much alcohol there is in each glass, bottle or can that they are drinking from. For example, a pot or schooner of full-strength beer may contain one standard drink but a can of beer may contain 1.5 standard drinks. Similarly most people are unaware that a single glass of wine served at a restaurant can be the equivalent of 1.8 standard drinks. 
So what is a safe drinking level? The Commonwealth government, through the National Health and Medical Research Council, has assessed that to minimise health risks men should have no more than four standard drinks a day on average and on any one day men should have no more than six standard drinks. Women should have no more than two standard drinks a day on average to minimise health risks and on any one day women should have no more than four standard drinks. For men and women an alcohol-free day—or, better still, days—is desirable each week. To spread the message the government has produced educational materials including coasters, booklets, posters and pamphlets that will be distributed to licensed venues as well as health care settings.
One of the big problems that we face today regarding the misuse of alcohol is the level of underage drinking and in particular binge drinking. I have encountered widespread community concern about the increasing amount of alcohol being consumed by young people and the fact that they start drinking at a much younger age. The 2001 National Drug Household Survey found that nearly 12 per cent of females and 10 per cent of males aged 14 to 19 were drinking at least at weekly intervals and putting themselves at risk of short-term harm, such as violence or injury, while intoxicated. An estimated 1.2 million teenagers consumed alcohol in 2001. Our young people are putting themselves at considerable risk through excessive drinking. Harms associated with excessive drinking include violence, unprotected and unplanned sex, physical harm and humiliation.
Two recent announcements aimed at reducing the misuse of alcohol among young people were looking at the problems of alcohol products being targeted directly at young people and the promotion of safe drinking messages through the music industry. In July last year, the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy agreed to ask the Intergovernmental Committee on Drugs to review the effectiveness of the current self-regulatory system for alcohol advertising. The ministerial council was particularly concerned about opportunistic marketing of alcohol to young people under 18 years of age. Further to that decision, I asked the National Expert Advisory Committee on Alcohol to examine the marketing and promotion of ready-to-drink alcoholic products to minors. These products are sometimes described as `lolly water', as they do not taste like alcohol, and it has been argued that they have been designed and manufactured to suit the palate of young people. In fact, over the past 3½ years, tracking studies for the National Alcohol Campaign have seen the proportion of 15 to 17 year olds drinking pre-mixed spirits dramatically increase from six per cent to 22 per cent for boys and from 10 per cent to 37 per cent for girls. Those are certainly alarming statistics. I also note from the Australian Alcohol Guidelines that the average can of a pre-mixed spirit drink is equivalent to 1.5 standard drinks.
The government's stance on these issues has now also received strong support from the Australian music industry. We have joined forces to reach young people with responsible drinking messages, and I would like to thank Mushroom marketing, the Brazin group and members of the bands Another Race, CrashPalace and the Butterfly Effect for their support. Jake Nicolaisen from the band Another Race had a clear message for young people who misuse alcohol. His warning was simple:
There's nothing cool about not being in control. Our choices are our own, we live and die by them, we prosper and fall and we can hurt or help, but they are ours and we own them.
What we need now is strong support from the community—including from parents, schools and doctors—in taking responsibility for this issue. In particular, the alcohol industry needs to adopt a responsible approach because it is providing a substance that is potentially harmful.
Another area where this government is totally committed is illicit drug use. We are making every effort to address the illicit drug problem in Australia and accordingly have introduced the largest single initiative ever undertaken in this country to respond to the supply of, and to reduce demand for, illicit drugs. We have evidence that the commitment of more than $625 million is working. Fewer people are now taking illicit drugs, fewer people are dying of overdoses, more parents are talking to their children about drugs, more treatment services are available and, with Commonwealth leadership and funding, all states and territories are now establishing diversion programs. The statistics speak for themselves. The 2001 National Drug Strategy Household Survey reported a 23 per cent reduction in the proportion of people using illicit drugs. The number of people dying of overdoses in 2001 was 306, compared with 725 in 2000 and 958 in 1999—a drop of 68 per cent in two years. One of the most encouraging statistics is that 78 per cent of parents spoke to their children about drugs during the 2001 National Illicit Drugs Campaign.
But the government is not about to fall back on its achievements. I was delighted to hear the announcement by the Prime Minister at the end of last year that an additional $215 million will be allocated to the continuation of the Illicit Drug Diversion Initiative. That brings to $840 million the total resources that the government has committed to the Tough on Drugs strategy. The Illicit Drug Diversion Initiative gives minor drug offenders alternatives to the criminal justice system by providing access to appropriate education, assessment and treatment services. During the second phase, we will build on the momentum that has gathered to date and ensure that minor drug offenders continue to be given a chance to address their illicit drug use and stay out of the criminal justice system.
One of the key components of this initiative is the Magistrates Early Referral Into Treatment program, otherwise know as the MERIT program. I recently had the opportunity to launch one of these programs at the Burwood Local Court in Sydney. MERIT is a voluntary program based in the Magistrates Court that offers assessment and treatment options for illicit drug users who are apprehended for summary offences. Suitable offenders are bailed for a period of up to three months to undergo treatment. Each offender's progress in treatment is reported to the court and is taken into account when sentencing is determined.
Another major part of the Commonwealth government's National Illicit Drugs Strategy is the Non-Government Organisation Treatment Grants program, which aims to strengthen the capacity of non-government organisations to provide improved services and to increase the number of treatment places available. This program is continuing in 2002-03, with $65 million allocated in the federal budget. Additionally, part of this funding has been allocated to the second stage of the application process, which will allow new organisations wishing to provide new treatment services an opportunity to apply for funding. As with tobacco and alcohol misuse, a significant focus of the National Drugs Strategy is on young people. A paper prepared by the Centre for Adolescent Health at the Murdoch Children's Research Institute and the University of Melbourne highlights that:
Early age of a specific substance use is associated with the subsequent development of more frequent use of that substance and such patterns of use generally increase the risk of problems with that substance later in life.
The government has provided $27.3 million to the National School Drug Education Strategy, which has a goal of no illicit drugs in schools and focuses on improved drug prevention education. In remote and rural areas, the Commonwealth government has been supporting the Croc Festivals. These events were developed to encourage young Indigenous students to attend school more regularly and to lead healthy, positive lifestyles without misusing alcohol or consuming tobacco, illicit drugs or other harmful substances. While on the subject of drug abuse, I cannot let the opportunity pass without condemning the deplorable stance taken by the New South Wales Greens on this issue. I was shocked to read that their party advocates the legalisation of drugs such as ecstasy, speed and marijuana. They are clearly out of touch with the damage that drug abuse causes to individuals, their families and the community.
As I have just outlined, the Commonwealth government has introduced a number of proactive measures relating to drug and alcohol issues, and we are not about to rest on our laurels. But the Commonwealth cannot do it alone. The state and territory governments must ensure that they put these issues high on their agendas and keep them there. I was concerned, for example, to hear that the Victorian government was taking funding out of drug and alcohol areas as the Commonwealth government put extra funding in. I am particularly concerned to hear that in my home state of South Australia, the state Labor government is planning to cut $104 million from the forward estimates for health over the next four years. Such cuts would have a big impact on hospital treatment and waiting times, and it makes a mockery of the state government's commitment to increase health spending.
There are two areas in particular that I would like to highlight—and which I would like states and territories to consider. Firstly, I would like them to look at their laws relating to the provision of alcohol—and in particular the supply of alcohol to young people—with a view to having more consistent legislation. This issue was brought to my attention as a result of the tragic death of 15-year-old Leigh Clark, who died as a result of consuming alcohol in the backyard of a friend's place. Leigh's father, Bruce Clark, wrote to me asking that something be done to provide consistent legislation across all states and territories regarding the supply of alcohol to young people. I have informed Mr Clark that, while this is up to the states, I will take the opportunity to raise the matter at the next Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy meeting which, of course, will be attended by state and territory ministers.
Secondly, I believe far more needs to be done regarding drug rehabilitation and treatment opportunities within the prison system. I am informed that at any one time there are approximately 20,000 people in our prisons. A significant number of them are addicted to drugs. It surprises me that there are opportunities missed within our corrective services system to educate, rehabilitate and treat these offenders. The emphasis has been on keeping inmates there, with opportunities lost to explore the cause of their being there and how they can be helped to not re-offend.
It has been put to me that there are real opportunities for non-government organisations that provide treatment services to provide rehabilitation and treatment for people in prison, and to continue this treatment after these people have served their time behind bars. As one treatment service provider put to me last year, one of the hardest things about trying to rehabilitate drug users is to get them fed, clothed, housed and turning up for appointments. He pointed out that all this could be achieved within the prison system. Adequate attention to drug use in prisons could also benefit the wider community by reducing the spread of hepatitis B and C and HIV.
There are emerging issues that we, as a government, are working on. One of these issues is the co-morbidity that exists between drug abuse and mental health. We need a greater coordination of services, greater involvement by GPs and, where necessary, links to teaching hospitals. The increasing use of psycho-stimulants is an area of growing concern. Already the government is taking a coordinated approach to stop over-the-counter medicines being diverted into the manufacture of drugs such as speed and ecstasy. Thirdly, there is a real need to look at the provision of treatment services in regional and rural areas of Australia.

"Fitzgibbon, Joel, MP",ALP,2003-03-03,"—I would like to use the free-ranging opportunity presented by the appropriation debate to talk about a number of issues in my electorate and, if time permits, say something more about the current situation in Iraq, something about unfair dismissals—because the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations decided to misrepresent me during question time today—and something about some gas issues in the Timor Sea. I will begin with the issue of health in my electorate and, in particular, the issue of bulk-billing. Even more importantly, I would like to raise the issue of access to medical help, in particular in the Cessnock local government area—my own home town—where the resident to doctor ratio is now approaching 3,000 to one. It has to be said that it is reaching crisis point. I suspect that the resident to doctor ratio in the Prime Minister's electorate, for example, would be something more around 1,200 to one.
This has significant knock-on effects. When you have a doctor on just about every corner, competition is intense, access is easy and bulk-billing rates tend to be high. There is another repercussion—that is, if people have easy access to a doctor, they are more likely to get more than their fair share of return on their Medicare investment. To give a short comparison, again using the Prime Minister's electorate, the bulk-billing rate in the Hunter electorate is around 50.01 per cent; in the Prime Minister's electorate it is in excess of 80 per cent. Similarly, the number of GP visits in the Hunter electorate during the September quarter of 2002 was around 146,000; in the Prime Minister's electorate of Bennelong it was around 186,000. So you can see the impact of a lack of doctors, not only in terms of access but in terms of the return people living in those areas where there is a shortage of doctors get on their Medicare rebate.
I think it is true to say that the highest taxing government in the history of federation is coming very close to securing the title of the government delivering the worst health outcomes in the history of federation. In the Hunter, this really is a crisis and it is time the government dealt with the crisis. Thankfully, due to some very effective work on the part of our local community and, I must say, with some assistance from the Commonwealth minister's office, the Cessnock situation has been alleviated. We have now secured seven new GPs in the course of a few short weeks. However, five of those GPs are there on a temporary basis as postgraduate trainees—doing their work experience in my electorate, if you like. Another is an overseas trained doctor on a temporary visitor's visa—once again, obviously there on a temporary basis. The seventh new doctor in Cessnock is there, for the time being at least, on a part-time basis—once again, possibly only a short-term solution. While we have had some relief in Cessnock, other towns in my electorate suffer similar problems and all the structural issues remain.
One of the big issues in Cessnock is that the area is classed as RRMA 2 and therefore does not qualify for a range of assistance measures designed to both retain doctors in country towns and attract doctors to country towns. Cessnock is considered to be `other metropolitan'—I think that is the term used—which denies it access to all of these programs. This is despite the fact that Cessnock's general practitioners are members of the Hunter Rural Division of General Practice, as opposed to the Hunter Urban Division of General Practice. This is despite the fact that Cessnock's GPs operate very much in a rural manner in their interrelationship with their patients and the local hospital. This is despite the fact that the Royal College of General Practitioners has designated Cessnock as an appropriate place for postgraduate students to do their rural doctor hands-on training, which is why we were able to secure five postgraduate students in Cessnock recently.
There are anomalies in the RRMA system. I am not saying that the government must move tomorrow to change Cessnock to RRMA 4 because, whenever you have these arbitrarily drawn boundaries, there will be knock-on effects and other anomalies will arise. I have asked the minister to have a close look at Cessnock on the basis that it has already been identified as an area of workplace shortage and to introduce some flexibility into the system to allow Cessnock to access some of those programs. I acknowledge that there are currently some good programs to both attract and retain doctors in country areas, but there has to be some flexibility to ensure that those programs are delivered where they are needed most.
Having passed some judgment on the amount of revenue being raised by the government—the seventh anniversary of which we are celebrating today—as compared with the health outcomes, the Medicare levy has gone from $3 billion to $5 billion and yet health outcomes in my electorate are going backwards. I appeal to the minister to have a special look at Cessnock. I have been attempting to organise a meeting between her and Cessnock GPs, who are very keen to discuss these issues. She has indicated her preference to have the local GPs meet with her departmental people initially, and I am happy to accept that. But, if appropriate outcomes are not determined, I will still call upon the minister to give those local GPs the time they need.
Obviously, we need higher rebates for GP services in certain rural and regional communities. We must ensure that GP rebates keep pace with rising medical practice overheads. We need better targeted GP incentive programs, as I have said. We need greater support for our public hospitals. We need an equalisation scheme which guarantees that country residents gain an equal share of their Medicare contributions—the point I was making earlier with respect to access to GPs. We need more moneys for our divisions of general practice for the development of local strategies for dealing with doctor shortages within the regions they service. This might be the mechanism for returning the Medicare investment to the regions—an equalisation scheme that delivers money back from areas which are overserviced to local divisions of general practice. In the medium to long term, most importantly we need to be ensuring that more university places are made available for young people from rural and regional areas, because they are the people who are more likely to want to return to the country areas to practise medicine. It is an important issue.
The second important local electorate issue I want to raise relates to Australia Post. Australia Post recorded a record net profit of $297 million in the financial year 2001-02. But in Cessnock the postal giant is forcing workplace changes and is currently in dispute with the 12 permanents who deliver mail in my local town. Australia Post wants to change the working hours of postal deliverers. It says that the change is technology driven—that the earlier sorting needs to occur in its main centre in Maitland, because that is where the latest technology is available, and the mail be sent to Cessnock later on; therefore, it wants the local postal workers to commence work later. This has big implications for their family incomes. It means denial of overtime opportunities and some of the penalty rate entitlements they current enjoy under their EBA.
I always try very hard to stay out of these issues when they are subject to further discussion between the parties. Maybe even as we speak there is still a meeting going on between Australia Post, the union and those local workers. We are still awaiting those outcomes. I accept that Australia Post is facing enormous new competition in a rapidly changing society and that it has to remain competitive. Much of that comes in the wake of the information revolution. Having said that I prefer to stay out of these negotiations until at least deadlocks are reached, I was most disappointed, while I was driving through Cessnock on Sunday, to notice a postman delivering mail. That surprised me because I was aware that, late Friday afternoon, the permanent postal workers had walked off the job. It is highly unusual, in any case, to see a fully uniformed postal deliverer delivering post on a Sunday.
My investigations revealed that the person on the motor scooter was an employee of or someone retained by Drake Employment. Drake Employment, I understand, has people fully trained in mail delivery services ready to supply to Australia Post when there is a work force shortage for some reason, such as an extraordinary number of people on holiday or sick leave. These people are trained and ready to go if the need arises. That in itself is of concern to me, but what really concerned me in this instance was that the person I saw on Sunday was, effectively, a scab. I always say that, if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and sounds like a duck, it is a duck. There is no other description for bringing in Drake personnel to do the work of Australia Post workers at a time when they have decided to withdraw their labour.
Some might say that residents would be happy for Drake personnel to be delivering the mail because, while the guys were on strike, they would not be securing their mail. I disagree. I think the general public, particularly in my electorate, would agree that those men have the right to withdraw their labour. It is an important point of leverage for them in their negotiations with the corporation. It is outrageous, in my view, for Australia Post to bring in Drake people to do the work of those Australia Post workers over the weekend and to replace them when they have withdrawn their labour. I will be talking to Australia Post about this issue again tomorrow. I certainly hope that this evening's meeting reaches some conclusions and some positive outcomes.
The third thing I want to talk about in relation to my electorate is something I touched on very briefly this morning in the debate on the private member's motion concerning Lang Hancock: restructuring in the coal mining industry in my electorate. It is fair to say, just speaking in general terms, that in the Hunter we are now producing twice as much coal as we were 10 years ago and with half as many people. That is largely, of course, a product of technological change—the large shift from underground coal mining to the more capital intensive open-cut coal mining. This has enormous implications for my electorate in economic, employment and social terms. Huge restructuring, consolidation and rationalisation of mines are taking place. We saw the closure of the Wombo underground mine, the Cumnock underground mine and, more recently, the Nardell mine.
Nardell is a slightly different case in that most of the other closures have come from general restructuring and changing economic conditions. But it appears that Nardell—which is only a couple of years old and which showed such promise in terms of future growth—has been suddenly closedbecause the Australian dollar gained strength, coal prices went down and they struck some difficult geological conditions, which is not unusual. What is unusual about this case is the suddenness of the decision to close the mine and the short period for which the mine has been operating.
The mine is operated by a subsidiary company known as Nardell Coal Corporation, but the major equity holder in the mine is a subsidiary of Macquarie Bank. I spoke to Macquarie Bank tonight and expressed my concern that not only have 100 men lost their jobs but also a huge number of unsecured creditors look like losing a lot of money. It just beggars belief that such a new mine should close so abruptly. I hope that Ferrier Hodgson, the receivers in this case, have some explanations for those creditors in the not too distant future. This is a very concerning development in my electorate: that such a new mine, offering so much in terms of growth, could suddenly be closed. I understand that it is being closed because Macquarie Bank or its subsidiary, the trust that has equity in the mine, has decided that it is all too hard and has called in the receivers.
I am not going to turn to Iraq, as I indicated I would, because I am going to run out of time. I have probably said enough about it in this place. I will just say how outraged I have been, since the last time I spoke on the issue, to see the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in particular, in here waxing lyrical during question time about the atrocities of Saddam Hussein, which we all acknowledge—the events of torture, dispossession, oppression and all of those sorts of things. They are feelings we did not hear expressed during the refugee debate in 2001, when we were turning away Iraqis who were themselves the victims of the very regime he has been referring to during question time on a regular basis. My view is that the hypocrisy of it all is just mind-blowing.
The last thing I will touch on, very briefly, is the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, who, pretty outrageously, took some quotes of mine out of context during question time today. That is fine because, in the past, I have expressed the view that small business people are concerned about unfair dismissal laws. There is no doubt about that: small business people look at a range of issues when they contemplate employing people, and unfair dismissal is one of them. The minister today took some of my comments out of context and mixed them with others on other issues to produce the mix he was looking for. Labor will reject the government's attempt to totally quarantine small-business employers from any action for unfair dismissal. I have said in here a million times before: once a society has made a determination about what constitutes a fair or an unfair dismissal, that standard should be applied equally to all in our society. You cannot say that, just because someone has only 19 work mates, they will not have any protection from unscrupulous employers. And there are unscrupulous employers out there. That is why I have consistently said that there are some problems within the unfair dismissal regime.
I point out again that the regime we operate under now is the government's own regime, as put in place under the Workplace Relations Act 1996. It is a regime that the minister of the day referred to as `a fair go all round'. If the government wants to talk to us about some changes to the regime, and in particular how it affects small business, we welcome that. We welcome changes to the process, but we will not support a proposition that, because someone has only 15 or 19 work mates, they should have no protection from unscrupulous employers whatsoever. That is ridiculous. If the government wants to talk about changes, it should talk to us.

"Gambaro, Teresa, MP",LP,2003-03-03,"—I rise to speak in the cognate debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-03 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-03. In keeping with the theme of finance, I wish to reflect on a matter that is very close to my heart: the state of Queensland. Queensland has earned the title of the Sunshine State. Phrases such as `beautiful one day, perfect the next' resonate with many Australians who long for the sunny climates of this great state. The bayside suburbs on the Redcliffe Peninsula in the electorate of Petrie have seen a growing resurgence in both population and the number of daytrippers to this part of the world.
Despite the picture-perfect images of this wonderful state, there is a growing concern for the manner in which the present Queensland government balances its budget. On Wednesday last week, the Queensland Treasurer, Terry Mackenroth, released the state government's mid-year fiscal and economic review. The outlook is for another budget deficit, the third one in a row. While employment growth is expected to exceed by one-quarter of one percent its projected figure of 2.5 per cent, and economic growth is expected to remain on track at 4.25 per cent, the government is still expecting a deficit of $741 million. This figure is lower than the previous year's $894 million deficit, but it is still a far cry from the prediction in June last year of a Queensland government budget surplus of $23 million. So what has gone wrong? According to the state Treasurer, `Queensland runs a tight fiscal ship and it runs it wisely.' He has advocated no new taxes yet he has forecast a 10 per cent increase in revenue. However, according to the mid-year fiscal and economic review, revenue has fallen from $20.18 billion to $19.69 billion and expenses have risen from $20.157 billion to $20.44 billion. So, if the mid-year revenue figures are down and expenses are up, where is the additional 10 per cent increase in revenue coming from?
The recent housing boom has proved very beneficial to the state government and has resulted in its having a $400 million windfall in stamp duty. Indeed, stamp duty from the housing boom and the subsequent increase in insurance has proved a real winner for state government coffers. But how could the ongoing demand in the housing sector be the source of the 10 per cent increase in state revenue? Perhaps the answer lies in investments that the Queensland government places with the Queensland Investment Corporation.
An independent review of the Queensland Investment Corporation's investment strategy found the strategy to be sound and predicted returns of about 7.5 per cent. That would suggest that something very positive is happening, but that is not the case. Last Wednesday, Mr Mackenroth told the state parliament that the Queensland government forecast a zero return from its QIC investments, which he said were currently running at minus five per cent. Two years ago, he predicted an eight per cent return, and that was downgraded to 2.4 per cent. Finally, it has been downgraded to zero per cent. Mr Mackenroth has claimed that exposure to international domestic sharemarkets was the real culprit.
The irony here is that the Queensland government could have received a greater return, according to the state Treasurer's figures, if it had opened up a savings account at the local bank. But, since the Beattie government's re-election in February 2001, it has spent big in the traditional confines of the executive wing of the Public Service. Commerce Queensland president, Graham Heilbronn, coined it quite nicely when he said:
The Beattie government must take a harder look at its own financial management and make the hard decisions to cut more fat out of the Public Service.
The Queensland Public Sector Union was the only group to publicly state that the Queensland budget was in a very healthy financial state. This is a very interesting stance given the recent cuts to the Public Service. Again, the state government did give the Public Service a 3.5 per cent wage increase over three years. Unfortunately in this great state of ours, the nurses were not so lucky. The state government could only offer them a three per cent increase, and the health minister referred to them and their profession in a most derogatory way.
The cuts to the Public Service came by way of 2,000 voluntary early retirement packages. We were told that this would save roughly $70 million and would cover the extra 0.5 per cent increase but there would be no reduction in the output from the Public Service. The cuts were not meant to affect services. In parts of regional Queensland, road programs could be affected as a result of 200 jobs being cut from the government's regional road building and maintenance unit. How do the regions feel, given that the Queensland government—according to figures it provided to the National Road Transport Commission—slashed road funding by 21 per cent in 2001-02? In 2000-01, the Queensland government spent $1.1 billion, and in 2001-02, that figure has dropped to $713 million.
This major reduction in expenditure has many people in the business community concerned. According to the Centre for Business and Industry in Brisbane, there is a concern that the state government allowed the capital expenditure budget to dwindle at a time when capital expenditure should be on the increase. The decrease in capital expenditure has fallen in the 2002-03 budget from $5.3 billion to $4.8 billion. The centre states that, to many in business, government indecision on major productive infrastructure projects is sounding warning bells.
The failure of the Beattie government to win over business was echoed recently by the President of Commerce Queensland, Graham Heilbronn, who said that a business-led recovery was highly unlikely. This was indeed reflected in the Pulse survey, released by Commerce Queensland two days after the Treasurer's review last week. Business in Queensland is visibly concerned, and it has every right to be so. The Pulse survey found that business had a strong impression that the Queensland government would increase taxes. This comes on the back of a recently announced ambulance levy of $88 per household, which is expected to raise over $100 million when it begins in July this year.
The levy was announced despite a record $558 million emergency services budget, announced in 2002, to provide an extra $18 million for ambulance services; a $50 million program to buy vehicles and build new ambulance and fire stations; and $18.9 million for a new volunteers program. In releasing the Pulse survey, Commerce Queensland's chief executive, Joe Barnewall, saw it as unfortunate that the Queensland government would be introducing an ambulance levy. He had this to say about it: `Irrespective of how it is marketed, it is a new tax and it certainly does cause a great degree of unrest and unease out there in the community.' 
As a Queenslander, my unease rests with the financial skill of the Beattie government, so I understand greatly the nervousness of the business community. The Queensland government's blatant lack of financial management questions the very integrity of its claim that there will be no new taxes. Perhaps in its efforts to raise this 10 per cent revenue through avenues other than additional taxes, it has begun what appears to be the great Queensland state government fire sale, beginning with the sale of prime residential land. In the last month, the state government has showcased two pieces of prime residential real estate that it hopes to sell—at Stafford Heights in my electorate, and also the old site of the Boggo Road jail in inner Brisbane. Each piece of land is worth millions. In my electorate of Petrie, the state member for Stafford, Terry Sullivan, held a public meeting to talk about the proposed development in Stafford Heights, which is on a section of land that is adjacent to the very important Mountains to Mangroves corridor. The corridor runs from the Ramsar-listed Moreton Bay across the federal electorates of Lilley and Petrie to Brisbane's Forest Park in the electorate of Dickson.
The corridor is so significant that it secured federal funding from the electorates of both Lilley and Petrie. The land is currently used by many local people as a recreation area and includes a sectioned-off, dog-friendly park. The proposed development has only one principal access point, which will cause major congestion for local streets. An estimate of the land value is somewhere between $5 million and $9 million. That would certainly be a nice little revenue earner, despite restricting the habitat for many species from the adjacent Mountains to Mangroves corridor that use this particular area of vegetation.
The member for Stafford is probably only one of two people I know who are for the development; the remaining hundreds of people are against it. Perhaps he knows that if he delivers this nice little revenue earner for the state government he, too, may be rewarded. He does not care that the people are against it. He said at a public meeting that he did not really care what the people of Stafford Heights thought about him—so much for being elected by the people for the people! Perhaps Mr Sullivan has a new mantra that borrows more from the movie Jerry Maguire than from any sense of duty to his own electorate.
More is the pity that the state government is using the guise of 20 per cent more public housing proposed in this development to give it some sense of duty to the people of Queensland. According to the state government, we need more dwellings, particularly in Brisbane, to house close to 9,000 on the public housing waiting list. But a quick check shows that the number of public housing dwellings in Stafford has remained static at 1,321 in both the 1996 and 2001 census, even though there has been a considerable sell-off of a number of public housing dwellings in the same area over the past few years.
If the Queensland government were really serious about public housing, they would not have cut funding to the Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement by $600,000, while the federal government increased funding by $1.5 million. They would not have sold off public housing dwellings while the waiting list continues to grow. At both ends of my electorate—for example, in the Deception Bay and Stafford Heights areas—there are public housing dwellings sitting idle. There is a litany of examples where the Beattie government have failed to service the Queensland public.
One of the saddest examples of how the Beattie government is redirecting funding is the reduction of staff in the Children, Families and Young People Directorate, which is responsible for child protection. According to the annual report of the Queensland Department of Families released late last year, staff in the Children, Families and Young People Directorate have been reduced from 163 to 143. This reduction occurred at a time when child protection notifications have risen by 20 per cent to almost 15,294. Since 2000-01, the number of child protection cases that have not been finalised has risen to almost 3,000. Couple this with dramatic increases in hospital waiting lists, and the very integrity of how the Queensland government provides for the Queensland people comes into question.
According to the 2001-02 Queensland Health annual report, public hospital emergency departments were unable to meet Queensland Health's target for treating patients of category 1, 2, 3 and 4 status. It found that 99 per cent of urgent emergency patients were treated within the recommended time frame—and Queensland Health recommends all category 1 patients be seen immediately. However, 71 per cent of category 2 patients were seen within the recommended 10-minute time frame, with a target of 80 per cent. Only 56 per cent of category 3 patients were seen within the time frame of half an hour, short of the target by almost 20 per cent. The report showed that the number of patients had increased from 718,000 to 722,000.
I am highly supportive of the work of all our health professionals, from nurses to specialists and the administrative staff of our hospitals. They all provide the outstanding service that led to Premier Beattie's statement in 2001 that Queensland has the best public hospitals. He is probably right. But he did not honour that statement when he was unwilling to give Queensland nurses the 3.5 per cent increase that he offered to the public service, downgrading it to three per cent because it was too expensive. So what value does Queensland Health put on the lives of thousands of people who are on the ever- growing waiting lists? In my electorate, there are 802 overdue -cases across three categories on the waiting list at Redcliffe Hospital and 34 overdue cases on the Prince Charles waiting list at Chermside.
Too often the state government points the finger at the federal government, claiming there have been cuts. But that is not the case. Let us have a look at what the Commonwealth's commitment to state health has been. The states have benefited from a 28 per cent increase in funding under the current arrangements, with a record $31.7 billion in Commonwealth funding for public hospitals. The private health insurance reforms, such as the federal government's 30 per cent rebate, are taking the pressure off public hospitals, with a 12 per cent increase in admissions to private hospitals. Under the current Australian health care agreements, the Commonwealth is providing $682 million to specifically help states improve their safety and quality. The Commonwealth was also instrumental in establishing the Australian Council for Safety and Quality in Health Care to lead national efforts in this area. In addition, there is $72.7 million in the 2002-03 budget to improve access for rural Australians. And the Commonwealth is taking the lead on improving cancer care—obtaining state health ministers' agreement to prepare specific proposals on practical improvements to the organisation, delivery and funding of radiation, oncology and related cancer services within 12 months.
Let us not forget the GST. When the GST was introduced, the federal Treasurer decreed that no state would be worse off. In the first round, in 2000-01, Queensland received over $4 billion in GST revenue. In 2001-02 it received over $5 billion. In 2003-04 Queensland is expected to be one of the three states in Australia which is recommended to receive more from the GST than the amount that was guaranteed by the federal government. According to the Commonwealth Grants Commission, Queensland is expected to receive $7.42 billion, up almost $404 million on the previous year. That is a significant increase in revenue for the state government, and it may well be a large chunk of any sudden unknown increase in revenue for the Beattie government. It demonstrates the financial input from the federal government to the state government and makes us loudly ask the question: where is the money going? One of the chief benefits of returning GST revenue to the states was that it gave them a growing pool of revenue to be spent as they wished. But public hospitals, education and transport—all of these—could well benefit from this freedom to allocate funding as required by the budgetary priorities.
There is a pattern forming. Facing three consecutive deficits, the Beattie government needs to do more now than provide rhetoric on how its investments did not do so well or how it can find blame with external factors. It needs to do more than use the media prowess of Premier Beattie to falsely claim that the federal government is not investing in Queensland. There are seven wage bargaining cases facing the Queensland government at the moment. Even the Queensland Teachers Union, once a flag waver of the Beattie government, particularly in my electorate, is running a public campaign to improve class sizes in Queensland's state schools. Queensland is a great state, but the Queensland state government really needs to remember that its financial mis-management is impacting on business confidence and contributing to a general malaise among many public service areas, such as health and education. That is not so good for this great sunshine state.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 2002-2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1,speech
"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2003-03-03,"—In addressing the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 2002-2003 and the Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 2002-2003, firstly let me comment briefly on the contribution by the member for Petrie. If I recall correctly, she was telling us about the importance of and the benefits that we get from the private health system. Perhaps it is worthwhile noting, in the context of private health, private medicine and private hospitals, that for the people of the Northern Territory—who are obligated to pay, as they have, to take up private health insurance because of the threats imposed upon them by government—there is only one private hospital in the Northern Territory, and that, of course, is in Darwin. The previous Northern Territory government made a decision to allocate a private hospital ward in the grounds of the publicly funded Alice Springs Hospital, but—and it may not come as any surprise to you, Mr Deputy Speaker Baressi; it certainly was no surprise to me—when expressions of interest were called, no-one was prepared to provide a private hospital service for Central Australia unless they received massive and direct government subsidies. This of course means that the so-called benefits of private medicine do not belong to the bulk of people in my electorate.
I say to the member for Petrie, who is no longer in the chamber, and to the other advocates in the government of the massive benefits of private health—noting the way in which they have inveigled, persuaded, threatened and cajoled members of the Australian taxpaying community to take out private health insurance—that, if you happen to live in a remote part of Australia, the benefits of private health insurance in terms of private hospitals are next to nil. This is not admitted to and not owned up to by the government. What we want in the bush is massive additional investment into public health and the public hospital system. Whilst I am not going to debate tonight the issue of Medicare and bulk-billing, suffice it to say that, if you look at those people who access bulk-billing in the electorate in which I live and work, you will see that they are people who benefit from direct publicly funded health services. I do not believe at this point that there is any bulk-billing practice in Alice Springs. I will, however, be undertaking a survey of all medical practices in my electorate over the next little while to establish the veracity of that and other claims.
One of the matters that I want to raise tonight is the question of Indigenous education. You will recall, Mr Deputy Speaker, that on 14 November last year, the Minister for Education, Science and Training released the National report to parliament on Indigenous education and training, 2001. I took particular interest in that report. If you trawl through the Hansard, you will see that I have used the opportunities given to me in this chamber over many years to talk about the issue of Indigenous education and its importance. In the foreword of the report that the minister launched, he wrote, `In order for Indigenous Australians to ... shape the kind of future and the kind of Australia they want, the key is education.' Hear, hear to that! `There can be no higher priority in a complex and broad portfolio than to improve educational outcomes for Indigenous Australians.' Hear, hear to that, I say! However, something has happened between the launching of that report and the subsequent way in which his department is administering the portfolio. You would be aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, that Indigenous Australians are benefiting from and have benefited from the Indigenous Education Direct Assistance programs, which encompass the Aboriginal Tutorial Assistance Scheme, ATAS, the Vocational and Educational Guidance for Aboriginals Scheme, VEGAS, and the Aboriginal Student Support and Parent Awareness scheme, ASSPA. These programs give Indigenous students access to valuable tutorial assistance, among other things, and encourage them and their parents to be more involved in school activities. ATAS, the tutorial assistance scheme, is an extremely well-regarded program. They all are. 
However, on 29 January this year, schools around the Northern Territory were surprised by correspondence they received from the Northern Territory State Office Manager of the Department of Education, Science and Training. He wrote to all NT schools on that date about changes to the IEDA programs budget in 2003. What these changes did was undermine and white-ant the capacity of Indigenous Territorians to have the access that they previously had to these programs. He wrote in his letter:
Given the level of the IEDA program currently delivered in the Northern Territory, it has been necessary for DEST to review its administrative arrangements. The new arrangements outlined in the attachment to this letter will ensure that the program maintains its focus on outcomes for students and that available funds are used in a way that will maximise the benefits for Indigenous students.
This came as somewhat of a surprise. Indeed, people who work in the education field in the Northern Territory, from the Northern Territory education minister, Syd Stirling, down to the Aboriginal workers in schools, were astounded by what was presented to them in this correspondence. Because what was presented to them in this correspondence was a radical reduction of the capacity for the tutorial assistance scheme and others—but, in particular, the tutorial assistance scheme. This included cuts of up to two-thirds to the tuition during school hours program, from a maximum 300 minutes per student per week to 100 minutes. Student numbers are to be capped at 2002 levels, so no additional students are allowed access to this program as a result of this directive from the department. There is a cap on the number of schools that operate ATAS. Only schools that ran ATAS programs in 2002 and submitted a report would be considered for funding in 2003. Only in very exceptional circumstances would students have access to the tuition during school hours program. There was to be no access to this program for transition students. Crucially, homework centre hours have been significantly reduced, and no new programs will be considered. 
These radical changes to a successful program will have enormous implications for the Northern Territory government's Indigenous Secondary Education Strategy and, in my view, will have an effect which will be most dramatic and very negative on Aboriginal communities right around the Northern Territory—from the urban schools in Alice, Darwin, Katherine and elsewhere to the remote bush communities. It is a disgrace that the federal government and its minister for education, who purports to—and, indeed, we had great hopes that he would—demonstrate his commitment to Indigenous education, can wreak such havoc on a much relied upon program without even having the decency to inform the Northern Territory government about its intentions or indeed to have any discussions with the school communities, the parents and the students themselves about what was being proposed. No discussion, no communication, just a fait accompli.
The first that the Northern Territory government heard of these changes was after the beginning of the school year when angry principals and parents began to call the minister for education and, indeed, my office to demand to know what was going on. I put out a release on 12 February raising my concerns about this issue, and my office was subsequently told that I would receive a letter from the minister, which I have yet to receive. I have also been told that the minister was going to fix this problem. The minister has yet to fix this problem and as a consequence there is a great deal of insecurity within the education system in the Northern Territory and amongst Indigenous parents because of what this means for them and their children. On 17 February the minister responded, when he said on ABC radio, `What I am determined to do is get this in school tuition program, keep it working and provide whatever funding I possibly can to so that we keep this program working.' Whoopee! There is a dramatic difference between having something working, having it working effectively and having cut the guts out of it in the way which has been proposed by this correspondence. There are many people waiting to hear what the minister is going to say and how he is going to fix this particular problem.
The IEDA programs are working. Last week I visited the Batchelor Institute in Alice Springs. They gave a number of examples of how this program was going to affect them and their students. In the context of this most recent document that has been sent out, they argued that the assumptions which appear to inform it are as follows. Every adult has had access to and outcomes from primary and secondary education; simply not true in the case of the Northern Territory. Everyone has a good understanding of the English language and numeracy; again, simply not true in the Northern Territory. Everyone understands the complex western capitalist culture of Australia and the academic disciplines that inform the most basic of awards; simply not true in the Northern Territory. Languages are not disciplines. ATAS funds a tutor to learn Indonesian, French or Latin—why not English? Indeed, why not? Access to tutors is easy; that of course is just a joke, as pointed out in correspondence I have seen from the Batchelor Institute to the education department. The use of tutorial assistance for a bridging access or enabling course is because of a shortfall in course design; that of course is also a joke and assessment will tell what is required. I am not going to read the details of that because there is another matter I want to come to in a moment. Let me just say that if the Minister for Education, Science and Training is actually fair dinkum about improving educational outcomes for Indigenous students across Australia—particularly in this case in the Northern Territory—he will not only make sure that the funding is restored to ensure that those programs can operate at the levels that they operated at last year, but he will also ensure that they are extended so that they can meet the demands that are there in the Northern Territory for the expansion of these programs, because they are crucially important.
There is another matter I want to raise this evening, which involves another minister—that is, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs. It involves the cuts to the living allowance and pharmaceutical benefits that the government has now invoked upon East Timorese people who have failed the application to the Refugee Review Tribunal. This is a very important moral issue, in my view. Three weeks ago an elderly couple came into my office in Darwin—Mrs Siau Ping Li and her husband, Mr Fong Ting Jong. Mrs Li is 57 years of age and Mr Jong is 69. This couple were the first East Timorese asylum seekers in Darwin to face the Refugee Review Tribunal. On 21 February, the tribunal handed down its decision to reject their appeal to stay in Australia—a decision that is expected to be duplicated to every one of the 1,800 East Timorese asylum seekers across the country who are currently subject to this process. This process, by which a group that is part of the Australian community has been subjected to years of uncertainty and neglect, has been atrociously handled from the beginning. The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs rejected our calls last year, which I make again tonight, to deal with this community humanely by creating a special humanitarian visa class. Instead, he insisted on continuing with the torturous, drawn out, costly legal process that is slowly destroying the spirit of these people—and, I might say, undermining the confidence of many in our community towards the minister and the government in relation to dealing with these issues.
I briefly want to talk about Mrs Li and Mr Fong. Last week Mrs Lee and Mr Fong were told by the department that their meagre allowance under the Asylum Seekers Assistance Scheme, which is less than a standard Centrelink allowance, was being taken away along with their access to Medicare and pharmaceutical benefits. This elderly couple—faced with a $1,000 bill, thanks to the RRT's rejection of their appeal to stay—can no longer afford to eat, pay their rent or purchase the basic essentials that allow them to survive and take part in the community without the support of charities or friends. But it gets worse. A note from last Friday's Northern Territory News states:
Mr Fong was scheduled for biopsy on 3 March to see whether or not he has throat cancer. He has to be fed by his wife often. Mrs Li has worked for many years as a volunteer for the Red Cross. She also needs medical care for chronic high blood pressure. Mrs Li said that the decision to cut financial and medical support would render them destitute.
That is what this government is doing to this community. It is something which I am very concerned and, indeed, most ashamed of. I am astonished that the government could fall to these depths. I was given to expect that this minister had some sense of compassion or feeling and that he would deal compassionately with these sorts of issues. But let me say that this is simply not the case.
I might point out that one of our members, the member for McMillan, was ejected from the chamber today for doing something which I think the world ought to know about. This minister is supposed to be the advocate and look after the interests of these people. These people are the most humble of people and I would have thought they had a right to expect that they would be granted permanent residency long before this. Through no fault of their own they have had delay after delay by successive governments dealing with their particular applications. But this minister simply plays to the gallery, and we had that writ large today. The member for McMillan was ejected from this chamber because we on this side of the House were running a book as to how many times the minister would look up to the gallery during the course of an answer to a question. The member for McMillan was close to the mark—that in response to a question, the minister turned to look up at the gallery not one, two, three or four times, but 15 times. The question was asked from the floor of the chamber and the minister stands behind the dispatch box and looks up at the gallery 15 times for approval. It is a demonstration of how sincere this minister is.
The minister has also said that the East Timorese asylum seekers who have sought refuge in this country have been secreting themselves in the community. That is far from the truth. There is no issue of secreting these people in the community in the Northern Territory. We want them to stay as citizens in the Northern Territory. They have been offered support by the Northern Territory government—indeed, from no less a person than the Chief Minister. The Northern Territory community wants these people to stay and does not want them to be dealt with unfairly or harshly—or in the way this government is treating them.
There is a very simple way around this. To help these people maintain the dignity that we want them to have the minister should not, in desperation, send them back to the uncertainty of East Timor when they have made Australia their home—many after eight or nine years of living here. Many of these people have had children born in Australia or have been educated here and regard themselves as Australians, yet we have this minister saying that they are, in effect, deceiving us. The deception is on the part of governments—whether Labor or Liberal, we as governments have deceived them. These people had a valid expectation that they would be treated properly, humanely and fairly by the Australian community, but that responsibility has been abrogated by successive governments. We now find that these people are suffering because of the callousness, the lack of compassion and the lack of feeling of this government, and in particular the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs.
Debate (on motion by Mr Bevis) adjourned.",REPS,<title>APPROPRIATION BILL (NO. 3) 2002-2003</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,14,1,speech
"Bevis, Arch, MP",ALP,2003-03-03,"—I have lost track of how many times the Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2002 [No. 2] has been debated in this chamber and in the Senate. It has been the subject of inquiries by Senate committees and more than a few questions without notice to the minister—usually dorothy dixers—as it was today. With minor adjustments, this is a remnant of the huge bill that was introduced by former Minister Peter Reith as part of his second wave laws and which was the subject of extensive investigation and comment at the time.
When there was another of these industrial relations bills before the parliament during our last week of sitting, I commented that it was just like Groundhog Day in the United States. There was a sense of Groundhog Day in this chamber as we went through a debate on a bill that was very much like bills we have debated on a number of other occasions. Here we are again with a Groundhog Day sensation, debating a bill that the parliament has clearly said it does not support but which the government insists on pursuing. The minister is a bit like Punxsutawney Phil, the gopher that comes out on Groundhog Day for the predictions of the weather. Punxsutawney Phil brings out these bills on a regular basis and they get knocked over on a regular basis, but, much like the punching clown that former Prime Minister Paul Keating used to fondly refer to, they keep bobbing back up. I must say that they bob back up with basically the same idea that got them on their backside in the first place.
One of the things that surprises me about this minister is that, having been in his job for some years now, I thought he would have developed a few ideas and a few plans of his own. It is clear from the revolving door of bills—basically, Peter Reith's legislation—that the current minister, Mr Abbott, has no real clue, plan or idea about the operation of industrial relations, other than to regurgitate the previously presented material or to play games with the tactics. The problem the government has with all of these things is that they usually present a bill which has—as this one has—some superficial political attraction. The reason they advance those bills is that they hope to get some political benefit from the games that are played, in this chamber and outside, as the issues are debated or presented—usually in an inaccurate way. This government, this minister and the minister before him are not honest brokers. They do not conduct affairs in industrial relations as independent, honest brokers, seeking to put in place a fair and proper system for workers and employers for the good of the nation as a whole.
That is not a view held by members of the Labor Party alone. The fact is that this bill—like the others doing the circuit, going backwards and forwards between here and the Senate—has been rejected by a majority of the Senate. It would be nice if the Labor Party had a majority in the Senate in its own right. I would be very happy if that were the case, but we all know that it is not. The reason this bill gets rejected is that few people outside the Liberal and National party rooms support any of this. That is why it continually gets defeated. It is being driven by an ideology that is harmful to ordinary Australian workers and also to Australian business. It is not in the national interest, although the government seem to think that it is in their short-term political interest.
The fact that the government come to these debates with dirty hands is clearly understood across the Australian community—so much so that it even gets mentioned in publications such as Inside Canberra. Inside Canberra is not a publication that many of our constituents would be familiar with. It is, if you like, a trade publication. People subscribe to it, and it provides in-house news, so to speak, on what is going on around the corridors of the parliament. Just last year, Inside Canberra had an article about the current Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations and the way he conducts industrial relations. The article talked about the fact that industrial relations was an issue that ranked low in the minds of the voters but one where Labor had a strong lead over the coalition in public support. It said:
There was a time when the minister running industrial relations was supposed to do something about settling dangerous strikes, not exacerbate them. When Harold Holt was Minister for Labor in the Menzies Government and a serious strike broke out or threatened he would immediately get in touch with his good friend, Albert Monk, the ACTU president, to try to facilitate a settlement. Tony Abbott, on the other hand, stands firmly in the employers' corner at all times.
And he does. He makes no bones about it. When there is a dispute—and the article goes on to refer to a dispute that was happening at the time in BHP—he refuses to do anything. The article states that Tony Abbott `refused to do anything other than say that the strikers are law breakers'. 
I well recall how, during a dispute at one of the component suppliers in the car industry, the same minister said that the striking workers were guilty of treason. They were in fact taking industrial action, and it was lawful. It was legitimate, legal, industrial action, for which they were publicly berated by this minister, as if they were guilty of treason. He used those words; he said those workers were `guilty of treason.' In a debate about industrial relations, you cannot go to the people of Australia and say, `Here is a set of new laws that we are putting in place,' when the people know that that is your form. When people know that in every step you have taken in industrial relations as a minister you have tried to take rights from ordinary Australian workers—and to take from the industrial commission the discretion it has to look at cases on merit and decide things freely—you cannot expect them to embrace your proposals. At every turn, that has been the record of this minister and this government, and this is another one of those proposals.
This bill is supposed to be about compulsory ballots for workers intending to take strike action. Unlike some of the other bills that have quite Orwellian titles, this one does roughly reflect what it is about. It is the rhetoric that goes with the bill that does not reflect what is in it. I sat and listened to the debate before the House rose two weeks ago, and I heard a number of people on the other side talk about this terrible problem of strikes and the democratisation we need in the work force to make sure these ballots are held. 
There are a couple of interesting things that need to be put in the mix. One is that strikes are at a very low level. The government boasts about this fact, and it is a fact: strikes are at very low levels. I cannot understand the rationale for saying, on the one hand, `Strikes are at very low levels that we have not seen for 30 or 40 years,' but on the other hand, at the same time, saying, `It is absolutely imperative for the operation of our economy that we put in place a legislative requirement that there be a very complex balloting process before anyone can take strike action.' Hang on: you have just told us that there are no strikes happening, so why have we got this bill before the parliament? What is the genuine industry workplace requirement to have this bill here? The answer is that there is none. There is a political agenda and a philosophical agenda, but there is no substance driving that. Industry is not looking for it, companies are not asking for it, the economy does not need it and it is, in fact, oppressive.
Before I leave the issue of the decline in strikes, let me point out once again, for the record, that the major shifts in strike activity in Australia did not occur when John Howard became Prime Minister. The two major shifts in the pattern of strikes in Australia occurred during the former Labor government's time in office. During the period from 1983 to 1992, there was a 50 per cent reduction in strikes, from a much higher base. The accord process did produce a level of industrial harmony that was out of step with the level during the decades before it. That was one of the significant achievements, I think, of the former Labor government and its accord with the trade union movement.
Members on the other side also talk about the United Kingdom. They say: `Labor Party members do not talk about Tony Blair. They should talk about Tony Blair and the British Labour government.' The Liberal Party say that the British Labour Party have introduced these laws and we in the Australian Labor Party are somehow out of step with that. I am sure that is what they are told to say by the minister's brief. I suggest to those on the other side of the chamber, before they hop up and say that again, that they ask the minister's office to provide them with the details of the operation of the UK law and then compare those with the proposals that the Liberal Party in Australia have advanced. There are balloting requirements in the United Kingdom, but they are significantly different to the balloting requirements here in this bill. The government is comparing apples with oranges. The only similarity between the two pieces of legislation is that they are both about ballots to do with strikes. This is not the same as the UK legislation, and members of the government should stop making that reference if they want to be honest in the presentation of the argument in this debate.
The International Labour Organisation has made some comment about provisions of this kind in legislation, and some of that comment was referred to when this bill—in a previous guise—went before a Senate committee for consideration. I will quote quickly from that Senate report. It refers to a submission provided by the International Centre for Trade Union Rights, which said:
It is true that the ILO supervisory bodies have, in the past, taken the view that mandatory pre-strike ballots do not necessarily conflict with the principle of freedom of association. However they have also maintained that the legal procedures for declaring a strike, such as secret ballots:
·	should be reasonable;
·	should not place substantial limitations on the means of action open to trade unions;
·	should not be so complicated as to make it practically impossible to declare a legal strike; and
·	are acceptable, and do not involve any violation of the principle of freedom of association, only when they are intended to promote democratic principles within trade union organisations.
I put it to you that this bill would fail that test. I am not convinced that this bill would stand up to a challenge before the ILO. The government do not seem too concerned about that. They have other legislation that has been found wanting at the ILO and they just ignore it or, in the case of one piece of legislation, they withdraw from the ILO convention they were contravening. When it comes to actually conforming to the minimum international standards set by the ILO, the Howard government are not too concerned about it. They either ignore the fact that they are in breach of the standards or, as they did on one occasion, they withdraw from the ILO protocol rather than put Australia in line with the provisions in that minimum protocol.
Professor Ron McCallum gave evidence about some of these matters when a very similar bill was before the parliament. I certainly would not in any way misrepresent Professor Ron McCallum's views, and I readily acknowledge that this bill is a little different to the bill he was making a submission about. Ron McCallum is one of the most respected industrial relations authorities not only in Australia but in the world. His advice is sought in Europe and in the United States, and he is well recognised around the globe as a very capable person in this field. He said:
... I suspect, from my long experience in labour law, that such a bureaucratic system will drop industrial action down from union executives and union secretaries to wildcat action. I think we will see an increase in short-term wildcat action, and there will be a series of legal decisions seeking to assert that wildcat action on the shop floor can be sheeted home to trade union officials.
He then refers to cases where that has happened overseas.
We do have some experience with this sort of legislation in Australia. The former Liberal government in Western Australia had provisions like this in place through the Kierath bill. That was, in my view, the worst industrial law in the country—actually worse than Peter Reith's law, and that is a big call. The Kierath law had a requirement for compulsory balloting before strikes. We should talk to people in Western Australia about how that operated. I notice that there is a government member from Western Australia in the chamber. The truth is that it did not operate. The government, the unions and, for that matter, the employers understood that the legislation was non-functional. It was ignored—that is what happened. It was ignored because everybody in the process knew that, in spite of the political rhetoric that the Liberal government went on with, it just did not work. It made matters worse, so no-one took any notice of it. If that is the sort of approach you want to adopt in legislation in the national parliament, you should at least be honest about it. 
There is another thing that government members need to be honest about. We already have in our legislation today a provision for secret ballots to be ordered. Anybody who thinks there is a problem with a ballot or with a strike that may be mooted has the opportunity to go along to the industrial commission—the independent umpire—put their case and actually have an order issued requiring a secret ballot to be held. Do you know how many applications have been made for that? Hardly any. Unfortunately, the most recent figures I have are a couple of years out of date, but I doubt very much whether there has been any change over the last couple of years. Over a four-year period, as at the end of the 1990s, there had been a sum total of nine applications. Under the existing Liberal government law, there were nine applications in four years to have a strike ballot conducted. We have a low level of strikes, which prompts the obvious question: why do we need this law at all? We already have in the law of the land today an opportunity for people to get an order requiring a compulsory ballot, which is what this bill seeks to impose, but no-one uses it.
If this is such an important issue, why is it that virtually nobody has bothered to seek a compulsory ballot before the strike occurs? Why haven't they done it? Why haven't the employers, who you tell us are concerned about this, ever applied for this in the past? Indeed, why hasn't the government used its leverage through the Employment Advocate or any one of its other mates to seek to have these ballots conducted? This government's law currently has a provision that allows the order to be issued requiring that a secret ballot be held. Again, the answer is the same: there is, in fact, no need for this in the workplace. There is no driver for this coming from the shop floor, whether it is from the bosses' side of the desk or the workers' side of the desk. This is being driven for the crass political advantage that the Prime Minister and the current minister think they can get out of it. 
The thread that runs through most of the comments you get from Liberal-National Party speakers on this matter is that they are democratising the workplace. They say that they are stopping workers from being forced into a decision they do not want to take and that this is all about making workplaces fairer and more democratic. Let us put that to the test. Let us democratise the process of industrial relations and give shareholders the same rights. Let us say that, before an employer can lock out a worker—that is, before the employer can withdraw their capital, as distinct from the worker, who withdraws their labour—they actually have to have a vote of the shareholders. It does not happen, and the government does not want it to happen. When this was in a different guise we actually moved an amendment in this place. As the shadow minister, I moved an amendment to do just that. It said that, if you are fair dinkum about this and you want to democratise the process and say that workers have to have a compulsory vote before there is any industrial action, let us do the same with employers. If you want to be fair dinkum about democratising it, do it with both sides of the argument. But this government, the Liberal and National parties who sit opposite, have never been willing to do that—not once.
The case is much stronger for shareholder ballots before lockouts. When strikes occur, typically they are fairly short term, although there was for some time under this government a growth in long-term disputes. Typically, strikes last for a couple of days or maybe a week; if one lasts for two weeks, it is a major dispute. How long are lockouts conducted for? Lockouts are conducted for not just days or weeks but months, and this is not in just one or two isolated cases. People have heard me recite a number of examples in the past. At Joy Mining, there was a three-month lockout. ACI locked out its workers for five months; on Christmas Eve, it shut the gate on them. The daddy of them all, of course, was G&K O'Connor Abattoirs, which locked out its workers for nine months because they would not take a pay cut. There was not one word of criticism from any member of the Liberal Party when those workers were being denied the opportunity to work for nine months.
If you want to be fair dinkum about having a democratic process, get up and say you support the requirement that shareholders have a vote before companies lock out their workers. Then I might start to take some of you seriously. This government and this minister have been properly pegged by everyone in the Australian community when it comes to the issue of industrial relations. They do not come with clean hands, they are not honest brokers; they are biased, they are vindictive and they are driven by ideology. The Australian people do not expect that and will not tolerate that from a government seeking to administer industrial relations—which, after all, is what regulates the capacity of most Australians to put bread and butter on the table and a roof over their head.",REPS,<title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT (SECRET BALLOTS FOR PROTECTED ACTION) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,16,1,speech
"Randall, Don, MP",LP,2003-03-03,"—It is my pleasure to speak on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. This bill has been in this House before. It is back here again because it has not passed through the Senate, which is largely controlled by the Labor Party, the Democrats and the Greens in concert. Before I say anything further, I will say that it was interesting to sit here this evening and watch the previous speaker, the member for Brisbane, try to recreate history and put his own inflection on the situation. As the opposition spokesman for workplace relations in the previous parliament, he could not cut through, and he is now trying to fight back from the back benches. There was a diatribe of the same old mantra of the Labor Party protecting the unions and having a go at the bosses. It is the old-fashioned class warfare. We know the Labor Party is largely controlled by the unions. Whether there is a 60-40 rule or a 50-50 rule, the majority of people on the other side of this House have a pedigree in the union movement. They must belong to a union to be a member in this place and they depend on the union movement for their preselection. I will go into that further later on.
The fundamental principle of democracy in the world hinges on the secret ballot. It is only totalitarian and authoritarian regimes that hate secret ballots. I repeat: it is only totalitarian and authoritarian regimes that hate secret ballots. They do not like democracy because they want the control in the hands of one or two. This is no different from the union movement in this country, which is supported by its friends in this House, the Australian Labor Party. Why is this legislation back here? It is back here because the purpose of the bill is to provide that industrial action taken by employees will not be protected unless it is approved by secret ballot. It is a fundamental right in a country like Australia. We are not talking about some draconian country that is controlled by one, as in a dictatorship, or by a socialist government. We are talking about one of the great democracies, and the second-oldest democracy in the world, Australia. The secret ballot is pivotal to this democracy.
It is clear-cut and understood by everybody that the secret ballot will ensure that those participating in an action have decided upon the action and have not been misled or bullied into it as a result of the union they are forced to belong to. When I say `forced to belong to', I do so because we know in this country that the rule of no ticket, no start still applies. Whenever you try to wipe it out, it goes underground. We have heard in the Cole royal commission, for example, large companies saying that they find ways on their books of paying the union membership of employees who do not wish to belong just to save peace on the industrial site. As I have said in this place before, if the Mafia were running an extortion scam like this, they would be locked up. But the union movement in this country can get away with standover tactics and extortion and have people dragooned into unions and into taking action.
I will mention the measures of this bill very briefly to get them on the record, because they have been mentioned by many people in this House. Applications for secret ballots must be made to the commission and can be made only when a bargaining period is in place not more than 30 days before the last occurred nominal expiry date for any relevant certified agreements. What must be included in the application? Applications must include the question to be put or proposed in the ballot, the nature of the proposed action and details of the types of employees. The commission must determine applications within two working days of the applications being made. The application must not be granted unless the commission is satisfied that the applicant has genuinely tried and is still trying to reach agreement with the employer. These provisions are to make sure the ballots are well run, democratically organised and properly controlled. 
What is required for a ballot to approve action? At least 40 per cent of the relevant employees must vote and more than 50 per cent of the votes must approve the action. That is fair; 50 per cent plus one is the rule of majority in this country, so that is inordinately fair. The action must commence within a 30-day period beginning on the latter of either the date of the declaration of the ballot or the latest nominal expiry date of any existing certified agreements. Who can be the ballot agent? The ballot agent can be the commission, or it may appoint the AEC or another person as the authorised ballot agent. However, the non-AEC person must meet certain criteria before being appointed.
Here is a very interesting case. This is how concerned and interested the government is to see properly conducted secret ballots: the Commonwealth will be directly liable to the ballot agent for 80 per cent of reasonable ballot costs, provided that the applicant notifies the industrial registrar of the cost of the ballot and the industrial registrar determines the reasonable ballot cost. So the federal government is saying, `We are not only going to help you organise the structure of this process but we will pay 80 per cent of the costs.' That is very fair, especially given the outcomes that may flow. The limits of this bill are that an order for a ballot or result of a ballot may be challenged in a court. In order for the ballot to be challenged, it would generally need to be in contravention of secret ballot provisions that amount to more than just a technical breach or involve fraud or misleading the commission or some irregularity that may have affected the outcome of the ballot. Those are the measures. 
This bill was introduced here in February 2002 and was rejected by the Senate in 2002. You can understand that the Greens may vote this way because they vote with the Labor Party all the time. But the Democrats, who wish to be negotiators and be relevant to the debate, for some reason have decided to take themselves out of this debate and allow it to become a running sore in the community. They have no will to resolve the matter other than to see it drag on and on, denying the workers of Australia the democracy that they are entitled to.
As I have said in this place a number of times, the greatest myth in this country is that the Labor Party stand for the workers of this country. They do not. The Labor Party in this country stand for the elites and the union bosses; they do not stand for the hands-on coalface workers. In fact we know that those sorts of people now vote in droves for the coalition government. I am talking about the sorts of seats where they use their feet to change their votes because of what we offer. The Australian Labor Party will oppose this again on the basis that it is aimed at limiting strikes and eliminating the remaining rights of workers to strike and because it is contrary to ILO standards. The Australian Labor Party will oppose the bill because it is contrary to the existing role of the IRC, because it orders that secret ballots are sufficient— and we just heard the member for Brisbane rattling on about that—and because the bill favours employers. All this is class warfare stuff: us and them.
—They are 100 years out of date.
—That is it. The dinosaurs on the other side might wonder why they are still sitting over there. The bill removes the intimidation factor felt by many employees who feel pressured into approving industrial action in hands-up vote situations. I began my working life in the Pilbara as a schoolteacher and I had a number of other jobs there, including labouring on the site. A number of times in Wickham it was `everybody out the gate'.
—Were you a signed-up member?
—I was a member of the teachers union. In fact, I was a union organiser until my last year of teaching. So I believe in collective bargaining, but I do not believe in it when it becomes rorted, in the hands of one or two, and not democratic. So I have a bit of background in this, and the member for Perth knows that.
We know how intimidating the hands-up vote can be. I am aware of many cases, particularly with militant unionists—as Joe Bullock calls himself, as a member of the CFMEU in Perth—who stand over and belt the living tripe out of those blokes who do not vote their way. And they will not employ them on the sites again. The no ticket, no start regime makes sure that these guys, the subcontractors in particular, do not get to come back on the site. It is all about control and the bosses being in charge.
—The union bosses.
—Yes, the union bosses. Continue to help me because we need to identify the ones in the woodpile. In most voting situations people are entitled to, and expect, privacy surrounding that decision. Given time, I will return to an element of the debate that I brought up last time I spoke on this and that is the Chartist movement, which was basically the genesis of the secret ballot in the world. It is something that the Labor Party should adopt because it is the grassroots of their industrial organisation. It grew out of the heart of industrial Britain.
—They will not adopt it.
—Of course they will not. I will continue with a few elements about the Chartist movement while I am at it. If the Labor Party were serious about their background, they would identify with the Chartist movement which grew in Britain in 1838. The Chartist movement had six demands: universal manhood suffrage—they got to women's suffrage later on; equal electoral districts; votes by secret ballots; annually elected parliaments; payment of members of parliament; and the abolition of property qualification for membership. Chartism was the first movement that was both working class in character—hear this, those over there who pretend to represent them—and national in scope. It grew out of the protest against the social injustices of the new industrial order in Britain in 1838. It was led by a chap called Lovett. They collected three million signatures in Britain and took them to the British parliament, yet the British parliament rejected the idea. You may ask whether that was the end of it. No, they continued to push this issue until 1848. But how about this: the principal leaders of the Chartist movement in Britain—and nearly every other Chartist leader—were arrested and sentenced to short prison terms. In fact, a number of the Chartists were transported to Australia as convicts. Unbelievably, people who fought in Britain for the secret ballot were sent to Australia as convicts because they were fighting for the six democratic changes that I was talking about.
What we do know is that all the six points of the Chartist movement, with the exception of annual parliaments, have been secured over time in Britain and in Australia but not in the union movement. Australia became the first country to introduce the secret ballot. For example, Victoria and South Australia were the first states to introduce secrecy of the ballot in 1856. That is the reason it is referred to as the `Australian ballot'. This system eventually spread throughout Europe and the rest of the world. In Great Britain, the secret ballot was finally introduced for all parliamentary and municipal elections by the Ballot Act of 1872, 16 years after it had been introduced in Australia. In the United States, the Australian ballot system was put in place for the presidential election of 1884, 28 years after it had been introduced in Australia. I rest my case. The Chartist movement was born out of the industrial movement in Britain—which the Labor Party should identify with. The key element of the Chartist movement is secret ballots, yet because the Labor Party are prisoners of the union movement in this country, they will not agree to the secret ballots because they owe it to their preselection bosses and they are not allowed to do it.
This bill does aim to protect jobs through democracy. Those workers affected by taking strike action will have an unfettered say about whether or not they want to take the action. What is wrong with that? The Australian Labor Party are more interested in putting the rights and concerns of those who control them before the rights and concerns of the workers, the ones they purport to protect. The unions tell the Australian Labor Party to just ignore this sort of democracy, that it does not exist in the confines of their own internal processes. Not only do Australian Labor Party members not have the chance to have a fair say in the unions; the unions get the first say. Without secret ballots before strike actions, the unions unfairly deny the workers a say.
Other governments, such as the UK government, have been encouraged to introduce the secret ballot. Tellingly, overseas Labour governments have had the courage to stand up to the unions and go ahead with these changes. The member for Brisbane said that Tony Blair's courage to introduce secret ballots was somehow flawed because the British secret ballots are not the same as the Australian secret ballots. What a load of baloney. They are secret ballots after all. No matter what mechanism is used, ultimately, if they are regulated by a fair regime and they are conducted in a proper way—like our own ballots when running for seats in parliament—what is so bad about that? It is just a natural right that people should be entitled to.
In Australia, of course, we do not have a Tony Blair. We have a Simon Crean as the leader of the Australian Labor Party—and when I say `leader', I say it very guardedly. When I read columns such as Glenn Milne's in this morning's Australian and listen to other commentators—and the faxes and the emails are flying—it seems that, in the absence of a strong leader, there are a lot of nervous nellies on the other side who are anxious about where they are going. They are very concerned about the absence of leadership in the Labor Party. George Campbell said before Christmas that Simon Crean had only six months in the job. I think the six months are running out. After the New South Wales election, we may very well see. But we want Simon Crean to stay. We think Kim Beazley is good on the back bench, and we want Simon Crean to stay where he is. We think he offers the sort of leadership that the Australian Labor Party are entitled to. As a result, people in the Labor Party are being robbed by the union movement because they do not have a leader who will actually come out and stand for something. Look at all the things that have been knocked back through sheer opportunism. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister went through them today.
Tony Blair amended the secret ballot provisions in the UK in 1998-99. Industrial reform will secure a more productive and more competitive workplace and a more rewarding and fairer workplace for workers. These outcomes will provide a stronger and more efficient economy and more harmonious and fairer workplaces. We know that just the other day Ian Macfarlane, chairman of the Australian Reserve Bank, said that Australia's position and solid performance in the world economy compared to the OECD countries was the result of flexibility in the work force. That is what the leadership of the Howard government has brought to the Australian workers: a far more dynamic and stronger work force because it is more flexible. If you go back to the old rigid dinosaur days under the Hawke-Keating government, it was so regulated and regimented that productivity was strangled. Now that the Labor government in Western Australia has taken the state back more than 10 years in labour laws, we are finding, for example, that young kids cannot get weekend jobs to the same extent because they come up against double time, treble time and all those sorts of things. Employers will not pay that; they cannot afford to pay it. As a result, young people are being denied jobs.
There is a genuine desire to see unions be more accountable to their members, and should this happen they might have far greater participation in the organisations, and this bill will address that. Finally, the minister has made the comment that the secret ballots bill is the single most important piece of legislation to ensure that we do not have strikes in this country without first having secret ballots. If it is good enough for the German socialists and good enough for the British Labour government, it should be good enough for us here, too.

"O'Connor, Brendan, MP",ALP,2003-03-03,"—I rise this evening to speak on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2000. I do so because I think there needs to be some effort by this parliament to examine the provisions of the bill and to discuss more fully—and, perhaps, more precisely—the manner and form of the bill, and the way it would apply if it were enacted and, therefore, used compulsorily in the workplaces of Australia. To date, the contribution by those on the other side debating on this bill has been woeful, in that there has been very little effort to discuss the machinations or practicalities of the provisions. That is important. If one is to look at the effectiveness or otherwise of a bill, one has to look at the provisions. Labor considers this bill impractical at best and, at worst, a further assault on one side of the industrial playing field; namely, Australian workers. The government has sought to impose an elaborate and unwieldy mechanism upon employees who may consider taking lawful industrial action.
Although this misguided attempt to stymie workers' rights in this country, under the guise of the high-principled notion of secret ballots, is intended to minimise industrial action in the workplace, I fear—given the manner and form of the bill and the added formality of the proposed process—that it will cause the opposite effect. Furthermore, this increased bureaucratic load will undoubtedly impose a greater burden upon the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, thereby diverting its attention from preventing and settling disputes, which is its primary function and has been since its introduction in 1904—almost at the time of Federation.
Equally important is that the Industrial Relations Commission focus upon the important principle of ensuring productivity and flexibility in the workplace—a principle that is based on a balanced approach and does not target one party to a dispute more than another. We have already heard from the member for Brisbane and others that, if this particular provision is so noble, the question begged is: why, then, does it not apply to all? We will leave the manner and form aside for a moment. Why is it that to withdraw one's labour one is asked to go through an arduous and convoluted—and, one would say, deliberately lengthy—process to establish a determination on whether people wish to take lawful action? Why is it that that occurs when labour is being considered but, with respect to lockouts, there is no provision for shareholders to exercise their democratic rights and have a secret ballot?
I suppose the difficulty for us in immediately accepting the noble intentions of the government in this area is that there is no effort to show any balance or to suggest to the parliament—or, indeed, to the community at large—that this government wants to apply equitable laws that are consistent to employees and employers in the workplace. That underlines the nature of this government: in the end, when it comes to applying law, it has one law and one form of regulation for Australian working people, and another law for employers, corporate directors and executive officers of companies.
Already this year we have seen that on a number of occasions. We saw that with their failure to accept amendments by Labor on regulating corporate bonuses. We saw that today when they argued that secret ballots are a principled approach to industrial relations but should only apply to employees and not to the employers—that is, the shareholders of companies—who will be affected by industrial decisions made by their boards or executive officers. So there are some real problems about accepting the genuineness of the government with respect to this area. There is a real difficulty because they have, yet again, clearly illustrated their incapacity to be fair and to show that they have an even-handed approach to industrial relations.
The arduous process outlined in the bill is as follows, as I understand it. In order for an employee, a group of employees, a union or agents on their behalf to consider legal industrial action, they must apply to the Australian Industrial Relations Commission for an order for a secret ballot to be conducted. I should add that—despite the government's rhetoric about individual choice without the presence of a union—in the case of an enterprise of fewer than 80 employees, no fewer than four employees are required to support the order. At least five per cent of the total work force is required for enterprises employing between 80 and 5,000 workers, and, for enterprises over 5,000, the requirement is for no fewer than 250 employees to support an order of this kind.
As I said earlier, the manner and form of this provision seem to be unclear. It suffices to say that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission will be distracted from its primary role, and no doubt the civil courts will be crowded with parties looking to judicially determine the extraordinary number of ambiguous and deficient provisions of this legislation.
After reading the minister's comments with respect to this bill and listening to some members opposite, you would be forgiven for thinking that this country is beset by widespread, wildcat, protracted industrial action. The minister would like people to believe that we are experiencing industrial warfare in workplaces across the nation. The reality is that that is not the case. If you believed the rhetoric of the minister, you would conclude that industrial unrest is commonplace. But, as I said, that is not the case. The empirical evidence points to a consistent and gradual decline in strikes since the election of the first Hawke government 20 years ago this week—on Wednesday, in fact. Any dispassionate analysis of this phenomenon would recognise, firstly, that the prices and incomes accord was a major contributor to the fact that fewer Australians' working days were lost as a result of industrial action.
My view with respect to the prices and incomes accord is that it was an imperfect compact. The accord, however, did impose a discipline upon industrial parties and helped redress some of the fundamental inequities in workplaces of this country. Unfortunately—and I think it should be noted so as not to be forgotten—the inability to regulate prices left the burden to bring about industrial harmony and the consequent economic gain almost entirely upon Australian workers and their representatives: the unions. That is the reality. If anyone were to observe the economic realities of the 1980s, one would suggest that the responsible parties to bringing about those efficiencies were primarily employees and their unions.
It is timely to contrast the behaviour of Australian workers in the 1980s with the elements of the business community in that period. It is fair to say that a large proportion of those so-called businesspeople were aptly named `corporate cowboys'. At a time when employees and unions acted in the national interest, I would argue that many businesspeople at that time were motivated purely by greed and self-interest. We had only to look behind the bars of some of our jails in this country over a period of time to see some of the corporate identities eventually coming unstuck and being brought to justice as a result of their irresponsibility and their greed. Whilst we had this image of some of these high-flyers—these people who acted improperly, corruptly on occasions, and unlawfully—I think it is fair to say in the broad sense that we had a union movement and an Australian work force that acted in a mature, responsible manner and looked towards the needs of the economy and the broader issues that could offer long-term benefits to the community and the workers of this country. The employees and the unions exhibited that form of behaviour, even at a time when many of the corporate cowboys, so called, were failing in their duty and their obligations to this country.
Notwithstanding that, since 1996 this government has attempted to turn history on its head. The fact is that this government has always failed to recognise the positive contributions made by Australian working people. Such a compact did not always benefit certain sectors of the workplace that could have struck greater benefits for themselves and could have sought to ensure that they were in receipt of far greater economic return because of their industrial strength. However, they chose to protect the community at large. This government has never accepted or acknowledged that these contributions were made, and they were made at a time of important structural change in this country. The government has failed in any way to acknowledge the fact that there were leaders in the workplaces at all levels who saw the need to change this country and to produce the benefits, notwithstanding in many instances the failure by their own employers.
It is fair to say that there were employers who came on board and assisted in that process, but there were many who did not. There were also many union leaders, and many Australian workers generally, involved in that process, but they have never been recognised by this government. It is fair to say that, since 1996, this government has sought to use instruments of the state—whether it be bringing attack dogs and masks to workplaces or establishing politically driven royal commissions—to undermine and weaken the rights of employees and their representatives: the trade unions. The fact remains that this continues today.
It is very important that we stop to make some comment about the witch-hunt into the building industry that has been commissioned by the government. One would find more credibility in a commission—even if the results were mixed as to where the breaches of law were coming from—if there were some focus on occupational health and safety matters, if some efforts were made to look at underpayments of employees' entitlements in the industry or if health and safety matters generally were also being redressed in this area, given the fatality rate in the building industry. I will not for a moment stand here and suggest that the building industry is in any way squeaky clean—it is not. Bribes might be offered by more than one person, and, as the CFMEU has said time and time again, if those things occur, they should be brought to the attention of the proper authorities. The fact remains that there are employers and, quite possibly, employees doing the wrong thing in every industry, but this commission's scope has been narrowed to focus purely upon the work force and their representatives rather than on issues like health and safety or fatalities in the building industry. Its scope is purely to look at the behaviour of certain individuals and not at others. There is no effort to look at other behaviour.
This commission will ultimately fail in its outcome because an objective person will realise that there is no effort to be impartial or to act for the betterment of the industry as opposed to directing its enmity and its energies towards adversely affecting working people and their representatives. That is the failure of this commission, and this bill is another example of this government focusing purely on working people and their representatives. The government is not focusing on shareholders and the need for them to possibly conduct a secret ballot to lock out people, nor looking at those rights and entitlements of employees and their unions. That is a failure of this government and it exposes the government's bias, as indeed the way the royal commission has been set up has exposed its bias.
The government is focusing all its energies on the building unions by setting up the royal commission and focusing all its energies upon other areas such as employee entitlements, but what is it doing to assist shareholders to save their own capital from greedy directors? Again, we have seen a spate of executives—many of them failed executives—receiving obscene sums of money when leaving the company. After Southcorp announced its profit had fallen by 97 per cent, it dismissed its then CEO, Mr Keith Lambert, and he received $4.4 million. Of course, that payout followed the national outrage when a payment of $33 million was made to Mr Cuffe, the former chief of Colonial First State funds management business. And let us not forget BHP Billiton's former boss, Brian Gilbertson, and AMP's Paul Batchelor, who are also going to receive millions of dollars. I think that it would be a hard case to argue that, in all the circumstances, those people have done a great thing for their companies. Even if they had, I do not think they could ever argue for or justify the amount of money they will receive. Clearly, we have a government that fails to regulate the conduct of greedy corporate directors. 
Indeed, the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations in question time today said there was no need to regulate bonuses for corporate directors. I think that shows that, when it comes to regulating the behaviour of greedy directors, this government goes missing. It is not even there to assist in the regulation of such conduct, but it will go through hoop after hoop in order to make the bargaining negotiations for Australian working people as hard as possible. It will go to every length in order to impose its ideological view upon the Australian work force. The fact is that this bill is flawed because it is biased. Its process is deliberately lengthy so as not to provide an effective process. I think it is also important to note that there are already sections of the act enabling a secret ballot to be conducted. Section 135 allows the commission to order the conducting of a ballot if it seeks to discover the attitudes of employees whose employment will be subject to a proposed agreement, if it helps to prevent an industrial dispute. That provision has been in existence in some form or another for 70-odd years. It is there for employers to take advantage of if they wish to. To take one example, in 1996 there were 4½ thousand applications for a bargaining period, and only two orders were made for secret ballots. In 2001, there were 6,600 applications for a bargaining period, and only one order was made for a secret ballot. The fact remains that this bill is all about imposing an ideology upon the workplace. Again, it exposes the unfairness and bias of this government towards Australian working people.

"Secker, Patrick, MP",LP,2003-03-03,"—I rise tonight in support of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Secret Ballots for Protected Action) Bill 2002 [No. 2]. Employers and employees have clearly embraced workplace bargaining in the past decade—which is something that clearly has escaped members opposite. More than 41,000 collective agreements have been formalised under the federal system alone, with thousands more under state bargaining systems. Over 1.3 million employees are covered by current federal wage agreements, including those who are on one of the 220,000 individual arrangements made since 1997.
The very purpose of this amendment is to make the process fair and just when determining whether a group of employees at a workplace want to take industrial action, without their facing the consequences or standover tactics from their union representatives. It will ensure that the right to protected industrial action is upheld—which should make those members opposite happy—free from consequences of an individual's right to action, and without the repercussions of a militant union that may be out to cause havoc and not resolve the issues at hand. This amendment is about making sure that individuals are free from any type of intimidation and how they can best be served, in many cases, by their own employer. At the end of the day, employees still have the freedom to strike if they are not satisfied. Minister Abbott in his second reading speech on the current bill reflected on his proposals to amend the current secret ballot provisions and stated:
A secret ballot is a fair, effective and simple process for determining whether a group of employees at a workplace want to take industrial action. It will ensure that the right to protected industrial action is not abused by union officials pushing agendas unrelated to the workers at the workplace concerned.
At present, certain sections of the Workplace Relations Act deal separately with secret ballots for industrial action, and notices to initiate bargaining may involve industrial action. In the case of secret ballots, there are also separate ballot provisions dealing with the election of officials of registered organisations for unions and employers. Ballots are also used for voting on amalgamations of registered organisations and for approving certified agreements. Having said this, this bill will benefit many ordinary working Australians. This bill, along with the other bills—the Workplace Relations Amendment (Choice in Award Coverage) Bill 2002 and the Workplace Relations Amendment (Award Simplification) Bill 2002, will assist the government's commitment that was made in 2001: choice and reward in a changing workplace. This bill proposes that employees and organisations of employees who take industrial action have protected action under the provisions of the Workplace Relations Act 1996.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2003-03-03,"—Tonight I wish to discuss the issue of principle in politics. In the inner west in Sydney the Greens are portraying themselves as the sole occupiers of the moral high ground. There is no doubt that Bob Brown is a political activist who has earned respect. In New South Wales, Ian Cohen has come into parliament after an active participation in the environmental movement. But what about the New South Wales Greens and their candidates in the upcoming election? In the last federal election, the Friends of Callan Park distributed a survey to all candidates. I had stated very clearly my opposition to the sale of any public land. This was consistent with my political position and I clearly indicated that. Despite this, they showed their anti-Labor agenda by producing a full colour pamphlet advocating a vote for all political parties, including One Nation, ahead of Labor. They were the only group in my multicultural electorate that did not seem to understand the imperative to put One Nation last. But it should not come as a surprise.
The Greens candidate for Port Jackson is Jamie Parker. He gained some prominence in today's Daily Telegraph as a publicist for the extreme fighting event held at the Masonic Centre in Sydney last September. This is when two competitors are placed in an octagonal cage and allowed to cause as much physical damage to each other as possible. Due to the danger of such events, it had no permit. There was no medical doctor present, but it did have Jamie Parker—so much for the great advocates of peace and antiviolence. Mr Parker is the Deputy Mayor of Leichhardt Council.
It is not just in areas of violence that the hypocrisy shines like a beacon. When it comes to selling off public land, they are right into it. There is a massive redevelopment of the old children's hospital site at Camperdown, the area which includes Orphan School Creek. It is across the road from the housing estate where I grew up. On 26 November, Mr Parker seconded a motion by his ally, Mayor Maire Sheehan. I quote from the minutes:
... council resolve to sell, by public auction, the parcel of land known as B1 and that the general manager be authorised to set a reserve price.
Mr Parker also moved to exclude the press and the public before this debate took place. I seek leave to table the minutes of the Leichhardt Municipal Council meeting.
Leave granted.
—When not organising violent events, Mr Parker is off selling public land. The Greens need to be made accountable. Many of their policies are just plain loopy, particularly in economic areas. They advocate their tax and revenue policy section 2.3.5, which is a capital gains tax on five per cent of family homes in any region. As if there is not a disparity in housing prices from the top five per cent in Brewarrina to the top five per cent in Rose Bay, they draw no distinction in their policy. Secondly, under their housing policy 3.3.11 they propose a tax on renovations and excessive and unjustified housing unit sizes. Some of their branch members in my area should have a good look at that, given their propensity for renovations.
Believe it or not, Parker may not be the Greens' most unprincipled candidate. I think that goes to Sylvia Hale, No. 2 on the upper house ticket. She ran in September 1999 as the No Aircraft Noise Party candidate for Marrickville Council. She had previously been the No Aircraft Noise candidate in the federal election for the seat of Grayndler in 1998. Her main opponent when she ran in that 1999 election was, of course, the Greens. So they were competing, essentially, for the same vote. What occurred after that, though, was that Sylvia Hale, about a year later, resigned from the No Aircraft Noise Party and suddenly became a Greens councillor. She did not resign her position and put that change before the public—that was too principled for her; she could not do that. But we had a look back and thought, `How long has this Greens connection been going?' What we found on the public record was that she was the single major donor to the Greens campaign in that same Marrickville Council election—she donated $5,000, just pocket money for this bourgeois aristocrat. So on the one hand she is running for the No Aircraft Noise Party, but, on the other hand, she is funding her opposition.
The Greens have taken it to the logical next step. Not just are they privatising public assets on Leichhardt Council, they have privatised their position on the legislative council ticket. She has gone from being a No Aircraft Noise Party councillor to buying her spot on the ticket. I call upon Bob Brown to intervene and remove her from the ticket. Nominations have not closed yet. When you actually examine the record of these people, you find that they simply do not measure up. The people of New South Wales need to have a very close look at the sorts of people who are standing under the Greens banner, the sorts of people who have been members of many political parties, and they need to reject this opportunism.
