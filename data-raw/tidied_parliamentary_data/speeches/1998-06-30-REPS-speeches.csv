"Crean, Simon, MP",ALP,1998-06-30,"—In 1996 the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) set three benchmarks of the government's performance on industry policy, and he has failed on every count. First, he promised to reduce the trade deficit on manufactured goods. What has been the result? By December last year the manufactured trade deficit had blown out to a record $13.3 billion, up over a third in just under two years. Second, the Prime Minister promised to improve Australia's performance on industrial research and development, but the results were cuts to R&D support programs which, in turn, have caused a collapse in business research with many companies taking their clever ideas offshore. Third—this was the doozey of the lot—he promised to create 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing industry by the year 2000. After 2¼ years there are fewer manufacturing jobs in Australia, not more. To be on target, the government should have created over 112,000 new manufacturing jobs; instead, they have lost 6,000. The promise has now become another non-core promise.
It is little wonder that the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) walked away from that target in question time last week in response to a question from the member for Wills (Mr Kelvin Thomson). Instead, he talked about the government's overall record of 231,000 jobs in 27 months. Some achievement that was!
—A great result!
—The minister says, `Great result.' Let us compare it with Labor's last 27 months in office when we created 561,000 jobs, more than double the target that the minister is now claiming is a great achievement. Almost two-thirds of those jobs under us were full time but almost all the jobs under this government are part time.
Labor was able to achieve it because it went for growth. But this government, through its policies, has slowed growth. It has pursued a deficit at any cost. It has been to the cost of the industry base, it has been to the cost of our current account, it has been to the cost of our foreign debt—all of which have blown out; and, in turn, that is what has cost the jobs in this country.
Instead of going for growth, this government cut the business programs that had actually stimulated stronger and sustainable growth under us, leading to those 560,000 jobs. Essentially, by cutting those programs, this government has tried to fireproof the car by taking out its petrol. These were not just broken promises; they also involved the government walking away from an effective involvement in industry policy. Support for manufacturers under this government has declined from $560 million to $146 million, as has support for programs for exports.
We hear the Minister for Trade (Mr Tim Fischer) get up and talk about the export market development grants scheme and the great success it has been; the problem is that they have cut it and it has not been as successful as it could have been. Research for the so-called `clever country' has now been set back 15 years because, for the first time in 15 years, we have seen private sector research and development decline. Innovation, and jobs consequent upon that, is now being exported overseas. The Ericsson case is just another 
 example. In all of the litany that the minister went through in answer to the question, he still did not say that 200 jobs are going to go and that the manufacturing base is going to disappear, essentially because of the cuts to research and development.
We have seen the virtual abolition of AusIndustry and  $100 million cut from Austrade. We also saw the abolition of the computer bounty. But no Australian industry has been untouched by this government's anti-business decisions. Take steel: when BHP announced the closure of its Newcastle steel plant, the Howard government was out to lunch—the minister in particular. He decided to attend the Crown Casino opening rather than a meeting of steelworkers and their families. The Prime Minister preferred to go and watch the cricket Test at Lord's rather than meet the Newcastle steelworkers. And they still have not introduced a steel plan.
Burnie, another case in point, showed that the government had learnt nothing. The Prime Minister refused to go there. He refused to lift the telephone to Stan Wallis, his compatriot in terms of a GST, and he could not talk to him about reopening Burnie. Instead, he sent in the receivers—the Minister for Social Security (Senator Newman)—the industry minister flew to Paris and the customs minister called the workers `rorters'. And there still was no industry plan.
In relation to copyright, the government is pursuing copyright amendments which undermine the intellectual property in this country, through a weakening of the rules governing parallel imports. These amendments will allow the importation of inferior quality product and allow importers a free ride on firms which have made the investment in marketing and product development—putting Australian jobs at risk. Once again, just as it did with the cuts to R&D, this government is stifling Australian creativity. Rather than making our creative talent vulnerable, it should follow Labor's approach: work with the industry to devise an industry plan which wins the commitment to growth, renewed jobs, investment, net exports and R&D.
In relation to shipbuilding, Australia has built a world-beating fast ferry industry from 
 scratch over the last decade, but the Howard government moved away from that industry by abolishing its bounty, which it will abandon in 1999.
—It's extended.
—You extended it only because of pressure from us, but you are still going to end it in 1999, when we will continue it until the international agreement is signed. That is the position that you should be adopting to support this vital industry in Tasmania.
On book printing, a quarter of the work force in the Victorian town of Maryborough, and hundreds of workers in other regional centres, rely on the Australian book printing industry. But the Howard government's response is to abolish their bounty and put 1,500 jobs at risk.
With the automotive industry, after adopting Labor's plan, it has still not introduced the legislation into the parliament; and in relation to textiles, clothing and footwear not only has it not introduced the legislation but it has not announced the new import credit scheme. This is still a government that does not care about industry policy. It does not believe in it and it has no commitment to it. When it is forced to act, it comes in here and pretends that it has seen the light, but when it is let off the hook it will not even introduce the legislation.
In most of these industries and on most of these issues, it is Labor that has led the effective campaign and forced the government to adopt our position or partially back down. More often than not, the member for Oxley (Ms Hanson) has either been silent or has voted with the government. She voted with the government and against Labor when we were trying to make the Productivity Commission take account of the regional impact of its recommendations. She voted against Labor's attempts to stop the axing of the book bounty. She voted against Labor's rejection of the axing of four key infrastructure projects, including Queensland's Oakey power station. She voted against Labor in seeking to ensure that the Trade Practices Act incorporated committee recommendations in respect of fair trading to assist small business. And she did 
 not even bother to turn up in relation to the axing of the ship bounty.
So far as Labor is concerned, we are the party for national development. We have a vision for a more vibrant, competitive and outward looking economy. Our industry policy is about looking forward, making more of our opportunities and doing it in partnership with industry. The government has to play a key role—not this sitting back on the side, out to lunch sort of business that has been going on, and which we have documented—through facilitation and policy settings to drive the national development agenda.
Our industry policy reinforces this role for government. It is built around five pillars: the vision, strategic action plans, innovation, investment attraction and enterprise improvement. For example, we do not believe industry programs should be held hostage to a three-year electoral cycle. We support five-year funding. We want to lock in a bipartisan approach to industry policy so industry can plan with confidence.
We are committed to abolishing the Industry Commission and replacing it with a national development authority. We want to extend the reciprocal obligation principle requiring firm commitments on jobs, investment, exports and research and development, in exchange for assistance provided. Why should it be only the long-term unemployed and unemployed youth who have to make a reciprocal obligation? If we are forging a partnership with business, what about their commitment to this nation? What is the point of insisting upon 15 per cent return to capital if you are not going to invest the capital in this nation and in job opportunities, only to see it going offshore? What Labor is saying is: we want to extend the reciprocal obligation policy to underpin the partnership, the commitment to growth and the commitment to jobs.
We are committed to developing strategic action plans in key industry sectors to underpin that partnership. Reciprocity will be a key element of the partnership, and targets will be set against which progress can be measured. We are also committed to building our infra 
 structure base—something I spoke about at greater length last week.
For Labor, an active industry policy is central to the task of growing this nation. It recognises that the best way to achieve higher economic growth is to adopt a strategic, innovative approach and to know that you have a government that backs that approach. It is no coincidence that in our years in government those industries which did receive assistance—which were part of the shared strategy—grew the fastest. Labor has shown it can deliver sustained growth. Through sound industry policy we can drive net export growth, thereby correcting the current account. We can address the balance of payments constraint—the thing that has been holding back our ability to sustain economic growth at that higher level. If we get that equation right, we will solve the unemployment problem.
We have said that reciprocal obligation is at the core of what we are talking about with industry policy. We will do that through the strategic action plans, essentially a partnership between business and government by which, in each of the key sectors, we identify the potential and the barriers to realising that potential, we develop collectively solutions to address the barriers and we commit to common objectives through targets.
That is what we would be doing now with the steel industry and with the pulp and paper industry, because those industries are in crisis under this government. We would also be sitting down with the telecommunications industry to ensure that Ericcson's jobs were not going back overseas, to ensure that we could get the best out of this nation, to make the most of our natural resource base, our skill base, our innovation base and our creative base. That is what we should be doing, but this government will not lift a hand. This government does not care.
Let me go finally to the question of tax. The most effective con job conducted by this government has been that perpetrated on some members of the business community elite, who have signed up to the GST in the guise of tax reform. The GST has become a substitute for real policies designed to generate real jobs and real invest 
 ment. Given the problems facing the country—the current account and slower growth—what is needed is business tax reform and policies which are complementary to what we have been advocating on the industry policy approach.
We need tax policies which will drive new investment in value added goods and services for net export growth. We need reform which encourages investment in infrastructure and in innovation, in connecting the good ideas to their commercialisation, in actively encouraging a successful venture capital market and in making the most of our natural resources, our skills, our innovation, our education attainability and our creative strengths. If we get that right, we will take this nation forward.
But nothing in the discussion that has been occurring between the Business Council and the government covers any of these issues. Nowhere is there a commitment to new investment on the back of their GST. Not only have we got a tax under them which will be inequitable and hit families, it will do nothing for growth, and that is being cried out for. Under this government we are not getting any policy.

"Moore, John, MP",LP,1998-06-30,"—There is no doubt about the old gadfly. He is out there running around talking to everybody under the sun. He today asked the second question since November on industry policy. It is no wonder he is out here with the MPI today, because he knows that tomorrow the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) will want to talk and he knows that Beazley has to have the last day, so he had to get in today. What does he do? He asks the second question since November and gets the MPI. That is a really good start. It shows you the great interest of the plumber. He is not interested in industry policy; he has taken up plumbing. He is down there throwing the dirt around—`Don't worry about industry policy, we will get on to other things.'
In the meantime, can I suggest that the Ericsson question be addressed more thoroughly. When I came to the office this morning, there were big headlines saying, `Ericsson's leaves Australia.' I got on to the 
 managing director and said, `Is that true?' He said, `No, it is not.' The industry spokesman got up and said, `They are all off.' I asked him to send up a statement of exactly where he was in relation to this. He said:
Ericsson Australia said today that it had no intention of withdrawing operations from Australia. . . . Australia has been identified as a host for key Ericsson regional centres, such as the Regional Supply Centre, Training and Education Centre, Service Centre, Competence Centre and the Global Design Centre among others. With these initiatives in place, Ericsson Australia will continue to build on the high level competencies available in Australia, strengthening its presence and outlook.
That is no resignation from Australia. It means more jobs in the higher paid sectors. It means more commitment to IT and the research and development we so badly need in this area. So the very premise on which the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) leads off in his gadfly sort of way is wrong. Make the assertion, colour and movement, no fact. Don't worry about the truth of the statement, just assert it. That is the usual sort of thing that he goes on with.
What has the government been doing since we came to office? When we came to office in March 1996, there was no industry policy. It had collapsed. Richardson admitted that. He said it straight out. The member for Hotham said, `Maybe we made a few mistakes.' Even he owned up. It took a while, but even he owned up in the end. So we systematically went about the work we had on hand.
First of all, do you remember the research and development syndicates? That was the member for Hotham's special little area where he fixed up his mates in the Rolls-Royces. We had to clean that area up. In IT there had been no review for ten years, so we moved on that area. In the manufacturing sector, there had been 200,000 jobs lost by Labor. We hear a lot about jobs. In the `recession we had to have', 200,000 jobs were removed from that area by Labor. We had record debt and record interest rates. And don't forget the `recession we had to have' which went with these situations.
Our international competitiveness, which must drive Australia all the time to get to 2010 and meet the open competition that year, 
 in this period fell from 10 to 21. What a record. Labor failed industry in this nation. Graham Richardson attested to that. He said that the greatest single mistake of successive Labor governments from 1983 to 1996 was the failure to develop a cohesive industry policy. When Richardson says that, you have to take notice in the Labor Party.
What did we do? We set about a systematic review of industry in this nation. We called upon David Mortimer to undertake a complete review of all government support across the board. We asked Professor Goldsworthy and Mr Cutler to take a complete review of the IT industries. It was the first strategic review of IT for ten years, as I said before. It is very significant. This is a very big area for Australia and something which we really have to hold on to and develop. So we put those two people onto that task.
In the area of cars, we answered the challenge of the post-2000 period. When the Productivity Commission came forward with their recommendations, the government was driven by its key areas of industry policy: investment, research and development innovation, and exports. Those three things led us in government to make the decision to extend the tariffs to the year 2005 and implement a significant investment program. There has been a significant response to that by the industry itself. Something like $4 billion has been committed to it so far in relation to the auto producers themselves, and the component manufacturers are making enormous developments in these areas, especially with magnesium and the like.
We pressed on to TCF, a very hard area to handle in terms of regions and employment. There we came up with another program, with heavy reliance on investment, research and development, and pushing them into export areas. We are doing something for our future. We answered the question of pharmaceuticals, another area looked at comprehensively by the government in industry policy. In this time, since March 1996, we have covered the whole area of industry policy in this nation. We have had the most comprehensive review of industry policy in 20 years and this has been endorsed not only by members of the 
 manufacturing sector and other areas but also by the very many people who have understood the concepts that we have put behind this in relation to it.
There are a number of initiatives from the statement Investing for Growth, made in December by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), which we have already implemented. The government has moved in terms of research and development, a very significant area. We have started and extended the new START program. We have introduced innovation funds because we in Australia know that one of the missing links has been the development of venture capital. Good ideas and research and development have not been taken up because of the reluctance of the private investor to get involved in the commercialisation of the sector. So we introduced innovation funds, which have been a great success, and five have already been announced and taken up. In relation to extended areas of research and development, we have made it possible to get up to the equivalent of a 200 per cent deduction if you are in the competitive area of research and development.
In terms of investment, Mr Bob Mansfield was appointed as the strategic investment coordinator to assist the government in reviewing various projects that come to hand. Already, we have enabled the Kistler space launching facility at Woomera in South Australia to be established. Wholesale sales tax in relation to that project was reviewed to enable that project to take place. That has been progressed in a number of other areas. We have moved on manufacture in bond and have allotted the first licence in that area. It is a very significant step to be able to bring in manufacture in Australia and re-export those products without incurring government costs in that area. None of these things were done under Labor—or thought of. As I said, this is the most comprehensive review in 20 years.
To promote Australia as a financial centre, we have moved to develop the new Tradex program. Information technology is a special area and was mentioned today by the member for Hotham. In this area, as I said at question time, a ministerial council has been set up, 
 chaired by Senator Alston, which is responsible for a whole of government response to information online service strategies. The government established a National Office of the Online Economy, for which Senator Alston is also responsible. We have announced the removal of tariffs on inputs to IT manufacturing in Australia—a very significant step indeed. The measure is projected to save Australian IT manufacturers more than $80 million over the next 18 months.
The government, as of tomorrow, will be starting up its first action agenda in the information industry sector, at a cost of some $28 million. In particular, it will set up a network of software engineering quality centres and a new testing conformance infrastructure. These are necessary since the withdrawal of Telstra from this field and will enable a wider number of bodies, both small and large, to test new products. So I think the government has responded in a very comprehensive way to a lot of the areas set out in Investing for Growth which was, as I was saying, a very significant statement.
In contrast, what has Labor done? They run around, but I do not know what their policy is. They come out making a wild series of statements, I am fully aware of that. But what really is their policy? They have not got any policy. The member for Hotham has asked only two questions on industry policy since November last year and he comes to the third last day of the winter sittings before he can get an MPI up, so he cannot be too interested in industry policy.
Labor are going to run around with industry and say, `Look, we will do special deals with our mates.' That is one thing the member for Hotham is good at. It is a really hot point. It is in the documents. Labor are saying they will get back to mutual commitment where industry agrees to a precise job in exports and investments and, in return, in government they will help them along. I assume that means that all those who do not go along and cooperate with the government get no assistance. They are saying that if you come to the government, they will give you something but if you do not talk to them, they will give you nothing. So in government they would divide 
 everyone up. The Labor mates would get a few bob and the others are to be forgotten about. This is the new-found industry policy of the Labor Party. It is back to the bad old days down at the ACTU and the New South Wales Right, hand in the pocket. They have been at that for years. There is nothing new about this. This is the greatest mob of failed politicians I have seen in all my life.
Those opposite ask us to go and look at the past. Business expenditure under Labor on R&D as a share of GDP was 25 per cent lower than the OECD average. Under Labor, Australia slipped from 18th to 24th in terms of business expenditure on R&D. It is no wonder they run around and talk about these terrible things. Labor's foreign investment policy promised to promote Australia as an attractive and highly competitive destination for investment, said Senator Cook in San Francisco. Labor's business investment averaged under five per cent per year. Under the coalition, business investment has grown by more than 17 per cent since March 1996. The CSIRO is one of Australia's great scientific institutions. Labor promised to cut $60 million from Australian funding in 1995-96. The coalition moved to restore that, and I am very pleased that happened.
In terms of international competitiveness, under Labor Australia fell from 10th to 21st position in the Institute of Management Development ranking of international competitiveness. In only two years the coalition had turned Australia's competitiveness around, improving six places to 15th place in the IMD's world ranking. Inflation under Labor averaged 5.5 per cent between March 1983 and March 1986. Inflation now is at the lowest sustained levels ever recorded—below one per cent.
Turning to overdraft rates—and who in business does not understand the importance of interest rates and the cost of money in this nation?—under Labor, business overdraft rates reached 20.8 per cent in 1990, and you probably would have paid a lot more than that in the fringe market. Under the coalition, bank overdraft rates are now 7½ per cent, having fallen 3½ per cent in two years. The government's net debt is just under 20 per 
 cent of GDP in 1995-96. Based on current projections and including the Telstra sale and receipts, Commonwealth general government net debt will decline to around 1½ per cent of GDP by the year 2000-01.
Unemployment under Labor averaged 8.7 per cent. Presently it is averaging 8.1 per cent. The Labor recession caused the worst unemployment in 60 years—an unemployment rate of 11.2 per cent with youth unemployment over 26 per cent. Turning to manufacturing unemployment—and we hear this from the opposition—under Labor, some 200,000 jobs went despite the fact that it is one of Australia's largest areas of employment. It was unable to make the slightest positive contribution to economic growth in 1995.
When Labor were getting towards the end and they were running around looking for something to do, they decided to have a brand new industry statement—Innovate Australia. They could not agree on it, so in the end the department had to cobble together a series of press statements. It was really a great event. When it came out with all the bluster and hoo-ha that went with it, what happened? In the innovation statement, the total outlays over four years were going to be $465 million. But what did they charge and raise from industry in the same statement? Some $818 million. The opposition talk about who has given the most to industry, who has given the most support to industry, who is backing them up and doing the right thing? In your last effort at it, you gave them $400 million and you took back $800 million. With Invest Australia, we put out $1.4 billion and you have never matched it.
—When are you going to start making an effort?
—You can say all the things you like. The great gadfly from Hotham has no policy and no action. (Time expired)",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Industrial Development</title>,Matters of Public Importance,6,1
"O'Connor, Gavan, MP",ALP,1998-06-30,"—After that rambling, incomprehensible speech by the Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), we on this side of the House really rest our case. Just have a look at your own back bench. If it is a case of `Oh, lonesome me' defending the government's 
 industry policy, then you are it. The minister claims in this debate that he has conducted the most comprehensive review of industry policy in 20 years. Minister, where are the results of this great industry review and your performance? I will tell you what they are: low economic growth, high unemployment, low job growth, jobs lost by the thousand in manufacturing—and you and the Treasurer (Mr Costello) still persist with the fantasy that you have fireproofed the Australian economy from the Asian economic firestorm.
This Howard government is the worst government in Australia's history. After winning a substantial majority when it was elected in 1996, John Howard and Peter Costello have squandered their accumulated political capital in a manner which has left the Liberal backbench sullen and angry, and the electorate bitter and disappointed. In 27 months in office this has been a government of dishonesty, a government of betrayal, a government of incompetence and a government lacking leadership of substance. In no other policy area has this dishonesty, this betrayal, this incompetence and this lack of leadership been more manifest than in the area of industry policy. Australia's great manufacturing industries are reeling from Asia's economic turmoil. But if that were not enough, they have to contend with a government which is in an advanced state of panic and decay and incapable of developing and implementing a coherent industry policy to guide the national economy through these very troubled times.
What manufacturing industry wanted from this government was stability. What it got was seven resignations in 27 months. That is almost one in every four months. This government has not even been able to go a footy season without a resignation. What manufacturing industry wanted was ministerial competence. The government got John Moore, who should have been sacked for his own breaches of ministerial conduct. What manufacturing industry wanted was that the promises that were made would be promises that would be kept. But in shipbuilding, printing, automotive, textiles, clothing and footwear, and research and development all it got was 
 broken promises. What manufacturing industry wanted was a federal government that was able to articulate a vision for Australian manufacturing in the new millennium. What it got was a government that has ripped the heart out of research and development and massively cut expenditure on education and training, the pillars on which Australia's future prosperity will be built.
The electorate of Corio, which I represent in this parliament, has a very strong manufacturing base. Its key manufacturing industries are automotive and component manufacture, and textiles, clothing and footwear manufacture. In both of these areas we have seen a comprehensive betrayal by this minister and by this government. On 5 June 1997, the Prime Minister and the minister announced the government's decision in relation to the automotive industry.
—More than 12 months ago.
—Twelve months ago the minister announced the government's decision with regard to this very critical industry to Australia and my electorate. You adopted major elements of our industry plan, and some of what you announced we did not agree with. But there is no certainty as far as this industry is concerned because 12 months down the line you have done nothing to introduce into this House the legislation that gives effect to the industry plan that you announced over one year ago. That is a betrayal of the workers in Geelong and the automotive workers throughout Australia and a betrayal of the regions that rely on this great industry.
The government made its announcement in relation to the TCF industries in September 1997. The government has taken no legislative action on the commitments that it made to the textiles, clothing and footwear industries of this nation at that time. This represents another betrayal of the 3,000 workers in my electorate who depend on this industry for their livelihood and the great regions of Australia in which this particular industry is situated. If we go to the printing industry, that is only a little betrayal because the government made its commitment six months ago and has done nothing about it.
It is not only in the broad industry policy areas that this government has been found wanting. In very specific areas of policy that require some intellectual analysis and a sophisticated response this government has demonstrated its capacity not to grasp the complexities of policy or understand the implications of what it intends to do. One such area has already been mentioned today in debate in this House—the proposed amendments to the  Copyright Amendment Bill 1997 . In particular, schedule 3 removes the safeguards currently available to Australian copyright holders and allows parallel imports of goods where there is copyright on accessories such as packaging and labelling. What the government is proposing has the potential to create widespread unemployment in a range of industries, including the food and beverages, apparel, footwear and fashion accessories industries. These problems are symptomatic of the government's whole industry policy approach: failure to understand the implications of what they are doing and failure to consult with key industry stakeholders on issues that affect them.
The government's industry policy failure is evidenced by the collapse of manufacturing jobs over the past two years. The Prime Minister promised to create 200,000 new manufacturing jobs by the year 2000. The record shows that, in the 27 months since the election, there has been a loss in manufacturing jobs in this country. Indeed, last year 32,900 manufacturing workers lost their jobs. The true situation for industry in Australia is contained in the budget. Net export growth will drop, business investment growth will slow and demand for research and development funds from the government is at an all-time low. The budget does not allocate one cent to the textiles, clothing and footwear package. We have seen a decline in support for manufacturing industry, we have seen a collapse in assistance for the information technology industries in this country and we have seen the virtual abolition of AusIndustry support for enterprise development.
Of course, this contrasts with Labor's success in office. Those elements have already been outlined by the member for Hot 
 ham (Mr Crean), but I will quote a few here. Under Labor, we saw manufacturing reach record growth with a 12.2 per cent increase in production in 1994 alone. In plans for sectors such as the motor vehicle industry, we saw exports climb from less than $400 million in 1984 to $1.5 billion in 1994. We saw support for science and technology increased to $3.2 billion a year.
This government has comprehensively failed in one of the most critical areas of public policy today. This government's policy is being administered by a minister who does not deserve the portfolio. In the hallowed halls of industry across the length and breadth of this country the minister is a joke and so is his government. Australian industry will not be placed in a very good position beyond the year 2000 if the policies and the lack of direction that we currently face continue to be pursued. There is one simple solution to this: that we cut the Liberal-National Party cancer out of the body politic in Australia. The sooner the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) calls the election, the sooner Australian industry will have a real government in this country that will address its longstanding needs for a policy direction of substance. It will get that when this electorate elects a Labor government.",REPS,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Industrial Development</title>,Matters of Public Importance,6,1
"McGauran, Peter, MP",NP,1998-06-30,"—I am very pleased to be participating in this matter of public importance debate. Correct if I am wrong—perhaps I am misreading their mood—but it seems to me that the opposition do not have their hearts in this matter of public importance, as evidenced by the member for Hotham (Mr Crean) and the member for Corio (Mr O'Connor). They came in and they read their speeches. Their passion for industry, their outrage, is so significant that they came in with some speeches written by their staff. They made a number of assertions and trotted out some old cliches.
Does the opposition know why this MPI cannot be taken seriously? There are a number of reasons, but this is the main reason: if the government's industry policy has been so calamitous over the last 2½ years, as they allege; if industry is besieged; and if there has 
 been a collapse of 200,000 jobs, as alleged by the member for Corio, why haven't the opposition done something about it before now? Why is the industry question asked today only the second industry question in the last eight months? Why is this the only MPI on industry that we have had for some 12 months? If things are as bad as the opposition make out, why haven't they been performing their responsibility as an opposition and drawing the situation to the attention of the House? It is simply because the government has cut the ground completely and utterly from underneath them.
The government has performed extremely well in all the complex and often interrelated issues of industry policy since coming to office. Finally, to put the opposition's baying to rest once and for all, the government released late last year `Investing for growth'—the most complete, creditable industry policy released by any government for several decades. So the hype, the exaggeration and the overstatement of their case that we have seen here today have fallen very flat. That is what you would expect from the Labor Party.
Any industry policy debate should be kicked off with the words of former Senator Graham Richardson, a cabinet minister in both the Hawke and Keating governments, which appeared in the Bulletin on 17 June last year. The Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore) has already briefly referred to the article. Former Senator Richardson said:
The greatest mistake of successive Labor governments from 1983 to 1996 was the failure to develop a coherent industry policy.
But just in case anybody should think Senator Richardson was on an adventure of his own, and settling some old scores—heaven forbid—he was corroborated by the shadow minister for industry, the member for Hotham, Simon Crean, on Radio National on 11 August last year when he confessed:
I think we have to admit we did not get it all right.
They certainly did not get any of it right. You only have to look at their performance over 13 years to see the disastrous consequences of their industry policies such as they were. And 
 they are still at it! That is the amazing thing. Does Labor ever learn anything?
We saw the release of their platform policy in January at the Labor Party conference and recently the draft industry development plan of the member for Hotham. What you have got to remember about this 1½-page effort is that it is just a reworking of Labor's track record in government; that is, they will intervene very selectively, according to what suits their political interests more than anything else, in certain sectors and abandon others. One of the most amazing things is that Labor tried to dress this up with some form of respectability by saying:
. . . Labor believes that industry policy measures must be developed and implemented on the basis of a shared responsibility.
That is a nice motherhood introduction. It continues:
Assistance provided to industries will therefore be on the basis of a firm commitment between government and industry—a mutual commitment whereby industry agrees to specific job, export and investment targets in exchange for government providing the best possible environment to achieve those targets.
The best possible environment! It is a party that gave us record inflation and record unemployment, record interest rates, that plunged the economy into the worst recession since the Great Depression of the early 1930s. But, even if we were to allow them a fresh start, they are condemned by their own modern words, for what does it mean: will require `specific job, export and investment targets'? Spell it out. What are the criteria? What is the measurement? What is the enforcement? What is the penalty? None of this, in either the platform or the subsequent industry development plan, is announced for us to judge.
What happens if they give assistance on the basis of targets being satisfied and those targets are not met? Is the money withdrawn? What if certain industries cannot meet those targets? Do they miss out? Even Labor's car and steel plans would have failed these tests. They would not have met any test for re-investment, for jobs, for targets or for export benchmarks, because both those plans saw a 
 loss of jobs in those industries across the life of the plan.
These are hollow statements. They do not add up. They are pandering to a sectoral part of the community all right, and that is the trade union movement more than anything else. There are no clear details. We do not know what they mean. The Labor Party will not expand on these broadest of policy statements. We do not know how much they will cost. We do not know what paperwork and red tape they will require. And we certainly do not know what they will really do for industry.
But it is not just us asking these questions and making these condemnations. Alan Mitchell, in the Financial Review of 21 January this year, said:
It is difficult to imagine a clearer . . . example in Australia of the failure of intellectual and political leadership.
Ross Gittins, in the Sydney Morning Herald  on 16 June 1997:
It takes no expertise, no thought, no courage—and no integrity—to lurch back to the policies of the `60's, and that's the best Kim can come up with.
Meanwhile, his rival, Simon Crean, has something new and exciting: ""industry policy""—which means lots of ""plans"" and Budget subsidies, with Simon doing all the deals with his Melbourne manufacturing mates.
Apparently this is something we've never tried before.
The Age  editorial of 24 November last year, headed `Labor looks to the past for its future', said the platform:
. . . relies on broad statements of social-democratic principle, rather than detailed policies of the kind laid down in the existing platform. This means that it remains unclear just where the Labor party is headed . . . 
And the list goes on and on. Max Walsh, in the Sydney Morning Herald  of 12 November 1996, said that `Simon Crean's interventionism is simply a re-packaging' of the historically documented problems of protectionism and it will be a `costly mistake'. There is page after page of ridicule and condemnation of the member for Hotham, in 
 particular, but also the Labor Party that is endorsing his ad hoc, ill-defined and generalised industry intervention policies.
In place of Labor's confusion and uncertainties, and outright superficialities, you have the government's industry policy. I wonder whether or not the opposition has bothered to read the `Investing for growth' document of the government. There you will see every aspect of industry policy comprehensively brought together, as well as an array of government financial assistance and incentives.
Quite frankly, Labor has nothing to tell the government about industry policy because the major initiatives for the government's policy of investing for growth include provision of over $1 billion for four years for targeted support for innovation. We more proactively promote Australia's advantages as an investment location through the Invest Australia program. We have specific incentives to attract strategic investment projects to Australia. We expanded the export market development grants scheme. We introduced a new system, as the minister referred to earlier on, of manufacture in bond. We introduced a range of taxation measures to increase the attractiveness of Australia as a financial centre, providing $80 million over four years. As well as that we have a 125 per cent tax incentive for R&D, and we have got a range of programs which provide for targeted support for basic R&D, commercialisation and technology diffusion.
The government's policy, whether microeconomically directed or by macroeconomic settings, is to make sure Australia's economy is strong, is competitive, is export orientated and is able to meet the challenges of a greater and greater free trade. The Labor Party have put together a gladbag of ideas, mostly drawn from the wish list of their union or manufacturing mates. It serves only a small sector of their constituency and not Australian industry as a whole. (Time expired)

"Macklin, Jenny, MP",ALP,1998-06-30,"—We are again debating the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998. I have already made some remarks. It is and, I must say, it remains an injustice that people can be prevented from working, from studying and from doing the everyday things of life such as shopping and going to the library simply because they have a disability.
In 1992 the Labor government established the Disability Discrimination Act. That act was about providing people with disabilities with a legal avenue of redress for discrimination against them on the basis of their disability. We introduced the separate position of 
 Disability Discrimination Commissioner to make sure that the Disability Discrimination Act delivered real changes to people's lives in these areas. What we needed then and what we need now is national leadership. I am very sorry to say, particularly on behalf of people with disabilities in this country, that we are not getting national leadership from the Howard government. We will no longer be able to get it from the Disability Discrimination Commissioner either, because there will not be one.
One of the most important things about the disability discrimination agenda is the standards. The Disability Discrimination Act provided a foundation for standards in a range of areas—employment, education, the built-in environment, communications and transport—so that we could change the environment around us to give people with disabilities a fair go. The standards were a very big step forward. They introduced a process based on negotiation and conciliation. They lifted the focus on individuals with  disabilities and put the focus on the environment. The focus was on the fact that disabilities can become a barrier to participation only if our environment is inadequate.
Now all that has changed. People with disabilities face a very different environment. They face a government which is no longer prepared to provide national leadership for reform. This is a government which does not seem to understand that providing access for people with disabilities actually benefits the whole community. Let us take the example of accessible transport. A simple thing like providing a ramp for bus access can make the world of difference not only for a person in a wheelchair but also for the mother with a pram or an elderly person with a walking frame. As our population ages, we need to think about how to make transport more accessible. This bill sees the Howard government walking away from this agenda. This government is turning its back on the five years in which people with disabilities were able to make real gains.
There is also the issue of cost. It is a major issue because the government has changed the way that complaints will be funded under the 
 act. Under the current system, a person with a disability can pursue a complaint with the commission at no cost. The two parties can sit down and, with the help of the commission, try to work out a solution. In the process, people start to understand the challenges faced by people with disabilities. But now, if people want to proceed with their complaint, they have to take it to the Federal Court. If they lose the case, they will of course be liable for costs. People with disabilities will have to pay legal fees and much more if they lose their case. I am sure that honourable members can understand the effect that this will have on people with disabilities.
Disability groups around Australia are most concerned about these changes. They are saying that people will not pursue complaints because they are terrified about the costs. We must remember that most people with disabilities are on low incomes because of their disability. I want to read to the House part of a note that I received from the Physical Disability Council of Australia about the result of the changes that we are debating. They said:
This means that people with disabilities will almost always commence an action with no real idea of the chance of success. A person losing a case against a `big spending corporation' could face bankruptcy. People with disabilities believe this is too high a risk for the potential gain—access to a theatre, access to a bus system, employment discrimination and so on.
That is from the Physical Disability Council of Australia. They said:
What good is a Disability Discrimination Act if people cannot afford to use it? What good are disability standards if the current substandard access for people with disabilities is rarely challenged?
Another significant aspect of the bill before us is that it aims to shift the focus away from intervention in particular cases and toward the provision of education and the raising of public awareness of discrimination issues. It does this in two distinct ways. First, it re-orders the primary functions of the commission to emphasise its educative role. Secondly, it reduces the commission's powers in respect of individual cases by requiring it to obtain the permission of the Attorney-General before seeking to intervene in court proceed 
 ings and by removing its power to recommend the payment of damages in discrimination cases.
I certainly do not wish to downplay the importance of public education in this context. Of course, it has a vital role to play. However, it must not be forgotten that individual cases play a very important part in raising public awareness. Such cases are often widely publicised and can send a clear message that unlawful discrimination will not be tolerated. One case that is often referred to is the case of Cox v. Queensland state government. In this case a person with a physical disability successfully challenged the building of the convention centre in South Bank in Brisbane city because there was no access through the front door. As surprising as this may sound—a major entertainment complex with no thought to wheelchair access—it happened. And it still happens. The person who challenged the building was successful. The Queensland state government had to install a lift and the case received a lot of attention.
This demonstrates the power of the current approach. It sends a very strong message to all governments and all businesses that they need to be constantly thinking about people with disabilities and how they will fare in using services or getting into buildings. It is the kind of constant reminder that governments of all political persuasions and at all levels, and all businesses also, need. We all need this constant reminder about the problems that people with disabilities face in either getting access to services or getting into buildings.
Labor opposes this bill and we feel particularly strongly about the attack on the Disability Discrimination Commissioner. We will not walk away from the Disability Discrimination Act. There is an enormous amount more to be done to make sure that people with disabilities get access to services, to the built environment, to the ordinary things of life that all of us take for granted. Our platform commits a future Labor government to retaining or, if this government is successful, putting back the Disability Discrimination Commissioner and to continuing the implementation of the 
 standards that we were so proud to put in place.
Social justice for people with disabilities is an aspiration that Labor fundamentally believes in. It is a Labor value. It is something we will continue to fight for and we will certainly oppose the whittling away of the avenues that people with disabilities have had to date that this government seems so intent on doing.",REPS,<title>HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1
"Nugent, Peter, MP",LP,1998-06-30,"—I chair the Human Rights Subcommittee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and so I take a particular interest in matters concerned with human rights. Of course, over the years Australia has put in place a human rights structure that is frequently held up as a role model for others to emulate. Human rights matters command a major place in the life and the attention of this nation, and in the media of this nation. They are even a key plank in our foreign affairs policy. Human rights legislation has been built over quite a long time and covers a very wide range of areas. Yet there is always some questioning as to whether we are doing it right, and whether there are better ways of doing it or whether we should change whatever is already in place in respect of human rights activity.
One thing that disappoints me sometimes is that if you try to change something to make it a bit better there seems to be a lot of questioning as to what your motives are. It seems that if you want to change something you must, by definition, as sometimes those on the other side will say, be acting on base motives. There is no acknowledgment that changing things might enable you to deliver a better result. It seems to me that in this place we should always be looking for better ways of doing things.
One of the important building blocks, in terms of human rights in this country, and human rights delivery and human rights protection, whether it is in disabilities, as the member for Jagajaga (Ms Macklin) was talking about, or in the whole range of other areas of human rights activity, is the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. This bill is all about making some changes to 
 HREOC. Given that this particular debate was started last week and was adjourned until a few minutes ago when the member for Jagajaga continued her remarks, it would be helpful perhaps to remind the House what this bill is going to do, as opposed to some of the somewhat wild ideas that have been floated from members of the opposition during the debate.
The bill is going to rename the commission as the Human Rights and Responsibilities Commission to better reflect the commission's function of educating all Australians about their responsibility to respect each other's human rights. The new commission's structure will consist of a president and three deputy presidents, each of whom will have responsibility for particular subject areas. One deputy president will be responsible for human rights and disability, one will be responsible for social justice and race and one will be responsible for sex discrimination and equal opportunity. Therefore, it is actually not true to say, for example, as the member for Jagajaga did, that there is no interest in the disability area.
The bill provides for the functions performed by the current Privacy Commissioner to be separated from the commission and for a statutory office of the Privacy Commissioner to be created. The bill provides for the refocusing of the commission's functions in order to give greater priority to education, dissemination of information on human rights and assistance to business and the general community. The bill will make the commission's power to intervene in court proceedings which raise human rights issues conditional upon it first obtaining the Attorney-General's approval. The bill provides for the abolition of the Community Relations Council, which has never been actually established, and the abolition of the National Committee for the Elimination of Discrimination in Employment and Occupation, which has only produced one report since it was first established.
The new commission will not retain the current power of the Human Rights Commissioner to make non-binding recommendations in reports to the Attorney-General for the 
 payment of damages or compensation following inquiries into complaints of breaches of human rights under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act 1986. Unlike complaints under the three anti-discrimination acts, these particular complaints do not deal with conduct which is alleged to be unlawful.
When governments make changes to legislation, there are those who will always impugn some base motive. There will be agreement on some aspects of what we are proposing and disagreement on others. Certainly a lot of people just suspect any change that is undertaken. There are pros and cons, I would suggest, to a number of aspects of the changes that we are making. I must admit that I had some reservations, for example, in not having special commissioners to look after each individual area, as has hitherto been the case. But it seems to me that we should always be prepared to look at new ways of doing things. If you get somebody who specialises only in a narrow area, certainly you get the benefit of particular expertise. But, equally, if you have somebody who takes a somewhat broader view, then they can often bring attitudes, views, knowledge and expertise from outside that limited area that might be beneficial, and it is worth having a look at and perhaps trialling that sort of approach.
We are asked sometimes whether there is a hidden agenda of the government backing away from human rights. I do not believe that is the case. I believe the government is certainly looking at doing things differently, but just because we want to do them differently does not mean to say that we are backing away. There is certainly a change of emphasis, and we are looking particularly to put more emphasis on the education side. There is also the introduction of responsibilities—something that will strike a chord with many in the community. Nothing should be cast in tablets of stone. We need to respond to community concerns, be prepared to make some changes, and to respond to changed circumstances. I am not sure how some of the changes will work out, but I think we should be prepared to give them a go.
But quite apart from the structures—and that is what this legislation is all about—it would seem to me that often human rights advocacy and the effectiveness of human rights advocacy are not always about structures; they are often about the people and the attitudes in the community that they respond to. This country has produced some outstanding people in the field of human rights—people who have set a fine example in this country as well as overseas. I am talking about people such as Sir Ronald Wilson, who is a previous president of the HREOC. He produced the stolen children report and was the Deputy Chairman of the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation in its first three years—a council on which I had the honour to serve for about six years, including Sir Ronald's three years.
I am also talking about people such as Chris Sidoti, who is still at HREOC. He has sometimes been critical of the government and, frankly, I think that is not always a bad thing. If somebody comes up with reasoned argument or evidence and criticises some of the things that governments do, whether it is this government, the previous government or the next government, there should be a place in our society for them, for independent bodies, to do so. Chris has certainly done that sometimes. One example was when he criticised the detention for far too long of illegal migrants by the department of immigration.
Chris Sidoti and HREOC have been very important in enforcing and supporting human rights not only in this country but also overseas. We, as a country, do a lot of work in the region in the human rights area. The Australian government has funded regional human rights bodies and HREOC provides much of the expertise to support those human rights bodies in the region. The restructuring will, I assume, mean that the present appointments will be terminated and new appointments made. I would certainly hope that Chris Sidoti—who I think is an outstanding Australian and an outstanding worker in the human rights field—is retained in a future role in HREOC.
Human rights activity must be an ongoing evolutionary process, and this is part of that 
 ongoing change that is inevitable. Other initiatives have also been undertaken by the government. One of the things, for example, that this government has undertaken—a new initiative, which I think is to its credit—in the human rights area is the creation of the Centre for Democratic Institutions, an important Australian government initiative aimed at promoting democracy, human rights and effective governance in developing countries, particularly in the Asia-Pacific region. The establishment of the centre fulfils a promise that we made at the last election to assist developing countries to strengthen democracy and provide effective governance. Governance is now one of the five priority sectors for the aid program. Only last week it was announced that the new director of the CDI was Mr Roland Rich. He is a long-serving and outstanding member of the staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and I am sure that he will carry out his duties diligently and in an outstanding manner. I, and I am sure all the other members of this House, wish him every success in that future appointment.
This government in many ways will continue the human rights policies that have been in place for a long time. But we also will institute a number of new initiatives—initiatives with both human rights in this country and human rights overseas. The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), for example, only this afternoon in question time was talking about his upcoming trip to Indonesia. Part of our government's activity will be through our activity overseas. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has made it clear that he will be raising with the Indonesian government a whole raft of issues in terms of human rights type activities. Whether it be democracy or military suppression in East Timor or brutality in the recent civil disturbances in Indonesia, those are the sorts of things which we have a proud record of pursuing at all levels overseas, and we will continue to do so.
—What about the poor Australian journalists?
—The gentleman from Dickson interjects, `What about the Australian 
 journalists?' The reality of life is that only yesterday we had a motion in this place, on which I spoke, about the Australian journalists. We are pressing, and the government has pressed, the Indonesian government and its new President, President Habibie, to open a new inquiry into the deaths of those Australian journalists. In fact, the Indonesian Minister for Justice has indicated that he is prepared to look at new evidence and, potentially, have a new inquiry into the deaths of those Australian journalists.
This government has been active, as was the previous government, in encouraging Indonesia to go down the particular track of having that new inquiry. I think the important thing at the moment is that, with the change of government in Indonesia, with its new President and new regime, we are seeing a fresh willingness to look at some of those issues and to take a different approach to the one that was taken under the former President of Indonesia. Therefore, it is important that this government, if you like, strikes while the iron is hot and pursues those matters. Those are matters which the Minister for Foreign Affairs has said he will be pursuing during his visit to Indonesia in the next few days—specifically, to look into having a new inquiry into the deaths of those journalists, to look at the problems in East Timor and to look at the issue of human rights as they apply across the board in Indonesia.
There are a whole raft of other issues that the government needs to pursue in connection with its foreign affairs policy and the issue of human rights, whether child labour in places like Pakistan and India, forced sterilisation of women in China, political issues in Burma and so on. We need to take a very hard look at a whole range of those areas, and we need to look at the manner in which we go about our diplomacy in those areas.
In closing, I would just say that this government is active in the human rights area. This government is aware of concerns and the need to look constantly at how we might approach these issues more effectively. This government does adopt a slightly different approach to that adopted by the former government. This government from time to time will 
 change things and, where it thinks appropriate, it will not be intimidated into not doing so.
This bill makes changes to HREOC which will now become the HRRC—and I am not sure what the mnemonic for that will be. Time will tell if the changes are to be effective, but certainly I believe we need to keep an ongoing watching brief to see whether or not those changes are effective. We need to monitor that situation, but we do need to give the changes a chance to succeed. I commend the bill to the House.",REPS,<title>HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1
"Theophanous, Andrew, MP",ALP,1998-06-30,"—The previous speaker, the member for Aston (Mr Nugent), spoke at length on international human rights, and they are very important. He did not speak much about the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998  and its purposes and what has been happening to human rights under the Howard government.
Unfortunately, this bill is about the emasculation of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The commission has been attacked, its budget has been cut and now we have this so-called restructuring of the commission in order to cover up what the Howard government has done in the area of human rights.
There are two aspects to this. The first aspect concerns there having been a very significant reduction in expenditure in this area. The second aspect, which is equally unacceptable, is that the government wanted to get rid of certain individuals who were acting as commissioners or not reappoint some commissioners, and so it decided to restructure the commission and get rid of those commissioners.
In the initial phase, in the initial proposals from the government, there were to be no specific commissioners at all; we were to end up with having no specifically oriented commissioners. Because of public protest about this proposal, the government has now made some concessions and there will be three deputy presidents with specific expertise in certain areas. That is an improvement on what was previously proposed. But, nevertheless, what the government has been trying, 
 and continues, to do with the general structure in this area of human rights is still unacceptable.
It is all very well for the member for Aston to come in here and talk about how we need to do more in the area of international human rights—and I agree with him; I think that Australia does need to do more in the area of international human rights—but also we need to look at our own human rights record and we need to do more to ensure that human rights are protected in this country.
One of the most unacceptable things about this legislation is the way in which it abolishes the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner. That commissioner has played a very important role in trying to ensure that people of indigenous background achieve social justice and that discrimination against those people which takes a variety of forms—both subtle and not so subtle—is not present in Australia. That was the intention in having the Social Justice Commissioner for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders. That position has been abolished and replaced with another which will take a broader role in racial discrimination.
This broader role, in a sense, is one example of responding to phenomena such as One Nation when attacks are made against Aboriginal people by saying, `Let's get rid of specific services and specific provisions that help and assist our indigenous people.' I have to say that we are very unhappy about that. We do not believe the government has given any real explanation for the actions it took in this area. There are other areas which the government has cut back—for example, the Sex Discrimination Commissioner. That was up in the air for quite some time. Again, the government has been confused. It has sent out confused signals about what it intends to do in terms of the elimination of all forms of discrimination against women. But I think that at least we now have some progress in that the government has recognised that there is a need for some specific responsibilities for the new commissioners. I guess one has to be thankful for small mercies, given what they originally intended to do, which was to get rid of all the specific commissioners. I do want 
 to record my protest in particular about what they did in relation to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner.
The reality is that in this country we have very many forms of discrimination against people. We have discrimination against people on the basis of their race, on the basis of their cultural background, on the basis of their sex and on the basis of their disability. Although we have made progress as a society, we also have dark forces in our community that seek to turn back the clock and entrench discrimination. One way to overcome discrimination is to have a proper access and equity program; a program that guarantees access and equity, especially in the provision of government services. I have a lot to say on this matter because, when I was Parliamentary Secretary to the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, I was directly responsible for the access and equity program for people of migrant background and for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.
We put into place a whole series of programs to ensure that access and equity took place. This was done through the Office of Multicultural Affairs, and about 50 per cent of the work of the Office of Multicultural Affairs was concerned with ensuring that the access and equity program was implemented. I can tell you that implementation of a program such as access and equity, which is intended to ensure that discrimination does not take place, especially in the Public Service—whether it is the federal or state public services—is not an easy matter. Indeed, Prime Minister Keating requested me in 1994 to carry out consultations in relation to discrimination against ethnic, or non-English speaking background, people. I carried out what were called multicultural consultations throughout Australia in 1994.
At that time what did we discover? We discovered that, notwithstanding the fact that we had had an access and equity program for about 10 years in this country, we still had significant aspects of government programs which were not being delivered on the basis of equal access and equity. We had discrimination within the Public Service, and we had 
 discrimination in the delivery of programs to people of ethnic background or Aboriginal background. I am sure that there was also discrimination in the delivery of programs to women. So what does the Howard government do when it takes office? It abolishes the Office of Multicultural Affairs. Therefore, the whole access and equity program, including the whole issue of the responsibility of departments to report on their achievements in access and equity, is abolished.
What do we have now? The Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) was given a couple of officers in Canberra whose whole job is to try to do what previously half of the Office of Multicultural Affairs was engaged in doing: that is, ensure that there are programs which overcome the problems of discrimination and ensure access and equity and the like. Now we have these couple of officers working in the department supposedly monitoring all the departments of the federal government in relation to this whole issue of access and equity. What a joke! As was proven in the discussions that I had in 1994, the reality is that the Public Service in this country has its own entrenched processes and structures and was not interested in actually changing its structures to deliver genuine access and equity. That was when we had a large number of people monitoring the situation.
Now what have we done? We have got rid of all those people and we have a couple of people in the department of immigration. If that was not enough, what happens to the independent Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission  budget. We have to reduce the number of commissioners, and we have to get rid of the specific commissioners. That is our idea of ensuring that there is not discrimination in this country and that there is an enforcement of human rights. This is an absolute nonsense. We have gone backwards in the estimation of the international community in relation to this matter. What we have to do is strengthen those programs, not weaken them.
I do not know why the Minister for the Status of Women (Mrs Moylan) is here. Given the reduction in resources, I do not 
 know what she intends to do about discrimination against women. Does she expect that discrimination against women is going to go down once resources are reduced? Is that what she expects when we know that in fact the opposite is happening?
—Do we?
—`Do we?' says the Attorney-General. Of course, you would not know, would you? Because you do not even bother to look into these matters. You are not even concerned. You did not even defend this commission when it went to cabinet; you allowed those cuts to this commission to go through. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. If you were really serious about these matters, you would have asked for more resources in this area instead of allowing these massive cuts to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission to take place.
—Just throw money at it!
—You think it is just a question of throwing money at it, do you? It is not a question of throwing money at it at all. Some of your legislation is inadequate in this area as well, and you need to do something about it. But what have you done about it in the years that you have been in government? Nothing. That situation is serious.
—We've done more than you.
—I remind you that we put the whole structure in place. Also, if you look at our reports on access and equity and in this area, we were never satisfied with what was happening. In every single report we said that more needs to be done. Have a look at the 1994 and 1995 reports on access and equity. These reports openly and honestly state, `We have problems, we are dealing with those problems, but we need to deal with them even further.' At no point did we say, `We are self-satisfied; we can cut the resources off a body such as the human rights commission.'
—You just kept putting out report after report and did nothing with them.
—The minister knows that there has been a substantial increase in the problems confronting women. During question time, she tried to tell us how 
 superannuation programs for women are getting better. I was just astounded by her statements.
—You didn't do anything about it, did you?
—We didn't, didn't we? We brought in a compulsory superannuation program which covered all workers, which therefore covered the most poorly paid part of the population, which happens to be women workers. What have you done? You have abandoned that program, you have got rid of that program, and therefore a large number of women who were in superannuation programs are no longer under those programs. You ought to be ashamed of yourself for getting rid of that superannuation program which covered all Australians. Now we have a situation where people are covered only if they want to be covered.
—Watch us, you might learn something.
—Order! I ask members to address their remarks through the chair.
—The minister seems to think that she has done a good job of the superannuation issue, but she has done a great disservice to women in this country because the majority of beneficiaries of that program were women. There is a range of other areas, even wages for workers, where women are discriminated against and continue to be discriminated against. What is the minister doing about it? `We will do a great deal, won't we? We will cut the resources of the human rights commission.'
Let us hope that the new structure which has been put into place is effective. We are going to be watching this very closely: we are going to be watching the appointments, we are going to be watching the resources which your government gives to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in its new restructured form and we are going to be bringing to your attention lapses in the area of the implementation of human rights.
Especially with the Hanson phenomenon rampant in this country, there is no doubt that people now are very afraid about discrimina 
 tion against them. It is not just a question of discrimination against women; it is also a question of discrimination in race and culture. We have had in this country a terrifying debate where even the Prime Minister (Mr Howard)—belatedly, after two years of walking around like a blind man, not seeing what was happening—finally said the other day, `Some people of Asian background are starting to feel that maybe they are not welcome in Australia or that they are not really the same as the rest of us, that perhaps they are second-class citizens.'
It took him two whole years to recognise what was happening with the Hanson phenomenon. If he had gone out and talked to people of ethnic backgrounds, if he had had a single minister who was interested in talking to the ethnic communities about these issues, then he might have understood what was happening—especially amongst people of Asian and Middle-Eastern backgrounds, people from Latin America and people from the recently arrived European groups. All those groups were wondering what was happening in Australia. They all started to feel that forms of discrimination against them would be allowed in this society, even encouraged. That is one of the most serious things that has developed as a result of allowing the Hanson phenomenon to build up in the way that it has.
But I regret to say that this government is one for which, in most areas of its administration, the minimum amount is adequate: `We need some human rights legislation, let us have the minimum. Let us not have some of the best. Let us not have the best resourced. Let us not really do a good job. Let us just do a minimum and barely adequate job. That is enough for us.' That is something which is true of a whole range of areas in the administration of this government.
From my point of view, I am very disappointed to see that so many programs put into place to overcome discrimination and to ensure people had basic human rights, access and equity have been totally abolished. We do not even monitor some of the matters that we used to monitor, for example, the access of people from different backgrounds to employ 
 ment in the public service and programs which the government is supposed to be delivering fairly and adequately to everybody. I am sad to say that this bill reflects some of the worst changes in human rights in legislation before this parliament that I have seen in the years I have been here. I hope that we will be able to reverse some of these negative developments and change what is happening so that Australians can feel that their human rights are being protected.

"Smith, Tony, MP",IND,1998-06-30,"—Lest it be thought that I am a dark force—given what the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) said—it is always right to question anything. To question any direction that is being taken by government is a healthy thing; it is not necessarily a dark force. Those who see what happened in Queensland as being a result of the forces of evil or darkness are actually missing the point. They should be asking themselves what they have been doing in the last 15 to 20 years to muster that sort of opposition. It is really the large parties and the policies they have adopted that have brought about that opposition, not the Hanson factor. It is the anti large party phenomenon. People are sick to death of being preached to by people like some members of the House who are saying that there are sinister, dark forces at work. With respect, that is rubbish.
All the time we need to question the direction of state based organisations. It is important to do this. Let me give you two examples. If you keep saying that we need to keep funding this and we need to go on and so forth, without pointing to examples you are missing the downside of these sorts of things. By way of background, I spoke in the House on 22 September 1997 about some people in my electorate who had run a small business for 36 years. They had the misfortune to be taken to the anti-discrimination commission by a totally unmeritorious applicant. I do not intend to repeat the facts I outlined in my grievance debate speech, but the cost to those people almost broke their business in two. They were decent, honourable people who were terrorised by the anti-discrimination commission. Ultimately, it had a fairly sad result. After I spoke in this place they eventu 
 ally settled the case, not because they felt this person had merits but because they were advised, having spent $20,000 to defend their situation and the applicant having spent nothing because the state was funding him, to pay him something to get the whole thing off their backs. It becomes a question of blackmail in so many cases. If instruments of the state are used to effect that sort of result, we have to question what those instruments are doing.
I was involved in another case. I acted for a chap who was charged with attempted rape some years ago. The case went to trial and in the course of defending himself this man lost his home and his family. He also lost his job because it was a workplace situation. But he defended himself successfully. He was found not guilty and acquitted. He gave evidence in his own trial and the jury were not convinced that the charge was proven beyond reasonable doubt. After that had finished he phoned me up and said that he had been advised that the prosecutrix in the case, the complainant, spoke to some of his friends at work and said that he got off because he lied to the jury. As a result of that, I suggested he take further legal action in the case. So he sued the complainant for defamation and for malicious prosecution. We took that to trial. He had no money so the solicitors and I undertook it on a speculative basis.
That was before a civil jury. The case did not go just a couple of days. When we got to court we found that the defendant was funded ex gratia by the state Attorney-General. My solicitor and I were almost exhausted. We were tied up in a case for three weeks with no legal fees coming in. The whole thing was litigated again and the civil jury found that, on the balance of probabilities, not only did he not attempt to rape the woman but also she had defamed him. The court awarded a sum of damages.
If I thought the case was over then, I was wrong because the next move that she made was to take him to the discrimination tribunal along with the employer. After all of that, some months later he rang me again and said, `She's at it again. She's after more money.' Having gone through the committal proceed 
 ings, the criminal trial and the civil trial and even having taken it to an appeal initially—but that was dropped when the matter was finally settled—this woman got legal aid to go to the discrimination tribunal to have another shot. If you think that you sit around the table at the discrimination tribunal and you have nice negotiations, think again because what happens there is simply quite stark. The people who staff those tribunals become in a sense—as Gary Johns, the former minister, said—judge and advocate in the cases.
They put it quite simply: `You can settle the case now or it will go for two weeks.' As I said to the person concerned, `We will be here for two weeks,'—because there is no way that this man is going to give her one red cent. But the former employer could not afford it—it was running an old people's home for charity—and, instead of being caught for two weeks in the discrimination tribunal with the resultant fees of probably in excess of $20,000, it paid her some money to get it out of that way. A totally unmeritorious complainant who had been though all those proceedings managed to extort some money yet again in another case. When the state, through its instrumentalities, is effecting that sort of result there is something wrong.
I am a passionate advocate for the court system. There is no substitute for the court system because that is the only way you can get to the truth: you can have your trial, you can have the evidence in chief, the cross-examination, and the proper judicial process with a jury of 12 commonsense people, or four people in the case of a civil jury. But the so-called human rights area can effect an awful lot of human wrongs, and here are two cases where the someone had to pay up for the wrong reasons. If that is a system that the government is now attempting to look at and restructure, I say that is good, but it has not gone far enough. Mr Johns wrote in his article in the Australian on 31 July 1997:
There is also some doubt over the use being made of the commission. For example, it has been reported that since the Racial Discrimination Act—administered by the commission—was passed 20 years ago, only 20 cases that have gone to public hearing have been upheld. 

Only 20 cases he refers to. He is talking about a report, so I do not know how accurate this is, but I do not think it has ever been challenged. You have to question where we are going if those are the figures, that we are spending an awful lot of money to effect that sort of result in 20 years. You really have to question that.
This is one of the problems that the government parties have. They have snuggled up too close with the human rights industry. They have not been game to make themselves different from that side, so they have made some changes, they have tinkered at the edges, but they have not really created the cleavage that is necessary between the two sides of politics.
That is what the people of Queensland have been saying in that state election. They are not saying that they have embraced Hansonism with a fervour. They are not saying that they have embraced the mad loony right. They are fed up with the lack of any identifiable group of policies that distinguishes the conservative side of politics from the Labor side of politics. We are all huddled together in this group with a few cliques in the middle of it all. This is one area where, I would submit, the government has a chance to do something much more.
The problem goes further than that, and Dr Ron Brunton referred to this in his brilliant article Betraying the victims. . . which was his critique of the stolen generation report. I have never heard anybody say, `That's not correct.' I have not heard an analysis of Dr Brunton's report in which anyone has said, `Dr Brunton was completely wrong in his critique,' apart from Zita Antonios. She made some comments about it in a general sense—they were totally non-specific of course—but Ron Brunton said:
I believe there are sufficient grounds to justify treating Bringing Them Home  as one of the most intellectually and morally irresponsible reports to be presented to an Australian government in recent years.
How many members of this parliament have read that critique? I guarantee there would not be more than a handful. It is a brilliant critique. It is not written by somebody who 
 could ever be said to be a racist or some loony right person; this is a person who exposed the Hindmarsh Island fraud, who defended the so-called `dissident women', the Ngarrindjeri women. This is why Dr Brunton concluded his report by saying, about the members of the government, of which I was once part:
Too many members of the Howard government seem to have lost confidence in the moral authority of their own supposed philosophical principles of liberalism, and seem to accept that they have no right to occupy the moral high ground. They need to remember that Martin Luther King's stirring wish that his children would see a time when people `will not be judged by the colour of their skin but by the content of their character' is a classic expression of the liberal ideal.
The member for Aston (Mr Nugent) made statements earlier on in relation to Sir Ronald Wilson. He was a good High Court judge but, with the greatest respect to Sir Ronald Wilson, he was an awful commissioner in these proceedings because he got down with the issue. Instead of staying above the issue, he got involved in the issue. There is an old saying: once you start getting involved with your client, you lose your judgment and your capacity for reason. You never get involved, if you are a lawyer, with your client's problems; you have got to be that distance removed. He was not.
Consequently, we come up with this extraordinary comment emanating from the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission through that report. Listen to this extraordinary comment by Dr Brunton:
The current elasticity of genocide is brought home by the silliest statement in Bringing Them Home . This is the claim that ""the continuation into the 1970s and 1980s of the practice of preferring non-Indigenous foster and adoptive families for Indigenous children was also arguably genocidal"".
Dr Brunton rightly observes:
From such a perspective, virtually anything goes.
That is the problem. When you say everything is discrimination or everything is genocidal, you lose the meaning and you lose the ability to flush out the cases that need to be flushed out—the cases where there has been terrible discrimination or terrible treatment—because you are mixed up with these generalisations. 
 It comes from the inexactitude of language that has crept into our society so much that now, instead of the analysis of the stolen generation report so-called, we are presented with something which Dr Brunton says—rightly, in my opinion—is a very questionable document, and yet it becomes the norm.
It is a bit like the human rights industry generally. There is the statement by the English socialist Hastie: `Racism increases in direct proportion to the number of highly paid bureaucrats you employ to find it.' We have a situation here where the government has been caught up in this environment. In 1990 the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) opposed the Convention on the Rights of the Child when he was in opposition, but now the government say, `No, we are prepared to content ourselves with the Convention on the Rights of the Child.' They have lost their moral, persuasive authority. They are not able to say, `That is not good enough. That is not what we as liberals'—with a small `l'—`believe in.' Consequently, we have the Convention on the Rights of the Child, for example, as one human rights document. It is a great document bar the three or four very nasty little clauses dealing with child autonomy which effectively can impinge upon the Australian family. We have seen examples of that already by virtue of the international committee trying to tell Australian families how they should bring up their children.
When we hear the member for Calwell saying these things about dark forces and when we hear people unable to articulate the distinctions that are necessary to be made between certain forms of conduct that are acceptable and certain forms of conduct that are not acceptable—lumping everything in and calling it genocide, for example, no matter what it is—we lose sight of the problems for individuals.
That is why we saw the awful situation involving Hindmarsh Island where the women who were honest—the decent women—were called the dissident women because they were saying, `This is a fraud, this is a fabrication.' They were called dissident by the ABC, by the media and by everybody else—except for Dr Brunton and a few others who said that 
 this was a fraud. Ultimately, because it was pursued through the courts—properly, with cross-examination and all those things that the legal process contains—the problem was fixed up and we came to the real truth of the matter.
That is why I say that in this particular area we cannot rest on our laurels. We cannot afford to look at the new commission and say, `This will solve the problem. We will have all these nice conferences where people will sit very happily around the table.' Can you imagine sitting around a table with someone who spat in your face? That is what happened to an employee of one of my constituents. He was spat at by the individual who took them to the commission. Can you imagine sitting around a table with an individual like that? That is the notion that is implied in this commission idea—that we all sit around and resolve it in this cosy way. It does not work, and it has to be acknowledged that it does not work.
You cannot allow people to use the state systems to effect an instrument of terror on decent, law-abiding citizens, and that can happen. It is no good saying, `That wouldn't happen all that often.' If it happens in one case it has happened in one too many cases, because those people were nearly run out of business as a result of that matter. I say again: we need to be vigilant and ever careful. We have had a very lame response from anyone who wants to look at the issue in relation to the stolen generation. We have not had any intellectual debate about this. We have had a blanket acceptance because we are petrified of political correctness. We really need a debate to help the victims, who were victims in the case of the stolen generation, instead of getting caught up in the debate that ultimately turns people to the Hansonism that is going to fuel the political divide in this country for a long time to come.",REPS,<title>HUMAN RIGHTS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1
"Williams, Daryl, MP",LP,1998-06-30,"—in reply—I assume that all members who wish to speak on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998  have now spoken. I would like to thank the members for Banks (Mr Melham), Bradfield (Dr Nelson), Chifley (Mr Price), 
 Throsby (Mr Hollis), Brisbane (Mr Bevis), Batman (Mr Martin Ferguson), Jagajaga (Ms Macklin), Aston (Mr Nugent), Calwell (Dr Theophanous) and Dickson (Mr Tony Smith), who have contributed to the debate on the bill, and for their interest in it.
As I outlined in my second reading speech, this bill is intended to be the catalyst for fundamental cultural change in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The changes it proposes to the structure and functions of the commission are a step forward, not a backwards step as has been alleged during the debate. The changes aim to remove those aspects of the commission's current structure and operations which most inhibit its ability to effectively promote and protect the human rights of all Australians while retaining the protection currently available to them under the federal anti-discrimination legislation. This fundamental cultural change in the commission is reflected in its proposed new name, the Human Rights and Responsibilities Commission. The new name also reflects the importance of promoting an understanding of every Australian's responsibility to respect the human rights of others.
In the course of the debate on the bill, a number of issues have been raised by the members who have spoken. I propose to address some of those issues. The member for Banks has claimed that the government's reductions in the budget of the commission amount to some 55 per cent over five years. It is hardly a criticism of the current government, which has been in office for just over two years, but the claim is in any event wrong. If the member for Banks had checked his figures before talking about this, he would have known that the reduction in real terms amounts to only about 27 per cent over the last three years. This government was elected on a platform of fiscal responsibility after it inherited from the Labor government a large budget deficit which could not be sustained. The reductions in the commission's funding reflect a need across government to ensure that in difficult financial times funds are applied in an efficient manner. The commission was subjected to budget reductions and, 
 like all agencies within the Attorney-General's portfolio, was also subject to the standard efficiency dividend of four per cent.
Additional reductions in the commission's funding can be clearly justified on other grounds. For example, reductions associated with the transfer of the commission's hearing and determination functions to the Federal Court are a natural consequence of the government's response to the High Court's decision in Brandy v. Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. This change was not made to achieve savings but rather to reflect the fact that the commission would no longer be performing a particular function. Further `reductions' resulted from the completion of projects which had been allocated specific and limited funding. In reality, these are not reductions that all; rather, the loss of funding inevitably follows from the completion of the projects for which the additional funding had been provided.
The member for Chifley asked about the processes which led to the government's decision to restructure the commission and move from five specialist commissioners to three deputy presidents. He should know, and I happy to remind him, that it was in fact his own party when in government which established a tripartite review of the commission's structure and operations. That review involved the commission itself, along with my department and the then Department of Finance.
In response to the contention of the member for Jagajaga that there is simply no evidence that the current commission is inefficient and top-heavy, I would like to make it clear that it was the tripartite review to which I have just referred that identified a number of aspects of the current structure and operations of the commission which needed attention. I can add, from my own perspective, that it seemed odd to me that a portfolio agency would have at the deputy secretary level more persons than were in the department itself at the same time. The review also made a number of recommendations for changes to the structure and operations of the commission, many of which have been adopted by the government in this bill and the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1), 
 the Brandy bill, which is currently before the Senate.
The member for Banks also suggested that the government has been deliberately delaying debate on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) in the Senate. Let me make it plain that I categorically reject this assertion. Delays have in fact arisen as a result of the opposition's very public stance against the worthwhile reforms proposed by that bill. As the Labor Party knows, those reforms are supported by the commission itself, which is anxiously awaiting the passage of the bill to remove the uncertainty which has been affecting its activities since the High Court's decision in Brandy. But it is not just the commission which has been affected. The government is very concerned at the impact of this unnecessary delay on persons who are currently parties to complaints under the Commonwealth's anti-discrimination legislation. While there is this delay, the big losers are the complainants and the respondents. The Senate can provide them with an effective and enforceable complaint handling system by passing the Brandy bill as soon as possible.
The member for Jagajaga criticised the Brandy bill on the basis of exposure to fees and costs in Federal Court proceedings that would result from passage of the bill. The provisions of that bill are not relevant to the bill we are debating, but I think there is an appropriate response to the criticisms which should be made. First, the cost regime in the Federal Court reflects arrangements under the existing system. A party seeking to enforce a commission determination in the Federal Court is already subject to the possibility of an adverse costs order. However, the removal of the unenforceable commission hearing function will provide parties who are unsuccessful at conciliation with direct access to the Federal Court. The scheme has the potential to redress significant delays in the current system and reduce the cost associated with obtaining a binding determination in anti-discrimination matters.
Secondly, it has always been the case that the usual rules for fees apply to anti-discrimination complaints in the Federal Court. However, in accordance with current 
 practice, these fees are not payable where a person has a card entitling him or her to Commonwealth health benefits, is receiving legal aid, Austudy or Abstudy, is a minor or a prisoner or is a person who would suffer financial hardship if obliged to pay the fees.
Thirdly, the bill contains a number of initiatives designed to reduce cost and formality in Federal Court proceedings. The court will be able to adopt informal procedures, as it will not be bound by technicalities or legal forms. Special registry procedures will be established for human rights matters, and the commission will be able to assist with the preparation of forms necessary to commence proceedings in the Federal Court. Where there is hardship, either party to a proceeding will be able to apply to the Attorney-General for financial assistance for the proceedings.
Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 8.00 p.m.
—I will continue my address in reply on the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1998 . The member for Banks said that the Labor Party opposed the provisions in this bill which remove the commission's ability to recommend the payment of damages in relation to certain complaints, because of amendments they proposed to the Human Rights Legislation Amendment Bill 1997 , currently in the Senate; that is, the Brandy bill. The Labor Party's amendments would retain the commission's power to impose binding determinations on Commonwealth agencies.
The member for Banks has, however, seriously confused two completely different categories of complaints which can be brought before the commission. The government's proposals in this bill are concerned with complaints under the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act of breaches of human rights or equal opportunity. These complaints do not result in any finding of unlawful conduct; rather, they may be the subject of a report to the Attorney-General, which must be tabled in the parliament. They involve not only Commonwealth agencies but, potentially, private citizens and organisations.
The Labor Party's amendments to the bill in the Senate deal with complaints of unlawful discrimination under the disability, racial and sex discrimination acts, so they would not assist in relation to the complaints which are the subject of this bill before the House. Currently, the commission can make non-binding recommendations for the payment of damages or compensation in relation to complaints under the HREOC act, alleging breaches of certain human rights, including by federal agencies, section 11(1)(f), or alleging that acts or practices, including by federal or state agencies, are impairing equality of opportunity in employment, section 31(b).
Under the government's proposed structure, the commission will retain the power to inquire into complaints of breaches of human rights or allegations of impairment of equality of opportunity, to attempt to conciliate them and, if necessary, to report to the Attorney-General in relation to those complaints. However, the commission will not retain its function of recommending the payment of compensation in respect of loss or damage arising out of such complaints.
Removal of this function is consistent with the commission being primarily a forum for the negotiation and conciliation of complaints, rather than a quasi-judicial forum adjudicating on people's rights. It is also consistent with the commission's new emphasis on educating and informing people about their human rights and responsibilities.
The honourable member for Banks and the honourable member for Reid (Mr Laurie Ferguson) have raised the question of the cost of establishing a separate office of the Privacy Commissioner. The bill will create a separate statutory office of the Privacy Commissioner. The office will consist of the Privacy Commissioner and her staff. There is no reason why the establishment of a separate statutory office of the Privacy Commissioner should involve any additional expense. There will be no change in the Privacy Commissioner's functions or powers. There will be no need to incur costs in setting up the office, as the Privacy Commissioner already functions independently within the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission.
The Privacy Commissioner has always operated with her own dedicated HREOC staff. To the extent that the Privacy Commissioner has previously been provided with administrative support centrally by the commission, I understand that she intends to continue to purchase such support from the commission. The act allows her to operate on this basis.
The creation of a separate office will provide the Privacy Commissioner with an opportunity to increase the profile, and thus the effectiveness, of her work in promoting the protection of individual privacy across all sectors. This increase in the profile of the Privacy Commissioner underlines the government's commitment to the protection of privacy.
The member for Calwell suggested that one of the government's aims in restructuring the commission is to remove those members of the commission who have been critical of the government's record on human rights issues. I wish to make it very clear that no decisions have been made in relation to the new deputy president positions, following the passage of this bill.
The government firmly believes that the commission's new structure and focus, which I have already outlined, will help it to contribute to the further enhancement of Australia's enviable reputation as a world leader in this area. However, such a major reorganisation of the commission necessarily involves establishing new positions of deputy presidents to replace the positions of specialist commissioners.
Given the fundamental changes in the focus of the commission, it is appropriate that the government have an opportunity to re-appraise all relevant aspects of its operations. Once the bill is passed into law the government will consider appointments to fill the deputy president positions.
As always when making these appointments the government will appoint the best possible people to fill the positions in the commission. The government's commitment in this respect has been demonstrated by its recent appointments of the new president of the commission and the new Sex Discrimination Commis 
 sioner, both of whom received broad political and community support. We will appoint to the commission the most appropriately qualified and experienced people we can find, taking into account the functions and duties of the commission and of the deputy presidents themselves.
The member for Aston mentioned the regional work undertaken by the commission. While not directly relevant to the bill, I also commend the work done by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission in promoting the establishment and development of human rights institutions within the Asian region.
The member for Calwell made numerous references to an access and equity program conducted in the former Office of Multicultural Affairs. In response to his comments, all I can say is I will draw the attention of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) to them.
The member for Dickson referred extensively to forensic experiences in relation to human rights cases. I do not propose to comment on any individual case. The member for Dickson also referred to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the fact that the coalition, as he put it, opposed the convention. In fact, the situation was that in 1993 the opposition moved disallowance of the declaration by the then government of the convention as a scheduled document to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Act. There has been a lot happen since 1993 in relation to the convention, including an inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. I propose not to comment further, except to point out that that report is awaited with interest.
I again thank all honourable members whose interest has prompted them to contribute to the debate and who have given the bill careful consideration. I commend the bill to the House.

"Smith, Stephen, MP",ALP,1998-06-30,"—Madam Deputy Speaker, before indicating whether we on this side grant leave, I wonder whether I might have your indulgence to make some brief remarks about the process, given the somewhat unusual nature of the request of the Minister for 
 Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Anderson)?
—Indulgence is granted.
—Thank you, Madam Deputy Speaker. The minister seeks to introduce legislation underpinning the RFA process. We on this side have indicated consistently that in principle we support such legislation, and I repeat that.
In this area, more so than in many others, the devil is in the detail. As a consequence, we would wish to closely examine the detail of any legislation which the minister might introduce. As well, given that only three RFAs have been signed to date, we would not want such legislation to give a blank cheque to endorse those other nine RFA processes in advance of these individual processes being undertaken.
While happy to see this legislative side of the RFA agreement process finally being pursued by the government, it remains of great disappointment to us—and, no doubt, to the people of Burnie—that the industrial development side of the RFA process has, on the contrary, effectively been dumped by the government, namely, the wood and paper industry strategy.
On processes generally I note that the government has struggled this week to present government business, and now that it is five minutes to midnight we get this substantive legislation.
Given that industry wants bipartisan support for this legislation and while detailed consultation has, no doubt, occurred with industry, it is regrettable that the minister and the government did not give detailed legislative briefings on the contents of this legislation as the process went along either to me or to my colleague the shadow minister for the environment, the member for Denison (Mr Kerr). If I were you, minister, I would have made a point of doing that.
Madam Deputy Speaker, the minister has indicated that he seeks only to introduce the bill at this point in the cycle. On that basis, I thank you for your indulgence. Leave is granted.

"Melham, Daryl, MP",ALP,1998-06-30,"—The Family Law Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998  makes two changes to the Family Law Act 1975 in relation to intercountry adoption. The explanatory memorandum has the general outline of the bill. I think it is worthwhile reciting that explanatory memorandum, which states: 
The Bill will enable regulations to be made to give effect to bi-lateral arrangements with other countries on intercountry adoption. The objective is to provide for automatic recognition of adoption decisions made in countries which are prescribed in the regulations. In negotiations with the government of the People's Republic of China on a bi-lateral agreement on intercountry adoption, the Chinese representatives have insisted on an assurance that Australian law will recognise adoption decisions made under Chinese law. The amendments proposed in this Bill will enable regulations to be made to give recognition in Australian law to adoption decisions made in the People's Republic of China. The negotiation of a bi-lateral agreement with China can then be finalised.
The Bill will enable regulations to be made to confer jurisdiction on Australian courts to make decisions on intercountry adoptions. In developing relations for the implementation in Australia of the Hague Convention on the Protection of Children and Co-operation in Respect of Intercountry Adoption 1993, State and Territory Governments have proposed that decisions on applications for adoption should be made by certain State and Territory courts. At present the provisions of the Family Law Act 1975 do not provide for jurisdiction to be conferred on all of these courts. The amendments proposed in this Bill will enable regulations to be made to confer jurisdiction on the relevant courts.
The bill is non-contentious. It has the support of the opposition, and I indicate to the government that we are prepared to facilitate speedy passage of this bill through the parliament.",REPS,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Slipper, Peter, MP",LP,1998-06-30,"—I do not know whether the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham) is turning over a new leaf, but in speaking on a couple of bills recently his contributions have been—in a blessed way—quite brief, and I thank him for that. The government is also appreciative of the fact that the opposition is supporting, and prepared to assist, the passage of the Family Law Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998  currently before the chamber.
As has been pointed out, the Family Law Amendment Bill (No. 1) proposes that two changes be made to the Family Law Act 1975 to facilitate Australia's international arrangements on intercountry adoption. The bill will change the Family Law Act to permit the promulgation of regulations giving automatic recognition to adoption decisions made under 
 the law of prescribed overseas jurisdictions. Currently, only one country—the People's Republic of China—is proposed to be a `prescribed jurisdiction' for the purpose of this amendment, but in the future, if the various state and territory governments from around Australia are prepared to agree, there could be further regulations made prescribing other jurisdictions. So, while initially this proposal will be restricted to the People's Republic of China, it is possible that the ambit of this amendment might well be wider in the future. But, given the fact that states and territories have responsibility for adoption law in Australia, it is clear that the ambit of this amendment could not be wider without the consent of those state and territory jurisdictions.
The second change proposed by the bill will amend the Family Law Act again to facilitate arrangements for implementation of the Hague Convention on Intercountry Adoption. The Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer) tabled the convention in parliament on 1 April 1998. Unlike our predecessors, this government does have in place a new treaty making process which ensures that any proposed treaty is available for consultation and is open to public scrutiny. There have been discussions between state and territory governments. In this case, the arrangements for the implementation of the convention have been developed by the federal government working in a cooperative way with state and territory governments.
It has been proposed by those other state and territory governments that certain territory and state courts should have the right to exercise jurisdiction in relation to decisions concerning adoption to be made under the convention. Present provisions of the Family Law Act do allow jurisdiction to be conferred on some, but not all, of the relevant courts. The bill currently before the chamber will ensure that the Family Law Act is changed to permit the necessary promulgation of regulations when required to ensure that the conferral of jurisdiction on courts can be dealt with in a comprehensive way.
It has also been stressed that the legislation before the chamber does not have any finan 
 cial impact. The government hopes that this legislation will be passed expeditiously and we are heartened in this aim by the words of the honourable member for Banks, who indicated that the opposition was prepared to facilitate passage of this legislation through the parliament. When he says through the parliament, one would imagine that he is referring to the Senate where the government does not have the numbers to pass legislation without support from either the opposition or other parties.
Intercountry adoptions have become quite popular in Australia over the years, and some 300 children from around the world are adopted each year by parents in this country. The Victorian Department of Human Services has actually acted on behalf of other state and territory governments and negotiated with the authorities in mainland China towards a new bilateral agreement on the adoption of children from that country by parents not only in Victoria but also in other parts of Australia.
Interestingly enough, the Chinese authorities have said that they will not allow an agreement to be finalised unless adoption decisions under Chinese law are given automatic recognition under Australian law, and that is the reason that this piece of law is being passed through the parliament at this time. As I said earlier, adoption is indeed a state and territory matter, but presently there is no consistent mechanism in Australian state or territory law for such recognition of overseas adoptions.
This is an important piece of legislation. It is one of the great raft of bills that every year passes through the parliament supported by both sides of politics. At this time, when certain people might be stating their disillusionment with the political process and their opposition to the way that the Labor Party in question time misbehave and are constantly out of order, it ought to be recognised that many bills that pass through the House of Representatives are in fact passed in a bipartisan way.
There is real cooperation in this place and in the committee system of the parliament. I think there might be a perception around that politicians are argumentative, that we tend to score points and that we appear to be remote 
 from people in the Australian community, but when one looks at the ways that the parliament works in practice, the committee system operates and that many items of legislation receive the support of all members, it is clear that the political process in Australia is alive and well and working for the good of all Australians.
Of course, we will continue to listen and consult. We appreciate that politicians do not have a monopoly on good ideas and commonsense. But the legislation currently before the chamber is an example of our ability to work through and bring forward a law which will make two sensible changes to the Family Law Act, two changes which have the support of both sides of politics. After this legislation passes through the parliament the Family Law Act will be very much better able to deal in a compassionate and humanitarian way with intercountry adoptions.
So I am very pleased to be one of the members supporting this legislation before the House of Representatives tonight. As has been indicated, it does have the backing of the government and the opposition. Hopefully, it will pass through this place expeditiously and be given a speedy passage through the Senate. It is with a great deal of pleasure that I indicate my support for this item of legislation and I commend it to the chamber.",REPS,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Smith, Tony, MP",IND,1998-06-30,"—It is a pleasure to speak on a piece of legislation like the Family Law Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998 . Any moves that will facilitate the adoption of children, particularly children from overseas, are good moves that not only demonstrate a healthy Australian society but also indicate that we as a country are prepared to assist those countries that are sometimes less fortunate than ourselves and that do from time to time have difficulties with housing and the care of children who may be orphaned or otherwise separated from their parents or in some way needing the nurturing and care of a family. There are many good reasons for facilitating intercountry adoption in this way. Any move to help that process is a good move and I am glad to support it.
Oddly enough, I am surprised by the statement of the preceding speaker, the member for Fisher (Mr Slipper), that there are only 300 children adopted each year. I would have thought that there were more than that. People in my electorate have contacted me about overseas adoptions and the difficulties that they have encountered from time to time. It is interesting that we should be referring to the Peoples Republic of China, because we do know that, under that country's one child policy, there have been some very sad circumstances involving particularly female children. We have seen and read about the appalling conditions in some of the Chinese orphanages, which really do call for the facilitation of a measure such as this. It is very sad to see children suffering anywhere in the world, particularly when there are so many parents who are anxious and keen to provide loving homes for children.
Some people in my electorate came to see me recently about this particular matter. There are many people looking for the mechanisms and the means to adopt children from overseas to complete their family picture. This particular couple came to see me some months ago. They had been in a relationship since 1991. They were a happy couple but were unable to have a child. After a period of about five years they still remained childless so they went to make inquiries. They did the right thing—they went to their doctor, they looked at the IVF/GIFT program. They then looked at overseas adoption. They went to a seminar about that and made some contact with the state department of family services. They had been in a strong de facto relationship for seven years and were married in November 1997. When they inquired about overseas adoption they were advised that they would have to be legally married for two years before an application could be submitted. This was a devastating blow for them, and it is a real anomaly.
I took it up with the relevant minister at that time, Mrs Naomi Wilson, who was an extremely helpful minister in the Borbidge government. She wrote to me very promptly and explained the situation. She said that the particular act in Queensland, the Adoption of 
 Children Act, was being reviewed. I hope that, under the new Beattie government, that act will be reviewed with a view to changing that situation because it is a real anomaly. People who have been together in a very solid relationship for seven years having to wait this additional time because they were not legally married is, in this day and age, an anomaly that needs to be corrected.
In their case, unfortunately, there was no discretion available. However, they urged me to help and I will be urging the new minister—whoever that is, and I think it will probably be Mrs Anna Bligh—to look at that act as a matter of urgency to try and help people in their situation. As I say, the adoption of children from overseas is a priority for many couples who want to complete that natural desire to have a family, to have children to care for, and there are many children overseas who are in desperate need of care.
With those few remarks, let me say I support this measure. Any measure to help facilitate this means of adopting children will, no doubt, benefit the community as a whole and the world as a whole. This is a good thing and we should encourage it.",REPS,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Marek, Paul, MP",NP,1998-06-30,"—I must say that, having listened to some of the other speakers, it is good to see that such bipartisan support has been put behind the Family Law Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998 . This bill is a great initiative and this is evidence that this coalition government is not only awake but also aware. The Labor government in past years had a history of incorrectly administering legislation, and it is a breath of fresh air to see that this parliament is working in the best interests of all Australians.
The legislation makes two particular changes to the Family Law Act. As we have heard in the past, it actually amends the Family Law Act to enable regulations to be made giving automatic recognition to adoption decisions made under the law of prescribed overseas jurisdictions. At this time, the only jurisdiction which will be prescribed is the People's Republic of China. However, in future, if state and territory governments agree, it will 
 be possible for further regulations to be made prescribing other jurisdictions. That information comes from the second reading speech by the Attorney-General (Mr Williams) and, like I say, it is a great initiative.
This legislation will actually facilitate Australia's international arrangements on intercountry adoption. This is an event that provides a future for many Australians in relation to having a family when many often cannot have, or do not have the ability to have, children. So, as far as I am concerned, I think it is a wonderful initiative.
A lot of couples would like to have children but, through no fault of their own or whatever, there is a problem. As the previous speaker, the member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith), was saying, it is imperative that people, if they want to, be able to complete their relationship to the point of having children to look after. I think that is wonderful. Some time down the track, my good wife and I would like to have children and, if we were not able to, I would like to think that we would be able to go through that process as well. It is not just an initiative for a small group of Australians; you do not know whom it will affect. That is why I say it is good legislation looking after good people, looking after good Australians.
Further to that, the question should be looked at in relation to political parties. The legislation poses an interesting question. In fact, I would be interested to hear how One Nation would actually feel about the intercountry adoption process, obviously because of the make-up of the children drawn from other countries. It is an interesting debate. I think all political parties should be involved in this debate. It basically goes across all sections of our community and therefore I think it is important. It is great to see that the Independents have entered into the debate, as well as the Labor Party and the National-Liberal coalition. But we have not heard from some of the other Independents and it would be interesting to hear what they have to say or how they feel about the intercountry adoption process. It is a great initiative. 
Let us be very clear about this: there are people who want to adopt and there is a shortage of children who are available for adoption. People should be able to draw on children from overseas countries—children who are significantly disadvantaged or oppressed or who, more often than not in some cases, might not be able to survive if it were not for the ability of people to be able to adopt those children.
This is a great initiative. I actually know there are a couple of families in Capricornia who have already drawn on the intercountry adoption process. I know that they are very proud Australians. We are a multicultural society and it is good to see that we interact so well in the community and that we have this ability to be able to work with other nations to ensure that this country develops to be one of the greatest nations in the world.",REPS,<title>FAMILY LAW AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,18,1
"Williams, Daryl, MP",LP,1998-06-30,"—in reply—In drawing this debate to a conclusion, I thank the honourable members for Banks (Mr Melham), Fisher (Mr Slipper), Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) and Capricornia (Mr Marek) for their contributions and their support of the Family Law Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1998 . Members may have been concerned about an article in today's press concerning the illegal traffic in domestic adoptions some years ago. This obviously brought anguish to the young women who gave up their babies in a time of different social attitudes.
The legislation before us deals with intercountry adoption. It is proposed, under the legislation, to establish best practice in respect of such adoption, and the types of difficulties referred to in the article in today's media would not occur once the convention has been adhered to by Australia. Australia should be in a position to ratify the Hague convention as soon as the report of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties becomes available.
The states and territories have agreed with the Commonwealth on the implementation arrangements for Australia's participation in the convention and are hopeful that the treaty can commence operation by 1 November this year. The states and territories will also be 
 grateful for the amendments which provide for the automatic recognition of adoptions ordered in China, pursuant to the bilateral arrangement between the Australian states and territories and China. As soon as this legislation is in place, the bilateral arrangement with China can be completed and another avenue for adoption for Australian parents will become available. Both these developments provide the opportunity for significant numbers of Australian citizens to give children living in institutions overseas in participating countries a family environment in which to grow and prosper.
The government is indebted to the opposition for the offer of facilitating a speedy passage through the Senate. On that basis it should be possible, all other things being equal, for the bill to be dealt with as a non-contentious bill later this week in the Senate.
The member for Dickson (Mr Tony Smith) and the member for Capricornia (Mr Marek) referred to the desire of many Australian couples to adopt children. It is worth pointing out, as I did in my second reading speech, that there are currently approximately 300 adoptions each year from overseas. The number is limited because there are few bilateral arrangements in place. Ratification of the Hague Convention on intercountry adoption will open up opportunities for increased numbers of children to be adopted by Australian parents. Currently, 22 countries have adhered to the convention, and some of these are potentially large sources for intercountry adoption. The number of participating countries is expected to grow appreciably in the next few years, providing, we hope, even more opportunities for Australian couples to adopt children from overseas. This bill has the support of the whole House, so far as views have been made known, and I commend the bill to the House.
Question resolved in the affirmative.

"Hawker, David, MP",LP,1998-06-30,"—In concluding my remarks of yesterday, I would like to reiterate the importance of the competition policy and the work that the National Competition Council is doing. I would also like to remind honourable members that the work of this council came from the COAG meeting in 1995 when the Commonwealth, state and territory governments all agreed to the introduction of competition policy and its implementation. The current report builds on some of the work that the committee has already done, both with the major report, Cultivating competition , which was tabled last year, and the work it does with the ACCC.
We have made a number of recommendations to the government, most of which have been taken up. The one we made in this current report, Review of the National Competition Council annual report 1996-97, was the importance of ensuring that the public is properly educated on the value of competition, how it is being implemented, where it is not being implemented and why it is not being implemented.
I again thank all members of the committee for their support. It was a unanimous report and I think that the committee does work very well in a bipartisan way, and it does demonstrate how a standing committee of the parliament can achieve a lot of very good work which I believe does enhance the reputation of the parliament. I also thank the secretariat for their support, particularly Bev Forbes, Chris Paterson and all the others who support the Financial Institutions and Public Administration Committee. They certainly do put in a lot of hard work and, with their support, we are able to produce some excellent reports.
This is my third time I have spoken on this report. I conclude with those few remarks and emphasise that the committee has made a 
 recommendation and that we look forward to a positive response from the government.",REPS,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Financial Institutions and Public Administration Committee</title>,Committees,19,1
"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,1998-06-30,"—I certainly welcome this report, Review of the National Competition Council annual report 1996-97 , and the work of the Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration in reviewing the process of national competition policy in Australia. I should start by outlining my surprise that we have not got a conga line of National Party members lining up, based on their recent rhetoric, to outline the so-called evils of competition policy. Perhaps those National Party members are out making their latest name change. There is a nice sequence in this: Country Party, National Country Party, National Party, and now the simple name change to One Nation—if not by their choice, then perhaps by the people.
They have been part of a process—somewhat common in the populism and demonisation now sweeping across Australian politics—to try to make competition a dirty word. I would pose the question: how else do you run a market based economy other than with competition? How do you make markets work without the discipline and the upgrading capacity of simple competition between corporations and, if need be, between government entities? This is a simple proposition: dogs bark, markets compete. There is no way of running a market based economy without the disciplines of competition.
If that is not evident enough to those in this parliament, they should simply look elsewhere. Would anyone go to North Korea, with its policy of isolationism, and pretend that that is better for economic growth and potential than market based competition? The Hanson approach, of course, is a mirror reflection of North Korea, where there are people starving in the streets because they cannot generate the economic growth to feed their people. Would one go to Eastern Europe and ask any economist or public policy official, or indeed any citizen, whether central planning was a better way of running an economy than market based competition? All of these things have been tried and they have failed. 
One of the emerging truths for people on the social democratic side of politics is to give up on trying to replace market based competition with some other form of production, distribution and exchange. The social democratic task now is to civilise global capital to ameliorate the impact of globalisation on society, its cohesiveness and its basic community values. This is a project that social democrats can embrace. But to try to replace market based systems with some other form of production is effectively a distraction from the central goal of social democrats in a globalised economy.
Markets have proven themselves to be an effective engine of growth, but	we cannot pretend, of course, that markets always get it right. As a rule of thumb, I work on the assumption that markets get it right in the allocation of economic resources 60 to 70 per cent of the time. In some of the fundamentals of life in Australia, market based competition is the clearing house for consumer choice and lifestyle. We do not try to centrally plan supermarkets or food distribution in Australia, or the distribution of clothing. No-one would ever pretend that you need to replace market based competition on those fundamentals of life with some other form of production or distribution. But in those cases where markets get it wrong, where there are externalities, environmental and social, where markets have an undesirable impact on society and income distribution, an undesirable impact on culture and community, there is an active role for government to play. So on 30 to 40 per cent of occasions markets may fail and may require active government intervention to make corrections, to give society cohesiveness, to give strength to community values and to achieve a fairer distribution of income and social capacity.
What should governments do in those interventions? The worst thing a government can do is to smother competition and create a dependency relationship with the private sector. In framing interventions, especially in a globalised economy, the worst thing government can do is to try and smother competition and create some form of dependency relationship with the corporate sector. We hear the 
 other side of politics talking about these things with regard to social welfare. It is true that in a post-industrial society transfer payments without new skills and responsibilities ultimately hurt the recipients of social welfare. That is a truth that I think all sides of politics are now facing up to. Transfer payments without new skills and responsibilities ultimately create long-term welfare dependency, and that is undesirable.
So, too, that principle applies when it comes to the corporate sector. Handouts to the corporate sector without the disciplines of market competition also ultimately hurt the recipients. I had a reminder of this when I was on a study tour in New Zealand, where a New Zealand metal manufacturer in Christchurch said to me, `Look, under the old regime, the policies of Muldoon and the like in New Zealand, there were protection, subsidies and regulation, and it was a licence to print money. Every time my company got into trouble, the government would bail me out. So I just relied on the government handouts, the government protection and the government subsidies to underscore my profit line and I did no innovation and no upgrading. I did not try to change my work practices and did not try to engage in outward strategies to expand my markets. I had a licence to print money from government.' That is a telltale sign of how you can smother the market mechanism with too much government intervention and protection. You do need certain disciplines in competition policy to make markets work.
This manufacturer expressed to me his initial opposition to the changes in New Zealand policy in the 1980s, but they forced upon him and his business innovation, upgrading and change in work practices—all the things that make markets work. When I visited in 1995, that business was engaging in innovation, R&D on the factory floor, to produce a plastic engine for motorbikes. This is a long way from guaranteed government income and profit support: ambitious plans to try and build an innovative base for exports and manufacturing potential. Just as it can be argued that social welfare recipients propped up by long-term welfare dependency are 
 suffering for that government policy, so too it can be argued that that applies just as much to the relationship between the public sector and the corporate sector.
I would argue that, when it comes to social and business wellbeing, you need a soft heart but also a hard head. The hard head says that competition policy is a useful discipline in a market based economy. For the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) and his fellow travellers around the backblocks of Queensland who say that is not the case, let them point to a place where some other system has worked better. They can never do it. Schumpeter, the economist, 100 years ago described this as creative destruction, and that is true.
—A hundred years ago?
—Well, he was born a hundred years ago.
—He wrote in the forties.
—He might have been writing in the 1940s, but he was born a hundred years ago. He was an Austrian from that era. I think he was born around the same year that Marx died, in 1883. He was at school, hopefully prospering from better school policies in Austria in the 1880s than you are giving to Australia in the 1990s.
Schumpeter described this process as creative destruction—markets can create a lot of wealth and economic opportunity but so too they can be disruptive of some of the fundamentals of a cohesive society. They can destroy some businesses and destroy some of the opportunities for a fairer distribution of income and social opportunity. This is where the active role for government comes into play. Earlier tonight I was at the Canberra branch of the Economics Society listening to Fred Argy give a precis of his new book. He provided what I thought was an outstanding way to consider the economic debate and the way this parliament should look at it now. That is basically to say that we are all economic liberals now. That was the message: we are all economic liberals now; it is just a matter of what sort of economic liberalism and market freedom we bring to bear.
What Fred Argy said, I think quite perceptively, was that progressive economic liberals 
 would believe in four things. The first was that markets, all other things being equal, are an effective way of allocating economic resources. Second, all other things being equal, competition policy is good. Third, markets fail and governments need to intervene in those circumstances. The fourth proposition is that markets produce poor distributional outcomes in society, again justifying government interventions.
On the third and fourth points, with regard to market failure and distributional questions, the big challenge for social democrats is to work out what sort of interventions and distributional strategies are needed, as the movement of capital has gone from the national sphere to global arenas. There are new market circumstances and new policy requirements for social democrats wanting to do the government intervention well and wanting to bring fairer distributional outcomes to society.
I sign up as a progressive economic liberal and I cannot see how anyone would believe in any other approach to economic matters or a report like this. Of course, there are some, led by the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) over here, who would be described within the Argy schema as a hard economic liberal. They do not believe that markets fail all that much and, even if they do, governments will not do much about it. Their final proposition is that the less government does the better off we will be.
That approach, I believe, is ultimately destructive to our social fabric, ultimately unfair on the distribution of income and opportunity, and a recipe for individualism and social fragmentation. In any case, it is not proven that any of that hard economic liberalism that we might find from Dr Kemp is going to produce any better economic outcome than the more progressive approach. I think it is very important to understand these things. For those who use competition policy as some form of demon, some form of populist rhetoric—talking about the money power and the Depression in the 1930s—it is incumbent upon them to explain how, without the disciplines of competition in a market based 
 economy, we can get any better result for this country.
I have not heard any explanation among the utterings and murmurs of Bob Katter—I think he speaks on these things only if a television camera is in front of him—on the far right or the rantings of someone like Phil Cleary on the far left, or from the Hansonites or the Democrats, who have a unity ticket on economic policy, of what they would replace the current system with. They have no explanation because history and logic tell them that there is no superior system to the competition disciplines of the market based economy providing also for an active role for government.
The active role for government is important, and I think it is changing. I have argued that in a dynamic, globally focused economy there can be consistency with a fair society. Important things need to be done on the distributional front, such as having a decent and indexed minimum wage, particularly in industries where there is very little opportunity for substitution between labour and capital. I have argued the importance of civil sector employment as a way of filling the gaps left on a spatial or a regional scale by the failings of the profit system. I have argued the importance of regional infrastructure and services.
And the most important point in this debate—and why I think Australia has gone backwards—is that we can prepare people for change only by giving them new skills and new ways of acting and responding to the change process. This is the problem with the debate. I was listening to Bill Clinton on CNN, talking at the Beijing University. To think that you could describe him as a politician on the one hand and our Prime Minister (Mr Howard) as a politician is absolutely ridiculous—they are as different as chalk and cheese. The Prime Minister has driven Australia into a state of funk; no talk and no leadership about how people can prepare for change, just always the constant attempt to patch things up and try to hold over the political agenda until the next poll comes in and gives him a bit of respite. It is the work of a small person locked in the past.
Clinton is always talking about preparing people for change, skilling them, giving them new opportunities and education, and making them understand that the only way we can respond in an era of uncertainty is to prepare people for change. In an era of permanent change, prepare for it, is the message that this government needs to give to the people of Australia. If it does not give that sort of message, we will stay in this state of funk, pessimism and depression; and every two-bit populist in town who wants to raise an issue and try to scare people will get a platform to do it because there is no leadership explaining the alternative. That is what has changed in Australia over the last two years. That is the thing that has fundamentally changed on the Australian political agenda. As reflected in government policy, this is not an administration that is prepared to invest in Australia's future by growing the national commitment to education, research and training.
I want to conclude with a final point about political communication. I do not endorse what Bob Hogg is doing with that ridiculous campaign supporting the GST. He was talking about communication. There are some fools in the press gallery who get onto these things. Tim Colebatch in the Age today described the GST as the best option in tax reform. He was having a go at me not so long ago, saying that a progressive expenditure tax would fold because it could not be made progressive. His answer on progressive tax was a GST so I do not endorse Colebatch, who is an imbecile, and I certainly do not endorse what Bob Hogg is doing with his strategy in tandem with Singleton. But I think Bob Hogg is right in terms of the political debate and the national understanding of issues like competition policy. He said:
I am sick of the fact that you can't have a dialogue in this country. Part of the reason for what is happening at the moment with the 20-odd per cent of dissent for One Nation showing up is that nobody's explaining. Forget this business of not talking and listening; that is just so much nonsense. People expect government to do things but they like to know why, what is the purpose and what is the long and short-term benefit of what they are doing. When you have a vacuum every bit of discontent, evil or otherwise, will congeal. It is the lack of debate on the public policy that is the real 
 problem. I mean, if we can't have a debate about reforms, in the end when it's all over people can say, yes I can support that or no I can't. It's how democracy works. We've been denying it for a while. Part of democracy is about educating by debate and explaining. What's wrong with them, it's not guns we're talking about, it's ideas, for God's sake.
If this government had any courage and any leadership, and propagated the right ideas and explanation to the Australian people about issues like competition policy, we would have the potential for strong, long-term economic growth, a dynamic market based economy with sufficient government interventions to do the things that also make our society fair.

"Latham, Mark, MP",ALP,1998-06-30,"—I certainly welcome this report, Review of the National Competition Council annual report 1996-97 , and the work of the Standing Committee on Financial Institutions and Public Administration in reviewing the process of national competition policy in Australia. I should start by outlining my surprise that we have not got a conga line of National Party members lining up, based on their recent rhetoric, to outline the so-called evils of competition policy. Perhaps those National Party members are out making their latest name change. There is a nice sequence in this: Country Party, National Country Party, National Party, and now the simple name change to One Nation—if not by their choice, then perhaps by the people.
They have been part of a process—somewhat common in the populism and demonisation now sweeping across Australian politics—to try to make competition a dirty word. I would pose the question: how else do you run a market based economy other than with competition? How do you make markets work without the discipline and the upgrading capacity of simple competition between corporations and, if need be, between government entities? This is a simple proposition: dogs bark, markets compete. There is no way of running a market based economy without the disciplines of competition.
If that is not evident enough to those in this parliament, they should simply look elsewhere. Would anyone go to North Korea, with its policy of isolationism, and pretend that that is better for economic growth and potential than market based competition? The Hanson approach, of course, is a mirror reflection of North Korea, where there are people starving in the streets because they cannot generate the economic growth to feed their people. Would one go to Eastern Europe and ask any economist or public policy official, or indeed any citizen, whether central planning was a better way of running an economy than market based competition? All of these things have been tried and they have failed. 
One of the emerging truths for people on the social democratic side of politics is to give up on trying to replace market based competition with some other form of production, distribution and exchange. The social democratic task now is to civilise global capital to ameliorate the impact of globalisation on society, its cohesiveness and its basic community values. This is a project that social democrats can embrace. But to try to replace market based systems with some other form of production is effectively a distraction from the central goal of social democrats in a globalised economy.
Markets have proven themselves to be an effective engine of growth, but	we cannot pretend, of course, that markets always get it right. As a rule of thumb, I work on the assumption that markets get it right in the allocation of economic resources 60 to 70 per cent of the time. In some of the fundamentals of life in Australia, market based competition is the clearing house for consumer choice and lifestyle. We do not try to centrally plan supermarkets or food distribution in Australia, or the distribution of clothing. No-one would ever pretend that you need to replace market based competition on those fundamentals of life with some other form of production or distribution. But in those cases where markets get it wrong, where there are externalities, environmental and social, where markets have an undesirable impact on society and income distribution, an undesirable impact on culture and community, there is an active role for government to play. So on 30 to 40 per cent of occasions markets may fail and may require active government intervention to make corrections, to give society cohesiveness, to give strength to community values and to achieve a fairer distribution of income and social capacity.
What should governments do in those interventions? The worst thing a government can do is to smother competition and create a dependency relationship with the private sector. In framing interventions, especially in a globalised economy, the worst thing government can do is to try and smother competition and create some form of dependency relationship with the corporate sector. We hear the 
 other side of politics talking about these things with regard to social welfare. It is true that in a post-industrial society transfer payments without new skills and responsibilities ultimately hurt the recipients of social welfare. That is a truth that I think all sides of politics are now facing up to. Transfer payments without new skills and responsibilities ultimately create long-term welfare dependency, and that is undesirable.
So, too, that principle applies when it comes to the corporate sector. Handouts to the corporate sector without the disciplines of market competition also ultimately hurt the recipients. I had a reminder of this when I was on a study tour in New Zealand, where a New Zealand metal manufacturer in Christchurch said to me, `Look, under the old regime, the policies of Muldoon and the like in New Zealand, there were protection, subsidies and regulation, and it was a licence to print money. Every time my company got into trouble, the government would bail me out. So I just relied on the government handouts, the government protection and the government subsidies to underscore my profit line and I did no innovation and no upgrading. I did not try to change my work practices and did not try to engage in outward strategies to expand my markets. I had a licence to print money from government.' That is a telltale sign of how you can smother the market mechanism with too much government intervention and protection. You do need certain disciplines in competition policy to make markets work.
This manufacturer expressed to me his initial opposition to the changes in New Zealand policy in the 1980s, but they forced upon him and his business innovation, upgrading and change in work practices—all the things that make markets work. When I visited in 1995, that business was engaging in innovation, R&D on the factory floor, to produce a plastic engine for motorbikes. This is a long way from guaranteed government income and profit support: ambitious plans to try and build an innovative base for exports and manufacturing potential. Just as it can be argued that social welfare recipients propped up by long-term welfare dependency are 
 suffering for that government policy, so too it can be argued that that applies just as much to the relationship between the public sector and the corporate sector.
I would argue that, when it comes to social and business wellbeing, you need a soft heart but also a hard head. The hard head says that competition policy is a useful discipline in a market based economy. For the member for Kennedy (Mr Katter) and his fellow travellers around the backblocks of Queensland who say that is not the case, let them point to a place where some other system has worked better. They can never do it. Schumpeter, the economist, 100 years ago described this as creative destruction, and that is true.
—A hundred years ago?
—Well, he was born a hundred years ago.
—He wrote in the forties.
—He might have been writing in the 1940s, but he was born a hundred years ago. He was an Austrian from that era. I think he was born around the same year that Marx died, in 1883. He was at school, hopefully prospering from better school policies in Austria in the 1880s than you are giving to Australia in the 1990s.
Schumpeter described this process as creative destruction—markets can create a lot of wealth and economic opportunity but so too they can be disruptive of some of the fundamentals of a cohesive society. They can destroy some businesses and destroy some of the opportunities for a fairer distribution of income and social opportunity. This is where the active role for government comes into play. Earlier tonight I was at the Canberra branch of the Economics Society listening to Fred Argy give a precis of his new book. He provided what I thought was an outstanding way to consider the economic debate and the way this parliament should look at it now. That is basically to say that we are all economic liberals now. That was the message: we are all economic liberals now; it is just a matter of what sort of economic liberalism and market freedom we bring to bear.
What Fred Argy said, I think quite perceptively, was that progressive economic liberals 
 would believe in four things. The first was that markets, all other things being equal, are an effective way of allocating economic resources. Second, all other things being equal, competition policy is good. Third, markets fail and governments need to intervene in those circumstances. The fourth proposition is that markets produce poor distributional outcomes in society, again justifying government interventions.
On the third and fourth points, with regard to market failure and distributional questions, the big challenge for social democrats is to work out what sort of interventions and distributional strategies are needed, as the movement of capital has gone from the national sphere to global arenas. There are new market circumstances and new policy requirements for social democrats wanting to do the government intervention well and wanting to bring fairer distributional outcomes to society.
I sign up as a progressive economic liberal and I cannot see how anyone would believe in any other approach to economic matters or a report like this. Of course, there are some, led by the member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) over here, who would be described within the Argy schema as a hard economic liberal. They do not believe that markets fail all that much and, even if they do, governments will not do much about it. Their final proposition is that the less government does the better off we will be.
That approach, I believe, is ultimately destructive to our social fabric, ultimately unfair on the distribution of income and opportunity, and a recipe for individualism and social fragmentation. In any case, it is not proven that any of that hard economic liberalism that we might find from Dr Kemp is going to produce any better economic outcome than the more progressive approach. I think it is very important to understand these things. For those who use competition policy as some form of demon, some form of populist rhetoric—talking about the money power and the Depression in the 1930s—it is incumbent upon them to explain how, without the disciplines of competition in a market based 
 economy, we can get any better result for this country.
I have not heard any explanation among the utterings and murmurs of Bob Katter—I think he speaks on these things only if a television camera is in front of him—on the far right or the rantings of someone like Phil Cleary on the far left, or from the Hansonites or the Democrats, who have a unity ticket on economic policy, of what they would replace the current system with. They have no explanation because history and logic tell them that there is no superior system to the competition disciplines of the market based economy providing also for an active role for government.
The active role for government is important, and I think it is changing. I have argued that in a dynamic, globally focused economy there can be consistency with a fair society. Important things need to be done on the distributional front, such as having a decent and indexed minimum wage, particularly in industries where there is very little opportunity for substitution between labour and capital. I have argued the importance of civil sector employment as a way of filling the gaps left on a spatial or a regional scale by the failings of the profit system. I have argued the importance of regional infrastructure and services.
And the most important point in this debate—and why I think Australia has gone backwards—is that we can prepare people for change only by giving them new skills and new ways of acting and responding to the change process. This is the problem with the debate. I was listening to Bill Clinton on CNN, talking at the Beijing University. To think that you could describe him as a politician on the one hand and our Prime Minister (Mr Howard) as a politician is absolutely ridiculous—they are as different as chalk and cheese. The Prime Minister has driven Australia into a state of funk; no talk and no leadership about how people can prepare for change, just always the constant attempt to patch things up and try to hold over the political agenda until the next poll comes in and gives him a bit of respite. It is the work of a small person locked in the past.
Clinton is always talking about preparing people for change, skilling them, giving them new opportunities and education, and making them understand that the only way we can respond in an era of uncertainty is to prepare people for change. In an era of permanent change, prepare for it, is the message that this government needs to give to the people of Australia. If it does not give that sort of message, we will stay in this state of funk, pessimism and depression; and every two-bit populist in town who wants to raise an issue and try to scare people will get a platform to do it because there is no leadership explaining the alternative. That is what has changed in Australia over the last two years. That is the thing that has fundamentally changed on the Australian political agenda. As reflected in government policy, this is not an administration that is prepared to invest in Australia's future by growing the national commitment to education, research and training.
I want to conclude with a final point about political communication. I do not endorse what Bob Hogg is doing with that ridiculous campaign supporting the GST. He was talking about communication. There are some fools in the press gallery who get onto these things. Tim Colebatch in the Age today described the GST as the best option in tax reform. He was having a go at me not so long ago, saying that a progressive expenditure tax would fold because it could not be made progressive. His answer on progressive tax was a GST so I do not endorse Colebatch, who is an imbecile, and I certainly do not endorse what Bob Hogg is doing with his strategy in tandem with Singleton. But I think Bob Hogg is right in terms of the political debate and the national understanding of issues like competition policy. He said:
I am sick of the fact that you can't have a dialogue in this country. Part of the reason for what is happening at the moment with the 20-odd per cent of dissent for One Nation showing up is that nobody's explaining. Forget this business of not talking and listening; that is just so much nonsense. People expect government to do things but they like to know why, what is the purpose and what is the long and short-term benefit of what they are doing. When you have a vacuum every bit of discontent, evil or otherwise, will congeal. It is the lack of debate on the public policy that is the real 
 problem. I mean, if we can't have a debate about reforms, in the end when it's all over people can say, yes I can support that or no I can't. It's how democracy works. We've been denying it for a while. Part of democracy is about educating by debate and explaining. What's wrong with them, it's not guns we're talking about, it's ideas, for God's sake.
If this government had any courage and any leadership, and propagated the right ideas and explanation to the Australian people about issues like competition policy, we would have the potential for strong, long-term economic growth, a dynamic market based economy with sufficient government interventions to do the things that also make our society fair.

"Price, Roger, MP",ALP,1998-06-30,"—I am very pleased to report that I was at the Filipino multipurpose centre at Rooty Hill in my electorate to celebrate 100 years of independence of the Republic of the Philippines. I was very pleased to be joined by John Aquilina, the New South Wales Minister for Education and Training and Minister Assisting the Premier on Youth Affairs; the Mayor of Blacktown; Councillor Charlie Lowes; my state parliamentary colleague Jim Anderson, the member for Saint Marys; the present member for Londonderry; and the member for Greenway, Frank Mossfield, and his wife. It was really great to join in those particular celebrations. I notice the Chairman of the Philippines-Australian Parliamentary Friendship Group is in the House and I am sure he would join me in expressing our best wishes to all Filipinos.
—Hear, hear!
—I draw the House's attention to a speech the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) gave at the Victorian Immigration Advice and Rights Centre on Wednesday, 10 June. In particular, on page 3 of that speech, he said:
When the Government came to office, the onshore application rate was increasing. The number of Protection Visa applications had increased from around 500 per annum in the 1980s to around 11,000 per annum. Many of these applications are from nationals of countries where there is little or no persecution—
And he cited the Philippines as one of the culprits. If Filipinos in my electorate are guilty, I believe that they are really victims more than guilty parties. The people that I really believe the minister should have targeted are what I describe as unscrupulous migration agents, who either get these people to sign blank forms and submit them, knowing that they have no chance of success, or solicitors who act as business migration agents and even unofficial migration agents. They know full well when they ask for not hundreds of dollars but several thousands of dollars to be handed over that these applica 
 tions have no chance of success. The point I want to make is: what is the minister doing about this most unscrupulous practice? Indeed, I am really concerned that he is about to abolish what limited supervision we have by way of a board and replace it with self-regulation.
I stress that the Filipinos are so desperate to settle in this country that if it is suggested to them that they pay over several thousand dollars and that this will lead them to being able to stay, they are more than happy to do it. I believe that they are being fleeced. This brings no credit on anyone. I call on the minister for immigration to give us the figures on these applications and how many of them are being submitted by migration agents as opposed to individuals.
When people come to my office, like every other member, I do not charge them one dollar. I would like to think that all members would do as I or my staff do in relation to these matters, which is to be brutally frank and honest with people about the stringent requirements for protected visa status. I am always very reluctant to submit applications that I believe have little chance of success. But we always tell them. The thing that really sticks in my craw is that once these agents have the money, they refer them to federal members of this House in order to pursue it once the inevitable rejection has come through. It is time that Philip cleaned up the agents rather than getting stuck into Filipinos.",REPS,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Philippines: 100th Anniversary of Independence</title>,Adjournment,20,1
