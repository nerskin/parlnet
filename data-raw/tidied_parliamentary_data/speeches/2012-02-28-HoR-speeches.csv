Mr ABBOTT
 (Warringah—Leader of the Opposition) (14:01):  My question is to the Prime Minister. I remind the Prime Minister of her admission yesterday that she had made mistakes over the past 18 months. Was one of those mistakes telling the Australian people, five days before the election, 'There will be no carbon tax under the government I lead'? Will she now apologise for this deception and rescind the operation of the carbon tax until after the next election?



The SPEAKER:  Order! The Leader of the Opposition will retract the word 'deceive' because that is unparliamentary.




Mr ABBOTT:
  The word was 'deception'.



The SPEAKER:  That is a derivative of the same word. It suggests a mental element of intentionally saying the wrong thing. It is disorderly. The leader will withdraw.




Mr ABBOTT:
  I will withdraw and I will ask her to explain.



An opposition member:  You should repeat the question!



The SPEAKER:  If I identified the member who did that interjection, he would be No. 1 for today. The honourable Prime Minister has the call.

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:03):  To the Leader of the Opposition's question: last year this parliament put a price on carbon. It did that because we want our nation to seize a clean energy future. The Leader of the Opposition himself has been in favour of putting a price on carbon. He went to the 2007 election on a platform of introducing an emissions trading scheme. On this side of the parliament, we have always said that the best way of tackling climate change—the cheapest, the most effective way—was to put a price on carbon—



Mrs Bronwyn Bishop interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The honourable member for Mackellar will restrain herself.




Ms GILLARD:
  and we have achieved that.




Mr Abbott:
  Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order on direct relevance. It was a simple question: was this statement one of the mistakes that the Prime Minister now regrets? She should directly answer that question.



The SPEAKER:  The Prime Minister will be directly relevant to the question.




Ms GILLARD:
  Putting a price on carbon was the right thing to do, and I stand by it. It was the right thing to do to seize a clean energy future. The Leader of the Opposition is on the public record saying that. 



Ms Julie Bishop interjecting—




Ms GILLARD:
  The deputy leader, who interjects, is on the public record saying that. The member for Sturt is on the public record saying that. They all went to the 2007 election pledging to vote for that in this parliament. When it comes to talking about deception on this question, they might like to explain to the Australian people why they were in favour—




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order.



The SPEAKER:  There is no point of order at this point because all the Prime Minister has said is that, when it comes to the point of deception, they might like to explain to the Australian people. If the Prime Minister were to accuse the opposition of deception, she would be compelled to withdraw. That could well be coming. It has not yet come. The Prime Minister has the call.




Ms GILLARD:
  Mr Speaker, I am more than happy to rephrase. It falls to the opposition to explain how the most senior figures of this opposition went to the 2007 election campaign saying that they believed in putting a price on carbon, that they would all vote for putting a price on carbon—




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Clearly, putting together the allegation of what happened in 2007 and the word 'deception' goes to intent, and she should withdraw.



The SPEAKER:  Has the honourable member finished?




Mrs Bronwyn Bishop:
  Yes. There has to be one rule about this word.



The SPEAKER:  The Prime Minister has been asked about a statement made prior to the election and has been asked if she would apologise for that statement. The Prime Minister has the call to answer the question.




Ms GILLARD:
  The senior figures of the opposition should explain why they went to the 2007 election, hands on their hearts, saying, 'I will walk into the parliament and I will vote for a price on carbon.'



The SPEAKER:  The Prime Minister will become directly relevant and will answer the question.




Ms GILLARD:
  I am asked whether or not carbon pricing is a mistake for this country, and I am pointing out that carbon pricing in this nation has had strong bipartisan support, and that is why it is not a mistake for the nation. It has been supported fulsomely by the Leader of the Opposition. He sought election in 2007 on the basis that he would vote for carbon pricing—



The SPEAKER:  The Prime Minister will return to being directly relevant.




Ms GILLARD:
  and he probably said that in 2007 because he believed then, as did Prime Minister Howard—



The SPEAKER:  The Prime Minister will resume her seat. Next question?




Ms GILLARD:
  that it was the right thing for the nation.



The SPEAKER:  The Prime Minister no longer has the call. Next question? The honourable member for North Sydney on a supp—




Mr Hockey:
  On a question. You asked for questions: 'Next question?' I am standing, asking for the call, sir. No-one else was standing—



The SPEAKER:  No, I was of the view that the honourable member for North Sydney was approaching the dispatch box seeking to ask a supplementary, and naturally I would have accorded him precedence had that been the case. The honourable member for Greenway.




Ms Smyth:
  For La Trobe.



The SPEAKER:  La Trobe, sorry. Congratulations are in order for the honourable member for Greenway and her husband, Michael, on producing a young Australian. The honourable member for La Trobe has the call.

"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2012-02-28,"



Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (14:11):  My question is to the Minister for Resources and Energy. I remind the minister of his statement yesterday that the Treasurer 'should take a good, hard look at himself'. Was he referring to the Treasurer's handling of the mining tax, which has had three different versions and five different costings, or is he referring—to use the minister's own words—to the 'character assassination' of the member for Griffith?




Mr Albanese:
  Mr Speaker, I raise a point of order.



Opposition members interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  The House will remain—or become—silent so that I can listen to the Leader of the House on his point of order.




Mr Albanese:
  I submit to you, Mr Speaker, that the second half of that question is clearly out of order as it does not go to the minister's responsibilities.




Mr Pyne:
  Mr Speaker, on the point of order: it is a longstanding precedent in this place that ministers can have their words put to them and simply be asked whether they stand by them. The Minister for Resources and Energy has made those statements and he has a responsibility to either stand by them or repudiate them in this place.



The SPEAKER:  My principal dilemma is whether I rule the whole question out of order on the basis that half of it pollutes the whole or whether in fact I direct the minister to answer the first part of the question. I invite the minister to answer the first part of the question, and he will disregard the second part.

"Ferguson, Martin, MP",ALP,2012-02-28,"



Mr MARTIN FERGUSON
 (Batman—Minister for Resources and Energy and Minister for Tourism) (14:13):  I thank the honourable member for the question, which really raised the importance of the mining tax. Our endeavour to put in place a profits based system in Australia is exceptionally important to the future of Australia. It is about time the coalition understood that we are very fortunate as a nation. There is a huge pipeline of investment in Australia to the tune of $455 billion in either planned or committed capital investment.


It is also time they understood that our economy is going through a major transition at the moment. Whilst a significant part of our economy is getting major benefits in the process of this investment, there are other parts of our economy that are challenged by the impact of the dollar and, I might say, disappointing commodity prices, such as the aluminium industry. That is the case internationally at this point in time. I also say to the opposition that only Labor have the capacity to manage this transition, just as we, during the period of 1983 to 1996, were the only party capable of opening up Australia to the process of globalisation.




Mr Hockey:
  Mr Speaker, on a point of order, the question was about whether, when he said that the Treasurer should take a good, hard look at himself, he was referring to the bungling of the mining tax or the other issue.



The SPEAKER:  The second part of the honourable member's question was ruled out of order. The minister will assist the House if he is as precise in his answer as he can manage. I call the honourable minister.




Mr MARTIN FERGUSON:
  When it goes to a question of having a good, hard look at yourself, it is time the coalition had a good, hard look at its scare campaign in terms of the transition that is going on in the Australian economy at the moment. I am talking about its endeavours to use workers and their families—



The SPEAKER:  The minister will be directly relevant.




Mr MARTIN FERGUSON:
  with respect to the transition that is occurring with Qantas, Alcoa and BHP. 


Mr Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to address this matter. The government is hard at work in trying to assist the Australian economy to manage a major investment pipeline whilst looking after those sections of the economy that are challenged by the transition. I say to those opposite: front up to policy and real policy debates rather than having your heads in the sand.

"Windsor, Tony, MP",Ind.,2012-02-28,"



Mr WINDSOR
 (New England) (14:24):  My question is to the Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities and relates to water buyback policy. Given recent questions raised about the government's initiative to seek expressions of interest for water in the southern connected system of the Murray-Darling Basin, as it applies to irrigation districts and strategic water purchases, can the minister comment on those concerns and, given those concerns, will the minister also consider attending a meeting of the Standing Committee on Regional Australia in company with the Murray-Darling Basin Authority Chair, Craig Knowles, to discuss progress on the Murray-Darling Basin Plan?

",HoR,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Murray-Darling Basin</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE,4,1,question
"Burke, Tony, MP",ALP,2012-02-28,"



Mr BURKE
 (Watson—Minister for Sustainability, Environment, Water, Population and Communities) (14:25):  I thank the member for New England both for the question and for the work he led when the Windsor inquiry looked into Murray-Darling Basin reform. A key recommendation, supported at the media conferences that followed, held by members of parliament on each side of this House, was for the government to put a pause on all non-strategic buybacks. At that time we gave a guarantee that in the north of the system we would only be buying from river pumpers and in the south of the system the general tenders which had been taking place would not recommence until 2013. Those commitments stand.


There have been claims, in this parliament and outside the parliament, from three members of the inquiry that the recent expressions of interest that have been launched are in some way a breach of that commitment. I make it clear to everyone, including members of the Windsor inquiry, that the expressions of interest have been launched so that strategic buyback can take place. Rather than doing a basin-wide tender, rather than going through the other system, which members opposite had always opposed, where value for money was the only indicator, we now actually have a situation where we look to expressions of interest to see whether or not for the local community the purchase is strategic—and that is exactly what the inquiry unanimously called for. I am very happy to meet with members of the committee to talk about this; I am very happy to ask the Chair of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority to meet with members of the committee as well. 


This comes down to one really simple dividing line. When we got that unanimous report I actually thought that we had from the coalition members of the committee a willingness to engage in reform and that they would hold themselves to the words of that inquiry—their issue was whether or not the buybacks were strategic. What we have discovered today is that, regardless of the unanimity of the report, there are members opposite whose argument is not just whether it is strategic; they are just opposed to reform of the Murray-Darling Basin. The arguments that they have thrown up in the last few days are a slap in the face to every South Australian member opposite who thought they had a consensus position from the coalition; who thought they were actually on a constructive path forward.




The SPEAKER:
  The minister will return to the substance of the question.




Mr BURKE:
  That is why, Mr Speaker, what has been announced is exactly what the Windsor inquiry called for, is exactly in line with the commitment we made and is exactly what until this week had been a unanimous position from the coalition.

"Garrett, Peter, MP",ALP,2012-02-28,"



Mr GARRETT
 (Kingsford Smith—Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth) (14:28):  The educational achievements of this Labor government are considerable. We take education seriously, and our commitment to make every school a great school is a commitment that we are delivering on. We have doubled investment in education to over $65 billion, including significant investment in national partnerships, where we work with the states to make sure that kids right around the country get the investment they need in their schools. I thank the member for Reid for his question because he has some 10 schools in his electorate benefiting from funding under the National Partnership on Low Socio-economic Status School Communities—which, incidentally, the opposition has said it will cut, so I know the honourable member realises how important this is.


We have put additional investment into teacher quality because the research tells us that this is the most important thing in improving student results. We have invested in national teacher standards to raise teacher quality. We got that done. We said that we would introduce a national curriculum and we got that done. We now have the first ever national curriculum being taught in Australian schools as we speak. We have delivered over 900,000 computers to every Australian secondary student in years 9 to 12 for this year's schooling.


We said that we would review funding for schooling, and we got that done as well. Last week, the Gonski review on education funding was released and it was well received and praised by almost every education stakeholder—with the notable exception of the member for Sturt. He went out on his own to recycle the hit list scaremongering routine, but no-one was listening.


I was asked about the government delivering better education opportunities for young people. Last Friday, the Prime Minister and I launched the third version of the My School website, providing additional transparency and information for schools and parents. What does it tell us about the investments that we have made and are making? There was one fantastic statistic that can be seen on My School that I want to let the House know about. In 2010, we had 17 literacy and numeracy national partnership schools with results that were substantially below similar schools on My School. In 2012 none of these schools are in this category. That is an absolutely fantastic achievement. The point about this is that this is good education policy in practice. This is delivering on the commitments that we have made to make sure that every kid in every school in Australia gets the best opportunity to get the best education that they can.



We hear bleats, squawks and scare campaigns from those opposite, along with the promise of $2.8 billion in cuts to education. But when it comes to education, those on this side of the House—Labor—deliver. (Time expired)

Ms GILLARD
 (Lalor—Prime Minister) (14:32):  In answer to the member's question, I did make a mistake: I made a mistake in assuming that the opposition would ever be motivated by the national interest. I made that mistake and I am happy to put my hand up to it. I thought that at some point the opposition that had said 'stop the boats' might be prepared to walk into this parliament and vote to give this government and governments in the future the same powers to deal with offshore processing that governments in the past have had. The mistake that I made was believing that somewhere deep down they believe in the national interest.



Opposition members interjecting—



The SPEAKER:  Honourable members on my left, including the member for Fadden, will listen in silence—as will members on my right.




Ms GILLARD:
  Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. I am being very directly relevant to the question that I was asked.



The SPEAKER:  I was not suggesting that the Prime Minister was not; I was just seeking silence so that the response could be heard.




Ms GILLARD:
  I have learned from that mistake. What I have learned is that there is never a time that the national interest worries the opposition. The only thing that ever worries them is their political interest and the depths to which they will go to pursue their political interests know no bounds. They are prepared to see more boats; they want to see more boats despite the risks to lives. Their pledge to the Australian people is to risk the lives of ADF personnel in pursuit of a policy that they know to be flawed. My mistake was ever believing that they were better than that.




Mr Pyne:
  Mr Speaker, I rise on a point of order. Given the number of very tragic deaths that have occurred in boats coming to Australia, the suggestion that the opposition welcomes more boats is deeply offensive to me personally and to the opposition and I would ask the Prime Minister to withdraw that offensive remark.

Mr BRENDAN O'CONNOR
 (Gorton—Minister for Human Services and Minister Assisting for School Education) (14:36):  I thank the member for Cunningham for her question. Before she was in this place, she was a school teacher. She understands the importance of education. This government fully understands the need to focus on education, employment and the economy. Indeed, this government, when confronted with the global financial crisis, invested a record amount of money into education. As the Minister for School Education, Early Childhood and Youth just said, we have doubled school education funding in only four years. We did so because we understand that it is absolutely critical to manage the economy to help working families. We understand that we need to ensure that those people in communities across the country who depend upon on us are able to be supported through those difficult times. We had to make a decision as to where we would invest that money. We rightly invested it in education. As a result, with that particular initiative alone, the $16.2 billion, we managed to support or create 120,000 jobs in this country, a remarkable effort when compared internationally with the way other governments confronted this issue.


We know those opposite neglected school funding in their time in government. There is nothing wrong with flagpoles but you have to go beyond flagpoles and invest in school education. By contrast, we built 4,500 new interactive classrooms, 3,100 libraries, 2,900 multipurpose centres and, one other area I was looking at recently, 280 language and science centres across this country as a result of that initiative. This has been a remarkable effort by the government. 


In the end it will always be Labor that focuses on the things that matter. It will always be Labor that puts jobs at the centre of public policy. In relation to this initiative, we focused on jobs to protect the workers in this country and we invested to protect the students who are the workers of the future. This initiative was absolutely critical. Look now at the results. As the Treasurer said today and has said before, we have an enviable unemployment rate of 5.1 per cent. Look around the world: we have an unemployment rate less than half that of Europe and a rate much better than other advanced economies as a result of actions of this government. It will always be the case that this Labor government will invest in education and support jobs.

In the electorate of Cunningham, the BER has provided 16 new libraries, 27 multipurpose halls and 27 classrooms. Indeed, we have invested $114 million in the electorate of Cunningham—not only in the electorate of Cunningham but in many electorates across this country represented by those on this side and by those opposite. The difference is those opposite chose to vote against that initiative, which was to support jobs and local communities. The Leader of the Opposition managed to literally sleep through that vote. In the end, he has no interest in jobs and he has no interest in education.

"Hockey, Joe, MP",LP,2012-02-28,"



Mr HOCKEY
 (North Sydney) (15:51):  Mr Speaker, this Prime Minister can only rebuild economic confidence in this government by dumping the Treasurer in the upcoming reshuffle. The last dumped Labor Treasurer, John Kerin, was widely regarded as a decent man but an incompetent Treasurer. In stark contrast, this Treasurer's incompetence is matched by his behaviour and his words. His continuation in this portfolio is a mistake and will continue to undermine business and consumer confidence at a crucial moment in time.


To be Treasurer, one must believe in economic values that grow the economy and deliver hope, reward and opportunity for everyday Australians. We need a Treasurer who displays confidence and clarity in the great public debates, we need a Treasurer who is across his brief and we need a Treasurer with a steely determination to advocate policies that may be unpopular but ultimately are right. We should have known that this Treasurer was not up to the job when in the immediate wake of the 2007 budget he cowered in his office rather than prosecute an economic argument against his predecessor. If he could not do it in opposition, it is no wonder his colleagues lament the straw man's performance in government. On coming to office in 2007 the Treasurer desperately searched for a critical narrative against his opponents.




Mr Clare:
  Madam Deputy Speaker, I rise on a point of order. The member for North Sydney should be relevant to the MPI. This is about confidence in the Australian economy and he has not mentioned it once.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  The Minister for Home Affairs will resume his seat. The member for North Sydney has the call.




Mr HOCKEY:
  The Treasurer could not argue the toss on fiscal policy in 2007, nor unemployment, nor corporate governance, nor prudential supervision. He could not argue the toss—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  But the member for North Sydney, like everybody else in the chamber, will be aware of standing order 90. Occasionally people should reflect upon that.




Mr HOCKEY:
  The Treasurer could not argue the toss on productivity, national savings or tax reform. The coalition's proud legacy had intimidated this Treasurer. He was a Labor Party state secretary desperately searching for a critical word or a weak indicator. After declaring 'Kevin Rudd and federal Labor understand the pressures on working families', the Treasurer thought he had found the river of gold when he declared war on inflation and added that 'the inflation genie is out of the bottle'. Not only did this declaration of war reveal his failure to grasp the impact of the already unfolding liquidity crisis in Europe and the United States but also the government began introducing policies that made inflation worse. New taxes on alcopops and motor vehicles increased everyday prices and added to inflation. The actions of the Treasurer left analysts and economists confused. Moreover, the public was left bewildered when the Treasurer was asked the inflation rate in a MYEFO press conference and for an agonising two minutes searched for the answer. After declaring war on inflation, he could not tell you what the enemy looked like. 


On top of this, the Treasurer was responsible for major policy backflips like Fuelwatch, GROCERYchoice and the on-again off-again on-again changes to employee share schemes. This further undermined public confidence in this Treasurer. Last week the Treasurer lambasted the member for Griffith's decision-making as 'dysfunctional' and yet it was the Treasurer who was hand in glove, side by side, with the member for Griffith as they rolled out the response to the global financial crisis. At first there was a collective denial that Australia would be hit. In fact, I was accused in this place in 2008 of talking down the Australian economy when I warned of the impending crisis. But then the penny dropped and the Treasurer began warning of impending devastation. The government went into crisis management but a key player, the Governor of the Reserve Bank, was not even in the room. The Treasurer and the member for Griffith were as one in the cabinet room with the Secretary of the Treasury. As partners they made a series of mistakes. For example, the government has had two different versions of government guarantees on retail deposits, which has added to confusion and panic amongst depositors in banks. It left investors in cash management trusts and investment vehicles bewildered and lost. Dysfunctional was the Treasurer's flawed Ruddbank, which could be used, according to the Treasurer, to fund projects like the $1 billion 79-storey Vision Tower in Brisbane. Thankfully for taxpayers the Vision Tower went into liquidation two months later without taxpayer contributions and Ruddbank went into the policy coffin. 


With the second stimulus, which the coalition warned was flawed, erratic and wasteful, as partners the Treasurer and the member for Griffith rolled out a pink batts scheme that led to four deaths and wasted $2.4 billion, a school hall program that blew out to cost $16.2 billion and involved the worst waste of money since the Whitlam government, and a program that sent $900 cheques to 16,000 dead people and 27,000 people living overseas to stimulate the Australian economy. Dysfunctional be thy name. The waste continues today, with set-top boxes estimated to cost $350 a home but with Senator Conroy now admitting that the boxes could cost up to $1,528 each in rural areas. Gerry Harvey says he can do it for $168. 


As if enough damage had not been done, we now have the emergence of the true narrative on tax reform. It was the Treasurer who commissioned the Henry tax review that cost $10 million. It was the Treasurer who adopted only a handful of the 138 recommendations. It was the Treasurer who ordered a further tax review, followed by a delayed tax summit, followed by a further tax review, followed by more indecision, false hopes, obfuscation and delays. When it comes to the mining tax, the member for Griffith and the Minister for Resources and Energy have dumped the dead cat on the table. The member for Griffith told the Weekend Australian just last Saturday:


We had reservations about embarking on something so complex but Wayne's view was that without it, his credentials as a reforming treasurer would be shot to pieces.


So the Treasurer was not motivated by a good policy or the budget deficit or the best terms of trade in 100 years—he wanted a mining tax to address his own lack of confidence in his own performance. Moreover, when the Treasurer released the tax he made a complete hash of the issue. As reported on the front page of the Financial Review today, the mining tax package has had to be rescued and restructured by the Minister for Resources and Energy on at least three separate occasions, with five versions of the revenues to be raised. No wonder the minister for resources said that the Treasurer 'should take a good, hard look at himself'. It is hard to believe he does not look in the mirror every day! Of course when the chips are down you may not want the Treasurer to be by your side in the battle. As the member for Griffith said just last Saturday on the mining tax:


And when the brawl became its most intense, Wayne didn't seem to be around at the end …


The Treasurer is no man of courage—and we need a man of courage to guide the Australian economy. For example, immediately before the coup the Treasurer proclaimed his loyalty to the member for Griffith on at least three occasions, describing the member for Griffith as 'a terrific Prime Minister' on ABC radio. At the same time we now realise the Treasurer was thinking differently. These days the Treasurer describes the Rudd years as dysfunctional and the man he worked closely with as 'paralysed with indecision' and someone who found it 'very difficult to provide respectful leadership in the cabinet'. 


However, the Treasurer was less than forthcoming with his colleague the member for Griffith. As the former prime minister said to Laurie Oakes just last Sunday:


I was doing my absolute best to run the country and to bring us through the global recession, totally focused on that. None of my colleagues in cabinet meetings or privately, including Mr Swan, who is now most vocal in his opposition, ever said that to me. I had very long and direct conversations with Mr Swan in the lead-up to the events of the coup on the 23rd and 24th of June that year. And at no time—at no time—did he reflect to me that there was any fundamental concern or any significant problem that would cause me or require me to change course, do something radically different, in order to retain the position of Prime Minister. In fact, the only time I found out that Mr Swan had changed his position on this was when I rang him after the coup had been launched, where he said to me simply, 'Oh. I'm backing change.' That was it. No prior warning. No nothing.


The words of the member for Griffith not a year ago, not two years ago, not five years ago but just last Sunday. So now we know the Treasurer has no courage, no conviction and no loyalty. 


It has been the member for Lilley who has got things so badly wrong. On banking policy he has had a confused approach to out-of-cycle interest-rate movements at various times, describing them on the one hand as commercial decisions but on the other hand he warns, 'Don't let the banks off the hook.' Recently he said the banks are highly profitable and even suggested that they are trying to gouge their customers on rates. He urges people to shop around with banking. But under him the four major banks have gone from 75 per cent of market share to 86 per cent of market share for housing loans outstanding.


It was not the member for Griffith who rejected a carbon tax emphatically just before the 2010 election, as this Treasurer did. Then he proceeded to implement one. We well remember on the 7.30 Report, after I had just debated the Treasurer, when it was put to him by Kerry O'Brien that there would be a carbon tax, he said it was not going to happen, it was fanciful. What happened as Treasurer a few weeks later? He was party to the announcement by the Prime Minister that Labor was going to have a carbon tax. But again this man who is straight out of the Wizard of Oz, who is a lion with no courage, did not go along to that press conference even though the Prime Minister was announcing the largest new tax in modern Australian history. He cowered under his desk in the Treasurer's office. He is no man of courage. He says it is a huge reform to the Australian economy but when it was actually announced where was he? He was in his office. He left the hard, heavy lifting on the carbon tax to the now crippled Prime Minister, to the member for Lyne who was gushing at the time, and to the Leader of the Greens, Senator Bob Brown. The only thing that was not there was the ghost of Kevin Rudd. That was what was missing. But what we do know is that when it comes to credibility on the carbon tax you cannot believe anything this Treasurer says. It was not the member for Griffith who described a carbon tax package as roughly budget neutral, then announced a tax leaving the budget at least $3 billion worse off. It was not the member for Griffith who came up with the idea of dumping an emissions trading scheme in 2010. It was the Treasurer and the now Prime Minister who offered that advice and encouraged the then Prime Minister to change his position and demanded in response to opinion polls that the government not proceed with an emissions trading scheme. 


It was not the member for Griffith who omitted the deficit number from the 2009 budget speech. Remember that? He could not bring himself to say it. It was not the member for Griffith who did not know in this building what the inflation rate was at a press conference or what the government's debt was when he was asked by one of our colleagues. It was not the member for Griffith who could not recall when Labor last delivered a budget surplus, in answer to a question from our friend over there. It was not the member for Griffith who nervously shattered a glass in an ABC studio after the last budget when he was quizzed on the details of his own budget work. It was not the member for Griffith who has taken a committed surplus next year on a free round-the-world flight, from a promise to a determination to a best shot and back to a promise. It was this Treasurer, the member for Lilley; responsible for his own actions, blaming others for everything else. It is the member for Lilley who was breaching the confidence of the Australian people at a critical time when Australians are cocooning and saving, fearful about what the future might hold for them and the volatility of the global economy. It is this Treasurer who is confused, uncertain, clumsy and incoherent. In order to save the Australian economy this Treasurer must go and must go now.

"Clare, Jason, MP",ALP,2012-02-28,"



Mr CLARE
 (Blaxland—Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Justice) (16:05):  The member for North Sydney is usually a pretty good speaker but that would have to be one of the worst speeches he has ever given in this place. It was a 15-minute boring spray. It was so boring the member for Moncrieff was on his BlackBerry through the whole speech; the member for Cowan, who has left now, was on his BlackBerry as well; and the member for Menzies was on his iPad through the whole speech—such enthusiasm the opposition showed to support their shadow treasurer.


It has been a tough week for the government but one thing has been tougher than that, and that was sitting through that speech. It has only taken 15 minutes from the member for North Sydney to remind us why this Labor government is so important, why unity is so important, because the alternative is that. The alternative is a 15-minute spray with nothing about the economy. This is an MPI about confidence in the economy and the member for North Sydney did not even talk about the importance of confidence in the economy. He just made an attack on the Treasurer, the man who helped to lead this country through the global economic crisis. That is a bit rich coming from this opposition led by a man who Peter Costello said you could not trust with the economy, by a man who his former boss John Hewson said was innumerate, by somebody who thinks that the NBN is just for video games, by someone who opposes everything in this place and stands for nothing. He is the Nancy Reagan of Australian politics without the astrology—say no to everything, just rancid, dripping, relentless negativity. The greatest threat that our disunity poses is that it puts Australia and the Australian economy at risk of that.


A political party pays a heavy price for disunity because disunity camouflages your strengths and camouflages your opposition's weaknesses. Conversely, unity changes everything. Unity is your ticket to the contest. When you are united the people of Australia give you permission to explain your achievements and what you plan to achieve in the future. They also give you permission to legitimately critique your opposition. This opposition deserves to be critiqued. This is supposed to be a debate about the economy. The fact is, our economic record is strong and the opposition's is not. Our sweet spot is their weak spot—economic management. 


The most important job of a federal government is to keep the economy strong. That is important because it means people have jobs. It means they can afford to look after their families. They can buy a house. They can pay off the mortgage. They can make sure that their kids have a good education. And that is what drives the government. That is why the Treasurer acted quickly during the global financial crisis. And the result of that? It meant that Australia was one of only a few countries around the world that did not go into recession in the last four years.


The Australian economy—this will put this debate in perspective—is now eight per cent larger than it was before the global financial crisis. Compare that to the rest of the world: Canada has grown by 2.8 per cent; Germany has grown by 1.8 per cent; the United States has not grown at all; Italy has shrunk by 4.1 per cent; Japan has shrunk by 2.8 per cent; France has shrunk by 4.2 per cent; the great United Kingdom has shrunk by 3.7 per cent; and, at the same time, Australia has grown by eight per cent, more than any of those countries. This is the real measure of confidence—growth. 


What is its impact? The impact is jobs for Australians. We have created more than 700,000 jobs in this country in the last four years at a time when the 20 biggest economies around the world have lost 20 million jobs. Our unemployment rate is half that of many other countries around the world. Our unemployment rate is 5.1 per cent; in the US it is 8.3 per cent; in the UK it is 8.4 per cent; in Greece it is 19.2 per cent; in Spain it is 22.9 per cent. This is our record and it is something we on this side of the House are very proud of.


We have also cut income taxes. From 1 July this year someone on $50,000 a year will pay 21 per cent less in tax than when we came to government; someone on $35,000 a year will pay 40 per cent less tax than when we came to government; and, someone on $20,000 a year will pay no tax at all. We have increased the childcare rebate. We have increased the pension. We have introduced the first paid parental leave scheme in Australia's history. We are increasing superannuation from nine per cent to 12 per cent. This means someone on $50,000 now who is 30 years old will have an extra $100,000 to retire on. Next financial year we will return the budget to surplus ahead of every other major advanced economy in the world—the fastest budget turnaround since records have been kept. 


What does all this mean? It means for the first time in Australia's history that we have a AAA credit rating from all three ratings agencies—something the great Liberal Party never achieved. These are the facts that reveal the real strength of the Australian economy. After just over four years of this Labor government, the Australian economy is stronger now compared to the rest of the world than ever before. Unfortunately, a lot of this has been masked. It has also masked the opposition's incompetence. 


Well, I say, enough of that. This debate gives us an opportunity to shine a light on the crack economic team we just saw on display a moment earlier—the presumptive airs of Peter Costello and John Howard, the Leader of the Opposition, the member for North Sydney, the member for Goldstein, that great team which said we were going to go into recession and we did not, the team which said we would lose one million jobs when in fact we created 700,000 jobs, the team which said stimulus was not necessary to keep the Australian economy strong during the global financial crisis, the team which said that the global financial crisis was a hiccup, the team which refused to have their policies costed by Treasury at the last election and asked another company to do it for them. I remember the member for Goldstein said that their work 'would be as good as you could get anywhere in the country, as good as Treasury'. That did not prove to be the case because when Treasury had a look after the election they found an $11 billion hole in their costings and a professional conduct tribunal ended up fining the two accountants who did that work for the Liberal Party. 


It gets worse, because the $11 billion hole we had just after the election has now turned into a $70 billion black hole. To put that in perspective for everyone listening today, that is about the same amount as the cuts the Greek government will have to make. One minute they promise a surplus, the next they do not. One minute they say they will have tax cuts in their first term, now they do not. This is amateur hour, and I say that apologising to all the amateurs around Australia. Why? Because the Leader of the Opposition and his crack economic team are writing cheques that the Liberal Party cannot cash. They are making promises that will mean they cannot return the budget to surplus.




Mr Fletcher:
  That is not to talk about four deficits in a row.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Ms AE Burke
):  Order! The member for Bradfield!




Mr CLARE:
  It will mean that when this government brings the budget back to surplus the Liberal Party would deliver deficit after deficit across the forward estimates.



Mr Fletcher interjecting—



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Bradfield is warned.




Mr CLARE:
  Perhaps the most perplexing element to this crack economic team's economic record is their decision to take away tax cuts from small business and give it back to big mining companies. This is the party that was born out of small business—Menzies' forgotten people, the people they once said they would look after—and they now want to rip away tax cuts for small business and give it to billionaires, to big mining companies. Robert Menzies would be spinning in his grave if he heard this now. This is not the party of Menzies anymore. It is not even the party of John Howard or Peter Costello anymore. Remember what I said earlier: you would not trust this man to run the economy. Nor should the Australian people. They want a debate about the economy. I say, terrific. This is the battle ground that most Australians care about. It affects their lives every single day. This government has the ammunition to have that debate.


Let's compare our record against your record. Have a look at these figures. Jobs are higher now than they have ever been before—more than 11,400,000 are now employed. Inflation is lower now than it was when the Liberal Party left office. Under us, underlying inflation is 2.6 per cent. When they left office it was outside the RBA's target band at 3.7 per cent. The cash rate is lower than it was under them. It is 4.25 per cent, while it was 6.75 when they left office. The cost of the average mortgage is lower now than it was when the Liberal Party left office. An average family—and there are plenty of them in my electorate—paying off a mortgage of $300,000 now pays $3,000 less a year in mortgage repayments. Government spending is also lower. Under this government real spending growth averages 1.5 per cent over the forward estimates. Under them, spending blew out to 3.7 per cent over the last five years. Under this government real wages have also grown faster. Real wages have grown by eight per cent since November 2007. Real wages grew by only 5.4 per cent over the last four years of the last Liberal government. These are the facts and this is our record.


It is a fact that politics is about choices. At the next election the people of Australia will have a choice. If they vote for the Labor Party they will get this sort of economic management. If they vote for the Liberal Party, who knows what sort of economic management they would get. If they vote for the Labor Party they will get tax cuts. If they vote for the Liberal Party, we now know that tax cuts are just an aspiration. Vote for the Labor Party and they will know we are giving an increase to pensioners. Vote for the Liberal Party and they will take that increase to pensioners back. Vote for the Labor Party and the people of Australia will get the National Broadband Network. Vote for the Liberal Party and they will rip that network out. Vote for the Labor Party and you will get the budget back into surplus. Vote for the Liberal Party and you will get a $70 billion black hole. Vote for the Labor Party and you will get a national disability insurance scheme. If you vote for the Liberal Party you will not. If you vote for the Liberal Party, as the people of New South Wales have seen in the last few weeks, you end up with disabled kids on the side of the road waiting for a bus that never comes.


That is the choice the people of Australia will have, and it is time it was known. It is time that this lazy, incompetent opposition, who cannot even speak about the economy for 15 minutes—and I am encouraging the next speaker to try to speak about the economy for longer than the member for North Sydney—was exposed for what they are. They are not the party of Menzies any more. They are not the party of Howard and Costello any more. They cannot even pretend to be Peter Costello or John Howard by standing on their shoulders.


We are happy to have this economic debate. We are happy to have it every day of the week, because we have the record and we are very happy to compare it against yours. When you compare our record on the economy to yours the choice is clear.

"Smith, Tony, MP",LP,2012-02-28,"



Mr TONY SMITH
 (Casey) (16:20):  We have just seen another performance from the minister opposite that sums up so much about the failings of the Labor Party today, the failings of this government—the worst government in living memory—and the effect that is having on business confidence right around Australia. The previous speaker just spoke about how if they can get unity on their side they will highlight their strengths. What the Australian people have seen in the last week are the two Labor parties. In the last week they have seen the real Labor Party, and that of course is the hate party. As of today they are now seeing the resumption of the Labor Party they have known since 2007, the fake party. The actions of this government show their administrative incompetence in program delivery. Couple this with the 24-hour, seven days a week display we have seen of their inability to work with each other. Their views of each other, views spoken from their own mouths, have rightly given the Australian people the horrible message that this government are not spending 24 hours a day, seven days a week working on the problems that require solutions and nor are they working 24 hours a day, seven days a week to strengthen the economy. Instead, they have been working 24 hours a day, seven days a week attacking each other. You do not need to take our word for it on the urgent need for the government to restore confidence. There is survey after survey. Last week the Morgan survey showed a fall in consumer confidence. It showed a reduction through this year and over the course of last year. But it is not just those surveys. The former foreign minister and Prime Minister himself, when he gave that infamous press conference from the Willard hotel in Washington DC, cited damaged confidence in the Australian economy. He cited business leaders who had made this very point to him about the dysfunctionality of the current government.


When you look at the fake party it is quite understandable that when the Australian public look at the troubles in Europe and look at the troubles in the budget in the United States, which they have been digesting for a couple of years now, they look to Canberra and want to know that the government is spending every minute of every day working on these problems—and they want to know that the government is competent. In both fields they have seen the answer. They have known for some time that the government is administratively incompetent. The simple proposition that incompetence here in Canberra creates a lack of confidence right around Australia is something that only those on the other side of the House would deny.


A lack of competence in the Lodge and a lack of competence in the cabinet room leads to a lack of confidence throughout the Australian economy. Those in small business, and families, look at the quality of the government and make a judgment about its ability to deal with difficult situations. I could argue, as most public commentators would also argue, that this has been on display for at least a couple of years. I could recite all the failed programs and, as the shadow Treasurer quite rightly did, the Treasurer's incompetence in his job and the way he has changed position on the economy over the course of his Treasurership.


The last week has been an extra revelation that dims the confidence of the Australian community. They have seen the true Labor Party—the hate party. We have seen it on display. The shadow Treasurer quite rightly read out some of the colourful quotes we have seen over the course of the last week. I will pick up just one set of contributions that says so much about those opposite, and it is from the member for McEwen, who a couple of weeks ago went public against the member for Griffith. He said he was a coward, in the Melbourne Herald Sun. He said he should 'put up or shut up'. He said:


And when they lose then they and their mates should just go to the backbench and then wander off at the next election.


We will see how much courage the member for McEwen has today if the Herald Sun follows him up. We will see whether he still thinks the member for Griffith and those who supported him should leave at the next election.


But it gets better. After engaging as best he could in the hate party and showing the Australian public his true agenda and what he spends his time on, here he was this morning at a doorstop, looking the cameras in the eye and saying to the Australian people and his electorate: 'Can I tell you, last night it was business as usual with everyone. We were all together having a good time.' This is absolutely unbelievable. It is this sort of deception that the Australian people see.



Government members interjecting—




Mr TONY SMITH:
  Those opposite do not get it. They are prattling on opposite, but they do not get that their administrative incompetence and what they have done in the last week damages business confidence. Do you understand this simple concept? The Australian public look at you—the most incompetent government in living memory, with the most pathetic backbench in living memory. You said for 18 months that the member for Griffith was absolutely fantastic, right up until the day before the member for Griffith had to go. You had the Treasurer of the country, two weeks before the member for Griffith was politically executed, saying what a great job he was doing. The Treasurer then released this extraordinary statement about the dysfunctionality of the government under the member for Griffith.


Yet those opposite think that somehow this does not send the signal to the Australian community that all is not well in Canberra. If you are looking at investing in a small business, or if you are running a small business and thinking about expanding, you might be thinking: 'They are having some tough times in Europe. How are things going in the Australian economy?' Do you really think the incompetent display you have put on, where you have revealed exactly what your priorities are and the lack of cohesion and lack of purpose in your government, has no possible effect on business confidence?


Those opposite have now gone back to the fake party. The one thing—the only thing—I would agree with the previous speaker on is that the next election will be a choice. When the Australian public go to the ballot box, they will have a choice between hope for reward and opportunity and the continuing chaos that they have seen since 24 November 2007. There is one thing this government could do to improve business confidence. It is, as the Leader of the Opposition said over the course of the last week, to let the people of Australia have an election to make that choice that the minister opposite was talking about. So let them make the choice and that will restore business confidence, because they will have the chance to elect a government of grown-ups that is capable of managing the Australian economy.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Hon. BC Scott
):  Before I call the member for Parramatta, while I was reluctant to call the member for Casey to order a couple of times, I note that the use of the words 'you' and 'your government' is a reflection on the chair. I remind all members that when they are addressing their comments it is not 'you' or 'your' and they should be referring to people by their title or the particular arm of government or opposition.

"Owens, Julie, MP",ALP,2012-02-28,"



Ms OWENS
 (Parramatta) (16:30):  Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and it would have been truly terrible if the member for Casey meant to inflict on you that level of personal abuse that he seemed happy to spray forth for a full wasted 10 minutes. The matter of public importance that we are supposed to be debating today, one which I thought we were going to debate and I looked forward to, is about the level of confidence in the management of the Australian economy. It is actually a serious matter, it is a matter of public importance and I would have hoped that the opposition would have actually had something to say about the economy. But what we have had instead in this House from the first speaker, the member for North Sydney, and from the second speaker, the member for Casey, has been 25 minutes of wasted time filled with personal abuse and a personal attack on the Treasurer, not on his record but on the perception that they have of his character, presumably one that they got from spending the last two days looking through whatever rubbish they could find in the media.


This is ridiculous. We should be talking about the economy and there is much to talk about. If they have any more speakers—and I hope they do not because, quite frankly, I think we have got better things to do in this place than listen to that level of nonsense; we really do have more to do than listen to that nonsense—that want to talk about the economy please let them stand up and do so; otherwise, we should move on to some serious business, because that is what we try to do in this House.


But let us talk about the management of the Australian economy since that is the issue that the shadow Treasurer actually put on the agenda. Let us talk about what people have to say about the Australian economy and our management of it. Let us start with someone that those opposite know quite well. Let us start with the Leader of the Opposition and what he has to say about the Australian economy:


On the face of this comparative performance, Australia has serious bragging rights. Compared to most developed countries, our economic circumstances are enviable.


That was a direct quote from the Leader of the Opposition when he was out of the country speaking to people in the United Kingdom, not something he is prepared to say here. When he is here he is happy to do his best to tear down confidence in the Australian economy at every opportunity, looking for anything he can find that might make people frightened or might make people doubt the strength of the Australian economy. But once he gets out of here to a place where there are not voters listening—or he thinks they are not listening—he speaks the truth in that context:


On the face of this comparative performance, Australia has serious bragging rights. Compared to most developed countries, our economic circumstances are enviable.


So I would say to the opposition that, if they want to put forward a matter of public importance about the need for the government to restore confidence in the management of the Australian economy, they could start with their own behaviour. They could start talking openly and honestly about what has been happening in this country and around the world over the last four years and about exactly how strong we are. They could actually talk about the economy instead of engaging in 25 minutes of useless personal attacks on character. What an extraordinary waste of the time of this parliament.


In a moment we will see who else has something to say about the Australian economy. For a start, we have a AAA credit rating from all three of the rating agencies. That is the first time in Australia's history that we have had that AAA rating from all three of the rating agencies—not something that those on the other side have ever managed to achieve and not something that they are prepared to mention in Australia. They are not prepared to acknowledge the strength of the economy in this country at all. They will go overseas and do it there but in no way will they do it here. Let us talk about what Governor Stevens of the Reserve Bank had to say just last Friday:


Our rate of unemployment has a 'five' at the front and the next digit is a small number. Inflation is about where we want it and our banks are strong. Our government finances, despite some pickup in debt in recent years, are … that basically we are a AAA-rated country and rightly so—there are not many of those. We are attractive to foreign investment. The government did not end up having to own any banks as a result of the crisis. There is a lot that is good about this picture.


That is a direct quote from the Governor of the Reserve Bank as recently as last Friday. Let us look at the underlying conditions that actually lead to people having that view, that lead to us being rated AAA by three agencies and that lead to the Leader of the Opposition saying, when he was out of the country, that we have 'serious bragging rights'.


Let us see why the Leader of the Opposition thinks that Australia has 'serious bragging rights' when it comes to its economy. We have low unemployment at 5.1 per cent. That is compared to 8.3 per cent in the US and 10.4 per cent in Europe. We have more people employed now than we have ever had in the history of Australia, and that is in spite of moving through the global financial crisis, which has hit the rest of the world incredibly badly. We in this country were shielded by the quick action of this government and we have unemployment in the low fives. That is an extraordinary achievement and it is worth bragging about when you go overseas—and the Leader of the Opposition thought so too. Our economy has grown seven per cent since the global financial crisis while others are only just recovering or are struggling to do so. We know that many are not recovering and we know that around the world there are countries that are still seriously struggling but our economy has grown by seven per cent. We have received some timely reminders quite recently. In January 46,000 jobs were created with the unemployment rate again trickling down to 5.1 per cent, which was virtually unchanged from 12 months ago. So that is 46,000 jobs in January.


Our investment pipeline is another indication of how investors see this economy and the strength of Australia moving into the future. A report from Access Economics shows our investment pipeline remains intact. It increased to $913 billion in the December quarter, which is again an extraordinary statement of faith in the Australian dollar and is perhaps something that the Leader of the Opposition might want to brag about in this country as well as when he is overseas. We have seen improvements in both business and consumer confidence in the last couple of weeks, in spite of the opposition's very serious attempts to talk down the economy in this country as often as they can. Consumer confidence was up by 4.2 per cent in February, and the NAB monthly business survey showed a slight increase in business confidence in January. So we are seeing very real improvements in that area. Last week the Australian share market had its strongest weekly performance in three months, which is also something we can take as a sign that things are moving along as they should.


Let us look at the comparisons between this government and the last one. Again, if the Howard government had achieved what we are achieving I suspect that the Leader of the Opposition would be bragging in this country as well as overseas. For example, real spending growth averages 1.5 per cent over the forward estimates compared to 3.7 per cent under the last five years of the Howard government. Our tax as a share of GDP will be 21.2 per cent in 2011-12 compared to 24.2 per cent under the Howard government. In other words, as a share of GDP, tax is less under the Labor government than it was under the Howard government.



Mr Buchholz interjecting—




Ms OWENS:
  I know from the interjection opposite that the opposition do not like to acknowledge that. They do not like to acknowledge the achievements so far. They do not like to speak the truth in this country. They just wait till they go overseas to do it. They brag overseas and run a fear campaign in this country. 



Mr Buchholz interjecting—




Ms OWENS:
  Honestly, if the member for Wright wants to interject he should look at the words of his own leader. The Leader of the Opposition speaks the truth when he gets out of this country, when he is not putting votes ahead of the interests of this nation. When he puts votes ahead of the interests of this nation he has nothing but negative things to say and when he goes overseas and wants to piggyback on the success of Australia he speaks the truth and talks about our 'bragging rights' in the management of this economy. The opposition should look at their own behaviour first, really.


At the moment the cash rate that families are working with is 4.25 per cent. It was 6.75 per cent when the Howard government lost office. It was 2.5 per cent higher under the Howard government than it is now. The standard variable mortgage rate is down to 7.3 per cent compared to 8.6 per cent when we first came into government. Our credit rating is AAA, which we have never achieved before from the three credit agencies. We have grown by eight per cent since November 2007, when in the last four years of the Howard government it was 5.4 per cent. So, in the biggest global financial crisis, real wages have grown more under this government than they did under the last one. There is much to be proud of with this. It is just such a shame that the Leader of the Opposition cannot say that in Australia. (Time expired)

Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland) (16:40):  There would not be another electorate in Australia that would be more interested than mine in the topic of this afternoon's matter of public importance debate. There is a crisis of confidence in my electorate, and it is directly linked to the uncertainty that this government has created through its reckless decision to legislate for the world's biggest carbon tax. The government like to claim that the job losses we have seen in the manufacturing sector have all been caused by external factors—that is, the high dollar at work and a range of other excuses—and that it is simply not their fault. My simple answer to that is: why make it harder? Why make it tougher for Australian manufacturers and other businesses, including the agricultural sector, to compete on world markets? People are losing their jobs today as a direct result of the lack of confidence in the future and the cost implications of the carbon tax.


The fundamental flaw in this Prime Minister's whole strategy lies in the fact that she still has not dealt with the breach of trust with the Australian people in relation to the carbon tax. Every other problem that has been put in front of this Prime Minister stems from that fundamental breach of trust with the Australian people where she famously ruled out a carbon tax before the election and has now set about implementing it without getting a mandate from the people.


This week the Australian people have had a very close look at the internal machinations of the Australian Labor Party and, I must say, they have been repulsed by the ugly sight that they have seen. We have seen bullying, threatening behaviour and intimidation. The previous speaker chastised the member for Casey and the member for North Sydney for allegedly indulging in personal abuse of members of the other side, but if we want to see personal abuse all we need to do is turn on the television and listen to Labor ministers talking about their colleagues. It has been an appalling example of how this government is dysfunctional at its very heart. I would actually not be able to use in this place some of the phrases and descriptions that those ministers have used, Mr Deputy Speaker. You would pull me up because it would be unparliamentary to use those sorts of phrases. But they are the phrases that ministers have felt free to use to describe each other. That dysfunction, that ugly side of the Australian Labor Party, has torn away at the confidence of the Australian people. They expect so much more from our elected leaders. What we are experiencing now is a deterioration in confidence as a direct result of the dysfunction which starts in the Prime Minister's office. 


That dysfunction has lead to an erosion of confidence in communities like mine in Gippsland. I meet with the owners of small businesses all the time, and what they are telling me, particularly in relation to the carbon tax, is that the job losses have started already. Small engineering firms are now reporting back to me that the major power stations are doing only the absolute minimum they have to do in their maintenance programs. Any discretionary expenditure has been wound back and the jobs have been reduced. A small engineering firm that may have been getting $10,000 or $20,000 per week in jobs through the power stations is now looking at $1,000 or $2,000 per week. They are saying, 'One job is lost over here and another one over there.' They are not the headline-grabbing job losses we have seen with some of the major losses around the state; they are happening on a smaller scale—and this is before the carbon tax has even been introduced.


I have a practical local example. I have a letter here from a major engineering company which in the middle of last year was in the throes of, well advanced in, its plan to purchase a smaller engineering firm in the Latrobe Valley. The plan was to take all the six staff from the small engineering firm. The firm had progressed as far as receiving planning approval, expanding their workshop and negotiating the final terms and conditions. I will not name the firm, but I will quote what they said in relation to their planned purchase. Their letter states: 'The announcements by the federal government yesterday with regard to a carbon tax and the ensuing power station closure discussions have caused our board of directors to require more time in order to develop a strategy for the group companies within the Latrobe Valley.' In the time that has passed subsequent to that letter they have pulled out of the sale, because they have no confidence in the future of power stations in the Latrobe Valley under this government's carbon tax regime. 


It is not just this side of the House which recognises this lack of confidence in the business community. I have a quote here from the member for Griffith. A lot of people have given some free character assessments of him in the past week. In a statement from Washington last week, the member for Griffith said: 


I also believe it is affecting the business community and I agree with recent statements by peak bodies to this effect.


It is important that business confidence is maintained in Australia—the economy and jobs are core to what any responsible government is about.


The member for Griffith is referring there specifically to the dysfunction at the very highest levels of this government. The minister for industry and resources said in relation to the carbon tax: 


I think there's a lot of concern in industry at the moment about the price we've locked in given where Europe is at the moment in terms of price of carbon—whether we've locked in a price that's to our disadvantage as a nation. 


It is not just members on this side who are raising concerns about the carbon tax and the impact it is having on confidence in the economy; it is also members on the other side when they feel free to finally speak their mind. As long as this carbon tax hangs over the heads of Australian businesses and industries, it is hard to see that confidence being restored. 


The issue of the carbon tax is one that is being followed very closely in my community. Naturally, because we have the brown coal-fired power stations, we are very much at the pointy end of the debate. For people in this community, it is about their jobs; it is about the lives that they can lead today; it is about the future that their children may have and whether they can obtain a trade and get to stay and work in the Latrobe Valley; and it is about what role they can play in the future economic growth of our great nation. From the moment the government broke its promise in relation to the carbon tax, there has been a crisis of confidence in the Latrobe Valley. 


In addition to those engineering firms which I have referred to and the larger power stations, the business community hate the uncertainty that has been created by this circumstance. All of this is coming from a Prime Minister who was quoted in the media quite recently as saying that she wants to run the economy 'in the interests of working people'. 




Mr McCormack:
  Humph. 




Mr CHESTER:
  I hear the member for Riverina scoff, with good cause. The Prime Minister's comment will come as a huge surprise to the people in my electorate. It will also come as a huge surprise to the power station workers in my electorate. The Prime Minister and every member of the government has voted to kick them out of their jobs. There are hundreds of power station workers in the Latrobe Valley today who will lose their jobs under the carbon tax Contract for Closure scheme. There can be no greater blow to the confidence of a regional economy than unemployment. This government and every member of it has voted to sack blue-collar workers in the Latrobe Valley, and now they sit there silently—not a word. Members opposite are sitting there silently, just as they sat silently during this debate on the carbon tax. Not one of them stood up for the workers in the Latrobe Valley; not one of them had the guts to stand up for the blue-collar workers in the Latrobe Valley who will lose their jobs under this government's carbon tax. Those jobs are in the hands of Labor MPs. The future of those families in the Latrobe Valley is up to those opposite. 


I just question whatever happened to that grand old party, the grand old Australian Labor Party, that proudly claimed to stand up for the workers of this nation. The workers that I speak to do not want Labor's household assistance package. They do not want Labor's transition plan. They do not want Labor's promise of new green jobs. They want the security of the job they have got today. 




Ms Grierson:
  You'll take them back to the fifties.




Mr CHESTER:
  Finally, someone has spoken up and referenced the fifties. In the fifties, the power station workers in the Latrobe Valley had a job, and you are going to take it away from them. Your government is prepared to take away the power station workers' jobs in the Latrobe Valley under its Contract for Closure scheme. I invite the member opposite to stand up and explain to me how she is going to stop that. Quite clearly, there is no interest among members opposite to actually stop the carbon tax and the Contract for Closure scheme and the way that it will cascade through regional economies like a toxic waterfall. 


This carbon tax will take money out of households, which means there will be less money available to be spent in regional businesses. In essence, it is a blight on the Australian community that this government is inflicting upon households, businesses and heavy industry at a time when we can least afford it. 


Just after the Prime Minister's treacherous disposal of the member for Griffith in 2010, she fronted the Australian public and said, 'There will be some days I delight you and there may be some days I disappoint you.' I have a tremendous view of the Labor party backbench from where I sit, and I am not seeing a lot of smiling faces. I am not seeing a lot of delight. In fact, I see a lot of disappointment written all over their faces. But this carbon tax is not about them. It is about the power station workers I just spoke about. It is about honest, hardworking men and women who just want to earn a reasonable pay and look after their families. It is about businesses and industry leaders who want to stay competitive and export their products around the world without being handicapped in the race by a tax that none of their competitors will pay. 


I say to the Prime Minister: all we have seen is disappointment. You have not delighted anyone in the Latrobe Valley. So why won't you not dump this tax before Australians really start to get hurt? The question that the people of the Latrobe Valley are asking this Prime Minister is: why are you making it harder for businesses to make a quid? Why are you making it harder for businesses to compete on world markets? And why are you making it harder for businesses to employ people, develop new skills and invest in the future of the our nation? It is no wonder that the Australian people have lost confidence in this Prime Minister. (Time expired)

"Symon, Mike, MP",ALP,2012-02-28,"



Mr SYMON
 (Deakin) (16:51):  It is a pleasure to speak on the matter of public importance this afternoon. I think the title, 'The urgent need for the government to restore confidence in their management of the Australian economy', has been well put, because the government has been doing that. There is only one side of this parliament that has not been. It is the side that has been out there day after day, whether we are in parliament or back in our electorates, talking our economy down. Every time a measure is put to this parliament to improve Australia's economy, who talks about ripping it down? Of course it is the opposition. 


We hear the same old story, and it has not mattered which leader they have had over that side of the chamber. I remember the former Leader of the Opposition, when we were dealing with the first stimulus package, saying, 'There were really no problems in Australia; we did not need to worry about things like that'—talking the economy down, and it has continued ever since. We hear it every day in this place at question time. We hear it almost every day when another motion to suspend standing orders is moved and, of course, defeated. This has become a bit of a joke on the Australian public because it is the government doing the work to not only build our economy but also make life better for working people and families in Australia.


I have listened to some of this debate and heard opposition members talk about all sorts of things, but when it has come to economic management and jobs they seem to stray off a little, and I wonder why. When you look overseas and see what has happened there, you find examples of countries that have dealt with the global financial crisis in a different way. In Australia, as I can prove, we have done better than other countries. We have done better by investing not only in building infrastructure but also in jobs. That is a great thing. It is not just a short-term thing. It is not money that is handed over to a private bank to help bail it out, to help pay out shareholders. It is money put into community infrastructure that will last for years, for decades.


Even better than that, although we get the infrastructure, we provide jobs along the way, jobs in the construction industry for thousands and thousands of people, many in my electorate and many in surrounding electorates. That is a great thing because, quite honestly, as so many tradespeople, engineers, consultants and architects and everyone involved in the construction industry told me during 2008, 2009 and into 2010, 'We would not be working if it were not for these programs.' That is simply true. Work had dried up in the construction industry. There was no private investment going around and an awful lot of people did not know where their next job was going to be. For those who do not know the construction industry, it can be quite itinerant. Many workers in the industry literally go from job to job. Sometimes they may work for months on a job; sometimes it may only be a day or two. If there is not another job to go to then that is a particularly worrying time because it can be a long time until the next one comes up.


By putting in programs like the Building the Education Revolution, this government was able to provide thousands and thousands of jobs in that industry. Electorates like my electorate of Deakin have benefited by an $80 million investment in new school buildings. Those will last for decades. They have refreshed and upgraded our schools and are a wonderful community asset that will outlast many of those members in this chamber.


Figures on the great work done locally on the economy speak for themselves. In total, our economy has grown seven per cent since the global financial crisis while other countries, as I have said, are still struggling to recover lost ground. As we know, an additional 46,000 jobs were created in January this year and Australia's unemployment rate is now at 5.1 per cent. That is an even better achievement when compared to a rate of 8.3 per cent in the US and 10.4 per cent in Europe. If we look back, we see that during the worst of the global financial crisis the US unemployment rate reached 10.2 per cent, or a total of 15.7 million people out of work in October 2009. Here in Australia the unemployment rate rose to 5.7 per cent before going back to 5.1 per cent now.


We invested. That is one of the great reasons Australia is better off than other countries which have had to deal with the global financial crisis. We have something to show for it. Unfortunately, there are many countries in Europe and many countries in the Americas that have put an awful lot of money in and really do not have a whole lot of results to show for their money. Not only did we invest in schools, we also invested in the Nation Building Program. Out of that, again, came more local jobs and more local infrastructure. That was a great help, a saviour, to many in my local area.


We had large projects such as the Springvale Road underpass funded through that program. As a result there were hundreds of jobs created there and the community got a lasting benefit, one that will serve for decades to come. It was a job that should have been done not just a few years ago but decades ago as well. A six-lane road with a railway crossing and 218 trains a day does not add up. All it means is traffic congestion from one side of the suburb of Nunawading to the other. Now that the work is done you do not even notice that it is there—I suppose that is a real compliment. If people do not notice the traffic jam, that is a good thing. Where it once was, even on a Sunday afternoon, if you had driven a car along Springvale Road you could well have been banked up for half a kilometre, even more, in a traffic jam. Peak hour times during the week were, of course, far worse.


If we go back to 2009 and recall some of the votes in this place, it was the opposition which moved an amendment that would have taken away the funding for that project. If that had been the case, those hundreds of jobs would not have been created and the infrastructure would not be there. That is part of the story as to how Australia-wide 200,000 jobs were saved. It is much easier to express when you have local examples. Many people look at large numbers and, although the large numbers may look impressive—including to people in this place—quite often they need to be given local relevance that I can show someone.


It may not need to be hundreds of millions of dollars or millions. It can be quite small amounts, but it makes a big difference to a local community organisation. Maybe the organisation has been able to upgrade its pavilion or playing ground and has been looking to do that for years and years to make life better for its club members. Of course, not just one club uses most of these grounds, it is a vast range of them. Investing in the community, as we have done in government, is one of the best things a Labor government can ever do. It has meant that so many people—not just in my electorate but also in every electorate across Australia—have been able to have better community facilities, better education facilities and better health facilities. Money has also gone in and, again, by building, expanding and improving services the community gets the benefit. That is the great thing about our investment during the global financial crisis and onwards, because we are the party that cares about jobs. We are the party that cares about people's living standards. It is important, and Australia has to have the strongest economy we can achieve. By doing what we have done and by continuing to do so, we can say—and we know—that more than 700,000 jobs have been created over the past four years. That rate of growth in jobs, in sheer numbers, is amazing given what we have been through with the downturn that still persists today in so many countries across the world.


We can go on to where things can go from now. Just recently in this House, of course, we debated the minerals resources rent tax. The money that will flow from that once it is passed by the Senate will flow back and assist the community. It will flow back from companies that can afford to pay it to small businesses that could really do with a tax cut—from companies that can afford to pay it to people who could really do with an increase in their superannuation savings.


These sorts of things are important and do matter, and they make a difference to the long term. They are important and of course there are many more of them, and this is not the only example. There is the tax write-off for small businesses of $6,000. It is a magnificent thing for a small business to be able to invest and know that they do not have to wait— (Time expired)

Mr BRUCE SCOTT
 (Maranoa—Second Deputy Speaker) (21:30):  I rise this evening to call on the government to provide more support and a greater effort in working with the kangaroo industry, or macropod industry as it is more technically referred to in the industry. I want the trade minister, particularly, to lift his effort in trying to re-establish the very valuable markets we have had in Russia, and also the dialogue that had been established between Australia and China, because they are two very important markets that have shown a great deal of interest. Russia in the past had been a market that was opened up, but we have lost it. I do not know why this trade minister has not given it more attention.


The kangaroo industry has a very strong presence in my electorate of Maranoa and across many parts of rural Australia. It is a significant employer for many rural communities in southern Queensland. In communities like Blackall, Longreach, Charleville, Mitchell, Winton, Barcaldine, Cunnamulla, Quilpie, Thargomindah, Windorah, my home town of Roma, Surat, St George, and many other little communities in between, the industry provides employment opportunities, not only in the harvesting sector but also in the processing sectors. In some of these communities 30 to 40 per cent of the jobs are related to the harvesting of the macropods in that area. There are at least 2,000 licensed kangaroo harvesters in Queensland. They operate under licence and have a quota arrangement. They are professional people.


Given the three almost consecutive seasons we have had of record rainfalls in Queensland, we have seen a massive increase in the number of kangaroos. My understanding is that the harvesting quota for the forthcoming year has been increased by something like 800,000. I will stand corrected on that number, as I may have one zero too many, but it is something of that magnitude. Why? Because of the record seasons we have had, kangaroos are in plague proportions in many areas.


Kangaroo meat is an organic meat product. It is a beautiful product. I know that overseas countries are demanding it, but we have got to lift our effort when it comes to trade and bilateral relations with these countries. The other thing is the leather. Kangaroo leather is one of the finest leathers in the world. In fact, any reputable soccer team will play with kangaroo leather soccer shoes. Anyone in the World Cup soccer would be playing in kangaroo-leather shoes, such is the reputation of kangaroo leather.


The industry has gone through some changes in the last two to three years. Phytosanitary issues have had to be addressed as well as the traceability of the product from harvesting right through to the processing plant. They have gone through a very expensive process of implementing regulations related to phytosanitary issues, because if kangaroo meat is going to be coming into the human consumption chain it has to meet the strictest of standards. The industry is meeting those standards. They have implemented those changes, but we are now finding that we do not have the markets available to meet the number of kangaroos that will need to be harvested. There will not be sufficient markets unless it goes into the pet food industry. That is a tragedy because kangaroo meat is better than a pet food industry product. It is much better and has a place in the human consumption chain.


I do not want to see a situation where the federal government, as they have done with the camels in the Northern Territory, just pays $19 million to shoot camels just to reduce their numbers. They are doing something similar with wild goats in Victoria at the moment. Just shooting them and leaving them in the field when they could have been harvested. This is a most valuable product. I call on the government to ensure they put an increased effort into opening up those markets in Russia and China and making sure that our marsupial industry, the macropod industry, has a brighter future than it has had in the last two to three years. They are in plague proportions out there and they need to be controlled. I call on the minister to lift his game.

"Bandt, Adam, MP",AG,2012-02-28,"



Mr BANDT
 (Melbourne) (16:00):  There is much talk of the miracle of the mining boom, but the reality is that we have a Jekyll and Hyde economy: one side of the economy is at war with the other. The more the mining bubble grows, the more the rest of the economy suffers—and we know what happens to bubbles: eventually they burst. At this rate, when the bubble bursts there will be little left to keep the economy going. So we need action: we need action to take the heat out of the dollar, we need action to ensure the enormous wealth of this mining boom is not squandered—squandered either by shifting the profits overseas, along with the iron ore and the coal; or squandered by spending today what the mining tax will raise instead of saving for tomorrow.


At the tax forum last year the Greens advocated that a substantial proportion of the proceeds from the mining boom should be quarantined for these two reasons. The first reason is intergenerational equity. There could be a fund that could be drawn on after the resources are exhausted as a means of sharing the benefits with future generations. The second reason is to address the challenge of the two-speed, or Jekyll and Hyde economy. A sovereign wealth fund investing offshore could help to counteract the appreciations of the Australian dollar, which have eroded the international competitiveness of important export industries such as sophisticated manufacturing, tourism and international education.


Sovereign wealth funds have operated well overseas, in places such as Norway, where they have invested proceeds from their North Sea oil. So we should commit to putting in place a sovereign wealth fund, and the first step is a thorough examination of how it could be done. Consequently, my motion calls for the Productivity Commission to properly examine the issue and report back. Sovereign wealth funds are generally state owned investment funds composed of financial assets such as stocks, bonds, real estate or other financial instruments. Around 36 countries have such funds; some countries even have more than one. Currently, $4.2 trillion worth of assets are under management by these types of funds—that is an increase of 11 per cent from 2010.


In some respects Australia already has a type of sovereign wealth fund. The Future Fund was established in 2006 to meet unfunded pension liabilities for former public servants and Defence employees. I do have criticisms of how the Future Fund has invested some of its revenue—most notably in tobacco shares, and I commend my colleague Senator Richard di Natale, who is working to address this issue—however, I do believe the Future Fund has shown that it is possible for such a fund to function effectively and with fairly wide support in Australia. I believe there is a need, and a space, for another sovereign wealth fund that could be an important economic stabiliser and provide the country with protection from overheating or from a future economic downturn. A new sovereign wealth fund could also help provide for the country's infrastructure needs.


In the time available I do not intend to try and debate all the issues relating to sovereign wealth funds. It is a complex and serious issue and deserves detailed discussion and examination, as my motion suggests. I do note that there are some high-profile advocates for the establishment of a sovereign wealth fund. Individuals such as Ralph Norris, previously the CEO of the Commonwealth Bank; and Mike Smith, the CEO of ANZ; as well as Fairfax chairman and RBA board member Roger Corbett. I also note the member for Wentworth has advocated for such a fund to be established, and I note his detailed and thoughtful speech on this topic in April last year. I anticipate that there will be those who do not support the establishment of such a fund at this time because, they will say, the budget needs to return to surplus first. I do not necessarily agree with that, but my motion is not inconsistent with it. My motion allows for a thorough examination to take place over the coming months, and those who believe that that ought to happen first can still nonetheless support this motion.

Mr BANDT:
  I look forward to a productive debate on this motion, and I am willing to consider amendments to get this motion through, because nothing could be more central to our future economic prosperity than understanding how we manage the mining boom. It is incumbent on all of us to focus our efforts on that task. The Australian Greens and I will continue to advocate for a proper mining tax based on that proposed by Treasury and the Henry review, and we will continue to press for a sovereign wealth fund. I commend the motion to the House.

Mr BRIGGS
 (Mayo) (16:05):  One joy of having children is that you get to read lots of fairytales, but I have not heard a better fairytale than what I have just heard from the member for Melbourne. In all seriousness, the Greens standing up with an economic policy which, to quote Ronald Reagan, is based on, 'If it moves, tax it; if it keeps moving, regulate it; if it stops moving, subsidise it,' is a joke. To be lectured to by the member for Melbourne about two former heads and one current CEO of a bank that the member for Melbourne spends nearly day after day kicking the living suitcase out of is, I think, just a little bit hypocritical now that he is taking their advice.


The member for Melbourne's understanding of the finance sector, if you are to believe him, is that, while Australia is nearly $300 billion in debt, what we should be doing is taxing the best performing industry even more because they will just keep creating jobs and investing even though they are now being taxed even more than they were before, and we should invest all those proceeds in this sort of magical money pudding which is the Greens' economic policy. We should put that into a separate account for some future need. He then tries to quote the member for Wentworth as his source for the reason he supports this. I acknowledge that the member for Wentworth supports this concept, but you will find also that the member for Wentworth supports paying off the debt. That is not something you would do, Member for Melbourne, because you would have a multibillion-dollar dental scheme in place before that—a scheme, I might add, that the former Labor finance minister Peter Walsh, who I know the member for Fraser has much respect for, said would be the quickest way to bankrupt the Commonwealth. That is what Peter Walsh, the former Labor finance minister, said: the quickest way to bankrupt the Commonwealth.


So you have this sort of magical money pudding idea that the member for Melbourne wants to push around. He asks for suggestions for amendments that might help support it. Well, here is a suggestion: get rid of Bob Brown's bank. Get rid of the $10 billion you are going to spend and waste on projects that the Greens think are worthwhile, with all your economic expertise. Get rid of that. There is a start. There is $10 billion less that the future generations of this country, including my children, will have to pay off and that you are recklessly encouraging your coalition partners to engage in.


The member for Fraser knows all this is true. He knows you cannot set up a sovereign wealth fund which changes the dollar. The member for Melbourne did not even begin to explain how much would be required on the international money markets to change the value of the dollar. I wonder if the member for Melbourne has any idea at all about how much would be required to be in this fund. A hundred billion? Two hundred billion? Half a trillion? A trillion? How much Australian taxpayers' money would it be, member for Melbourne, that the Australian government—the five people sitting around a boardroom table—would have to sit there and invest overseas to play with the dollar value? How much would it be? How much Australian taxpayers' money are you willing for a group of people to spend overseas to play with the dollar's value? I would be really interested in the answer. I suspect the member for Melbourne has not got a clue.


The Greens on economic policy make the Labor Party look relevant. For goodness sake! We are nearly $300 billion in debt and he is talking about establishing a magic pudding sovereign wealth fund on the basis that the mining industry is going to continue to contribute these additional taxes, which of course will not damage investment at all! They will not stop people investing! No, you just continue to ramp up the tax. The next line will be 'because Australians own those assets'. That will be the next line we hear from the Greens. Of course, that is not true either. The mining companies invest their capital to make the most out of those assets. They are the people who employ. They are the people who take the chances. The taxpayer does not. By the way, those taxes that those mining companies pay and those jobs that they create go towards the Commonwealth so that they can provide services like health, education and the services that the Australian people demand. This motion should be laughed at. If it were coming from someone who had seriously thought about a sovereign wealth fund and wanted to engage in a debate about the merits of a sovereign wealth fund, it would be worthwhile having this discussion, but when it comes from the Greens, when it comes from a pretend communist, it is not worth the time to have this discussion. There are merits in having funds established. The Future Fund is one where you have a specific purpose. Peter Costello saw that purpose as ensuring that in the future we are able to meet our obligations. To sit here for five minutes and listen to the member for Melbourne, the former communist, tell us about financial policy is a joke.

Dr LEIGH
 (Fraser) (16:10):  It is always a pleasure to follow one of the modest members in this place! Opened in 1880, the Melbourne Royal Exhibition Building is widely considered a national treasure. It was the first building in Australia to achieve World Heritage listing. It was made possible by the discovery of gold in the 19th century. If you want to see the legacy of the first Australian mining boom, you just need to look around central Melbourne. The question we are facing today is effectively this: would Victoria now be better off if the Victorian government of the 19th century had saved the money rather than building infrastructure? That is basically the argument made by those who argue that the right policy response to today's mining boom is a sovereign wealth fund. One of those sovereign wealth funds has various advocates. I have certainly heard the members for Wentworth and Kooyong in the popular press making strong arguments in favour of sovereign wealth funds. There are typically three arguments made by proponents of sovereign wealth funds and it is worth going through those in turn.


First of all, some say that with the Australian dollar at historic highs we ought to amass greenbacks as a form of insurance against a currency slump. It is certainly true that a currency slump would be a shock to the economy, but it is not the only one we have to guard against. Governments have to anticipate and react to natural disasters, fiscal shocks and even unexpected technological change. We have already got substantial foreign holdings. The Future Fund has $75 billion, of which about a quarter is in overseas equities, and Australians have $1.3 trillion in superannuation, of which about a fifth is overseas assets.


The second argument made for a sovereign wealth fund is that it would cure Dutch disease, which occurs when a mining-induced currency rise hurts other export industries such as manufacturing, tourism or higher education. Most likely it is true that saving a greater share of mining tax revenues would lead to an easing in monetary policy and therefore a lower exchange rate, but the effect would be modest, particularly under current mining tax rates. If your top priority is to cure Dutch disease, a sovereign wealth fund is more of a bandaid than a vaccine.


The third argument for a sovereign wealth fund is that we need to boost national savings. It has got a virtuous ring about it, but it misses the fact that Australians already save a great deal. In 2010 our gross national savings rate was 25 per cent higher than Japan's. The current federal government's fiscal consolidation is one of the fastest on record and a significant share of government investment is a down payment on future productivity. That is what we are doing with the National Broadband Network, education and transport. If you believe that Australia needs to save more, you need to say which taxes you would increase or which spending you would cut. A sovereign wealth fund without deposits has all the usefulness of a pub without beer. To put it another way, a sovereign wealth fund is in simple terms a piggy bank that contains foreign currency. It is not much use if it is empty.


At its core the debate over a sovereign wealth fund comes down to intergenerational equity. Most economists and philosophers believe our generation has an obligation to hand on to our children at least as much wealth as we inherited. We do not need to preserve every hill and rock, but if we use up an asset we should replace it with one at least as valuable. That affects how we think about the climate change debate. The Great Barrier Reef has extremely high value, so it merits urgent action by our generation to preserve it. But intergenerational equity also reminds us that future generations will be richer than us and not necessarily any more public spirited, so there is no philosophical obligation to leave our children an overstuffed piggy bank rather than, say, a good education and a well-functioning rail network. Indeed, if we were to slash spending on skills and infrastructure and save the proceeds, future generations might well condemn us as short-sighted scrooges. This is not to say that there is not a strong case for a sovereign wealth fund sometime in the future. Maybe in the future we might be able to think about a Norwegian style fund to build a stock of assets to the future or a Chilean style fund to implement counter-cyclical fiscal policy, which was so sorely missing for much of the Howard years. But in the current economic environment it is hardly a high priority. If you are concerned about future generations, let us focus on the top priorities: a price on carbon pollution, shifting from the outdated mineral royalties scheme to a profits based mining tax, and investing in skills. These are the sorts of long-term investments that future generations will thank us for. In my view, the notion of a sovereign wealth fund can go in the safety deposit box for now.

Mr TUDGE
 (Aston) (16:15):  I rise to also speak against this motion. Despite this idea of a sovereign wealth fund gaining some support in influential circles, as the member for Melbourne pointed out, a sovereign wealth fund should be firmly rejected. The fact that a sovereign wealth fund, at its essence, involves keeping taxes higher in order that the government invests in company shares, in itself, should be enough for most sensible people to firmly reject this idea. But, if we look more closely at the evidence, then that should put it beyond any dispute.


To start with, if you want to have a sovereign wealth fund you must have a budget surplus and you have to have paid off your existing debt. In case you have not quite realised, we currently have a $37 billion deficit forecast for this financial year—although that will probably grow by the time we get to the end of it—and we have a net debt of $132 billion. Even if we get to the surplus which the Labor government promises us next year, of $1.5 billion, and similar amounts over the forward estimates, it will take 80 or 100 years before we pay back the debt which this government has accumulated. We have got to get the budget back into surplus and we have got to pay back the debt before we can even think about creating some new financial assets.




Mr Husic:
  When are you going to deliver it?




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mrs D'Ath
):  Order! Allow the member for Aston to be heard in silence!




Mr TUDGE:
  Of course, many people on the other side of the table—and certainly the Greens member—would have us go into further debt in order to acquire shares in Procter and Gamble, and Mobil overseas. I find that a ridiculous proposition. I can understand why the Greens would advocate going into further debt so that the government can purchase shares overseas, but I cannot understand why normally sensible people like Ed Husic or Andrew Leigh would advocate such a proposition. 


Even if no national debt existed, putting budget surpluses in a sovereign wealth fund is a poor idea. If we are honestly interested in intergenerational equity, which is one of the arguments being put forward for a sovereign wealth fund, what we should be doing is ensuring that our policy settings are geared toward maximising GDP. That is what former Treasury Secretary Ted Evans said. And if we want to maximise GDP, which is the best thing that we can do for future generations, we need to lower taxes, we need to invest in productive infrastructure such as our ports, or completing the Melbourne ring road, rather than keeping taxes high in order to invest in foreign owned financial assets.


Of course, as Dr Leigh pointed out, there are times when we do need to increase savings, but now is not that time. We actually have quite a high savings rate in Australia—higher than the OECD average. Of course, if we did want to increase savings, then let us increase private savings rather than public savings. Private savings means that people can invest where they like, so it is good in principle, but it also means that you have the full diversity of the assets invested, so you end up with a better return than if the government were to invest in particular assets.


If we do go down this path of a wealth fund, as has been advocated by the member for Melbourne, then we can soon have the government owning a sizeable proportion of a particular company's share, which means it then has a conflict of interest when it is trying to regulate that company, because it ends up owning 10, 15 or 20 per cent of that company.


The member for Melbourne also raised the issue of using a sovereign wealth fund to address our currency concerns. The member for Mayo addressed this as well. Again, it is not something that a sovereign wealth fund could do unless it were an enormous fund. The Australian dollar is the fifth-most traded currency in the world—$4 trillion is traded in the Australian dollar every single day. Member for Melbourne, do you honestly think that our sovereign wealth fund will be able to manipulate that currency with $50 billion or $100 billion? How big does this sovereign wealth fund have to be? It will be in Procter and Gamble, or Mobil or Philip Morris, or other overseas companies that we will invest our taxes. It is a ridiculous proposition. It is always superficially attractive to have a big pot of money for a rainy day but, at the end of the day, it involves trade-offs, and the trade-off in this case is holding taxes high in order to invest in foreign owned shares and foreign owned financial assets.

"Husic, Ed, MP",ALP,2012-02-28,"



Mr HUSIC
 (Chifley—Government Whip) (16:20):  The member for Aston is normally rather mild and reserved, but the member for Mayo has him all riled up and he has decided that he is going to go out there with both fists swinging on this idea. Amazingly, I think we will find that a number of us have views about whether a sovereign wealth fund should be should be established. I am always happy to examine ideas but in moving down that path I also want to make sure that, particularly where we have to make choices over government spending and where we best direct that spending, we are using funds in the best possible way and seeing whether there are alternatives.


Certainly the whole notion of a sovereign wealth fund, to put it into context, has come about as a result of where we are at with the mining boom and people being concerned, and obviously we are just as concerned within government, that once you extract those minerals that is it. They can be extracted only once and exported only once, and the value generated can occur only once. From our perspective, I can certainly understand conceptually that we would want to maximise that benefit for the country not just for now but into the future, as well as looking at what might be done to ease some of the economic impacts felt elsewhere as a result of the mining boom.


A sovereign wealth fund is not a new concept. It has been around since the 1950s, and there are a variety of different funds that exist in terms of the scope or the way in which they were established. They are either stabilisation funds, savings funds or development funds. People have pointed to the Future Fund. I understood that the purpose of the Future Fund was largely in relation to ensuring that the Commonwealth could meet its liabilities with respect to superannuation for Commonwealth public servants. The Future Fund was never set up in a way to deal with the scope that the member for Melbourne has highlighted, which is to help ensure that we maximise the benefits of the mining boom or to ameliorate some of the impacts of the mining boom on the economy.


From my perspective, we have a form of sovereign wealth fund in place right now. If conceptually people are concerned about maximising the value of the resources boom to the Australian economy, we have taken a step this year, which was opposed bitterly by the coalition—that is, to put in place the minerals resource rent tax. Look at the money that will be gained and what we are looking to do with it. For example, through the revenue generated through the MRRT we are looking to boost superannuation funds. We are looking to ensure that we can propel future investment by adding to the national pool of savings through what we are doing with the MRRT flowing through to superannuation. It is not us as a government necessarily picking and choosing what shares we will expend government revenue on, rather the superannuation funds themselves will do that on behalf of their members. That is what we are seeking to do. We are seeking to ensure, for example, that small business will benefit through what we are doing with the MRRT by ensuring that they are able to write off assets to the value of $6½ thousand, and by helping them we will ensure that we can boost employment prospects for the economic health of those small businesses, 96 per cent of which I understand form the backbone of Australian business today. My particular concern, and this has also been expressed rather forcefully by the member for Mayo and backed up by the member for Aston, is that if we are looking in terms, for example, of stabilising the currency for economic purposes with a concern for what that will do to manufacturing—and I have spoken in this place and elsewhere of my concerns about that—the amount of money required would be huge. We have heard the member for Aston highlight that $4 trillion is traded in the Australian dollar on any given day. It would be of very serious concern, then, if we were to say that we would defer decisions on education, health and other infrastructure because we wanted to put that money into a sovereign wealth fund.


I do not doubt that, from his perspective, the member for Melbourne is motivated by economic concerns about this matter. But if we are to make choices about how we spend this money we do need to think carefully about how we do it and whether or not the money that we invest reaches the intended objective.

"Van Manen, Bert, MP",LP,2012-02-28,"



Mr VAN MANEN
 (Forde) (16:25):  I too rise to speak on the member for Melbourne's motion on the establishment of a new Australian sovereign wealth fund. In essence, Australia already has a sovereign wealth fund: the Future Fund. That was established by Peter Costello and is currently worth some $73 billion. I think that the work we as a coalition government did through the leadership of the Howard-Costello government when we paid off $96 billion worth of Labor debt and built a portfolio of assets in a Future Fund is a tremendous example of how an economy should be properly managed.


Whilst the primary purpose of that fund was to provide unfunded Public Service superannuation liabilities, I think it also provided some sort of model for what we could potentially look at in the future. In September 2011, Sovereign Wealth Funds News listed the Future Fund as the '14th largest sovereign wealth fund in the world'. The Future Fund played a crucial role in helping Australia combat the global financial crisis by providing vital liquidity to our banks in the initial fortnight of the panic on world capital markets, following the collapse of Lehman Brothers.


In principle, I think the idea of a sovereign wealth fund has merit. However, given our current economic position and thanks to the reckless spending and mounting debt under this Labor government, talk of expanding our sovereign wealth resources is purely both academic and premature.


If the Greens were serious about restoring resilience through a fund, they would not have recklessly demanded the establishment of the $10 billion Clean Energy Finance Corporation—the Bob Brown Bank—as a price for their carbon tax support. We have no certainty as to how that money will be spent and what economic return we will get. This fund would be established from borrowed money, which in the first place will put further upward pressure on our already mounting debt and interest rates.


I would like to stress that the views expressed in this place today, whether in support of or against an Australian sovereign wealth fund, will have little impact until a surplus is delivered and we start repaying the debt. I have previously mentioned in this place that under Labor we have seen four of the biggest budget deficits in our history. Labor continue to borrow $100 million per day and, in just four years, Labor have turned a $20 billion surplus into $167 billion in accumulated deficits and $70 billion in net Commonwealth assets into what will be $136 billion of net debt.


Currently, Australians are paying $100 million a week in interest, which is robbing our future generations of their wealth. Our annual interest payment on Labor's debt is some $7 billion a year—equivalent to the cost of seven hospitals or, to touch on a current topic, the funding of our NDIS. The Labor-Greens government cannot handle the budget, so why would we trust them with a national savings vehicle? In the past they have taken advantage of national savings vehicles.


For example, the coalition set up the $2 billion communications fund, where the interest was to be invested in telecommunications upgrades in rural and regional Australia in perpetuity. But that has not occurred because the current government had got their hands on it and milked it. Similarly, money put away in the Building Australia Fund was raided and the education endowment fund has been scrapped.


The temptation for politicians to raid sovereign wealth funds was recently referenced in an article in the Australian, entitled 'Sovereign wealth funds poor value for money'. The author, Adam Creighton, put forward his views, stating that sovereign wealth funds 'ultimately provide a tempting pot of funds for politicians to raid'. We do not need to tempt this government to spend money they should be saving. They are already doing a good job of that themselves. It would be far more productive to concentrate on getting back to surplus rather than establishing another fund. Put simply, we do not need another piggybank full of borrowed funds at risk of being pilfered by this government. We need strong economic policy that will guide us back to surplus. (Time expired)

 (Lyons) (16:51):  On Thursday, 15 September 2011 the House of Representatives Selection Committee report referred the Wild Rivers (Environmental Management) Bill 2011 to the House of Representatives Agriculture, Resources, Fisheries and Forestry Committee for inquiry. The bill was introduced into the House of Representatives on 12 September 2011 by the member for Warringah. The bill is similar to two bills introduced into the House of Representatives in 2010 also by the member for Warringah. The 2010 bill was referred to the House of Representatives select committee of the House of Representatives economics committee for inquiry and report on 17 November 2010. The report of that inquiry was tabled on 12 May 2011. In addition, two similar bills were introduced into the Senate by Senator the Hon. Nigel Scullin. These bills were both referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, which reported on 22 June 2010 and then 10 May 2011 respectively. 


On 24 November 2011 the House of Representatives select committee also referred the 2011 bill to the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs. While recognising that the 2011 bill has been referred to an alternative committee, some members of the committee wish to briefly note the following workability issues in the bill, several of which have already been raised in previous parliamentary inquiries, such as ownership definitions, dispute resolution, employment guarantees and the creation of different tiers of land rights. These were highlighted to the committee. Others felt the bill had been adequately dealt with at committee level. Given the fact that the 2011 bill has now been referred to an alternative committee, the committee has resolved to conclude its inquiry into the 2011 bill with this report. I would like to thank the members of the committee for their work in relation to the inquiry and thank the government officials who briefed the committee on the bill in 2011.

Ms PARKE
 (Fremantle) (16:57):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, I present the committee's report entitled Examination of the annual report of the Integrity Commissioner 2010-11. As a matter of process, I can say at the outset that the committee has found that the annual report is fully compliant with the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006 and regulations as well as with other relevant government requirements. This annual report is the fifth provided by the Integrity Commissioner and covers ACLEI's fourth full year of operation. The Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006, the LEIC Act, requires the committee to examine each annual report and each special report prepared by the Integrity Commissioner and report to the parliament. As there were no special reports prepared by the Integrity Commissioner during 2010-11, the committee focused its examination of ACLEI's fifth annual report on the following: first, on ACLEI's achievements against the performance reporting framework; second, on the direction of ACLEI; and, finally, on certain issues arising from ACLEI's reported performance in 2010-11.


I begin by observing that ACLEI achieved the set performance targets in 2010-11. Nevertheless, the committee observed that the balance between ACLEI's workload and the resources it is given to handle that workload must continue to be monitored. The most significant development in 2010-11 was the inclusion of the Australian Customs and Border Protection Service within ACLEI's jurisdiction. The committee recommended that this occur in its interim report for the inquiry into the operation of the LEIC Act.


In 2010-11 the Attorney-General's Department engaged Mr Peter Hamburger PSM to review ACLEIs capabilities, operating arrangements and resources. Mr Hamburger made three recommendations: government should consider establishing reporting arrangements on the timeliness of ACLEI's assessment process and its coordination with law enforcement agencies; an MOU should be developed between ACLEI and the three law enforcement agencies within its jurisdiction, under which ACLEI would be assured of an acceptable amount of physical surveillance capacity; and an agreement should be secured by which the law enforcement agencies would each transfer a small amount of funds to ACLEI to strengthen its capabilities in areas other than investigation, especially in relation to prevention activities. The committee supports these three recommendations and will monitor their implementation. In the committee's view, the most serious finding of the review was that ACLEI required greater access to high-end investigative capabilities, especially physical and technical surveillance capacity for which it had statutory authority but insufficient logistical capability. The committee congratulates ACLEI on another successful year of operation while recognising that significant challenges remain. These include the ongoing integration of Customs and Border Protection within ACLEI's anticorruption remit, improving the timeliness of assessments and investigations in the face of limited resources and further development of corruption prevention and education programs. 


The committee welcomes the government's announcement on 13 December 2011, made by the then Minister for Home Affairs and Justice, the Hon. Brendan O'Connor, that further funding will be provided to strengthen detection and investigative capability within ACLEI. The committee looks forward to further detail in upcoming budget papers and annual reports. The annual report also notes the establishment of the community of practice for corruption prevention to bring together practitioners from agencies under ACLEI's jurisdiction and the formation of the Australian anticorruption commissions forum, comprising integrity agencies from around Australia. 


I would like to acknowledge that the fifth anniversary of the establishment of ACLEI occurred on 30 December 2011 and that the fifth anniversary of the establishment of the committee occurred the day before yesterday, 26 February. In terms of the ACLEI committee's future work in 2012, the committee is now focusing on its inquiry into the integrity of overseas law enforcement operations. This is an understandably complex and critical area of inquiry and it continues the ACLEI committee's important function in assisting the positive and constructive evolution of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity.


In conclusion, I take this opportunity to thank all my fellow committee members, including of course the deputy chair, Senator Ian Macdonald. I also thank the committee secretariat for their continued hard work in supporting us in our task. I want to particularly thank Dr John Bell, who has been a wonderful secretary to the committee and who will soon be leaving to undertake other responsibilities. The committee has had very high-level professional support from Dr Bell and we will all miss his wisdom and gentle kindness. We wish Dr Bell and his family well for the future. I also would like to congratulate and thank, once again, the Integrity Commissioner for a very good report. Thank you. (Time expired)

Mr CHAMPION
 (Wakefield) (17:23):  We live in a rather tumultuous world, both economically and in civil and military affairs. It seems to me that, in this world, isolation is utterly impossible. It is impossible to wall ourselves off from the troubles of the world and their actions and lack of action, and engagement is the only choice we have. In talking about this parliamentary delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council Europe in Strasbourg and the 57th Annual Session of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, I want to begin by thanking my friend the honourable member for Cowan for his company and for his engagement on this parliamentary delegation. I also thank Richard Selth, who is in the chamber today, who ably organised it for us. What became very apparent as we undertook our duties was that this is a particularly interesting time in the world. Many of the things that we did at the Council of Europe concerned particularly important issues, whether it was listening to Mr Thomas Hammarberg, who is Commissioner for Human Rights of the Council of Europe, talk about the pluralism in media and transparency in media ownership and all the problems that are now occurring in the United Kingdom—I know it is a very big issue—or whether it was listening to Mr Angel Gurria, who is Secretary-General of the OECD, talk about things such as the policies that had to be pursued during the global financial crisis, the need for growth, the desire to bring down deficits and reduce debt-to-GDP ratios while maintaining recovery, having seen the current events in Europe and indeed in Greece.


If there were anything I would like to put to the Federation Chamber it is that isolation is impossible. We simply must engage in these issues because they do affect us here at home. Mr Gurria's address to the council included addressing the terrible issues of unemployment in Europe, particularly youth unemployment, and the shift from lifelong employment to lifelong employability and skills acquisition. There are also many policy issues in there for Australia.


Similarly, with respect to the meeting at NATO, we met with the Romanian Chamber of Deputies. We had some very good meetings with many members of the Romanian parliament. It is fair to say that they encouraged us to establish an embassy and greater relations with Romania. That feeds into some other work I am doing as Chair of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee. We are currently undertaking an inquiry into that matter, so it is an issue that weighs on my mind. We attended the NATO Parliamentary Assembly Committee meetings and several issues were raised there, not least our involvement in Afghanistan, which were particularly important. I took away a lot from Professor Barakat's presentation on post-conflict development of Afghanistan and how much progress has been made on some issues of governance, poverty reduction, security indicators and the like. That was very interesting for me.


It was a very useful parliamentary delegation. It will add to our understanding of the world and, importantly, will add to our understanding of the environment in which our troops operate in Afghanistan. Again, I would say to the public: we live in a tumultuous world. Isolation is impossible and it is not desirable. We simply must engage. This nation must invest in parliamentary delegations and diplomacy generally if we are to have an influence and effect on the world around us.

The delegation presented a great opportunity for me to learn about relevant issues happening in the world. Our first stop was at the Council of Europe in Strasbourg, between 4 and 5 October. Europe has been so completely occupied with the debt crisis and the challenges of the eurozone. This visit allowed the delegation to get a real understanding of the realities and struggles to resolve these issues. As we continue to see to this day that the problems and the focus in Europe remain a high priority for eurozone members, it is hard to see true economic stability being restored in Europe anytime soon. I was able to make a short speech at the Council of Europe, where I stressed the importance of living within one's means. Although I was later congratulated by the Secretary-General of the OECD, Mr Angel Gurria, it did not seem to be greatly appreciated by the majority of parliamentarians there. That is something that I can live with. I should also make mention of the assistance of Ms Joanne Frederiksen, Deputy Permanent Representative of Australia to the OECD, who provided us with good assistance for our visit to the Council of Europe.


The second part of our program was our visit to, and participation in, the 57th annual session of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly in Bucharest from 7 to 9 October 2011. I note the assistance of the Australian Honorary Consul in Romania, Mr George Prelea. He was particularly useful and we were very well looked after. I thank Mr Prelea and his wife for their support and warm hospitality. Having been a major in the Australian Army, it was good to be able to interact with members of parliament from NATO countries and other nations and to hear the opinions and perspectives on matters such as the war in Afghanistan, the NATO members' intervention in Libya and geopolitical developments on the edges of Europe. I would say, from my participation in the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, the conservative political group meeting and at several of the committee sessions, it was fascinating to witness the interaction between nations and political groups. I saw the way in which the Russian delegation had been invited to participate but on all occasions that I witnessed they adopted a critical approach to NATO and strongly pursued their national interests, even when the discussion did not mention them. I certainly discussed my observations with the Liberal Democrat MP from the United Kingdom and the participation of a highly critical Russia was clearly the source of great irritation with NATO member delegates. I also note that the political groups were very keen to ensure that they were well or at least properly represented in the leading positions in each of the committees. There certainly seemed to be a strong alliance of political philosophy that in some cases appeared to transcend national groupings.


I would also take the opportunity to comment on the interactions between NATO members regarding the intervention that saw air strikes on government forces in Libya. This saw the United Kingdom and France supported by the United States on one side, with a block of critical nations on the other including Italy, Germany and Spain. Those nations were quite negative about the intervention and Russia also spoke against self-glorification. As I have already said, I found the interactions at the NATO Parliamentary Assembly fascinating. The importance of working with political friends was clearly evident and important in the multilateral environment. The involvement of Russia and the tolerance of their constant criticism was surprising, and also the way in which geopolitical events were approached and dealt with by the member nations of NATO.


It is my view that the Australian parliament should continue to attend the NATO Parliamentary Assembly so that we can better understand and appreciate the intricacies of Europe. It was a very good and useful experience and others should have the opportunity I have had. Before I conclude I would say briefly on Romania that the hospitality was very great from the members of the Romanian parliament, but it was very clear as well that there were problems with governance and corruption in Romania, which I am sure is distressing to Australians of Romanian descent. I reiterate that it was a great opportunity to attend these assemblies and I congratulate again Richard Selth and Paul Jeanroy and thank them for their efforts for us.


Debate adjourned.

Ms LEY
 (Farrer) (17:34):  I rise to second the motion moved yesterday in the House by the Leader of the Opposition, the member for Warringah, concerning the Fair Work Australia investigation into the Member for Dobell and activities of the Health Services Union. This investigation into the Health Services Union and the member for Dobell has been the responsibility of Fair Work Australia since June 2009. In total it has taken nearly four years so far. The taxpayer is now up for close to $1 million for this inquiry plus further costs with the bringing in of external legal counsel and, as I understand it, accounting consultants as well. Unfortunately there is no end in sight. Despite declaring on 19 October 2011 that the investigation was on track to be completed by the end of that year, acting general manager of Fair Work Australia Bernadette O'Neill has failed to deliver. There has also been a failure to provide a real reason for this remarkable delay, bearing in mind it has far surpassed the Watergate investigation and the Cole royal commission. It is almost a fifth of the time it took to build the Snowy Mountain scheme. The length of time that this investigation has been continuing has been quite plainly ridiculous.


It is about the misuse of funds from some of the lowest paid workers in this country and these are the people who deserve answers as to where their money really went. If indeed it is true that their hard-earned union subscriptions went into the financing of prostitutes, then they should be more than just angry. These people pay their union dues for the union, in turn, to use this for their direct benefit. Certainly no-one would expect that benefit to be the procurement of call girls for the sole entertainment of the union executive or to help mount election campaigns for the aforementioned member for Dobell. I have been a member of the Australian Workers Union in the shearing sheds and I know how much it hurts as a low-paid worker to contribute a substantial slice of your uncertain income to the union. I sometimes did wonder when the union representative pulled up at a remote shearing shed in western Queensland in a very large, white, well-sprung car just how comfortable their life really was compared to mine. At the time I did not mind because I thought they were acting in my interests.


In the context of this debate, Fair Work Australia persists in dragging its heels in this investigation. They are letting down the 70,000 members of the Health Services Union. Fair Work Australia was established by the Rudd-Gillard-Gillard government, and it is meant to be an independent umpire. Yet this so-called 'independent umpire' is unwilling to make the call on the investigation into the member for Dobell. Quite frankly, the only people that this institutional go-slow or blundering administrative competence—you make your pick—benefits is the federal Labor party, enabling them to maintain their wafer-thin hold on power. This is a government that is willing to condone appalling behaviour by all and sundry. It reeks of sheer desperation and even gives the appearance of quite untoward behaviour. If there has not been any interference, perhaps all that this proves is yet another debacle at the hands of our Prime Minister. Fair Work Australia was her personal baby, remember, but it cannot even conduct an investigation in a timely manner. The Gillard government must be held accountable on this matter. As a body established at the request of this government, it bears responsibility. These are incredibly serious allegations and the government needs to provide the Australian public with answers immediately.


They have also been made aware of these allegations into Mr Thomson, as reported in the media. Former industrial registrar Doug Williams confirmed to Sydney's Daily Telegraph that he was telephoned by the Prime Minister's chief of staff, Ben Hubbard, in early 2009 about inquiries into the Health Services Union and Mr Thomson. Quite clearly, the release of emails under freedom of information demonstrates that there was an exchange between Rhys Davies, the press secretary of former Workplace Relations Minister, Chris Evans, and the Fair Work Australia Communications Manager, Judy Hughes, concerning the Thomson investigation. In the exchange of emails Ms Hughes was asked if claims made by the Seven Network that the Labor MP Craig Thomson 'lied to Fair Work Australia' were true. In one of her replies, Ms Hughes sent Mr Davies a draft media statement issued to journalists that said there was no new inquiry into Mr Thomson, and Mr Davies replied, 'Thanks, that's awesome. That should minimise any run it gets in the morning.' We are determined to ensure that the government comes clean, that it releases all the details of all the contact between ministers, Prime Ministers and their officers and Fair Work Australia.


Clearly, the government is reluctant to act. We have seen bullying tactics preventing the Fair Work investigators from answering questions in October estimates. Acting general manager, Bernadette O'Neill, has stated that she did not plan to make public the already finished report, which has found extensive rule breaking in the Health Service Union's Victoria number 1 branch. That is one of the branch investigations. There is also a national investigation. The branch investigation has been completed and we are not to know what information it contains. As far as findings go, we know that an employee of the Australian Government Solicitor received a letter advising of proposed findings back in December 2010. Why then is Fair Work Australia continuing to stall? The coalition's freedom of information request regarding those emails indicated a degree of complicity and that is the reason for the motion and the debate today: because the government has involved itself in an organisation that it claims it has left alone to make an independent decision.


Fair Work Australia has finally conceded that it is considering recommending legal action in relation to its inquiry into the Health Services Union and the allegations that the union's former national secretary and now federal Labor MP, Craig Thompson, misused a credit card provided to him by the owner of a graphic design and printing business—a business, I might add, that receives $680,000 a year to produce ten issues of the Health Services Union newsletter. I produce a number of issues of my electorate newsletter and I have a printing allowance but it beggars belief that $680,000 could be provided to provide ten issues of the Health Services Union newsletter. I do not think its 40-page glossy brochure could possibly attract this sort of real funding. That leads to suggestions that the money is being misused. Whether the provision of credit cards to the member for Dobell and the health service union boss were intended as an inducement in return for this printing business does require investigation. I am not making a statement here that that was the case but it does require investigation.


The recent Senate estimates process saw Fair Work Australia confirm that they had identified 25 possible breaches within the Victorian branch of the Health Services Union alone and nationally the figure would surely be higher. But, despite identifying a plethora of breaches which may in fact constitute criminal offences, Fair Work Australia has refused to meet with the New South Wales police to discuss the investigation. What we need are assurances that the integrity of Fair Work Australia remains intact. This is a body overloaded with former union officials and tightly bound to the Gillard government. It is clear to all and sundry as to why they are reluctant to hand down a verdict. If anyone witnessed this, I did in the painful performance of acting general manager Bernadette O'Neil's in Senate estimates. I had to feel sorry for her while she was delivering the answers that she was forced to deliver in that inquiry.


What is the public supposed to make of the fact that now Fair Work Australia has admitted that it is taking a long time and has invited KPMG to undertake an independent review of its inquiries? The cost of this will be extraordinary. If Fair Work Australia was doing its job it would not need to investigate itself via KPMG. And Ms O' Neil indicated that the KPMG inquiry would be made public but not the Fair Work Australia report into the union and the member for Dobell for fears that the material may be considered defamatory. Since when has the risk of exposing defamatory material stopped us getting at the truth? And that is what the opposition is seeking to do with this debate and this motion: to get at the truth.

Mr STEPHEN JONES
 (Throsby) (17:39):  This is an extraordinary debate being brought before the parliament today. It is a sorry episode in which the opposition seeks to appoint itself as the prosecution, the judge, the jury and—if they get it their way—probably the hangman as well. There are some countries where the legal systems—if you can call them legal systems—afford the government of the day the right to be the prosecutor, the judge, the jury and the hangman. Commonly, we refer to them as dictatorships. In this country we have and respect some things known as the separation of powers and the rule of law. One of the great things about the separation of powers is that we have specialist courts and tribunals whose job it is to hear and test evidence and hand down a verdict. We have specialist prosecuting agencies whose job it is to weigh up whether allegations made against an individual or organisation are worthy of bringing to court and having those allegations tested in court. We have specialist agencies whose job it is to deal with somebody if and when they are convicted of a crime. What we have in this whole passage of events from the opposition is an attempt to use the processes of parliament to afford themselves the right to override those separation of powers to somehow enter into a trial of a person and an organisation by media and by parliament and to completely circumvent the proper role of the tribunals and courts. Deputy Speaker Windsor, I know that from your long history in this House and in the New South Wales parliament you are very familiar with instances where the parliament and the media have been used to usurp the role of courts, to have tried somebody and to have had them sent to their fate only to have, in a short period thereafter, that person or those people completely vindicated by a proper investigation and testing of evidence and of law by a court—in that case, the Supreme Court of New South Wales. 


Let us not go down that sorry path. Let us not go down the path of those opposite using and abusing the processes and privileges of this place to afford themselves the rights and privileges of the prosecutor, judge and jury. Some of the great things about Australia which sets us apart from many other countries in the world is that we believe in the separation of powers, in the right of somebody to be determined to be innocent until proven guilty and in the rights and responsibilities of courts and tribunals to fulfil their statutory duty to properly test allegations when they are made.


The reason that we know that this is nothing more than a political stunt is that those opposite have had contradictory positions when it comes to the investigations of the Health Services Union of Australia. In item six of this motion they are calling on the government to provide an assurance that there has been no political interference in the Fair Work investigation. That statement is one that I am sure all members of this House would be willing to agree to but when you put it alongside statements and the whole process of events that has led to this motion being brought to the House you know that they do not mean what they say. Only a few months ago, we saw those opposite calling on the government to actually actively intervene in the investigation that has been conducted by Fair Work Australia and to do that for nothing more than political reasons. We know that this is a stunt. We know that those opposite see this as an opportunity to use the processes of this place to conduct a trial by media, coming very close to defaming an individual while using the processes and privileges of this place to do and say things that they could not say or do outside the chamber. And that is nothing short of a disgrace.


I suspect that there is another reason why this motion has been brought before the House today and we saw it in the contribution made by the member immediately before me. This is nothing short of a campaign against the institution of Fair Work Australia. The contribution made by the honourable member just now sheds a light on this. The member for Farrer does not believe that Fair Work Australia is an independent institution, despite the fact that the vast majority of its members were actually appointed by the former government when it was in power. They believe that it is somehow a tainted political institution. I can tell you that it is not. It is independent and as long as there is breath in our bodies we will ensure that it remains independent. We will not be part of a long-running campaign by the industrial warriors on those opposite to try and taint, smear and dirty up Fair Work Australia for political reasons. Those opposite are like political moths to the industrial lamp. They cannot help themselves. Whenever they get the opportunity to rush out as proud Work Choices warriors, they are there with their spears in hand attacking all of those institutions. Many of them have spent 15 years attempting to tear them down. We have reinstated them and put some fair dinkum laws in place to protect the rights of workers. Those opposite are now reinstating their campaign to dirty up the institution to pave the way for a reintroduction of their Work Choices style laws and all that they stand for. We on this side of the House stand for an independent tribunal which is able to freely and fairly adjudicate based on a fair treatment of the evidence the disputes and matters that are bought before it, without interference from any of us in this place.


We reject the campaign that is being run by those opposite. We are incredibly suspicious about their motives. As I have said, the clear intent is to ensure that they are able to run a campaign to reintroduce Work Choices style laws. Everything that they can do to dirty up the institutions that have been put in place by the Fair Work Act, they will do and they will use the privileges and processes of this place to do so. We will not be hoodwinked by it.


I say once again—and I will conclude on this point—that there are countries around the world that do not believe in the separation of powers. There are countries in the world that will allow a trial by media. There have been some unfortunate passages of history in this country in which individuals have had their reputations torn down by a trial by media only for it to be found subsequently in a court of law that there was no basis for the allegations. Let us not have this happen again. Let us use the proper authorities. Let us courts and tribunals, exercising their proper rights and fulfilling their proper responsibilities, test the allegations that have been made in the proper way. Let us not go down a path on which we disrespect the importance of the separation of power, the importance of natural justice and the importance of parliament and the tribunals of this country playing their roles without the interference of one in the affairs of the other. Thank you.

"Keenan, Michael, MP",LP,2012-02-28,"



Mr KEENAN
 (Stirling) (17:52):  That was a truly remarkable performance from the member for Throsby. When faced with the allegations that have been put to the member for Dobell on a sustained basis over many years  in this place, outside of this place and in the media, the response of the member for Throsby was to come in and make some inane comments about the separations of powers and then, astonishingly, a return to Work Choices. Let us just go back and recap the reasons we are discussing the behaviour of the member for Dobell. We are discussing the behaviour of the member for Dobell because very serious allegations have been made about him misusing the funds of the union that he was the secretary of, the Health Services Union, which represents 70,000 of the most disadvantaged workers in Australia. Very serious allegations have been made that he abused credit cards issued by the union by using them to pay for electoral and personal expenses. Over $100,000 of cash advances were not accounted for. Perhaps most celebrated of all was the allegation that sexual services were paid for using those credit cards.


These allegations have been denied by the member for Dobell, but never once has he come into this chamber to defend himself from these allegations. The member for Throsby rather astonishingly said that we could not repeat these allegations outside of the chamber. I am very happy to table about 10 or 20 media interviews where all of these allegations have been made outside of the chamber. The member for Dobell has done absolutely nothing to defend himself from those allegations. What he did was take defamation action against Fairfax Press, which was publishing these allegations. He was forced to withdraw that action and incurred significant costs, which were then met by the New South Wales branch of the Labor Party. What we all know—what every single member of this House knows—is that the member for Dobell has not been able to defend himself because he is guilty of these allegations. If he was not then he would come into this House and he would defend himself against them—something he has refused to do on every given occasion, even though the Prime Minister said the he was going to be required to—




Mr Zappia:
  Mr Deputy Speaker, I raise a point of order. In accordance with the standing orders, I find that that is a personal reflection on a member of this House and I would ask the member to withdraw.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Windsor
):  Will the member withdraw?




Mr KEENAN:
  I am happy to withdraw, Mr Deputy Speaker. The point is, if the member for Dobell had nothing to hide in these matters he would walk into this chamber today and he would explain himself. He has been accused of very serious things. There is no better place in Australia to be able to explain yourself than as a member of the House of Representatives. You do not get a better bully pulpit than this to come in and explain your actions. By his refusal to do so I think the Australian people are entitled to draw their own conclusions about what that means.


We do have bodies that are investigating these matters: the Victorian Police and the New South Wales Police. We rightly support their independence to pursue these allegations. What does concern me though is in relation to Fair Work Australia, a body that was tasked with investigating these claims back in 2009. We are now in 2012. I think the Australian people are entitled to ask: why is it taking so long for Fair Work Australia to reach conclusions about these matters? Extraordinarily, Fair Work Australia appearing before this parliament has said that they are at a loss to explain why it has taken so long as well. Until we get that explanation, until Fair Work Australia is able to explain to the Australian people why it is taking well over three years—in fact, this investigation is now into its fourth year—to investigate these claims, then we are entitled to ask what the genesis of this institutional go-slow has been.


Why is it that Fair Work Australia cannot conclude this investigation when I think most of the Australian people would understand that it is a pretty open-and-shut case of malfeasance? If it were not then, as I said, the people who have been accused would be able to defend themselves—and they have been completely unable to do that.


What we do know is that the Fair Work Australia investigation has been ongoing since 2009. It was actually an investigation that was started by the industrial registrar in January 2009. They have repeatedly said at Fair Work Australia that this investigation was going to be concluded, yet, we find that it still remains ongoing. These are very legitimate questions raised in this motion about why it has taken Fair Work Australia so long, and I would urge them to explain to the Australian people why that is. (Time expired)

Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (17:57):  I have only been here for four years, but that was the most disgraceful and disgusting performance I have ever seen by a member in this place. The right to silence is a cherished institution in this place. He has a right to silence. The member opposite has made, in cowards castle, an allegation that a member of this place is guilty of malfeasance. That is exactly what he said in this place, and he also completely denies the separation of powers. Then he wails and whines over there, but the truth is that everyone is entitled to the right to silence in this country and everyone is innocent until proven guilty. We do not have kangaroo courts in this country. I know that the member for Throsby talked about authoritarian regimes but the truth is that that is the case. I remember very well when I was a practicing lawyer in the Brisbane CBD at the height of the Fitzgerald inquiry. I remember distinctly a former National Party Premier of Queensland being asked a question about the separation of powers under cross-examination, and him fumbling and stumbling around, but still in all the separation of powers is absolutely critical.


This motion before this place, shows the depths to which the coalition will plummet. There is the self-righteousness, the sanctimony and the unctuous activity from those opposite, when they know very well that Fair Work Australia has been established properly and that they are undertaking an independent investigation in relation to this matter, and it is the hypocrisy of what they are doing. For example, the inconsistency: one day they say to us that we should be hurrying along Fair Work Australia in their investigation—that we should be giving them a prod along—saying, in effect, that we should interfere. The next day they are saying that we should not be doing that. This motion here in this place talks about wanting an assurance there has been no political interference in Fair Work Australia. They simply cannot have it both ways. They cannot criticise us one day on one thing and another on the next. They cannot come into this place and besmirch members of this House who have been elected by the people. 


I remember back in 2007 when former Prime Minister John Howard was questioned about three MPs and on ABC radio on 7 March, 2007—and he was absolutely right about the three members under investigation—he said: 


But a lot of people who are under investigation end up having nothing to answer for …It's a police investigation and the appropriate thing for me to do is to let the police investigation run its course and then if it is appropriate I will have something to say.


That is absolutely correct. I wish that those opposite who claim that they are standing in the footsteps of John Howard and are following him—treating him as their mentor, their guide and their apostle almost—would follow what he has to say here. I wish they would show some discretion, some integrity and some honesty about this.


This motion really is a terrible distraction from the business of this government and from the business of this place. We have better things to do in this House. We have education reforms and health reforms to talk about. We have infrastructure, road and rail. We have important things that we could do in this place and important things that those opposite should hold us to account. 


Labor has not always been in government; Labor is often in opposition and those opposite are often in government and now they are in opposition. It behoves them—it behoves either side of politics—to hold the government to account, not to engage in gutter tactics in relation to these types of matters. What they are trying to do here is undermine the integrity of Fair Work Australia regardless of the outcome. Why are they trying to do that? Because they are trying to distract from the complete absence, the complete policy vacuum that those opposite have. The Member for Throsby is absolutely right—besmirch a member of this place, besmirch Fair Work Australia and bring back an industrial relations system that they always wanted. They are the architects, apostles and devotees of Work Choices. That is what this is about. It is about the biggest dummy spit you have ever seen in political history, as the Leader of the House has said. On many occasions they have done it. They should hang their heads in shame about this particular matter. (Time expired)

Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (18:03):  I realised I had an opportunity to make a few comments on the Marriage Amendment Bill 2012, brought forward by the member for Throsby, as I understand it. Obviously this is an issue of which there have been a lot of strong opinions passed. Certainly it is the case that my office and email are no strangers to being contacted by those who have these strong opinions. I value the opinions of all those who have contacted me to offer them. As I have said before, I particularly value those who have created something personal. Whilst I still acknowledge the value of those who have sent a formal email through, I do particularly value those who have given their personal perspective on it. I would note that of those who have contacted my office, it remains quite categorical: 1,004 people have contacted my office and expressed a view against same sex marriage; 144 have expressed a view for a change consistent with this bill that is before the House. I know that it is important, particularly for us as members of parliament, that people know who they are voting for and that they know if we say something before an election then we will comply with that. There have been in the past other times where it has been clearly said when an issue comes up that there will be a  free vote on this or that particular matter, but in this case it was very clearly the coalition's policy before the election—in fact, I think it was both sides' pre-election commitment—that there would be no change to the definition of marriage, and we stand by that.


That being said, as we are the party where you can actually have your own ideas and you are actually able to vote contrary to the team if you believe so strongly in that, it is definitely the case that a conscience vote does exist on our side. It always does. We do not get thrown out of our party or disendorsed if we offer a conscience vote or if we believe so strongly in something. We will not just toe the line as others might have to, because if we stand up and we talk about something then it is what we believe in.


The reality is that our side remains opposed to a change in the definition of marriage. I personally opposed a change in the definition of marriage. I value those people that have given me their thoughts on the matter and I have responded to all those people, identifying where we stand and how I will be supporting the party position, because that was the position we took to the last election and we will stand by it. I stand on this bill and I stand against it, and I think that what is required is that we comply with what we said before the election. We will be doing that, unlike others.

"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2012-02-28,"



Mr MURPHY
 (Reid) (18:06):  I do not accept that the move to change the Marriage Act to accommodate same-sex couples is a matter of equality or human rights. This is clearly about same-sex couples being equal to opposite-sex couples with respect to marriage. It is not about equality for all, at least for the moment, since there has never been marriage equality. Legally and religiously, there has never been marriage equality in relation to polygamy, minors, members of the same immediate family and so on. These exclusions result from the nature of marriage as a societal institution that represents, symbolises and protects the inherently reproductive human relationship—whether or not a couple choose to have children. I note also that failure to consummate a marriage is still grounds for voiding or annulling a marriage.


Once marriage is redefined to include same-sex couples then, using the equality argument, there is no moral reason for excluding, for example, polygamy or group marriage. Therefore I believe that dressing up the current campaign as a move for equality is a sleight of hand. In reality, it is a move to change the definition of marriage, which is currently the union of a man and a woman. I believe that redefining marriage will change the meaning of marriage for all Australians. It will weaken the institution and undermine the millennia-long social purpose of marriage. Definitions matter. That is how we interpret and identify reality. I believe it is not permissible to redefine or change the name of something simply to accommodate a particular group's opinion, especially when this would change beyond recognition or define out of existence an established age-old institution.


Nevertheless, I oppose discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Civil partnerships open to both opposite-sex and same-sex couples should be legally recognised, and partners, whether opposite-sex or same-sex, should be entitled to the same benefits and protection of law. Therefore, despite strenuous opposition from conservative constituents in my electorate in 2009, I supported and voted for 85 amendments to federal laws to eliminate discrimination against same-sex couples in areas such as taxation, social security, health, aged care, superannuation, immigration and family law.


Marriage is about love, but not merely love. Marriage is about the particular love between a man and a woman, which is unique. Importantly, opposite-sex union is the only union that is capable of and oriented towards producing children naturally. Marriage as a legal institution directly points this connection to children, to protect the interests of children and keep biological families together. The law recognises what marriage is—namely, the unique sharing by a man and a woman of all aspects of life. However, the purpose of marriage as a legal institution relates specifically to the distinctive biological possibilities of this union. Many people think of marriage as only about love because two partners usually enter into such a special sharing of life with profound commitment and affection. However, if there were no biological consequences of sexual union—if it involved only love and commitment—then society would not need specific laws to recognise this union. Parliaments make laws about matters of public interest, but not about personal feelings such as love or commitment. Governments would not be able to promote marriage as a life-long union if it were just related to such personal issues. People were getting married and forming families long before the rise of nation states. Parliaments have made laws to recognise the existing age-old institution of marriage, not only because it formalises the relationship that produces future citizens but because, as the bedrock of biologically related families, legally binding marriages allow governments to enforce the natural existing responsibilities of parents to care for their children.


People who want to redefine marriage claim that this will affect only a small number of Australians. I believe that the opposite is true. The definition of an institution determines the way society relates to that institution. For example, if there were a successful campaign by non-Indigenous Australians to be recognised as Indigenous by redefining the word 'Indigenous' to include all who express love for and commitment to Australia, the definition of Indigenous Australian would necessarily change for all Australians. It would become a question of people's desires and feelings—that is, love and commitment—instead of the biological definition of Indigenous. The word Indigenous would be redefined to become meaningless. The legal definition of marriage as an exclusive permanent union of a man and a woman shows a clear link to its role in raising children. In fact, in the Marriage Act there is no mention of love or commitment at all. Any attempt by the parliament to recognise love and commitment as being central would go beyond our mandate.


Marriage and children are linked by the reproductive capacity of the union of a male and a female. Undoing this link by redefining marriage to denote the relationship of any two people regardless of whether the relationship is principally reproductive or not would alter the central purpose of marriage to being merely an affirmation of feelings rather than establishing a family. The private purpose of marriage would become its central aspect and the public purpose will become obsolete as it would no longer make sense to say that marriage connects children to their mothers and fathers and those parents to one another.


Marriage was not created by governments, but governments do recognise the institution of marriage as one that serves a public purpose—formalising the existing obligation of biological parents to care for one another and their children. Inserting the definition of marriage as between a man and a woman into the Marriage Act in 2005 merely affirmed what the law has been for Australia's entire history. The existence of a legal definition, however, does not give the parliament the right to redefine marriage, rather it more clearly establishes its role in administering, strengthening and protecting marriage in our nation. Where parliaments have redefined marriage, such as the north east of the United States and in Canada in 2006, there have been ongoing campaigns from other groups of people to have their relationships also recognised as marriages, including groups in support of polygamy and of group marriage. Supporters of group marriage in Australia are now also calling for marriage equality. While I believe the equality argument is spurious, many people would be entitled to ask the so-called marriage equality lobby: why should same-sex couples be more equal than people who want a polygamous or group marriage? Why, then, should we not keep redefining the term to include any meaningful relationship between any number of people who might be in love and committed to one another? By removing the essential aspect of marriage, parliaments would be unjustly discriminating against other people wanting their types of relationships to be redefined as marriage.


Some people argue that without same-sex marriage same-sex couples will not have the same legal rights and benefits that come with being married. However, same-sex couples enjoy every legal right that those in opposite-sex de facto relationships or marriages do under Australian federal laws following the reforms enacted in 2009, which I referred to earlier. Furthermore, every state and territory has some form of formal recognition of people in same-sex partnerships. I have had plenty of feedback from my constituents. I have been visited by people from both sides of the debate. I have met with same-sex couples who support same-sex marriage and other people who oppose same-sex marriage. Some same-sex lobbyists have rung my office to oppose same-sex marriage because they cannot understand how any homosexual would want to embrace a heterosexual institution. Others have rung to support same-sex marriage. I have given them all a fair hearing.


I have received many emails, letters, phone calls and have listened to constituents who have come to my office to express strongly held views. Moreover, I receive hundreds of emails and telephone calls daily covering the many other issues that my constituents say are far more important to them than same-sex marriage. Nevertheless, in relation to same-sex marriage, I carefully monitored the pro-same-sex marriage campaign from GetUp! which took place before the 2011 ALP national conference. Of the 1,250 identical emails I received, only 25 were from constituents living in Reid. That is only two per cent. These 25 were outweighed by telephone calls, emails, letters and personal visits from constituents supporting the institution of marriage. They took the time to compose individual and considered messages rather than simply click on an email link and then quickly move on to something more important to them in their daily lives.


Support for same-sex marriage is, by and large, soft. Most supporters regard it as a matter of minor importance. However, people who oppose the inclusion of same-sex marriage into the Marriage Act see this as a vote changer, and my electorate contains a large proportion of people with that view. There are such electorates immediately to the west of mine in Sydney and in other states who, in my opinion, will reject any candidate who supports a redefinition of marriage. If I am re-endorsed by my branch members as the ALP candidate for Reid, you can be certain that I will campaign all the way to the next federal election defending the age-old institution of marriage, and let the people speak, particularly the silent majority.

Mr SIMPKINS
 (Cowan) (18:03):  I realised I had an opportunity to make a few comments on the Marriage Amendment Bill 2012, brought forward by the member for Throsby, as I understand it. Obviously this is an issue of which there have been a lot of strong opinions passed. Certainly it is the case that my office and email are no strangers to being contacted by those who have these strong opinions. I value the opinions of all those who have contacted me to offer them. As I have said before, I particularly value those who have created something personal. Whilst I still acknowledge the value of those who have sent a formal email through, I do particularly value those who have given their personal perspective on it. I would note that of those who have contacted my office, it remains quite categorical: 1,004 people have contacted my office and expressed a view against same sex marriage; 144 have expressed a view for a change consistent with this bill that is before the House. I know that it is important, particularly for us as members of parliament, that people know who they are voting for and that they know if we say something before an election then we will comply with that. There have been in the past other times where it has been clearly said when an issue comes up that there will be a  free vote on this or that particular matter, but in this case it was very clearly the coalition's policy before the election—in fact, I think it was both sides' pre-election commitment—that there would be no change to the definition of marriage, and we stand by that.


That being said, as we are the party where you can actually have your own ideas and you are actually able to vote contrary to the team if you believe so strongly in that, it is definitely the case that a conscience vote does exist on our side. It always does. We do not get thrown out of our party or disendorsed if we offer a conscience vote or if we believe so strongly in something. We will not just toe the line as others might have to, because if we stand up and we talk about something then it is what we believe in.


The reality is that our side remains opposed to a change in the definition of marriage. I personally opposed a change in the definition of marriage. I value those people that have given me their thoughts on the matter and I have responded to all those people, identifying where we stand and how I will be supporting the party position, because that was the position we took to the last election and we will stand by it. I stand on this bill and I stand against it, and I think that what is required is that we comply with what we said before the election. We will be doing that, unlike others.

"Murphy, John, MP",ALP,2012-02-28,"



Mr MURPHY
 (Reid) (18:06):  I do not accept that the move to change the Marriage Act to accommodate same-sex couples is a matter of equality or human rights. This is clearly about same-sex couples being equal to opposite-sex couples with respect to marriage. It is not about equality for all, at least for the moment, since there has never been marriage equality. Legally and religiously, there has never been marriage equality in relation to polygamy, minors, members of the same immediate family and so on. These exclusions result from the nature of marriage as a societal institution that represents, symbolises and protects the inherently reproductive human relationship—whether or not a couple choose to have children. I note also that failure to consummate a marriage is still grounds for voiding or annulling a marriage.


Once marriage is redefined to include same-sex couples then, using the equality argument, there is no moral reason for excluding, for example, polygamy or group marriage. Therefore I believe that dressing up the current campaign as a move for equality is a sleight of hand. In reality, it is a move to change the definition of marriage, which is currently the union of a man and a woman. I believe that redefining marriage will change the meaning of marriage for all Australians. It will weaken the institution and undermine the millennia-long social purpose of marriage. Definitions matter. That is how we interpret and identify reality. I believe it is not permissible to redefine or change the name of something simply to accommodate a particular group's opinion, especially when this would change beyond recognition or define out of existence an established age-old institution.


Nevertheless, I oppose discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. Civil partnerships open to both opposite-sex and same-sex couples should be legally recognised, and partners, whether opposite-sex or same-sex, should be entitled to the same benefits and protection of law. Therefore, despite strenuous opposition from conservative constituents in my electorate in 2009, I supported and voted for 85 amendments to federal laws to eliminate discrimination against same-sex couples in areas such as taxation, social security, health, aged care, superannuation, immigration and family law.


Marriage is about love, but not merely love. Marriage is about the particular love between a man and a woman, which is unique. Importantly, opposite-sex union is the only union that is capable of and oriented towards producing children naturally. Marriage as a legal institution directly points this connection to children, to protect the interests of children and keep biological families together. The law recognises what marriage is—namely, the unique sharing by a man and a woman of all aspects of life. However, the purpose of marriage as a legal institution relates specifically to the distinctive biological possibilities of this union. Many people think of marriage as only about love because two partners usually enter into such a special sharing of life with profound commitment and affection. However, if there were no biological consequences of sexual union—if it involved only love and commitment—then society would not need specific laws to recognise this union. Parliaments make laws about matters of public interest, but not about personal feelings such as love or commitment. Governments would not be able to promote marriage as a life-long union if it were just related to such personal issues. People were getting married and forming families long before the rise of nation states. Parliaments have made laws to recognise the existing age-old institution of marriage, not only because it formalises the relationship that produces future citizens but because, as the bedrock of biologically related families, legally binding marriages allow governments to enforce the natural existing responsibilities of parents to care for their children.


People who want to redefine marriage claim that this will affect only a small number of Australians. I believe that the opposite is true. The definition of an institution determines the way society relates to that institution. For example, if there were a successful campaign by non-Indigenous Australians to be recognised as Indigenous by redefining the word 'Indigenous' to include all who express love for and commitment to Australia, the definition of Indigenous Australian would necessarily change for all Australians. It would become a question of people's desires and feelings—that is, love and commitment—instead of the biological definition of Indigenous. The word Indigenous would be redefined to become meaningless. The legal definition of marriage as an exclusive permanent union of a man and a woman shows a clear link to its role in raising children. In fact, in the Marriage Act there is no mention of love or commitment at all. Any attempt by the parliament to recognise love and commitment as being central would go beyond our mandate.


Marriage and children are linked by the reproductive capacity of the union of a male and a female. Undoing this link by redefining marriage to denote the relationship of any two people regardless of whether the relationship is principally reproductive or not would alter the central purpose of marriage to being merely an affirmation of feelings rather than establishing a family. The private purpose of marriage would become its central aspect and the public purpose will become obsolete as it would no longer make sense to say that marriage connects children to their mothers and fathers and those parents to one another.

Mr Fletcher
  asked the Treasurer, in writing, on 16 August 2012 :


In respect of Treasury modelling of the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, what (a) was Australia's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2010, (b) is Treasury's base case forecast of GDP growth per annum between 2010 and 2050, and the forecast of GDP for 2050 at this growth rate, in aggregate and per capita terms, (c) is the forecast of GDP growth per annum if a carbon price is introduced, and the forecast of GDP for 2050 at this growth rate in aggregate and per capita terms, and (d) is the expected difference in GDP for 2050 and on a cumulative basis from 2010 to 2050 with and without a carbon price.

"Swan, Wayne, MP",ALP,2012-02-28,"



Mr Swan:
  The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:


The 2008 Government report Australia's low pollution future: the economics of climate change mitigation provided details of modelling of the effect of a carbon price on the economy. One of the scenarios modelled in that report, labelled 'CPRS-5', incorporated information from the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme Green Paper and was calibrated to achieve a carbon mitigation target of 5 per cent below 2000 levels by 2020 and 60 per cent below 2000 levels by 2050.


In 2011, the Government report Strong growth low pollution: modelling a carbon price was released and the core policy scenario contained in that modelling report closely matched the Government's policy as outlined in the Clean Energy Future.


The responses to your questions regarding the 2011 report are:


(a) Australia's GDP in 2010 is estimated to be $1.28 trillion (2010 dollars).


(b) The forecasts of GDP and GDP per capita average growth rate per annum between 2010 and 2050 are 2.7 and 1.4 per cent respectively for the medium global action scenario. GDP in 2050 is estimated to be $3.66 trillion (2010 dollars).


(c) The forecasts of GDP and GDP per capita average growth rate per annum between 2010 and 2050 is 2.6 and 1.3 per cent respectively for the core policy scenario. GDP is estimated to be $3.56 trillion (2010 dollars) in 2050.


(d) This information is published in Chart 5.13 in the SGLP report, available on the Treasury website.
