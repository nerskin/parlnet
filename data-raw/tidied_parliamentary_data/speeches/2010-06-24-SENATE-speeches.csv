"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2010-06-24,"—The Bankruptcy Legislation Amendment Bill 2009 is to streamline the process for fixing and reviewing trustee remuneration in a bankruptcy, strengthen the penalties for offences, abolish bankruptcy districts, increase the minimum debt for a creditor’s petition, increase the stay period following a declaration with intention to file a debtor’s petition and increase the debt income and assets test thresholds for debt agreements.
The bill is intended to streamline and update the regime to reflect the change in the value of money since the last significant revisions in 1996. The most important of these is to increase the minimum amount for which a creditor may petition. In addition, the threshold amount for debt agreements—that is, a voluntary agreement between a debtor and creditors principally available to debtors with low levels of income, assets and debts—has been increased by 20 per cent. The threshold is calculated by reference to the pension rate multiplied by a fixed amount. The multiplier is to be raised from seven to 8.4. A proposal in the exposure draft to significantly reduce the bankruptcy periods was removed following stakeholder protests. The amendments in relation to offences and bankruptcy districts, which are outmoded, are unlikely to be controversial. However, stakeholders have complained that consultation was inadequate in relation to other amendments. The raising of the creditors’ petition threshold will excise a substantial proportion of consumer debt from the bankruptcy regime. Some insolvency practitioners, particularly those with significant practice in arranging debt agreements, have complained that lifting the bankruptcy threshold will reduce the utility of the debt agreement regime notwithstanding the relatively modest increase in the debt agreement limit.
The bill was referred to the Senate Legal and Constitutional Affairs Legislation Committee, which reported on 23 February. The Liberal members of the committee recommended that the original proposal in the draft bill to lift the threshold from $2,000 to $10,000 be changed by lifting the threshold only to $5,000. The threshold of $2,000 set in 1996 would be worth $2,770 in today’s money. The arguments in favour of a fivefold increase have clearly not been substantiated. As a compromise, an increase to $5,000, which the government amendments secure, is more balanced and more broadly in line with indexation. There was evidence before the committee that the stay period of 28 days was too long. A 21-day stay period would grant debtors sufficient time to consult with financial advisers and reorganise their affairs without unduly prejudicing the rights and interests of creditors. The government has also conceded that point raised by Liberal senators on the committee.
Finally, any increase in the eligibility threshold for debt agreements would not be justified until the findings of previous impending reviews of the regime have been taken into account. A review is due to be undertaken in mid- to late-2010 and the proposed amendments in relation to that matter are premature. I welcome the fact that the government has also yielded to the views of the Liberal senators on the Senate committee that these amendments should be deferred pending the completion of those reviews. In the circumstances, and with the three amendments—that is, lowering the increase in the threshold from $10,000 to $5,000, shortening the stay period from 28 days to 21 days and deferring consideration of the debt agreements provisions until the completion of the reviews I have mentioned—the coalition supports the bill.",SENATE,<title>BANKRUPTCY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2010-06-24,"—I thank the opposition for indicating their support. This is non-controversial legislation. It aims to modernise Australia’s personal insolvency system and, in particular, provide debtors with overwhelming debts a more realistic opportunity to obtain advice and consider all options before contemplating bankruptcy.

"Ronaldson, Sen Michael",LP,2010-06-24,"—I rise to speak on the Trade Practices Amendment (Infrastructure Access) Bill 2009. The objective of this bill is to minimise delays in decision making under the National Access Regime. The National Access Regime provides a mechanism for business operators to be granted access to privately held infrastructure which cannot be reasonably duplicated by a competitor. The regime provides a mechanism for access to privately held, nationally significant infrastructure where two parties cannot reach an agreement on its use.
Under the Howard government, COAG agreed to introduce the requirement that regulators will be bound to make regulatory decisions within six months. Also, where a merits review is provided for, reviews are to be limited to the information submitted to the original decision maker. This bill gives effect to the amendments agreed to by COAG.
The amendments to infrastructure access are welcomed by the coalition, as they will encourage competition in all sectors that require access to privately held infrastructure of national significance. Consequently, the coalition supports the bill, which will result in a more effective and efficient market arrangement.",SENATE,<title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (INFRASTRUCTURE ACCESS) BILL 2009</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,3,1

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2010-06-24,"—I rise to speak very briefly on the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Television) Bill 2010 and to thank the clerks for keeping us on track this morning. The bill is largely positive. It seeks to ensure that some quarter of a million households in some of Australia’s more remote areas that currently cannot receive digital television terrestrially will receive substantially the same content via satellite.
However, as mentioned in our additional comments in the committee report on the bill, the Greens were quite concerned that open narrowcasters, such as the publicly funded National Indigenous Television, and other community broadcasters may find themselves unable to get access to the new satellite platform despite the fact that it is being funded by the public purse to the tune of $40 million per year. The government have assured us that they have done everything they can to address this issue, including an amendment that ensures that open narrowcasters and community broadcasters will be able to be received on the same reception equipment as the commercial and national broadcasters rather than being condemned to obscurity on disused equipment. However, the government have advised us that there is a legal impediment to giving open narrowcasters and community broadcasters the kind of legislated guarantee that they are looking for that they will not be excluded from the new platform by the joint-venture company that will be running it—as I remind the chamber—at taxpayers’ expense. Nevertheless, the government have given us some assurances that go some way towards addressing our concern for these very important and very independent players in the Australian media landscape.
To put it on the formal record, once other senators have spoken, I ask the minister to confirm for us the following four things: firstly, that there is a legal impediment to providing a legislated guarantee that all open narrowcasters and community broadcasters will be able to access the new platform on fair and non-discriminatory commercial terms and, secondly, that the government’s amendment will mean that open narrowcasters and community broadcasters will be able to be received by the same reception equipment as the commercial and national broadcasters, including by the smartcard and subscriber management system, by dealing solely with the satellite owner, Optus. This is quite important. They will not need to deal with VAST at all, although that is up to them if they so choose. I ask the minister to confirm, thirdly, that the funding agreements prevent VAST from discriminating against access seekers or blocking their access and, fourthly, that, if ACMA does not voluntarily take action, the minister intends to use his powers under the government’s amendment and under the existing part 9B of the Broadcasting Services Act to ensure that ACMA does in fact ensure that the domestic reception equipment cannot exclude narrowcasters and community broadcasters, nor can the electronic program guide subscriber management system or smartcard.
In closing, I thank the minister for bringing this legislation forward—I think it is important and timely—and I thank his staff for the constructive way in which they engaged with the Australian Greens in negotiating this bill through the Senate.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Cormann, Sen Mathias",LP,2010-06-24,"—The Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Television) Bill 2010 is yet another case study of what an incompetent government the Rudd-Gillard Labor government have been over the last three years. They promise the world and deliver next to nothing. They do not think things through. They have to organise things at the last minute. There is mismanagement, failure and incompetence wherever you look. This legislation, which of course follows a grandiose promise made by Senator Conroy in January this year that the government would fund a new satellite service to bring digital television to all Australians who cannot adequately receive terrestrial digital television services, was introduced by the government only in March. And here we are, with less than one week to go before the digital switch-over in Mildura, on the last day in parliament, and the government have to fix up the stuff-ups in their original legislation, which was introduced less than three months ago.
Now we understand that perhaps members, senators and ministers of the Rudd-Gillard Labor government have been somewhat distracted. But even this week the government has been all over the place. On late Tuesday afternoon we were asked if we could deal with this the next morning. When we turned up in the Senate this urgent, important legislation that desperately needed to be passed had been prioritised way down at No.9 on the legislative agenda that day, which meant that there was absolutely no chance that we were ever going to deal with this legislation.
The government has now put forward nearly 40 pages of amendments to a piece of legislation they introduced only in the middle of March. We will support most of those amendments. We have had discussions with the government and it has conceded that some of the amendments are not as time critical as might have been initially claimed and those amendments have been removed.
I will pick up on one area of amendments: the captioning and content requirements on digital multichannels. Under the Broadcast Services Act broadcasters are currently required to apply the full captioning and content requirements to all of the digital multichannels after switchover has occurred in their licensed area. However, because regional broadcasters switch over earlier than metropolitan broadcasters, the obligation will be imposed on regional broadcasters before those metropolitan broadcasters, which will have major consequences for regional broadcasters as they source their programs from metropolitan markets.
Why didn’t anybody think of that before they introduced the original legislation? If this is a problem which pops up at the last minute—with one day to go and less than a week to go before the switchover in Mildura—how many other problems will be discovered on 1 July when Senator Conroy is going to be in Mildura pressing the button, as he has been telling us so frequently here in this chamber?
This is non-controversial legislation and we have been facilitating along every step of the way to get this legislation passed very quickly. It passed very quickly though the House of Representatives. It took the government a very long time to bring it to the Senate for us to deal with it. Clearly, Senator Conroy was struggling in his negotiations with his own colleagues to get appropriate priority for this particular bill, which is why we are dealing with this bill so late in the piece.
I want to draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that the amendments that were originally circulated—which related to the restack of digital channels to achieve the so-called digital dividend—have been withdrawn by the government, so we are led to believe, as will amendments 58 and 59 relating to an exemption for broadcasters from converting certain terrestrial sites to digital.
We are not making a judgment or a comment on the merits or otherwise of those amendments, but our view is that, given the rushed process that we are forced to go through on this occasion, those amendments warrant some further scrutiny and exposure to proper process—something that this bad and incompetent Rudd-Gillard Labor government does not know much about.
In concluding my contribution to this bill, there are examples of failure, incompetence and mismanagement right across the Rudd-Gillard Labor government. This is just one small example of how a lack of proper process and thinking things through leads to you dealing with things at the last minute and trying to fix things up at five minutes to midnight. We are helping to facilitate this process here today because we do not want the good people of Mildura to be caught up in the middle of the incompetence and the mess generated by Senator Conroy on this occasion.
My message to the people across Australia is this: if you want a return to good government then vote for the coalition at the next election. Only the coalition will deliver good government after the next election. If you want the continuation of the bad government that you have had over the last three years, you might want to consider supporting a Gillard Labor government at the next election. Of course, I hope the people of Australia have the good sense to vote for good government at the next election.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2010-06-24,"—I give my support to the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Television) Bill 2010 but I would like to put the government on notice about some concerns I have regarding its implementation. Television has become more than a form of entertainment. I note that the government has allocated some $400 for eligible households to subsidise the installation of equipment needed to receive a digital signal in black spots that cannot receive terrestrial digital reception.
I have concerns that this may not be enough to cover costs in regional and remote areas, including in my home state of South Australia—although I acknowledge that the government has included increased subsidies for pensioners and other low-income groups. However, I encourage the government to monitor the subsidy as closely as possible. There is some uncertainty about which areas will need satellite equipment and I call on the government to make sure the subsidy is appropriately scrutinised.
I am also concerned that some people may not realise that they are living in a black spot and need satellite equipment to receive the digital signal until it is too late because digital and analog signals are not being broadcast simultaneously in black spot areas. There is also the issue of households that may not receive all the available channels despite having satellite reception. While I support the bill, I call on the government to act quickly if and when problems arise, and I seek their undertakings on this.
Television has become an important tool of communication in modern Australian society, and families and individuals should not be excluded from easy access to this tool of communication simply because of where they live. I believe the switchover to digital is a good thing and will open up a whole range of broadcasting opportunities. I acknowledge that there are some concerns about how the government has decided to deal with this problem; however, at this stage I believe it is important to begin implementing the new system and ensuring appropriate safeguards are in place. I believe digital broadcasting is the future but as we move into the future we must make sure that we do not leave some people in the past.",SENATE,<title>BROADCASTING LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (DIGITAL TELEVISION) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,4,1
"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2010-06-24,"—I thank senators for their contributions to this important piece of legislation, the Broadcasting Legislation Amendment (Digital Television) Bill 2010. I place on the record the issues raised by Senator Ludlam. I note those concerns and his understanding of the issue relating to the amendment he sought is correct. I am pleased to offer the government’s assurance that we will continue to monitor provisions for access to the platform by community and narrow-cast broadcasters, and we specifically confirm the four points he raised in his contribution.
This bill introduces a legislative framework for the implementation of the new satellite service to bring digital television to all Australians who cannot adequately receive terrestrial digital television services. The government are committed to improving the choice and quality of digital television services for viewers in regional and remote Australia as we move towards digital switchover. For the first time, the bill and its amendments will provide broadcasters with the opportunity to deliver, over time, the full suite of free-to-air digital television services to every viewer in Australia, wherever they live. I commend the bill to the Senate.

"Macdonald, Sen Ian",LP,2010-06-24,"—I am conscious of the need for speed in dealing with these very important bills, but regrettably I will have to take just a few minutes to put on record the coalition’s position in relation to the Excise Tariff Amendment (Aviation Fuel) Bill 2010 and the Customs Tariff Amendment (Aviation Fuel) Bill 2010.
This is important legislation. Aviation safety, to which this legislation relates, is also very important. But the government, as with all things aviational, seems to treat it as an afterthought. The government has become recognised for its lack of any real consultation with the industry in relation to aviation matters. The passage of this legislation—its introduction and the way it is being rushed through the Senate on the last day of what will be the last sitting of this parliament, one would think, after the events of this morning—is typical of the Labor Party’s inability to manage anything in government, particularly the safety of our airways.
Because of the lack of consultation with the industry and because of the cavalier way in which the minister and the government treat aviation safety, the coalition quite rightly wanted this to be looked at by a Senate committee, and I am delighted that Senator Back and Senator Colbeck, as part of the committee, looked very carefully into the legislation and came up with a number of recommendations. Whilst the coalition does not like to increase any aviation taxes, in the end we thought that in the interests of safety we should allow this bill through subject to some very strict requirements, that key performance indicators are adopted by CASA. The committee recommended and the coalition supports that CASA must consult more with its clients and improve its own level of efficiency. The organisation—that is, CASA and its staff—must develop these key performance indicators and measure its own performance.
The coalition, whilst not opposing this legislation today, will be questioning CASA at Senate estimates and on other occasions about how they are using the extra funding provided by these bills. Effectively, we want to make sure that CASA are effective in their expenditure and that they enter into meaningful discussions with the industry and make sure that the things they do are talked through with industry.
Industry are, in fact, the best people to advise on the safety of our skies. There is nothing more important to the industry than safety; yet the government and CASA seem to ignore them and treat them as some aliens when it comes to these questions. If in this instance the industry had been more involved by the government in these issues, the whole thing would have gone through much smoother and much more effectively and we would not be rushing it through in a couple of minutes on the last day of sitting in this parliament.
There are a lot of complaints about CASA. We know they have a difficult job and an important job, but the way they interact with their clients is very, very important. From time immemorial we have had those complaints, and they seem to be on the increase again. We need to ensure that CASA and the government, for as long as it remains the government—and, after today, you would think that would not be very long—or even an incoming coalition government are aware that parliament will be looking at CASA’s expenditure and will be looking at their consultation with industry, and their ability to work with industry rather than against industry.
These bills, as we know, increase the excise levied on fuel by 25 per cent, and the funds raised from that increase are to be allocated to CASA to enable them to recruit new staff and to expand their surveillance activities. I understand that, if this legislation is not passed, 50 existing CASA inspectors will be put off in the next couple of weeks. Of course, one of the reasons that we are letting this through is to provide money so that that does not happen. Some of the money raised by this tax increase will go towards CASA to clear up a backlog of regulatory reforms.
The way in which these increases in levies are calculated has been very clearly enumerated by the shadow minister, Mr Truss, in the other place. So, for brevity, I will not go through the details, except to indicate that not all aviation fuel is subject to excise. The military, for example, are not charged excise on aviation fuel. Importantly, under international treaties, aviation fuel on international flights is also exempt. So it is rather ironic that, while these levies are for safety principally on international routes, it is actually the domestic aviation sector that is paying the levies to ensure safety.
A lot of issues were raised by the committee—and, again, I thank my colleagues on the committee for their careful inquisition into all aspects of this. I know the committee and the airline industry were shattered by the aggressive approach taken by government senators on this committee. Some of the airline operators were quite amazed at the vehemence of attacks by Labor senators—for example, saying, ‘Why didn’t you read the budget papers and so something about this before we got to the committee hearing?’ The people they were talking to belong to an association with one or two employees, who are not in a position to trawl through every line of the budget to try to look at these things. If the minister and the government had taken the time to bring the industry in, had taken them into their confidence to look into these issues and had worked with the industry rather than against them, the whole passage of this legislation would have been much smoother.
The industry was surprised when this came in, in spite of claims by the government. There is no reference in the white paper to an impending increase in the excise on aviation fuel. As I mentioned, the government had not contacted any aviation industry stakeholders on this issue before introducing these bills. It is the same with that disallowance motion that we dealt with last week, which I think we disallowed yesterday—if not, it will be disallowed later today when the government finishes speaking on it. Many in the aviation industry found out about the excise increase when they were contacted by Mr Truss for their opinion on this. Some of them were not even aware of this. That shows the lack of consultation by this government, which is renowned for its lack of consultation, its mismanagement and its lack of understanding of any business principles whatsoever.
Of course, today we seem to have gone out of the frying pan and into the fire when it comes to the leadership of government. We know that the gang of four have been making decisions that have been disastrous for Australia—the insulation fiasco, the ETS fiasco, the mining tax fiasco. All of those things were determined by the former Prime Minister, the current Prime Minister—or about to be the current Prime Minister, I think—Mr Swan and Mr Tanner. So things will not change unless we change the government—and, hopefully that will happen. One of the reasons that the government must change is that this government simply has no idea of good business principles, good management and how to consult and deal with the industry it is trying to administer.
There are many other issues I want to raise, but time is not going to allow me. I do just mention that maintaining Australia’s reputation for safe skies is important and ensuring our top level status with the International Civil Aviation Organisation—ICAO—and with the American Federal Aviation Authority is something that everyone in this parliament and the industry supports. Whilst this is all related to maintaining those ratings, the minister did not mention that at all in his speech. He simply spent his speech trying to create confected outrage because the opposition and the industry actually wanted to have a look at what this bill was all about.
In spite of our concerns and lack of consultation, and in spite of the very aggressive way in which Labor senators attacked the industry at the committee, the coalition will, in the interests of safety and in the interests of allowing CASA to be properly resourced to ensure that Australia maintains its reputation for safe skies, not be opposing this legislation in the Senate. The aviation industry is made up of very reasonable people. They are all willing to pay their way, but they quite rightly expect to be treated fairly rather than arrogantly and in a bullying manner by a government that is renowned for that. Methinks it will get worse with recent happenings in the Labor Party.
In concluding, I make it clear to the government and the aviation industry that the coalition will not be agreeing to any further increases in this excise unless CASA is able to clearly demonstrate that it is delivering better results. As I have indicated, for this government—as long as it remains—and for an incoming coalition government, we will be carefully watching CASA to ensure that they get key performance indicators in place and that they do measure their performance and actually work with the industry in the interests of safety in our skies, which is of paramount importance to all of us and particularly to the aviation industry itself.",SENATE,<title>EXCISE TARIFF AMENDMENT (AVIATION FUEL) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,5,1

"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2010-06-24,"—I rise to speak on the Tax Laws Amendment (2010 GST Administration Measures No. 3) Bill 2010. I note at the outset that this week marks 10 years since the introduction of the goods and services tax. The Hansard from the other place will show that the member for Griffith referred to that day as ‘fundamental injustice day’, but I suspect that there may be another day that now figures in his mind under that particular description. In noting that, I obviously acknowledge that there is a very human dimension to the events of this morning on the other side of this building. I think we are all keenly aware of that.
This bill seeks to simplify and streamline the administration of the GST. Schedule 1 amends the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 to make the supply of goods transport services in Australia GST-free if that supply is made as part of the international transport of goods to a nonresident who is not in Australia. Schedule 1 also changes the liability for paying GST on the transport of goods within Australia where that transport is part of the international transport of imported goods from the transport service provider to the importer of the goods. The amendment will mean that importers will add the cost of domestic transport into the value of taxable importation used to calculate GST liability on importation and will remove the GST liability on the supply of domestic transport services made to a nonresident. I can tell by your nodding, Madam Acting Deputy President Cash, that I did not need to say that; you knew that already.
Schedule 2 of this bill amends the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 to ensure that global roaming telecommunication services remain GST-free. The measures contained in schedule 2 were initially announced by the former government, and the former government announced in December 2006 the intention to clarify the law to maintain the intention that suppliers of global roaming telecommunications services would remain GST-free.
There was a requirement for clarification in this area of GST law, because a tax ruling by the Australian tax office cast doubt on the treatment of such suppliers. These suppliers were always intended to be GST-free, in accordance with Australia’s obligations under the international telecommunications regulations. The former coalition government began consultation with the telecommunications industry to ensure the amendments were properly targeted. The current government confirmed their intention to continue with the amendments in the 2008-09 budget.
Schedule 3 contains further amendments relating to third-party payments. It amends the A New Tax System (Goods and Services Tax) Act 1999 to allow entities to make appropriate adjustments where the entities are members of the same GST group, GST religious group or GST joint venture. Whenever there is a GST bill in this chamber, I am fondly reminded of a previous time where issues of what was subject to GST and what was GST-free occupied a fair amount of time.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2010-06-24,"—I rise to speak on the International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2010. The coalition supports the International Monetary Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2010. This bill amends the International Monetary Agreements Act 1947 to allow Australia to accept the changes to the New Arrangements to Borrow adopted by the executive board of the IMF on 12 April.
On 2 April 2009, the G20 countries agreed to increase the level of finance available to, and the number of members involved in, the IMF’s New Arrangements to Borrow. The New Arrangements to Borrow is a credit arrangement between the IMF and 26 members and institutions to provide supplementary resources to the IMF in times of economic turmoil.
The former Treasurer, Peter Costello, worked to establish this mechanism, which came into effect on 17 November 1998 and has been renewed twice, most recently in November 2007. Australia has supported these arrangements since that time, and that support is not wavering today at all. On 12 April this year, the executive board of the IMF approved changes to the new arrangements to increase the finances available and to make the system more flexible. This decision resulted in a tenfold expansion of the resources available.
This bill will increase the credit line in the IMF’s currency of special drawing rights. Australia’s potential exposure will be approximately $7.3 billion at today’s exchange rate, and one should note that at this point in time Australia’s gross borrowings are in excess of $147 billion and heading very quickly to $150 billion as a result of extremely bad management by the current Labor government, which, for all intents and purposes, seems to be in a state of turmoil. Should the IMF access this credit—and we hope it will not have to—the loan would have to be repaid in full with interest in five years. No doubt, Australians would have to acknowledge that they would most likely be going overseas to borrow this money to lend back to overseas.
The changes to the new arrangements also include changes to the number of participants in the mechanism. China, Russia, India, Brazil and nine other countries will now be involved in the new arrangements. In terms of flexibility, the changes require a large majority of participating members to agree before the New Arrangements to Borrow can be activated. The successful passage of this bill would mean that Australia will be supporting the New Arrangements to Borrow and therefore would provide the consent required by the executive board of the IMF to activate the changes to the terms and conditions. This bill will also confirm Australia’s commitment to that G20 agreement, as well as its strong and ongoing support of the IMF.
The coalition acknowledges that the participants at the G20 meeting that is scheduled have lately changed—as of this morning—and we acknowledge that the current turmoil and pandemonium that is apparent in the Australian Labor Party is having effects on how people perceive Australia. The sooner Australia can settle down and get itself good government, the better it will be for all of us.",SENATE,<title>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY AGREEMENTS AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,9,1

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2010-06-24,"—I rise to speak on the National Health Amendment (Continence Aids Payment Scheme) Bill 2010. The National Continence Management Strategy was established in 1998 by the coalition government to provide funding to research and service development initiatives aimed at prevention and treatment. This affects primarily the Ageing portfolio but also involves the disability portfolio. The Continence Aids Assistance Scheme provides a payment to assist eligible people who have permanent, severe incontinence to meet some of the costs of their continence products. In February 2007, the Continence Aids Assistance Scheme was expanded to include people aged five to 15 years and 65 years and over. In the May 2007 budget the scheme was further expanded from 1 July to include anyone over the age of five years with a permanent cause for their incontinence with either a neurological or non-neurological cause for their conditions.
In the 2009-10 budget the government announced that from 1 July 2010 it would replace the Continence Aids Assistance Scheme with the continence support payment. This change is a savings measure of $10.7 million. Under the new scheme eligible people will instead receive a payment as a contribution towards the cost of products. The disability sector has expressed concerns that the new scheme may incur delivery costs, as under the current scheme there are no delivery costs. It is understood that the increased competition will ensure that free delivery will likely be offered as an incentive to purchasers. This is a view that has been put forward by the Continence Foundation of Australia. However, the coalition is yet to be convinced that this will occur, and we will be watching the rollout of this program. There is also concern that the government may reduce or change eligibility at 30 June 2011. There is also some concern that the government has not done the best job in communicating this change to recipients of the scheme, notwithstanding the distribution of an information kit.
I make two quick points in relation to that. We are trying to claw back $10 million at a time when this government is wasting billions and billions of dollars on pink batts and, of course, the worst offending scheme—the $16.2 billion waste of funds for the Julia Gillard memorial halls. Here we are taking money away from this scheme for people with continence problems, affecting our most aged and frail and people with disabilities. How typical that we will now be looking to save this sort of money when we have wasted so much money on all sorts of reckless spending. I place those comments on the record.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2010-06-24,"—I rise to speak on the Corporations Amendment (Corporate Reporting Reform) Bill 2010. This bill aims to improve Australia’s corporate reporting framework by reducing red tape and regulatory burdens on companies, altering disclosure requirements and implementing a number of other refinements to the framework. Reducing the regulatory burden is something the coalition passionately progressed in government and supports in opposition. It is the coalition’s ideal to make sure that small business, especially, is not encumbered with onerous reporting requirements.
This bill contains four main measures that I will briefly mention. First, it streamlines the reporting requirements imposed on companies limited by guarantee. Companies limited by guarantee will no longer be required to distribute an annual report; instead they will be required to write to members, informing them that an annual report has been prepared and how they can obtain it. Hopefully, this will even have consequences in reducing greenhouse gases. Companies limited by guarantee will also be prohibited from paying dividends, because these companies almost exclusively consist of non-profit organisations. The government wishes to make it clear in the legislation that this type of company structure is not suitable for dividends to be paid. Reflecting industry concerns, the government has supported a coalition proposed amendment to insert a grandfathering clause which will exempt these types of currently operating companies limited by guarantees from being forced to restructure.
Second, this legislation streamlines how parent entities are treated for the purposes of reporting. Third, these measures clarify the treatment of dividends by allowing a company to pay a dividend where the company assets exceed its liabilities immediately before the dividend is declared and where net assets are sufficient for the payment of the dividend. The coalition notes the concerns from company groups such as the Australian Institute of Company Directors, which thinks a profit based test and these amendments today are still too restrictive.
Further, other groups remain concerned that small proprietary companies who currently have no legal obligation to prepare audited accounts will have to apply accounting standards to determine the company’s net asset position prior to the payment of a dividend. The potential application of accounting standards to determine net assets requires the understanding of how to apply a two-inch thick book of accountancy standards of which I am very aware, having made a little bit of money applying them for people. None of those entities operating as small companies in Australia will understand it without paying money to advisers like the good accountants, of which I am a member as a fellow of the Australian CPAs. It will be a tremendous cost burden to the sector. I must note that accountants prefer not to indulge in excessive work for no real purpose but to merely impose new regulatory guidelines on private companies which generally have a limited use for the report and in which the number of people who have access to the report can find out the details by a more direct purpose than total reliance on the report.
While this legislation does allow more flexibility for determining dividend payments, it would be useful for the government to review how the measures operate and, in effect, reassure small proprietary companies that they will not have an additional burden placed on them. Finally, the legislation allows an entity to vary the length of a financial year subsequent to restarting a 12-month reporting requirement. The coalition supports this bill but notes the concerns and its aims to reduce compliance burdens placed on industry. I commend the bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>CORPORATIONS AMENDMENT (CORPORATE REPORTING REFORM) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,11,1

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2010-06-24,"—I rise to speak on the Financial Sector Legislation Amendment (Prudential Refinements and Other Measures) Bill 2010. The objective of this bill is to amend a number of acts, including the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998, to improve Australia’s crisis management and prudential framework. The bill makes a number of small amendments to APRA’s preventative powers, APRA’s correction powers, APRA’s and the ATO’s investigation powers, APRA’s failure management powers, the Financial Claims Scheme and the financial sector levies.
The reforms were announced by the minister in January this year, and the legislation follows a public consultation period with the industry. The measures will commence 28 days after the bill receives royal assent. The legislation is supported by the opposition. The exposure draft consultation process allowed the Treasury to address small technical concerns, and the legislation is now broadly supported by stakeholders in the financial service sector. The bill amends a number of acts to improve Australia’s prudential framework by introducing a number of small measures that will improve the ability of the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority to manage Australia’s financial institutions during a crisis.
The bill contains several main areas of amendments. Firstly, the legislation will strengthen APRA’s power to prevent prudential concerns from arising. Secondly, the bill will amend the Financial Sector (Collection of Data) Act 2001 to allow more flexibility in the financial data collection and publishing regime of APRA. Thirdly, the legislation will amend the financial sector levies framework, which will improve the methodologies governing the determination of levies. Finally, the bill will amend the Financial Claims Scheme to improve the scheme’s operation and to expand APRA’s administration of the scheme. APRA will be able to determine the rate of interest that applies to protected accounts for the purposes of determining entitlements under the Financial Claims Scheme when APRA considers that the rate of interest is not certain.
The bill considered today allows APRA to deliver a more direct response to turmoil in global and Australian financial markets. It is appropriate that the intervention powers be taken out of the hands of the Rudd Labor government—but we think that might have already been done; we think it might now be the Gillard Labor government—and given to market experts at APRA. The government caused chaos—and we know what that looks like; we had a good show of it last night—in the market through its bungled bank guarantee scheme.
The coalition supports this bill. The bill improves Australia’s prudential framework by providing some measures allowing APRA to be more responsive to market fluctuations and financial services. I note that, even during the drafting of this speech, so many things have changed around here as this place has become ‘Pandemonium Palace’ but, in trying to get some normality into the operation of business here, I commend this bill to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (PRUDENTIAL REFINEMENTS AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,12,1

"Ludlam, Sen Scott",AG,2010-06-24,"—I will make some brief remarks on the Veterans’ Affairs Legislation Amendment (2010 Budget Measures) Bill 2010 and related bill. Veterans of British atomic weapons testing that occurred in Australia between 1952 and 1963 at Maralinga, Emu Field and the Monte Bello Islands have been calling for compensation for a very long time. Some of them have joined a class action in Britain now that the EU high court has ruled that they deserve a day in court so that they can make their case.
Former opposition Labor spokesman, now Minister for Veterans’ Affairs, Alan Griffin, acknowledged, during the 2006 election campaign, that Australian members of the armed services were used as guinea pigs in its tests and that the strategic ambitions of the UK were given priority over the safety and wellbeing of people that the Australian government should have been protecting. That was a very clear acknowledgment of responsibility and perhaps even liability. The bills we are debating today address the neglect that these people have endured for decades. Of course, the Greens welcome this. I add my comments to those of Senator Parry that these bills have been held up, for some reason that we simply do not understand, in the House of Representatives. We believe that the compensation is clearly insufficient but it is welcome that these bills are with us today.
We believe that given these people were exposed to ionising radiation and that there are severe health impacts arising from this, they should get full comprehensive health care, in particular at a gold card standard, as many of their advocates have been claiming. I understand that in this legislation as it is drafted there is no automatic access to the gold card for British nuclear test participants. However, if they become eligible for a disability pension of a rate equal to or greater than 100 per cent of the general rate, my understanding is that, as the bill is written, they will receive a gold card. Widowers of nuclear test veterans and participants who become eligible for a war widow or widowers pension will receive a gold card.
The Greens believe that it is not too much to ask to simply extend this protection further and extend the gold card as a matter of routine to these participants in the tests. There is strong evidence internationally of genetic effects of nuclear tests on children and grandchildren of those exposed, that the damage wrought by ionising radiation affects the very DNA that makes us human, and that these effects are carried on through the generations. For families and particularly the children of nuclear veterans, we believe the government should be taking great care to recognise if second and third generations have been affected by their parents’ or grandparents’ exposure to this radiation and, if they have been, then we have an obligation to care for them.
While this legislation does not address this issue, the belated acknowledgment of the health impacts on veterans should lead also to acknowledgement of effects still being endured by Aboriginal people. Of course, this legislation is completely silent on those who were inadvertently and against their will exposed to radiation, to the fallout and to the trauma of having their lands bombed for British nuclear tests. The compensation and the recognition for Aboriginal people has been utterly insufficient. It has been a shameful and terrible story which is deserving of an apology, because these people were not warned and they were not looked after.
Senator Faulkner recently provided information to the Senate in response to a question of mine about the very small sums of money that have been paid that pale into insignificance when compared with the budget line items set aside in this and future budgets for veterans. I am of course not arguing for the funding to veterans or to service personnel to be cut; I am arguing that Aboriginal people affected by the tests should also receive just compensation and health care. To date, the government’s response has been utterly insignificant to the trauma that these people experienced. I move the Greens second reading amendment:
At the end of the motion, add “but the Senate calls on the Government to extend eligibility for the Repatriation Health Card – All conditions (known as the ‘Gold Card’) to former Australian Defence Force members in the new category of service established by this bill, the British nuclear test defence service, and to their medically-affected dependants”.",SENATE,<title>VETERANS’ ENTITLEMENTS AMENDMENT (INCOME SUPPORT MEASURES) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1
"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2010-06-24,"—I will be supporting the second reading amendment of Senator Ludlam and I join with him in his sentiments and his concerns. These British atomic weapons detonation tests that were conducted at Emu Field, Maralinga in South Australia and the Monte Bello Islands off the west coast of Western Australia were conducted to enable the United Kingdom to develop nuclear fission bombs and later nuclear fusion, or hydrogen, bombs; and the tests were carried out with the full cooperation of the Australian government under Prime Minister Menzies. More than 17,000 Australian soldiers and civilians were directly involved in the tests and assessment of the fallout from the tests. Many of these Australians have gone on to suffer a range of illnesses as a result of dangerous and continued exposure to high levels of radiation from cancers to genetic diseases inherited by their children. In May 2007, Professor Al Rowland, from Massey University in New Zealand, published a scientific paper on chromosome damage, providing hard evidence of the relationship between the exposure to the ionising radiation from the atomic blasts and certain cancers and birth defects.
Today only 2,500 ex-service men and women out of the 8,000 who were involved in the nuclear testings are still alive. Over the past few months that I have been approached on this issue, I have been contacted by veterans who were involved in the nuclear testing. One of them was Geoffrey, who was 23 years old when he served at Maralinga with the Air Force. He arrived in the middle of 1961 just after two major bombs had been tested. During his 12 months on the base, tests on smaller nuclear weapons were continuing as well as assessment of the fallout from these bombs. Geoff tells me how he recalls walking in the dust, wearing nothing more than a singlet and shorts. He admits he volunteered to go there but says had he known of the risks, had he been told about the risks, he would have stayed away as far as possible. Geoff has survived a brain tumour, and both his son and grandson suffer severe health effects. Geoff blames these illnesses on his time at Maralinga. Sadly, Geoff’s story is one of many. Some veterans have told me about how they did nothing more than turn their backs for mere moments before turning back around to watch the aftermath of the explosion.
I am pleased that through this bill the government has finally introduced one of the recommendations of the Clarke review to recognise veterans in the atomic tests as ‘non-warlike hazardous’ under the Veterans’ Entitlements Act. That is a good thing. Under this amendment, veterans will be able to access a disability pension and healthcare treatment for conditions arising from their service, and war widows and widowers can access pensions where the death of the service person is attributable to that service.
Another thing that needs to be said is that in 1993 the government accepted a ₤20 million ex gratia payment, valued at approximately $100 million today, from Britain. The deal was negotiated by the then Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Simon Crean, and the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Gareth Evans. The government argued that this fund was to go towards repatriation of the land; however, in a speech to the House in October 2006, Minister Crean said:
We successfully got the British government to make a contribution of some ₤20 million—an outcome that was designed to, in its own words, support future claims for compensation for participants.
In other words that fund should have been used to give direct compensation for participants, not used just for cleaning up the land. He went on to say that ‘it was recognised that there could be future claims’. As I understand it, that money has solely gone for rehabilitation of the land and not for compensation of victims.
There is now a court case in the UK which Australian veterans are seeking to join—it is a very difficult and expensive case—so that they can get lump-sum compensation, and I wish them well in that class action. Unfortunately, even if they were to be successful in this lawsuit, under the agreement of the 1993 ex gratia payment, any compensation may have to be paid to the Australian government. That is an area of real concern. In any event, I hope that they are successful with their claim.
I commend the government for at least acting on the Clarke review recommendations. We need to go further, as Senator Ludlam said, but at least this is a first step to assist veterans.",SENATE,<title>VETERANS’ ENTITLEMENTS AMENDMENT (INCOME SUPPORT MEASURES) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,24,1

"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2010-06-24,"—I rise to speak on the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011, Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011 and Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2010-2011. The Rudd government has been treating Australian taxpayers like a bunch of mugs. Open up any paper, turn on the radio or the TV—even just drive your car past one of the many billboards—and you are bound to hear the government’s propaganda on the Labor Party’s mining tax. Guess what? It is paid for with Australian taxpayers’ money. I am aware of an announcement the soon-to-be Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, has just made, but I will come to that in a moment.
The Labor government has been spending millions of dollars to fund its Labor Party election campaign and it is sending Australian taxpayers the bill. Over $30 million is still set aside for Labor Party propaganda, and it would come out of the pockets of mums and dads. What a joke. Planning to spend over $30 million of working families’ money to fund the Labor Party’s election campaign is an absolute disgrace. It is an outrageous abuse of taxpayers’ dollars and it smacks of total hypocrisy from the Labor government.
In 2007, Labor promised to clean up political advertising during election campaigns. That was when Labor was still in opposition and did not hold the purse strings. But, now that Labor has gained control of the taxpayers’ money, they have had second thoughts. They have just taken that promise and flushed it down the toilet, like many of the other promises they have made, such as not cutting the health rebate and promising to build 260 childcare centres.
Labor has gone back on its word time and time again and, quite frankly, Australians have had enough. Clearly, the Labor Party are losing the trust of the Australian people, who have come to believe that their word does not really represent their word. This fact is evident in the opinion polls. The Australian public are fed up with getting told one thing by the government and then seeing them do the complete opposite. Over $30 million is still set aside by this government to sell its latest tax to Australians. It is an absolute disgrace and I think it makes a lot of people sick. Even Labor members of parliament have said that it is not right. What message is the Labor government sending to families when the government can find money to spend on election advertising but they cannot find the money to help pensioners, our stay-at-home mums or our military veterans?
Clearly, the reckless mining tax is only Labor Party policy; therefore the Labor Party should be paying for the ads out of their own pocket. It is ridiculous that the Labor Party should keep using taxpayers’ dollars to flog Labor Party policy when it is still yet to be approved by parliament. And, in case the Labor government has forgotten, let me enlighten them: you do not have the numbers in the Senate, so you cannot just ram through Labor Party policy such as the reckless mining tax. You have to work with the Senate.
It is a good thing that the government of the day cannot just ram through their policy. We saw what happened with that under the Howard government. Family First is on the record as saying that we are against the reckless mining tax in its current form. Family First will not be voting for a policy which has been recklessly put forward without any proper consultation with the actual industry and which is going to destabilise a sector of our economy that Australians have come to rely on. I am certainly not going to let the Labor government get away with wasting taxpayers’ dollars to promote a Labor Party policy which is not even guaranteed to come into law and has not got the support of the majority of the Senate since Family First is opposed to the mining tax in its current form. If the Labor government will not clean up their own act then it is up to Family First and others to make sure another cent is not spent on this spin.
I have just noticed that the new Prime Minister, Prime Minister Gillard, in her first press conference after becoming Prime Minister, has realised how blatantly appalling this advertising campaign has been and has said that they will stop spending the money. This is a good thing, but the fact of the matter is that it still remains in the appropriation bills, and the requests for amendments that Family First is putting forward would ensure that no taxpayer money can be spent on advertising this reckless superprofits mining tax. It is a pity that we have already had to waste millions of taxpayers’ dollars before the Labor Party could arrive at this conclusion themselves, and it is a shame that it took requested amendments such as the ones that I am putting forward to get the government to listen. In light of the government’s announcement, I will still be pressing ahead with my requests for amendments because they do exactly what the government has promised to do, and that is to stop using hard earned working families’ money to spend on advertising for the Labor Party’s re-election.
These requests for amendments are an insurance policy for the Australian taxpayers. I urge the rest of the senators to look at the requested amendments I have put forward as insurance to make sure that the government’s word is their word and that not another cent will be spent on the Labor Party’s policy which is part of, I think, their re-election campaign. My requests for amendments to the appropriation bills will put an end to any money being spent on this mining tax.

"Joyce, Sen Barnaby",NATS,2010-06-24,"—I rise to speak on Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011, Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2010-2011 and the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011. Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011 is for the purpose of appropriating about $72 billion for the ordinary annual services of government. Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2010-2011 appropriates approximately $9.5 billion for the non-ordinary other annual services of government. The Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2010-2011 appropriates $222 million out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the expenditure in relation to the parliamentary departments.
This is the third budget that this government has delivered and they are zero from three: they have never delivered a surplus and they never will. Of the three budgets delivered by the Rudd government—as it was—this is the most political, the least believable and the most damaging to Australia’s long-term future. This is a budget that trashes, through a combination of negligent mismanagement and unprecedented waste, the legacy of good financial management left by the coalition. This is a budget built on a foundation of accounting tricks and diversions. This is a budget built on a desperate tax grab—an attempt to hoodwink the public into believing that the Labor Party will actually deliver a surplus. The last coalition government delivered 10 surpluses in 12 years. The last coalition government left a legacy of sensible economic management—a $20 billion budget surplus and $60 million in the bank. The Labor government did not take long to trash this legacy. Their first budget delivered a $27 billion deficit, their second budget delivered a $57 billion deficit and for their final act they forecast a $40 billion deficit in 2010-11. These are three of the largest deficits in our history. They completed the trifecta and it only took them one term to do it. This financial year’s deficit is the largest, as a percentage of GDP, since before the Whitlam government.
And what have the Australian people got for all this spending? We can see the results around us. In our homes we have spent a billion dollars on insulation. The results have caused over 180 fires and four tragic deaths. We are now spending a billion dollars to fix the mess. In our schools we are spending $16.2 billion on the Building the Education Revolution. We should note here that the grand architect of that complete fiasco is now going to be the Prime Minister of Australia after a very nefarious backroom deal from the faceless people in Sussex Street and the Labor Party. This is where our nation has got to. We put aside the votes of the Australian people and we handed over to Senator Mark Arbib, to Eddie Obeid and to Joe Tripodi, who are now apparently running the nation.
Recently I visited the Manilla Central School, where two demountables—dongas as we call them in Queensland—were there at a cost of $1.807 million. I imagine most Australians would expect a pretty fancy sort of house for that sort of money. In fact, Senator Williams said he could build three bedrooms, brick veneer and tiles for that sort of money. What are we talking about? What did we get? Pools? No; we got demountables—demountables bolted together, made in a factory and delivered to a schoolyard in north-west New South Wales. On our borders we are spending an extra billion in response to the Labor government’s—it is no longer the Rudd government—complete loss of control of the flow of asylum seekers. This government unwound the solutions the Howard government left them in August 2008, and since then over 130 boats have arrived carrying over 6,000 asylum seekers. This year alone 70 boats have arrived.
But it is what we cannot see that is perhaps the greatest legacy of waste left by this government. I do not see an inland rail network driving a corridor of commerce through regional towns, connecting Melbourne to the ports of Queensland. I do not see the duplication of the Pacific Highway, which Labor promised by 2016 but for which they now do not have the funds. I do not see the new water storages to underpin the future economic development of growing areas of Australia. I do not see the vital infrastructure. We did have $90 billion spent on stimulus, but only 14 per cent of the stimulus went to economic infrastructure. The Labor Party are the grand architects of kitsch trinkets to adorn certain sections of our nation, the bill to be left to our children and our grandchildren. They have no idea how to pay off the debt; they only know how to continually go to the international credit card and hock Australia even further up.
We have pink batts. They put ceiling insulation in. We have dongas. We are heading towards $150 billion in gross debt, noting that Labor state governments are in excess of $160 billion in gross debt. These bills appropriate funds for the 2010-11 financial year, but the government wants us to focus on the promised land where in three years time we will apparently have a surplus because the Labor Party promises to fix its addiction to unsustainable spending. The impending surplus that they tell us about is about as believable as everything else the Labor Party says, and right now, if they open negotiations, we know that the surplus will not be there and that this miraculous $1 billion figure that has been delivered by the so-called economic cycle angel which will descend from heaven and make the deficit better is completely and utterly unbelievable. It is quite evident that we are now in a twilight zone where we are once more sucked into believing the Labor Party, who told us merely a couple of years ago that we today would be experiencing a $17 billion surplus. We now have a $57.1 billion deficit. We never had a deficit bigger in raw terms than that number.
The Labor Party promised to keep spending below two per cent in real terms. One way they achieve this is by a little accountancy trick. They keep moving $1.5 billion of spending from future years into this financial year. This is a ponzi scheme of a budget. They cannot keep this trick up in the future. A reckoning will eventually come for the Labor Party. We know what the Labor Party plan is for that reckoning. They will not cut spending. They will not suddenly become more disciplined. Instead they will raise taxes. In the budget overview the Labor Party produces a table trumpeting that they will make $30 billion in savings over the forward estimates. Over $16 billion of these savings—that is, over half—are higher taxes. The Labor Party are introducing a new tax on smoking to discourage smoking. That will raise about $5 billion. The Labor Party will introduce a new tax on mining to encourage mining. We are supposed to believe that this will raise $12 billion.
But it is not just tax. It is part of a nationalisation of the mining industry, bringing about immense sovereign risk to our nation, taking our nation to a peculiar corner which they have never been in before, putting the hearts and minds of people in regional Australia at complete unease because of what is happening to the structure of our economy. Where do these ideas come from? They came from the ‘kitchen cabinet’, the so-called gang of four, of which a member is going, by reason of backroom deals, to become the Prime Minister of our nation without ever going to an election. We are now basically going to have a 40 per cent ownership of the mining industry taking up 40 per cent of the revenues and accepting 40 per cent of the costs—or so we are led to believe. Who knows? Things change here overnight.
Do you think for one moment that if you now have a 58 per cent tax on mining companies you might have a slight problem with vertically integrated companies that work across nations’ boundaries? Do you think that a fully state owned enterprise from overseas is not going to move its profits, even though it might operate here, back to a more sensible and favourable tax regime? The RSPT is a bad tax. It is not elegant; it is just a blatant tax grab. It is premised on completely insubstantial foundations. There are statements that even if we raised the tax up to 60, 70 or 80 per cent it would make no difference to the desire of people to work in the mining industry and that profits will not move. Of course this is obviously and absurdly not the case. It is completely ridiculous. The government would have us believe that it is going to lead us to higher investment in the mining sector; however, the RSPT is creating many more problems. Xstrata has announced that two projects which would have employed over 3,000 workers in Queensland have been scrapped because they are no longer viable: the $6 billion Wandoan coal project and the $600 million Ernest Henry copper mine underground shaft project will not go ahead.
What the people of Australia do understand is that when these companies make profits they can afford to embark on costly exercises to create more mining wealth—wealth that Mr Rudd and now you, Ms Gillard, and your colleagues were lauding for helping Australia to weather the GFC. The Prime Minister knows that this is a bad tax. The Labor Party is desperately trying to sell this tax by spending $38 million on a blatant political advertising campaign.
This endeavour comes from a former Prime Minister—it changes so quickly round here—who at the last election said that political advertising was a ‘sick cancer within our system’ and ‘a cancer on democracy’, and I did not hear Ms Gillard contradict him on that. He went on to give an ‘absolute commitment’ to have the Auditor-General evaluate government advertising campaigns. Even today we heard Ms Gillard say that she will remove the campaign as long as the mining sector remove theirs. That is hardly an overwhelming endorsement of the philosophies and values that are now part of this new regime.
We should not be surprised that this government’s words do not match its actions. This is truly an Orwellian government. It is Building the Education Revolution by placing dongas at the back of school halls. It has a Nation Building Plan that allocates only 14 per cent of the stimulus spending on economic infrastructure . Where has the rest of it gone? And their Minister for Finance and Deregulation stated, ‘Government, after all, exists to regulate.’ I will take one quote from Orwell’s timeless essay The Politics of the English Language:
The great enemy of clear language is insincerity. When there is a gap between one’s real and one’s declared aims, one turns as it were instinctively to long words and exhausted idioms, like a cuttlefish spurting out ink.
The Labor Party dealt with this in their backroom deals by faceless people last night and this morning. Is there a better modern description of the walking PowerPoint slide that we had for a Prime Minister? Now we have the new office holder intending to, in some cathartic way, remove herself from decisions in which she was a partner in the disaster.
The coalition notes Senator Fielding’s proposed amendment to stop the government from spending this money on blatant political advertising. We certainly support the intent of this amendment, which is to make the government honour its election commitments. However, there is a very good historical reason why interference with appropriation bills is not condoned. There was an example in 1975 which is well known. There are many on the other side of the chamber who would understand that.
More importantly, if the government did want to advertise on public policy issues, other areas are certainly more deserving. Why isn’t the government warning the public on the risks of poorly installed insulation? Why isn’t the government informing the residents of the Murray-Darling Basin of the impending draft Basin Plan and the ways in which they can respond to it? Why isn’t the government informing the people of the Murray-Darling Basin that soon the sustainable diversion limits will nationalise the irrigation industry in the same way they nationalised the mining industry?
The government’s proposals to raise taxes are all just a direct consequence of the Labor Party’s addiction to spending and debt. Eventually the hangover comes and eventually the Australian people are presented with the bill for the Labor Party’s reckless and wasteful behaviour—or, as the finance minister put it, ‘The Labor Party’s failure to dot its i’s and cross its t’s’. That was an incredible statement when he was trying to explain how they got into this position with ceiling insulation.
Now they tell us that, as we go forward, we are to be impressed by the fact that we will be borrowing in excess of $700 million a week, putting upward pressures on interest rates and the cost of living for all Australians. That is supposed to be a good outcome. It cannot be a good outcome for the people of Western Sydney, it is not a good outcome for the people of regional Queensland and it is not a good outcome for business. Australia’s pressure on interest rates has come from Labor Party mismanagement, from a Labor Party that appears to have resigned this parliament to becoming a pandemonium palace.
The coalition delivered 10 surpluses in 12 years. An accountant judging this would say: ‘This is the sort of client that I want to run the books. That is the sort of client that has a real understanding of the worth of money.’ The Australian people are coming to terms with the fact that the Labor Party do not understand or value money.
This is a reckless government and quite obviously out of control. The government by their own actions have removed their leader. What an endorsement that is of the way they believe they are going! They eat their own. They know that they are a complete and utter botch job. There is not a hard decision in this budget to cut the reckless and wasteful government spending. In sum, this government are not fit to govern. The only way to turn around our great debt and deficit is to change the government, not its leader. These bills simply confirm what we all know. No matter how hard they try, this government do not know how to be responsible. They do not know how to act in such a way as to bring real change. They are ephemeral, they change leaders, there is pandemonium. They are a complete anachronism of what responsible government should be.",SENATE,<title>APPROPRIATION (PARLIAMENTARY DEPARTMENTS) BILL (NO. 1) 2010-2011</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,25,1

"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2010-06-24,"—I rise to speak on the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Budget Measures) Bill 2010. This bill comes at a difficult time for Australian families. They can only be feeling profoundly disappointed at the failures of this government to support them and their families, given promise after promise that was made before and since the last election. The general report card on the government is pretty poor. Before the last election, the commitment was to high-quality, affordable child care and universal access to early childhood education. The actual impact of the government’s policies has been to reduce the government’s financial assistance for child care and increase costs for both child care and early childhood education.
Let us have a look at some of the promises that have gone absent without leave—and many of these were canvassed at the recent Senate estimates. The commitment to 260 new childcare centres was quietly withdrawn in April this year—coincidentally, on the same day as the Melbourne Storm salary cap debacle erupted in the media—and it was buried on the second page of a ministerial press release with no indication in the heading of the press release as to what the most profound part of that press release was. We always look to the second page of the press release for the key announcement, don’t we, Mr Acting Deputy President? The upshot of that press release was that 222 childcare centres will now not be proceeding. After all of the excitable claims about ending the double drop-off, which we heard time and again before the last election, that was not to be. That is another promise not met, amid suggestions of supply issues, which is one thing if you live, as many constituents obviously do, in outer metropolitan areas but another thing altogether if you are fighting for an affordable space for your child in inner city Sydney or Melbourne.
Rural childcare centres that operate on a part-time basis are also under threat. Minister Ellis will only guarantees six months accreditation, which it virtually impossible to employ staff or to start new services. If you are a parent looking for childcare services, your choices will now also be reduced with the removal of the government’s start-up funding for family day care and remote area day care. Clearly, reduced numbers of small business people, particularly women, will be able to start this home based service without the grant; so families who want to opt for the alternative, and often cheaper, family day care will face further shortages of places from 1 July 2010. The government has also cut funding for occasional care. This is an essential service for parents wanting emergency child care or access to a playgroup. Even the after school community program will cease operation from the end of this year. All of these decisions have a cumulative effect on the choices and abilities of parents to find good reliable care for their children so women can maximise their participation in the workforce.
In the recent budget a raft of supposed savings were announced. These included a reduction in the childcare rebate cap by $278 per year for the next four years, which is contained in the bill before us at the moment. This comes at a time when the new quality agenda is also expected to push up daily fees and reduce the number of childcare places. This will significantly increase the cost of child care. Clearly, the new national quality agenda means that additional staff with higher qualifications will be required. Parents will face extra daily costs of between $13 and $22 for babies and toddlers in care.
In relation to the budget decision in this bill, the new capped limit is cut to $7,500, which is reached as soon as child care costs hit $15,000. This will not be indexed for years. Full-time care over 48 weeks per year at just under $70 a day would reach this limit. Parents of babies and toddlers who pay higher fees because of higher staff ratios will be hardest hit. Three days of care a week at $125 a day, which is not uncommon for baby and toddler care in high-demand city centres, would cost $18,000 a year. Parents would be $10½ thousand out of pocket.
I have already referred to estimates by Childcare Alliance Australia that fee increases of between $13 and $22 a day will be necessary from next year to cover the small staff ratios and higher staff qualifications required of centres to meet the national quality standard reforms. It is worth noting that, in a survey by the Daily Telegraph in Sydney in March, parents were found to be paying an average of $100 a day for toddler child care in Sydney’s CBD.
Labor is selling this rebate cut on the basis that it will only affect three per cent of working families receiving CCR and that these families are wealthy. This is not a realistic assessment. The reality is that parents all over the country are reassessing whether they can afford good quality child care or the number of days of care per week now used. There is a direct relationship between affordable child care and the number of hours that parents, especially women, can work. The finance minister’s claim that these reductions are ‘just a bit of a haircut’ shows how removed from reality the government is.
Parents and the childcare sector have every right to feel let down by this government. The government has attempted to justify the CCR reduction by claiming that the savings of $86.3 million over four years will instead assist in paying for the national quality reforms agenda. But, again, we know from the budget papers and Senate estimates that the government is spending some $100 million on administration and red tape and $120 million on advertising. This is not ‘a haircut’; it is an insult to Australia’s working families.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHILD CARE BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1
"Hanson-Young, Sen Sarah",AG,2010-06-24,"—I rise to speak on the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Budget Measures) Bill 2010 put forward, sadly, by the government on budget night. It is going to have a significant impact on families who access child care right around the country—and the pain will grow not just for the coming financial year but across the forward estimates.
It was interesting to sit here listening to the opposition’s spokesman because I agree with a number of his points. This is not a good piece of legislation; we should not be looking for budget savings in the really important essential service area of child care. We need to see more funding directed into the area and a better way of ensuring that the government can get their quality outcomes addressed through how they actually pay for child care. Of course, the Greens have put on the record numerous times that the childcare rebate is not the best way of delivering good quality, affordable or accessible child care. But that is what we have got and that is what parents rely on week in week out to go some way towards meeting the very expensive cost of good quality child care.
It does cost money to pay qualified people for their wonderful skills in educating and caring for our youngest kids. It is an essential service for parents and it is an essential service for the country. We know that between the ages of zero and five is the most crucial time for educating and caring for children. The best investment we can make in their educational outcomes into the future is to get it right in that age group. The three core principles that should underpin any type of early education and care in this country are quality, affordability and accessibility. The government’s move to cut the childcare rebate, to freeze the indexation and to make it more difficult for families right around the country to afford good quality child care shows a total misunderstanding of the struggle that working families and parents have every week.
Every week they make choices to ensure that their children are looked after in good quality care and it is expensive. The government needs to accept that if we want good quality childcare, if we want a framework that insists on that right around the country, if we want qualified people looking after our most vulnerable kids at the time when we need to be investing in good quality care and education then we are going to have to pay for that. This cost should not just be slapped on the shoulders of parents; we need the government to help foot the bill to ensure that we are investing in these kids’ future.
The government should not be using childcare and early childhood education as the scapegoat for finding budget savings. On the point of budget savings, it may not seem an awful lot in the big scheme of things—$86.3 million over four years is all this measure would save the government—yet it would work out as hundreds if not thousands of dollars per child for families that this is going to affect. It may not be much for the government in the big scheme of things in the global budget, but it would have a very significant impact on families right around the country. As I said, as the quality framework continues to be implemented the cost of delivering good quality care is going to rise and unfortunately the government have not met this challenge with a way of supporting parents to meet those costs. Instead they have done the exact opposite and they are going to make it more difficult for them to accept it. While I said I agree with a number of the points that were raised by the opposition in relation to this bill, I am sad to see them support it, that they are simply going to wave it through. It is not good policy, it does not make financial sense and it is going to make the lives of families far more difficult.
The Greens will move an amendment to this piece of legislation which would make the childcare rebate accessible on a fortnightly basis. At the moment parents have to wait to access the rebates every quarter, so every three months. You pay your childcare fees weekly or fortnightly and you keep paying, keep paying and keep paying yet it is not until three months later that you get your rebate. That has a very significant impact on family budgets. I have written to the minister about this and spoken publicly about this. Let us try and ease that burden by at least helping with the budgeting situation by ensuring that that rebate is paid fortnightly. This was promised by the Rudd Labor government during the 2007 election, but the government has not done so. It seems that they are not prepared to put more money in to ease the cost for families. As the cost of childcare is going to rise because of the quality framework and ensuring that we have good quality care then, at the very least, let us try and help families manage their budgets. Waiting for three months for their $6,000 or $7,000 rebate is not very helpful. That is the crux of it.
I do not understand why the government have targeted childcare as a place to try and find budget savings. It does not make sense. It is going to make family budgets more difficult and it is going to make it more difficult for the government to sell its message about the importance of a good quality framework that needs to be rolled out around the country. We need well-qualified people and good quality care for our kids. The government are going to have a big problem trying to sell the importance of those reforms if they are not prepared to fund them. They are reforms that the childcare sector, families and parents have been waiting for for a long time, yet it seems that this government will have an uphill battle on their hands in trying to sell the importance of it if they are not going to carry the costs to help parents afford good quality care. The move by the government to cut the childcare rebate, freeze the indexation, is going to make things far more difficult and flies in the face of the three core principles of quality, affordability and accessibility.
This is just another issue in a long line of broken promises by the government in this area. We saw the axing of the 260 childcare centres and the flimsy figures used to excuse that, saying that there was a 91 per cent-plus vacancy rate across the country. Parents were told they did not need to worry as they could get their kids into childcare centres. We know that is simply not true. If you are in a metropolitan area or you are in a rural or regional area that is simply not true. If you have a 12-month-old child chances are you will be on a waiting list for quite some time or you are going to have to go back to your employer and negotiate to work on a different day because there are no spots on the particular day that your shift has been offered. The government have not been genuine with the Australian community or families in relation to their commitment to childcare. They keep talking about it yet everything they do is making things more difficult for them.
Yes, we need good quality care. Yes, we need a framework that implements that. But the government must fund that properly and support parents to afford that. Cutting the childcare rebate and cutting the commitment to build new centres which would provide more affordable places is simply going to make things much harder. I hope that under the new leadership of the federal Labor Party Prime Minister Gillard will see sense, that making things more difficult for parents to afford good quality care and access places will be reviewed. I hope that the government sees sense on the amendment that we are putting forward, which is not going to cost the government any more money. Exactly the same amount of money will be given back in the rebate, but it will make it more affordable for parents because they will not have to wait to get their rebate every three months; they will only have to wait a fortnight—just like all other government and parenting payments. It simply makes sense. I would like to think that the opposition would support that amendment because it is a fundamentally important one. Government bureaucrats may not care much about this as they draft these pieces of legislation, but to families who have to carry the cost of weekly childcare fees it is important that they get the rebate in a fortnightly instalment as opposed to waiting for a quarterly rebate. This is going to have a very significant impact.
I thank my colleague Rachel Siewert for clearly putting forward the Greens position on this piece of legislation earlier in the week. She pointed out how important investment in early childhood education is for any government, regardless of who their leader is. Regardless of what side of the benches we sit on, we need to be investing in the early education and care of our kids. We need to ensure kids have access to education and care of the highest quality. We must make sure that people can access it and it is affordable. There is no use having the best quality care in the world if parents cannot afford it. We need to help them to carry that cost. Child care and early childhood education are not a luxury, they are an essential services that families right around the country rely on every day. We need to make sure not only that families can afford it but also that it is good quality. I will be moving an amendment in the committee stage.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHILD CARE BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1
"Fielding, Sen Steve",FFP,2010-06-24,"—You would have every right to question the government’s commitment to working families after looking at the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Budget Measures) Bill 2010. The government is trying to slash the childcare rebate by $278 per child per year. This is a blatant attack on working families by the government and it represents a real kick in the guts to Australian working families. It is a heartless decision that strikes at the heart of the family budget and puts even further pressure on families who are already struggling to pay the bills and make ends meet.
The government has ripped into one of the most important items for ordinary hardworking Australians and pretends it is nothing. The government has abandoned its pledge to help working families when it comes to accessible and affordable child care and has put mums and dads out of pocket by an extra $278 per child per year. But we should not be surprised, because this broken promise only adds to other broken promises by the government.
For a family with two children, this budget cut will cost more than $500—that is, a family budget will be hit with $500 extra in childcare expenses. Any family that pays more than $57.70 per day in childcare fees for five days a week will be worse off under this change. On top of this, the childcare rebate will no longer be indexed to the CPI, like it has been in the past. What this means is that, as childcare expenses go up and up each year, Australian families will be left more and more out of pocket. Even the Henry tax review was urging for greater support. It suggested giving low-income families a 90 per cent subsidy for child care. But the government has done the very opposite and hiked up the effective cost of child care for those that depend on it most.
This latest attack on working families comes only a few weeks after the government broke another election promise by scrapping its plan to build 260 childcare centres. These 260 new centres were needed because there are already many families who have trouble finding an affordable spot in child care for their kids. Clearly the government does not really care about the extra costs and looking after working families in the area of child care when it goes back on promises like this.
The government has said it is committed to helping working families, but how are families supposed to go to work if there are not enough affordable childcare centres to look after their kids and it is too expensive for them? We know where this promise went: it went to the Labor election promise graveyard. Before Mr Rudd was elected in 2007, he said in a campaign ad:
… I believe you make your own luck.
He wasn’t wrong there! You have no choice but to make your own luck under the Labor government, because it has broken its promises in regard to child care and has slapped working families in the face with higher costs.
On budget night, when these stingy cuts to the childcare rebate were announced, Family First was the only party to speak up. There was little or no objection from any other party about the cut to the childcare rebate. It was Family First that first raised the issue. There was such an overwhelming public outcry against the government’s cuts to the rebate that the coalition finally took notice and pretended to care. I use the word ‘pretended’ because the pretenders, the alternative government, said they would also oppose the cut to the childcare rebate. That promise had a shorter life than any promise by the Rudd government. That is what you get when you are dealing with the hollow words of the two major parties.
Family First is the only party that is genuine about helping families. Family First will not be voting for this bill because it is a cruel bill that punishes families who need to put their kids in child care and hits them hard in the hip pocket. If the government wants to cry poor about needing the extra savings in the budget, perhaps it could stop feathering its own nest. It just stinks to think that this is the second year in a row that former Prime Minister Rudd—and Prime Minister Gillard, I am sure, is probably not going to go back on it—has increased staffing levels by more than 60 in the Prime Minister’s own department. It is a real smack in the face for all Australian mums and dads who will now be faced with higher out-of-pocket childcare fees when they see Prime Ministers feathering their own nest. At a time when Australians are told to cut back and make do, the excesses of a Prime Minister increasing their own staff is obscene. We raised this after the previous budget and we have raised it after this budget. It is incredible to think that, in the last two budgets, the Prime Minister’s own staff has increased by nearly 60 each time. That is excessive. The government cries poor and says that it just does not have the money to maintain the childcare rebate at the same rate but has no problem splashing out $18 million of taxpayers’ money to boost the Prime Minister’s office budget. I find the government’s priorities warped. This is a government that has clearly lost sight of helping its working families. Family First will not be voting for the stingy cut to the rebate, and I am surprised the opposition has gone for it.",SENATE,<title>FAMILY ASSISTANCE LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (CHILD CARE BUDGET MEASURES) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,26,1
"Arbib, Sen Mark",ALP,2010-06-24,"—I thank the senators for their comments. I also note the opposition’s support for the Family Assistance Legislation Amendment (Child Care Budget Measures) Bill 2010 and thank them for it. I will make a number of points in response to some of the concerns, particularly from Senator Hanson-Young and Senator Fielding. Our government has a clear record on early childhood education, on child care and on supporting Australian families. I do not think there is any doubt that we have prioritised affordable and high-quality child care for Australian families and their children and we remain committed to this. Evidence of this commitment is clear in our investment of $17.1 billion in early childhood education and child care over the next four years. That is $10 billion more than was provided in the last four years of the Howard government.
In July 2008 we delivered on our election commitment to increase the childcare rebate from 30 per cent to 50 per cent of parents’ out-of-pocket expenses, something that senators failed to mention today. This extra support goes directly to parents to help them with the cost of child care. We also met our election commitment to lift the maximum families could claim from $4,354, as it was under the previous government, to $7,500 per child per year, a substantial increase of $3,146 a year, or some 72 per cent. Last year 670,000 Australian families benefited from the significant reforms, enabling them to claim back half of their out-of-pocket childcare costs up to $15,000 a year for each child in care. Further, as a result of these changes, ABS statistics also show that childcare costs to parents fell by over 20 per cent. Under the previous government families were also forced to wait until the end of each year to access their childcare rebate payment, something that we all remember. This put pressure on family budgets throughout the year, something that the Rudd government acted on. We promised it; we changed it, going to quarterly payments giving parents assistance closer to the time they incurred their childcare costs.
In addition to the childcare rebate, we also provided $8.4 billion over four years for low- and middle-income earners through the childcare benefit. This means we cover more than half of childcare costs for these families. In total, we will provide $14.4 billion over four years for parents through childcare benefit and childcare rebate. This is $8 billion more than the Howard government provided in childcare fees assistance in their last years. This is a commitment to childcare quality, to reducing costs and to helping Australian families. That is what the Gillard government stands for, and it is something we are proud of.

"Parry, Sen Stephen",LP,2010-06-24,"—by leave—Mr Deputy President, could we commence that notice of motion again. There was a lot of noise in the chamber with senators entering. I think it would be fair to Senator Ryan and Senator Brown if the motion was put again.
—The question now is that Senator Brown’s amendment be agreed to.

A division having being called and the bells being rung—

—Mr President, on a point of order, as it is time for the start of question of time, could I suggest we defer debate and the vote on this resolution and consider it again following taking note at the end of question time? I suggest this as a way of assisting the chamber and making sure that people are clear what is happening.

"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2010-06-24,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Immigration and Citizenship (Senator Evans) to a question without notice asked by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Abetz) today relating to the proposed new tax on mining.
The gang of four has now become the gang of three, and the 2IC has been rewarded for her treachery and disloyalty and taken over from the worst Prime Minister in the history of this country. After accepting her 30 pieces of silver, she has once again betrayed her commitment and conviction about the previous policies of what has proved to be a hopeless and hapless government, of which she was the architect. One of the first things she has done is ditch the taxpayer funded advertising justifying their great big new tax on mining. I salute the fact that the advertising is not going ahead, because it was a waste of taxpayers’ money and it was an abuse of the privilege that this government received.
But what is astounding is that yesterday, the day before and the day before that, Ms Gillard, now Prime Minister Gillard—it fills me with fear—was justifying this expenditure. Thirty-eight million dollars was well-spent yesterday, apparently, but not today. This joins the long list of ditched and dumped disastrous policies and justifications this government are trying to hide under the political corpse of Kevin Rudd. But it will not work, because the structure of this government is essentially the same. The faceless, backroom boys are still pulling the strings of whatever puppet they have in charge. It will not work. The Australian people will see through it.
Kevin Rudd, for all his failings, was named ‘Canada’s mining man of the year’, thanks to his work to destroy Australia’s mining industry. But while he was getting that award, there was strong competition in the Labor Party for the award of ‘undermining man of the year’. Could it be the triple F of Feeney, Farrell and Faulkner or the ABC of undermining: Arbib, Burke or Conroy? All of them have butchered a Prime Minister in the greatest act of betrayal that the Labor Party has ever seen. The list of backroom people—
—Mr President, my point of order goes to relevance, as well as hypocrisy, given what those opposite did to Turnbull. But, most importantly, my point of order is relevance.
—Senator Wong, that is a debating point rather than a point of order.
—I should articulate my point of order a little more carefully. The point of order is relevance. This is ‘taking note of answers’. What Senator Bernardi is commenting on has absolutely nothing to do with any answers given in question time today.
—There is no point of order, Senator Wong. Having sat through question time, I can say that I think relevance has become somewhat debatable.
—Mr Deputy President, on a point of order: the minister in making her point of order could not help herself and directly referred to Senator Bernardi’s alleged hypocrisy. That should be withdrawn because it was directed personally at him.
—You want me to withdraw? Surely after your hypocrisy with Turnbull, do you really want me to withdraw?
—Order! Senator Wong, if you used the word ‘hypocrisy’ and it was directed at a senator, then I must ask you to withdraw.
—I withdraw.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy President. Clearly, Senator Wong, who was 100 per cent behind Kevin Rudd last night, is feeling a little challenged. But I would return to the backflip by Ms Gillard on the $38 million waste of taxpayers’ money. So proud were the government of their track record that they had to knife the architect and replace him with the 2IC.
I know there are those who clung loyally to the flag that supported such disastrous policies. I know that Senators Cameron and Wong came out supporting and justifying all of the policies of the Rudd government, but the problem is that it is not going to change now. They have changed the colour of the hair of the puppet at the top but the same backroom boys will be doing the job of ruining this country day by day. It is an absolutely undistinguished record. What they have done to the mining industry is to challenge it. They have justified their great big new tax on mining by saying that it is actually going to grow the mining industry. We now know that is absolute poppycock, and we know it because Ms Gillard can no longer justify the misinformation that was put out by this government, a government that was intent on spin and propaganda rather than on substance and the national interest.
It is galling to me that Senator Wong stands up and talks about relevance. Let me say this: Senator Wong unfortunately has been deemed irrelevant by this government because the portfolios that she has continued to hold have proved to be perhaps the most disastrous of a very bad and failed government. So while Ms Gillard will be saying that things are going to change and that they want to enter into a truce, such statements are motivated simply by electoral opportunism. They want to buy some peace so that they can stop the haemorrhaging and hide these disastrous and failed policies under the corpse of the former Prime Minister. He was a flawed Prime Minister, a failed Prime Minister, a disastrous Prime Minister. He was a Prime Minister who has really done no credit to Labor or to this country. But that is not the point. Ms Gillard was entrusted as the deputy leader and she has displayed no loyalty. This is the greatest act of betrayal.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Budget</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,41,1
"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,2010-06-24,"—It is my pleasure to follow Senator Bernardi in speaking on this take note motion. There is nothing more fascinating for the public of Australia, I am sure, than to listen to that speech. How is it that those opposite can stand up and reflect on Labor’s decisions in relation to leadership, having cleaned out two leaders of their own and having ditched a leader on the back of a principle in circumstances that defied their own claims that it was a policy area of no regard—that is, climate change? What we have is a new leader who will take this country forward with pride, dignity and vision.
How is it that those opposite can stand there with any credibility and say that this government has not achieved anything? Our achievements are so comprehensive compared with the 11 years of the coalition government’s absolute neglect of our education system—both secondary and tertiary. Education, research and development and the investment we need to make in enhancing what we build, design and export all suffered under the Howard government. We went backwards on so many national indicators including, very importantly, our connectivity.
We on this side of the chamber know that the economic infrastructure of the future is bandwidth, and yet we have those opposite still saying that they will oppose the National Broadband Network in the face of an agreement by Telstra to participate in it. In the face of universal acclamation of the elegant structure of the telecommunications policy as we have put it forward, we have this lot opposite now saying they will withdraw the investment that Labor has made in the type of technology that will underpin our education system going forward. They will pull those computers out of schools. They will stop the funding flowing to the physical infrastructure of our education system to the detriment of every generation hence that leaves schools in Australia and enters our workforce.
Theirs is a backward thinking party. We know they were a backward thinking government because we experienced 12 years of that under Howard. Now they have the gall to stand up and ask us what we have done. We have done so much. We have built new libraries. We have built new physical infrastructure in schools that changes the day-to-day experience of kids. It inspires them to know that the government of this country values their education. And, trust me, the impact of that is critical. The message that young people received under the Howard government was that the government did not care. That government had no regard for their future—for where they were going to take those children down the track.
I do not have enough time to list the successes of this government, but let me turn briefly to the investment in health. We know the health costs were blowing out. We look at the numbers under the Howard government and we look at the disinvestment. We look at the $1 billion stripped out by the Howard government, and everybody knows that we were heading to a bad place with respect to health services. Only under the Rudd government, and now the Gillard government, has there been a program for health reform involving substantive investment. We have put in place a system that will bring about real change for this country. We are talking about the health of our citizens. Combined, these two issues—investment in education and health—represent two of the very core issues that Australians hold dear.
Under the Howard government, on all those indicators, we went backwards, and you cannot stand up across the opposite side of this chamber and hold up flagpoles and compare them to the sort of physical and organisational investment we are making in our education system. You cannot compare a $1 billion withdrawal of funding from our public health system to our multibillion dollar investment in the future of a national healthcare system coordinated through our states and the federal system to deliver universal health services to Australians. They cannot compare. They know it. They have nowhere to go, and Ms Gillard will make a fine Prime Minister for this country. (Time expired)

"McGauran, Sen Julian",LP,2010-06-24,"—‘Ms Gillard will make a fine Prime Minister’ were the ending words of the previous speaker, who is probably the only senator—and, for that matter, member of parliament—to go on Sky TV before the ballot itself. Let that be noted by her detractors when the time comes for payback. And payback is already happening: you are going to have to look for a new finance minister by the looks of things down in the House at this moment. I am told that Mr Lindsay Tanner is resigning and will not be recontesting. That little honeymoon has not lasted long.
And nothing has changed at all. All through question time you did not take the opportunity to change the direction of the government. What is the point of changing a leader if you are not going to change your policy and direction? Like all of around this place, I tuned in, glued to the press conference of the new Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, to whom I offer a parliamentary congratulations—no more, no less. It is a high office; I congratulate anyone who manages to scramble to that position, as they do.
—Even with blood on their hands.
—With blood on their hands, as Senator Abetz announces. All of us have been around politics long enough to know that, as we can see even with Mr Tanner, that does not hold for a united team. But far be it from me that I be distracted by the good interjections of Senator Abetz. I, like everyone, was glued to Sky’s televising of the press conference of the new Prime Minister. I was bewildered that this Prime Minister and party, who were up all night plotting and planning the new position of the Prime Minister, did not take the opportunity on day 1 to fix the problem. Why would you remove former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd if you are not going to change your policies or the direction of the party?
You have simply made a political manoeuvre as a reaction to the polls. There is no conviction of policy. You spent all of question time defending the old policies of border protection—which brings me to the point. While you were scrutinising leaders I would have thought you would have scrutinised your own leader here in the Senate. There is one who should have been dropped too. Maybe he will be yet in a reshuffle. If you want to drop leaders on the basis of polls, there probably has not been a leader who has plunged you deeper in polls than the leader in the Senate and his portfolio. No-one has mismanaged his people portfolio worse than Senator Evans. But why would I think you would be discerning at all? Why would you be discerning about who is leading your party and who is running your policies when you have just made Prime Minister the person who has managed the worst waste of taxpayers’ funds to the tune of billions and billions of dollars since Federation? That will be her badge of dishonour.
And don’t think it has been lost on the Australian people. The rhetoric that came out of that press conference! Not one policy was changed when you had the opportunity to do it on day 1. Just go back and look at the first press conference of our change of leadership. We did it for a purpose. The purpose was to drop the ETS. There was no purpose in putting Ms Gillard there unless you changed some of your policies, and one, of course, was the mining tax. The other was to toughen up your border security protection, but nothing came out of that press conference but more rhetoric.
—It is just the same spin.
—It is just the same old spin. I was quite bewildered. I was quite encouraged, to tell you the truth. I was expecting more, given that you were all up late last night and you would have thought to change the direction of the party, but all we got was another version of the working family. Over and over she repeated phrases: ‘hard-working Australians’, ‘my door is open’ and ‘my love of this country’. Not one policy was changed. If you think the Australian people are just going to accept a new version of spin, you are wrong. You have miscalculated. There has to be a change in fundamental direction of policy.
This is what we will go to the election with. We already have our bumper sticker: this is a Prime Minister who is no different from the previous one. You are still playing spin. You are still playing politics with it all.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Budget</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,41,1
"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2010-06-24,"—This is all very illuminating. The opposition consider that policy consists of Mr Abbott saying that he would not do something. That was Senator McGauran’s great change of direction when they changed leader. Senator Bernardi talks about the Labor Party changing leaders and omits mention of the treachery and betrayal that occurred in the case of Mr Brendan Nelson and Mr Malcolm Turnbull. They, at least, were leaders who were trying to take you down some positive path, who were trying to develop policy, and that clearly was not good enough for the Liberal Party. In the absence of Mr Howard, who was very good at developing pragmatic policies, at throwing money at things, at making empty symbols, they floundered around looking for a leader who could develop real policies and take the party in a new direction.
So they turned to Mr Brendan Nelson. But the polls dropped, so they got rid of Mr Brendan Nelson—an act of treachery and betrayal for someone just into opposition. That leader was just done away with. Then we had Mr Malcolm Turnbull, who, again, rather than consistently saying no to everything that came through the parliament, tried to do something constructive. He tried to acknowledge that there might be some shades in the black and white. But, no, Mr Turnbull was subjected to an act of treachery and betrayal in his party room and, on the eve of making a historic, world-leading agreement, was dumped by his party.
Now we have Mr Abbott, whose crowning achievement, according to Senator McGauran, is to say no to the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme. What else has he done? What policies has he produced since then? Negative ones. In this parliament the consistent action of the opposition is to negate any legislation, not let anything through and not talk about their own policies but adopt a negative, blocking tactic. There are no policies, there is no action—no change, in fact, from the Howard era. Mr Abbott runs on a negative scare campaign. We all know that that can be very effective, and it did make it tough for the Labor Party. But this morning we had Julia Gillard taking up the leadership of the Labor Party, pledging to take the Labor Party in a new direction. She said that we had lost our way in the public debate, partly due to this negative campaign. She is going to take us in a new direction.
I greatly look forward to seeing the way that Julia Gillard will lead us forward. I have great faith in her intelligence and her ability to develop policy and see it through. Her faith in her country will translate to positive policy. Her love of her country will translate into policies that will take this country forward rather than being locked in the past, failed policies of the Howard era. I certainly have great faith in Ms Julia Gillard’s ability to do that. I look forward, most of all, to having a Prime Minister who looks to the future and who has the ability to take the people of Australia with her. I also look forward to working with the first female Prime Minister. It is a great thing, a great example for those of us in the party and, I am sure, all around the country that we have a female Prime Minister of great ability, great intelligence and great courage. We look forward to her taking us into the future.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Budget</title>,Questions Without Notice: Take Note of Answers,41,1
"Kroger, Sen Helen",LP,2010-06-24,"—This is indeed a remarkable day in this place and indeed in Australian history. Sitting back here, listening to Senator Hurley and Senator Lundy, I wonder what parallel universe they reside in. It is just absolutely gobsmacking listening to what those on the other side are suggesting. We have witnessed a leadership spill today like this nation has never seen before. We heard Senator Hurley praise the former leaders of the coalition for their great work. At least on this side we actually have a democratic process in which we deal with these things. We have a democratic process in the Liberal Party and in the coalition under which our policies and our programs are determined in the party room—not by a kitchen cabinet of four, a rapidly reducing number. As Senator McGauran has just said, you have got one fewer now. Once there were four, then there were three and, within six hours, there are now only two. How many are going to be left? The Prime Minister will be there on her own!
We actually have a process whereby our leaders are not undermined by faceless factional warlords, good Senators Feeney and Farrell, who actually fix who is going to run their party and fix who is going to control the government. It is the unions and the factional warlords that are dictating the policies and the programs of this government. It is not any caucus but the factional warlords, and that is the tragedy for all Australians today. The tragedy is that they do not have a true government; they have factional warlords who are dictating the direction of this country. This day will no doubt go down in history as a very sad day for all Australians. Our new Prime Minister admitted in her press conference only today that she felt this government had failed the Australian people. She said only a couple of hours ago:
I know the Rudd government did not do all it said it would do and at times it went off track.
Well, hello! Here is one of the kitchen cabinet of four who suddenly, because she is wearing the cloak of prime ministership, is now admitting that, yes, the Rudd government did get it wrong and it went off track. Why has she not conceded this until now, as the former Deputy Prime Minister and as one of the key four people who have determined the policies, procedures and programs of this government?
The list of the government’s broken election promises is as long as the queue of boat people lining up to get on boats in Indonesia and other waters. When you add up the sum of these broken promises and fiscally irresponsible policies, it adds up to one big black hole that needs to be funded. So how does this government deal with that black hole? Like all Labor governments, they do not look at reducing spending or at ways in which they can get value for money out of their programs. What they do is hike up taxes, and here the mining sector are in the eye of the storm. The target is the mining sector so that they can prop up this government and plug the huge gaping hole that is in their budget. A resource super profits tax is not going to fix the problems of this government. It is not going to fix the failed insulation program. It is not going to fix the failed BER—the billions of dollars that are going into the still-being-built Julia Gillard memorial halls. The RSPT will not fix the problems of this government. It is a deflection. The government are a disgrace and they should deal with the real issue, which is their policies. (Time expired)

JOINT COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT REPORT 417: REVIEW OF AUDITOR-GENERAL’S REPORTS TABLED BETWEEN

FEBRUARY 2009 AND SEPTEMBER 2009


TABLING STATEMENT


24 JUNE 2010

Mr President, on behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present the Committee’s Report 417: Review of Auditor-General’s Reports tabled between February 2009 and September 2009.
The Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, as prescribed by the Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act 1951, examines all of the reports of the Auditor-General and reports the results of the Committee’s deliberations to the Parliament.
This report details the findings of the Committee’s examination of nine performance audits tabled in 2009. These nine reports were selected for further scrutiny from the seventeen audit reports presented to the Parliament between February and September 2009.
As usual, these reports cover a range of agencies and highlight a number of areas of concern including:
the environmental impact of government procurement practice;
the efficiency of government IT systems and data management; and
ongoing issues within the aged care sector.
The Committee was impressed by the progress being made by a number of departments in achieving better practice in green office procurement and sustainable office management. However, we are concerned at the seeming lack of urgency and leadership at a sector-wide level and are making a number of recommendations to help correlate and disseminate best practice across government departments and agencies. In particular the Committee is recommending that the Department of Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts take a leadership role in promoting environmental management systems and develop a best practice environmental management system template with minimum standards for reporting.
Examination of the Defence Materiel Organisation’s management of the M113 Armoured Personnel Carrier Upgrade Project again highlighted ongoing concerns over scope changes and lengthy delays to Defence projects. Despite being assured that appropriate processes are In place to keep decision makers informed of scope changes, the Committee is concerned at the apparent lack of administrative discipline in implementing these processes. Accordingly we have asked the DMO for details on how it is ensuring staff adhere to the existing processes. Although the M113 project is expected to meet a completion deadline of December 2010, it is still assessed as ‘high risk’, therefore the Committee has asked Defence and the DMO to report back to us on the progress of the project.
On a related matter, the Committee reviewed the planning and approval of Defence Major Capital Equipment Projects to determine whether the two-pass approval process is being implemented effectively. The audit report identified a number of anomalies between process and practice and the Committee made three recommendations aimed at ensuring the accuracy of documentation, records and submissions.
The Committee was satisfied from its inquiry into the quality and integrity of the Department of Veterans’ Affairs income support records that, although the system has experienced difficulties, there have been no instances of incorrect payments being made to DVA clients. However, we are concerned at the discrepancies and errors identified in the audit report and the lack of progress in implementing a comprehensive and accurate electronic database for the Department. There is potential for a detrimental flow-on effect with regard to client payments and service delivery. The Committee has asked the DVA to report back to us on the implementation of the new information technology system.
On examining the review of the management of the Movement Alert List by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, the Committee was particularly concerned over the number of Australian citizens listed on the system. We are satisfied that the Department has substantially reduced this number since the audit but urge DIAC to revise its policy and guidelines regarding the recording of Australian citizens on the system, to ensure a consistent approach is taken in future. Of further concern to the Committee is the lack of performance data available making it difficult to assess MAL’s effectiveness. We have asked the Department to identify and report back to the Committee on specific instances where MAL has influenced decisions on visa and citizenship applications.
The Committee also examined DIAC’s management of the Settlement Grants Program. The Committee is concerned that the effectiveness of the SGP is not being satisfactorily monitored and evaluated to determine if it is meeting its objective to help new arrivals to settle into Australian society. We are not convinced that enough is being done to identify and respond to the needs of immigrants at a local level and support programs specifically tailored to those needs. We have therefore asked the Department to report back to the Committee detailing how the effectiveness of the Program is being measured with regard to data collection and community consultation.
In this batch of reports, we pursued an ongoing interest in the aged care sector by reviewing two audits: the planning and allocation of aged care places and capital grants and the protection of residential aged care accommodation bonds. The first audit assessed the effectiveness of the Department of Health and Ageing’s management of the planning and allocation of aged care places and capital grants, in accordance with the Aged Care Act 1997. The Committee is pleased to note that, overall, the planning and allocation of aged care places and capital grants by the Department is operating effectively.
The second audit was designed to assess the Department of Health and Ageing’s administration of prudential arrangements for the protection of residential aged care accommodation bonds. The Committee understands the importance of these bonds to the capital growth of aged care facilities and acknowledges that to date no aged care clients have suffered the loss of their bonds. However, we are concerned at the potential for loss to occur and would like to see the prudential regulation strengthened with more attention paid to risk management implementation and ongoing monitoring. To this end, we have asked the Department to report back to the Committee on the implementation of the ANAO recommendations.
Finally, the Committee looked at the construction of the Christmas Island Immigration Detention Centre. While the Committee recognises that it is difficult at this distance to apportion blame, we are gravely concerned at the mismanagement of Commonwealth funds for this project. The substantial discrepancy between the initial cost estimate and final cost of the project and the apparent failure to identify significant risk factors in the project are of particular concern. The Committee feels that more could have been done during the planning stage to develop a realistic estimate of the cost of the project and we are not satisfied with the argument that the uniqueness of the project led to such serious miscalculation of costs and risks.
The Committee acknowledges that this project was a catalyst for the implementation by Finance of the two-stage Cabinet approval process and the Gateway Review process. We have recommended that the ANAO undertake an audit to determine the effectiveness of the Implementation of both these processes in mitigating risk for Commonwealth construction projects.
We would like to acknowledge the valuable work of the Auditor-General and the staff at the Australian National Audit Office. We look forward to continuing reviews of the Auditor-General’s reports.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Public Accounts and Audit Committee</title>,Committees,57,1

JOINT COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT REPORT 417: REVIEW OF AUDITOR-GENERAL’S REPORTS TABLED BETWEEN

FEBRUARY 2009 AND SEPTEMBER 2009


TABLING STATEMENT


24 JUNE 2010

Mr President, on behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present the Committee’s Report 417: Review of Auditor-General’s Reports tabled between February 2009 and September 2009.
The Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, as prescribed by the Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act 1951, examines all of the reports of the Auditor-General and reports the results of the Committee’s deliberations to the Parliament.
This report details the findings of the Committee’s examination of nine performance audits tabled in 2009. These nine reports were selected for further scrutiny from the seventeen audit reports presented to the Parliament between February and September 2009.
As usual, these reports cover a range of agencies and highlight a number of areas of concern including:
the environmental impact of government procurement practice;
the efficiency of government IT systems and data management; and
ongoing issues within the aged care sector.
The Committee was impressed by the progress being made by a number of departments in achieving better practice in green office procurement and sustainable office management. However, we are concerned at the seeming lack of urgency and leadership at a sector-wide level and are making a number of recommendations to help correlate and disseminate best practice across government departments and agencies. In particular the Committee is recommending that the Department of Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts take a leadership role in promoting environmental management systems and develop a best practice environmental management system template with minimum standards for reporting.
Examination of the Defence Materiel Organisation’s management of the M113 Armoured Personnel Carrier Upgrade Project again highlighted ongoing concerns over scope changes and lengthy delays to Defence projects. Despite being assured that appropriate processes are In place to keep decision makers informed of scope changes, the Committee is concerned at the apparent lack of administrative discipline in implementing these processes. Accordingly we have asked the DMO for details on how it is ensuring staff adhere to the existing processes. Although the M113 project is expected to meet a completion deadline of December 2010, it is still assessed as ‘high risk’, therefore the Committee has asked Defence and the DMO to report back to us on the progress of the project.
On a related matter, the Committee reviewed the planning and approval of Defence Major Capital Equipment Projects to determine whether the two-pass approval process is being implemented effectively. The audit report identified a number of anomalies between process and practice and the Committee made three recommendations aimed at ensuring the accuracy of documentation, records and submissions.
The Committee was satisfied from its inquiry into the quality and integrity of the Department of Veterans’ Affairs income support records that, although the system has experienced difficulties, there have been no instances of incorrect payments being made to DVA clients. However, we are concerned at the discrepancies and errors identified in the audit report and the lack of progress in implementing a comprehensive and accurate electronic database for the Department. There is potential for a detrimental flow-on effect with regard to client payments and service delivery. The Committee has asked the DVA to report back to us on the implementation of the new information technology system.
On examining the review of the management of the Movement Alert List by the Department of Immigration and Citizenship, the Committee was particularly concerned over the number of Australian citizens listed on the system. We are satisfied that the Department has substantially reduced this number since the audit but urge DIAC to revise its policy and guidelines regarding the recording of Australian citizens on the system, to ensure a consistent approach is taken in future. Of further concern to the Committee is the lack of performance data available making it difficult to assess MAL’s effectiveness. We have asked the Department to identify and report back to the Committee on specific instances where MAL has influenced decisions on visa and citizenship applications.
The Committee also examined DIAC’s management of the Settlement Grants Program. The Committee is concerned that the effectiveness of the SGP is not being satisfactorily monitored and evaluated to determine if it is meeting its objective to help new arrivals to settle into Australian society. We are not convinced that enough is being done to identify and respond to the needs of immigrants at a local level and support programs specifically tailored to those needs. We have therefore asked the Department to report back to the Committee detailing how the effectiveness of the Program is being measured with regard to data collection and community consultation.
In this batch of reports, we pursued an ongoing interest in the aged care sector by reviewing two audits: the planning and allocation of aged care places and capital grants and the protection of residential aged care accommodation bonds. The first audit assessed the effectiveness of the Department of Health and Ageing’s management of the planning and allocation of aged care places and capital grants, in accordance with the Aged Care Act 1997. The Committee is pleased to note that, overall, the planning and allocation of aged care places and capital grants by the Department is operating effectively.
The second audit was designed to assess the Department of Health and Ageing’s administration of prudential arrangements for the protection of residential aged care accommodation bonds. The Committee understands the importance of these bonds to the capital growth of aged care facilities and acknowledges that to date no aged care clients have suffered the loss of their bonds. However, we are concerned at the potential for loss to occur and would like to see the prudential regulation strengthened with more attention paid to risk management implementation and ongoing monitoring. To this end, we have asked the Department to report back to the Committee on the implementation of the ANAO recommendations.
Finally, the Committee looked at the construction of the Christmas Island Immigration Detention Centre. While the Committee recognises that it is difficult at this distance to apportion blame, we are gravely concerned at the mismanagement of Commonwealth funds for this project. The substantial discrepancy between the initial cost estimate and final cost of the project and the apparent failure to identify significant risk factors in the project are of particular concern. The Committee feels that more could have been done during the planning stage to develop a realistic estimate of the cost of the project and we are not satisfied with the argument that the uniqueness of the project led to such serious miscalculation of costs and risks.
The Committee acknowledges that this project was a catalyst for the implementation by Finance of the two-stage Cabinet approval process and the Gateway Review process. We have recommended that the ANAO undertake an audit to determine the effectiveness of the Implementation of both these processes in mitigating risk for Commonwealth construction projects.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2010-06-24,"—In summing up this debate, I thank honourable senators for their contributions in relation to this, and I note that the coalition and the Australian Greens support the disallowance of these regulations. So clearly the numbers are with the disallowance. There are a couple of short points that I need to make. Firstly, I need to correct a statement that I made in the Senate during this debate when I said:
That means that in the unlikely event of an emergency an off-duty pilot who is on the flight but not on the flight deck at that time would not be allowed to access the cockpit to assist and ensure the safety of passengers, because that would be illegal.
Guy Maclean, from the Australian and International Pilots Association has made the point that that is not correct. The regulations do allow this to occur but only in reaction to the occurrence of a safety incident where the pilots are concerned that denying a pilot the jump seat removed the opportunity for a trained pilot to prevent an incident occurring in the first place. Furthermore, the pilots association made another point in relation to Senator Evans’s contribution on behalf of the government, when Senator Evans stated:
The government has placed responsibility for this important measure on the pilot who is operationally in charge of the aircraft at the time. If the chief pilot is on a sleep break or on a long-haul flight then responsibility rests with the pilot who is in command of the aircraft at the time.
The pilots association tells me that this is not correct. The regulations target only one person with criminal strict liability. The pilot in command, no matter where he is, what he is doing or who is flying the plane, is the one who is responsible, not the on-duty pilot, as the government has implied. There is only one pilot in command on a flight; this person never changes. That is something that I think needs to be pointed out.
The government has also made the point that if these regulations are disallowed there is nothing there. There is a void. That seems to be the argument. That is not the case. The situation is that we revert back to the initial regulations—the status quo that existed previously where there is no strict criminal liability but there are still safeguards in place in terms of cockpit security and where pilots are not being punished under a regime of strict liability, which is one that is unprecedented anywhere else, according to the Australian and International Pilots Association. I would urge the Senate to disallow these regulations so we can go back to a more sensible regime and encourage the government to negotiate this with airline pilots. I note the support of the coalition and the Australian Greens in relation to the disallowance of this motion, and I am grateful for that support.
 (Senator Trood)—The question is that the motion in the name of Senator Xenophon be agreed to. Those in favour say aye; those against say no.

Government senator—No.

Government senator —The noes have it.
—I remind honourable senators that if a division is called on a Thursday after 4.30 pm, the matter before the Senate shall be adjourned pursuant to standing order 57(3) until the next day of sitting at a time to be fixed by the Senate.

"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2010-06-24,"—I present the report of the Community Affairs References Committee, The hidden toll: suicide in Australia, together with the Hansard record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.
Ordered that the report be printed.
—by leave—I move:
That the Senate take note of the report.
Firstly, I would like to thank everybody who made submissions and gave evidence to the inquiry of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee into suicide in Australia. This was a deeply emotional and moving inquiry, and we very much appreciate the time and work people put into submissions and oral presentations. We heard many personal stories that were deeply moving. I would like to express thanks on behalf of the committee to all those people. I would also like to express thanks to the secretariat, who worked very hard on this committee and who also found it very moving and emotional.
This committee inquiry arose because, as the title of the report—The hidden toll: suicide in Australia—suggests, there is a hidden toll of suicide in this country. It was initiated because organisations such as Suicide Prevention Australia and Lifeline Australia were deeply concerned that statistics on suicide were not being accurately reported and that the statistics were much higher than was being reported. The Australian Bureau of Statistics, the ABS, was undertaking a review of statistics which came out during our inquiry. That review showed that the statistics are indeed substantially higher than is currently reported—in fact, the number is over 2,000. The figures, unfortunately, are nearly as high as our road toll. We know there is a lot of awareness around our road toll; there is not as much awareness around the issue of suicide. So, for a start, the committee recommends that we improve the accuracy of our reporting.
We think there is a need for standardisation of coronial investigation and findings of intent—it is different throughout the country. We need a single national suicide prevention strategy to clearly link all the efforts of government and community organisations. We listened very carefully to evidence from Patrick McGorry—among others—who told us that we need to have aspirational targets for suicide reduction. So we strongly recommend that the government adopts those aspirational targets. We make recommendations about the need for stigma reduction programs, because there is still a stigma around the issue of suicide which prevents people talking about it.
We talked about the issues around mental health and suicide. We received a lot of evidence around mental health. We heard about many positive programs. We recommend in the report that more money be allocated to mental health around Australia. We believe it is very important that successful programs currently operating around Australia continue to be funded and we recommend that funding for suicide prevention and for support of the bereaved is at least doubled. We have said ‘at least doubled’ because that was what was recommended by some witnesses—some recommended much higher. We think it should be at least doubled, and then current programs and strategies can be reviewed. We believe more resources are needed to address the issue of suicide. 
It is also very important that more training is available for those working on the front-lines in our communities—ambulance officers, police officers, nurses, doctors—to help them address the issue of suicide. Two of the recommendations that I am particularly strong on is the need to put people who have expertise in mental health and suicide in every emergency department in this country, because—would you believe?—that does not happen. Everybody that comes out of emergency or a stay in hospital needs to have a case management plan and a support person. I also strongly support the recommendation for ‘graded accommodation’, or step-up and step-down facilities, for people who are recovering from a suicide attempt or those who have suicidal ideation. It is important that those facilities are provided.
I will stop there because I know others want to speak and we are tight for time. But I very strongly recommend this report to the government and ask them to very seriously consider the recommendations from this inquiry. There is a hidden toll in this country, and we need to do something about it.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs References Committee</title>,Committees,60,1
"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2010-06-24,"—One of the great joys of being a member of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee is the amount of time we can devote to some of the most important issues that face Australia, and suicide prevention is by no means unusual in that sense. This has been an extraordinarily educative and at times harrowing process. Certainly it can only increase the enormous respect one has for people who live with bereavement as a result of suicide and for people who live with a mental illness that makes them consider suicide all the time.
I would like to concentrate on a couple of the recommendations. The first recommendation makes the point very strongly that the economic cost of suicide is minute compared to the social and emotional cost of suicide. But as a society we tend to notice the things that cost money. Current assessments from organisations like Lifeline and from people like Professor Patrick McGorry are that suicide costs the Australian economy at least $30 billion a year—which makes it well worth trying to reduce that rate just in economic terms. The flow-on social and economic benefits can only be wonderful for the country. We are suggesting that the Productivity Commission or an organisation such as that should look at the economic assessment of suicide and attempted suicide in Australia.
One thing I did not know until we did this inquiry was how large a problem suicide is in Australia. Professor Patrick McGorry, at a different launch this morning, made the point that it is the largest killer of people in the prime of their lives in Australia. In terms of lives lost every year in Australia, it is 40 per cent higher than the road toll. However, we obviously do much, much less about it than we do about the road toll.
As a former journalist, the other recommendation I would particularly like to focus on is recommendation 20, which is about how we go about reporting suicide and how we develop awareness of suicide. It has long been the view in Australia that reporting suicide has the potential to lead to copycat suicides, but the point is made that without strong public awareness campaigns and strong mainstream media reporting of the road toll very little would have happened to reduce the number of deaths on the roads. We have been highly successful in reducing the road toll with strong media awareness campaigns on the topic. It would be good to see the research done so that we can be confident that the guidelines that currently exist under Mindframe can be reviewed and adapted so that we do get public attention being paid to what is currently the greatest killer in Australia. On that same basis we recommend that, at least biannually, the national figures on suicide should be published. Again, stigma has prevented this from being the case. It needs to be brought out into the open now.
One fact that I did find disturbing, and Senator Siewert mentioned that we really have some problems in recording suicide and even assessing what sometimes constitutes suicide, is that we basically do not recognise the fact that people under 15 commit suicide. Those figures are not even collected as part of the statistics. There needs to be public conversation about what is a terrible tragedy and we certainly need to do something about the issue. I would very much hope that this report is widely read and accepted and that it leads to real changes in the way we deal with the question of suicide prevention.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs References Committee</title>,Committees,60,1
"Adams, Sen Judith",LP,2010-06-24,"—I rise to concur with my colleagues on the importance of this particular inquiry. It attracted 258 submissions, we held 12 public hearings throughout Australia, and we have come up with 42 recommendations. Each of those recommendations is very, very important, and I would like to speak about some of them.
There should be an increase in the funding and the number of projects for men. Unfortunately men, unlike women, are very loath to come forward and say they have a problem. Coming from a rural area, I know that there is a cohort of older farmers who really do have these problems, and in many rural areas there is no access to appropriate services and often no GP. Going to the local mental health service, which is often the only place for them to go to, is seen as a stigma. We do have Lifeline, and while we were in Hobart we were very fortunate to observe some of the volunteers working for that organisation. I think Lifeline should be commended on the work they do.
We feel that a separate strategy should be developed for Indigenous communities. In my own home state of Western Australia, not very far from where I live, we had 12 suicides of Indigenous young men over the course of four months. It was absolutely tragic. One suicide is tragic, but to have 12 in a community was very, very sad. It is great, though, to see the support that that community now has in the shape of the services that have been provided there and great also to see the way the community has pulled together to deal with the issue. I do hope they are able to go forward.
We feel that child suicides should be officially reported and that support group assistance should be developed for those who attempt suicide or self-harm. Often those who self-harm go to an emergency department but, because they have self-harmed, they are treated with complete disdain and are not given the service they should get. Quite a number of our witnesses gave us evidence to this effect.
Front-line emergency staff have been mentioned too, and I think they need terrific support. The town that had the 12 suicides was only small, and those emergency staff had to deal with one suicide after the other. On such occasions those people need so much support. Front-line emergency service people must be given debriefing and must be trained to deal with what they have to deal with.
In relation to mental health services, I feel that we need to put so much more into the area. Not every suicide is completed by someone who has a mental health problem, but most are. Somehow we have to pick up these people before they self-harm. Another recommendation is that additional suicide awareness and risk assessment training must be provided to the gatekeepers in regional, rural and remote areas. The cities do have services but, coming from a rural area, as I have said, I know that services are very few and far between.
Another group of people, the LGBTI people, must be recognised in suicide prevention strategies and policies, and targeted programs need to be developed for them. They seem to be left out and they are often very badly affected. We also feel that a national suicide bereavement strategy should be developed. The person who has completed a suicide is not there to deal with the tragic consequences, and bereaved families really have not been given the assistance they probably deserve. Once again, I must say that in rural areas these services are not readily available. There are some very, very good organisations that are doing great work, but there are just too few of them.
We really feel that we should have backup and support for recently released prisoners because often they have had problems. They come out of the prison and then do not have any backup services. So, all in all, I would like to thank the secretariat. With 12 public hearings, they had had to work very hard, and I think that they have done a wonderful job to produce the report for the committee. I also thank all those witnesses who have come before us in public hearings. It is not easy to come and sit before a Senate committee and tell about your personal life. I really commend all those who did that, because they certainly helped to give us the evidence in this report to go forward and to ask the government to support this problem.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Community Affairs References Committee</title>,Committees,60,1
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2010-06-24,"—I want very briefly to add something to the comments that have been made by the other members of the committee. This inquiry on suicide cannot be something that is left to sit on shelves. We have over 40 recommendations, which can be a little bit confronting for people, but the message from all of us who took part in this inquiry was that these recommendations come from the heart. What we were expecting from them was a greater awareness and some real action to come from the process that we were lucky enough to share in.
As is usual with the Senate Community Affairs References Committee, the number of people who came to tell us their personal experiences and to share in an act of hope and positive solution making allows us to move forward so that there will be some concerted effort in this country around the very important issue of suicide. There is not time to talk too much about it now, and I am sure that many people will continue to talk about this inquiry and the opportunities we have in the future, but I very much wanted to commend again the people who came and shared with us. When you see the inquiry—and I really hope that many people will get the chance to read it—you will see the depth of compassion and knowledge that people have chosen to give to our committee and then expected us to do something with. It is not just storytelling; it is an expectation that, by doing this quite difficult action—coming and talking with our committee—there will be a resultant action taken by the government. As have many people, I commend the work of the secretariat. I think it is most important that we move forward and make a concerted effort in this country to face up to the issues that have affected so many people and so many families so that these issues are not hidden and avoided. We can work together to make a better response in this country. With that, I seek leave to continue my remarks.

Coming from a rural area, I know that there is a cohort of older farmers who really do have these problems, and in many rural areas there is no access to appropriate services and often no GP. Going to the local mental health service, which is often the only place for them to go to, is seen as a stigma. We do have Lifeline, and while we were in Hobart we were very fortunate to observe some of the volunteers working for that organisation. I think Lifeline should be commended on the work they do.
We feel that a separate strategy should be developed for Indigenous communities. In my own home state of Western Australia, not very far from where I live, we had 12 suicides of Indigenous young men over the course of four months. It was absolutely tragic. One suicide is tragic, but to have 12 in a community was very, very sad. It is great, though, to see the support that that community now has in the shape of the services that have been provided there and great also to see the way the community has pulled together to deal with the issue. I do hope they are able to go forward.
We feel that child suicides should be officially reported and that support group assistance should be developed for those who attempt suicide or self-harm. Often those who self-harm go to an emergency department but, because they have self-harmed, they are treated with complete disdain and are not given the service they should get. Quite a number of our witnesses gave us evidence to this effect.
Front-line emergency staff have been mentioned too, and I think they need terrific support. The town that had the 12 suicides was only small, and those emergency staff had to deal with one suicide after the other. On such occasions those people need so much support. Front-line emergency service people must be given debriefing and must be trained to deal with what they have to deal with.
In relation to mental health services, I feel that we need to put so much more into the area. Not every suicide is completed by someone who has a mental health problem, but most are. Somehow we have to pick up these people before they self-harm. Another recommendation is that additional suicide awareness and risk assessment training must be provided to the gatekeepers in regional, rural and remote areas. The cities do have services but, coming from a rural area, as I have said, I know that services are very few and far between.
Another group of people, the LGBTI people, must be recognised in suicide prevention strategies and policies, and targeted programs need to be developed for them. They seem to be left out and they are often very badly affected. We also feel that a national suicide bereavement strategy should be developed. The person who has completed a suicide is not there to deal with the tragic consequences, and bereaved families really have not been given the assistance they probably deserve. Once again, I must say that in rural areas these services are not readily available. There are some very, very good organisations that are doing great work, but there are just too few of them.
We really feel that we should have backup and support for recently released prisoners because often they have had problems. They come out of the prison and then do not have any backup services. So, all in all, I would like to thank the secretariat. With 12 public hearings, they had had to work very hard, and I think that they have done a wonderful job to produce the report for the committee. I also thank all those witnesses who have come before us in public hearings. It is not easy to come and sit before a Senate committee and tell about your personal life. I really commend all those who did that, because they certainly helped to give us the evidence in this report to go forward and to ask the government to support this problem.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,60,2
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2010-06-24,"—I want very briefly to add something to the comments that have been made by the other members of the committee. This inquiry on suicide cannot be something that is left to sit on shelves. We have over 40 recommendations, which can be a little bit confronting for people, but the message from all of us who took part in this inquiry was that these recommendations come from the heart. What we were expecting from them was a greater awareness and some real action to come from the process that we were lucky enough to share in.
As is usual with the Senate Community Affairs References Committee, the number of people who came to tell us their personal experiences and to share in an act of hope and positive solution making allows us to move forward so that there will be some concerted effort in this country around the very important issue of suicide. There is not time to talk too much about it now, and I am sure that many people will continue to talk about this inquiry and the opportunities we have in the future, but I very much wanted to commend again the people who came and shared with us. When you see the inquiry—and I really hope that many people will get the chance to read it—you will see the depth of compassion and knowledge that people have chosen to give to our committee and then expected us to do something with. It is not just storytelling; it is an expectation that, by doing this quite difficult action—coming and talking with our committee—there will be a resultant action taken by the government. As have many people, I commend the work of the secretariat. I think it is most important that we move forward and make a concerted effort in this country to face up to the issues that have affected so many people and so many families so that these issues are not hidden and avoided. We can work together to make a better response in this country. With that, I seek leave to continue my remarks.

That the Senate take note of the report.
I chaired the latter part of this inquiry, which was driven in large part by senators Dana Wortley and Steve Fielding, and for that they deserve acknowledgment. Essentially, it arose out of the allegations by a number of workers at Australia Post about the manner in which Australia Post was allegedly treating workers when they got sick or became injured at work. I pay tribute to the quite significant numbers of workers who gave evidence to the committee, some in confidence, some in writing only, some by physical testimony. Not only did it take personal and emotional commitment and conviction from those workers but it essentially put their integrity at stake in many cases and took quite some personal courage.
Likewise, Australia Post, who would hardly have welcomed an inquiry of this nature, as far as the committee is concerned approached the inquiry in a constructive way. They were accepting of the fact of the inquiry. During the process of the inquiry—near the end of it, in fact—Australia Post and the union arrived at a new memorandum of understanding in respect of the use of facility nominated doctors, as Australia Post calls them, which was at the heart of the issues in dispute. They came up with a memorandum of understanding that put some boundaries and bases of understanding around the uses of facility nominated doctors for Australia Post workers. If that were all that came out of this inquiry, it alone is progress and therefore good.
However, we hope there will be more. The committee report makes a number of recommendations about systems and processes that Australia Post might consider implementing at the workplace to further define the use of facility nominated doctors and to further put some boundaries around the processes and systems that might be used in respect of facility nominated doctors. A more pertinent recommendation is that Australia Post consider ceasing using facility nominated doctors for workers compensation purposes.
That said, beyond the recommendations made about Australia Post considering mechanisms to increase worker buy-into and commitment to processes leading to their recovery from injury and rehabilitation at work, I speak on behalf of all committee members in saying that the committee hopes that the report is received with the constructive spirit which is intended and that the report contributes to continuing to improve workplace relations at Australia Post.

—Slowly dying—not with a bang but with a whimper!
—Slowly dying—that is probably a better way of putting it. The Electoral and Referendum Amendment (Modernisation and Other Measures) Bill 2010—everything bar the matter on which I intend to move amendments—was agreed through the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. We obviously support that as do, I presume, the minor parties and the government. We were disappointed that the postal vote application part of the bill under schedule 6 was inserted in what should have been a non-controversial bill. Given the hour, I will not make any further comments about that.

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2010-06-24,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

May I start by stating that I am extremely disappointed to hear that the Government has negotiated amendments to this Bill with the Opposition that will continue to allow political parties to distribute postal vote applications to constituents to which they can attach political advertising, and to allow political parties to receive postal votes to be forwarded to the Australian Electoral Commission.
I acknowledge the positive provisions of this Bill.
Australians will be able to provisionally be enrolled from the age of 16 years; it will be easier for people to apply for a postal vote, it will introduce flexibility for ballot papers to printed at the local level and it will provide clarification around the rights around inspection of the Electoral Roll, to name a few.
These are good amendments.
These amendments will further refine our electoral process and will engage more young Australians in the voting process.
But the two most important amendments proposed in this Bill, I have been advised, will not proceed because the Government has agreed to the Opposition’s amendments which will maintain the status quo.
The Government had the right idea—and my support—to prohibit written material from being attached to a postal vote application.
But the Opposition wants to continue to be able to send Constituents its party-political advertising along with a postal vote application.
Now if that doesn’t interfere with the process, then I don’t know what.
I know some might say that when a voter walks into his or her local school to cast their vote on Election Day, that they are bombarded by people handing out pamphlets and letters and badges and the like.
The difference here is that they don’t get to the ballot box and as they’re reading how to complete the form, there’s a piece of paper instructing them how to vote.
Further, I want to express my disappointment that the Government is willing to back down from this amendment which would have improved Australia’s electoral system.
The second amendment I am disappointed will not succeed is the one which sought to require postal voters to send their votes back to the political party which enables them to count votes before forwarding them on to the Australian Electoral Commission.
Again, this is a good amendment but as I understand it, the Government has agreed to the Opposition’s Amendment to remove this provision from the Bill.
I want to make it clear that I do not support the Opposition’s Amendments to this Bill, but I acknowledge that the Government has conceded to these Amendments in order to have this Bill passed.
This is an opportunity lost.
I support the more-administrative provisions of this Bill, but the two key changes to do with materials attached to postal vote applications and the banning of voters returning postal votes to political parties were good changes that the Government had put forward and which would have greatly improved our electoral system and democracy.",SENATE,<title>ELECTORAL AND REFERENDUM AMENDMENT (MODERNISATION AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,67,1

"Fierravanti-Wells, Sen Concetta",LP,2010-06-24,"—I rise to speak on the Healthcare Identifiers Bill 2010 and the Healthcare Identifiers (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2010. After all the ups and downs, it is interesting to see this bill finally come up. I want to place on the record that Minister Roxon has made comments in the other place criticising the coalition for supposedly blocking this. Here we are, almost at the death knell, and because they could not get their act together and get their programming right we are now dealing with this in a hurried manner. It has been shuffled down the list repeatedly.
Indeed, that is also the case with the National Preventive Health Agency and the legislation dealing with that. I raise this because we have to put up with the comments from Minister Roxon. She cannot get her facts right and so she puts out these silly press releases that tell us that it is being blocked by the opposition. The preventive health agency bill is one that I inherited when I became shadow minister for ageing, looking after health and ageing in this place. It has been sitting on my shelf for the last six or seven months. Why? Because this government has not been able to get its act together. It was with Senator Cormann when he was looking after health in this place, so can I just tell the minister to either get a copy of the Senate procedures and understand them or go back to the people that put order and procedure into the Senate and complain to them. Do not come out and complain to the opposition if you are having a hissy fit because your bills are not getting through the Senate.
Having said that, I now turn to the healthcare identifiers legislation. This bill is another example of this, and because of the time constraints I will not go through the various things this bill actually does. I do want to say that it is very important. This is a bill that goes to e-health. We support e-healt; indeed, it was an initiative started by the coalition. But it was very important that this bill be correct to ensure that the improvements in patient safety, medical care, privacy and coordination have a critical and solid foundation in relation to its future. It is important that we get this right.
In the lead-up to the last federal election we heard many promises from the former Prime Minister on health. For example, ‘We are going to plan to fix the hospitals.’ Indeed, one of the points we keep hearing about healthcare identifiers and e-health—and we heard it again last week in relation to the COAG inquiry—is that they are important. Yes, it is, but it is important that we do get it right. It is also interesting to see that there was a whole range of promises in relation to a whole lot of things on the grand hospital plan. Might I say that this was a plan approved by the gang of four, so again it was one of those rushed jobs where the formalities did not actually start until three weeks before COAG. Of course, the Prime Minister—the former Deputy Prime Minister—was right in there making those decisions.
I will not trawl through the various problems in relation to health, but I will say that in relation to e-health there were concerns about the original legislation. When we examine the history of this legislation we see a repeat of common features of the Rudd record on health: planning, rushed legislation and a lack of appropriate consultation with stakeholders. The lack of consultation, and putting out draft legislation where so much of the legislation was actually in regulations that were not put out, really caused a lot of angst for stakeholders. It was because of this angst that the coalition pushed for a Community Affairs inquiry. Regrettably, at the time of the hearing we still did not have the regulations. And as so much of the parameters of this was going to be in the regulations it was really unfortunate that they were not out in the public arena. Now, here we are, and it is, as I said, the death knell.
Another concern that was raised following the lack of consultation time available to stakeholders was the fact that this system was due to commence on 1 July this year. It defies belief that the government has delayed—and this comment needs to be made—providing software manufacturers and developers with the specifications to enable them to design the appropriate IT framework or to integrate healthcare identifiers into existing packages.
Concerns were also raised about the breadth of this legislation. In particular, there was potential for privacy laws to be overridden if the action was in relation to disclosure under any other law. Given the reports in the press, particularly in the Australian on 2 March this year—and we trawled through this at the committee hearing—about concerns and allegations raised against Medicare Australia staff in relation to inappropriate viewing of confidential patient records without authority in the past financial year, it was really important that the parameters in relation to access to healthcare identifying information work were properly delineated.
There were additional concerns in the minority report and I contributed to that minority report. It must be stressed that, whilst we do not oppose this legislation, we thought it was important that stakeholders be given that further opportunity for consultation through the committee process. One of the concerns was this potential function creep and the use of healthcare identifiers being extended to other purposes. The final concern was the possibility that the scheme would not be ready for implementation on 1 July.
The coalition presented eight amendments to the government and in a press release on 21 June the responsible shadow minister, Dr Southcott, stated that there were discussions in relation to amendments put to the government. They covered four basic areas: to prescribe the requirements for assigning a healthcare identifier to a healthcare provider or recipient as a schedule in the bill; to confirm that the operator of the health identifying service can only be changed by legislation; to provide a guarantee of a right of appeal or review under section 9 of the proposed legislation; and to delete the provisions which allow the healthcare identifier to be released if permitted under another law. We believed that these amendments would significantly improve the legislation and urged the government to support them.
We are very pleased that Minister Roxon has significantly backed down from the original legislation. We believed that the Labor government needed to go much further to ensure important privacy protections and prevent function creep. Therefore, we are pleased that Minister Roxon has heeded our concerns and accepted six of our amendments—namely, those going to requiring legislation to change the service operator from Medicare, those requiring legislation to proscribe the data source, definitions for healthcare providers to be done by way of legislation and not regulation which is very important, and requirements for assigning identifiers to be done by legislation and again not by regulation.
Our two remaining amendments were in relation to limiting the disclosure of information and removing a person’s ability to disclose information under another law, a concern raised at the inquiry. Following discussions with stakeholders such as NETA and after exploring the issue with the government, there are legitimate concerns with the operation of the outstanding two amendments about the potential to overly restrict the use of health identifiers and potentially expose clinicians to offences for aspects of routine health care. As I said, very little time was afforded to stakeholders to submit their views on the draft legislation and not all these concerns were addressed. For legislation such as this, which is very important and deals with highly confidential healthcare information, it is vital that it is right.
I conclude by saying that the coalition will not oppose the legislation and we will not oppose the government’s amendments. We will also not be moving our amendments, given most of our concerns have been taken up by government amendments. I am not sure what the position is in relation to the Green amendments and Senator Siewert may clarify that. We saw some Greens amendments which allow individuals to opt out of the identifier scheme. The coalition will not support the Greens amendments which we believe are unnecessary at this stage. Critically, this will be dealt with in the next step which is the electronic health record. This will be an opt-in system in that you will have to provide explicit consent to have a personally controlled electronic health record.",SENATE,<title>HEALTHCARE IDENTIFIERS BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,69,1

"Xenophon, Sen Nick",IND,2010-06-24,"—The incorporated speech read as follows—

The Healthcare Identifiers Bill 2010 is the first Bill that will introduce an e-health system to Australia.
e-Health is, to use a cliché, the way of the future.
Similar systems are in place or being developed in Europe, Canada and the USA and I’ve been advised that the technology currently being used has been not only highly secure but incredibly useful and beneficial.
e-Health offers doctors and patients access to accurate, up-to-date medical records and health information.
It will make changing doctors or being referred to specialists easier, especially for patients with complex medical conditions.
And having been in that boat myself, I can see how it will be helpful.
The transfer of records, x-rays, test results ... all the information we as patients forget or remember incorrectly, will be available to any doctor we see, anywhere in Australia, with the appropriate permissions, which can only benefit treatment of patients.
Such a system will also help to monitor ‘doctor shoppers’; patients who move from one doctor to another in order to collect multiple prescriptions, often in order to feed prescription drug habits.
However, while I do support the introduction of e-health, even at this very initial stage, I do have concerns regarding privacy.
I note that the Government has acknowledged these stakeholder concerns also, and I appreciate that.
It is vital that such a system does not compromise an individual’s privacy with regards not only to their health history but also any identifying information.
And as this scheme develops, I indicate now that I will be monitoring subsequent legislation very closely to ensure that the privacy of Australians remains in tact.
I understand that there have also been concerns expressed around ‘function creep’; that the Unique Healthcare Identifier number may gradually be expanded to include purposes and functions it was not originally intended to be used for.
The legislation as it currently stands only allocates the use of the Unique Healthcare Identifier to health, and it must stay this way.
I think it’s important at this stage that we recognise that this particular Bill does not establish the actual working system of electronic health records; it simply puts the framework for such a system to be established in place.
Therefore, there will be further stages where thorough review will be conducted and I look forward to debating the subsequent legislation concerning the implementation of this scheme, and the associated issues that will be raised with it.
I support this Bill, and I support the establishment of e-Health in Australia.
I believe that, with the appropriate scrutiny and safeguards, that such a system will be a good thing for Australians, and a positive step in improving our healthcare system.",SENATE,<title>HEALTHCARE IDENTIFIERS BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,69,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2010-06-24,"—This is just another example of the farce in this chamber this afternoon. We got a phone call asking if we would consider bringing the Healthcare Identifiers Bill 2010 and the Healthcare Identifiers (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2010 on and, in trying to facilitate the debate, I said: ‘Yes, I have amendments. I am happy to decide them on the voices and I won’t call a division. We will try and facilitate this getting through the chamber.’ About five minutes later we got another phone call saying, ‘No, it’s not coming on.’ I sent my staff home. Nobody had the courtesy to phone my office to tell me this bill was coming back on. In fact, I would not have known if I had not been in the chamber for the previous bill. Since when is that good government process? I could call a division right now on my amendment and you would not be able to finish this. It is only my good grace that prevents me from doing that.
Now I have that off my chest, I will address the bill. This is an important piece of legislation and it deserves to be treated better than this. This is setting up a system that is very important for the future of the health system in our country. It is quite controversial. This is the first bit of that legislation and e-health is very controversial. I realise that this is only an initial phase, but a lot of people see this as the thin end of the wedge, which is why we have been paying such close attention to this legislation. This bill sets up a national system for identifying healthcare consumers and sets out the purposes for which healthcare identifiers can be used. It establishes a national healthcare identifiers service to allow electronic communication between healthcare providers.
I know there remains a great deal of confusion as to whether this legislation is about electronic health records or creating the building blocks for the e-health system which is why people are anxious. This is why it is important for us to have a proper debate so that people actually understand the sequence, what the identifiers mean and what the electronic records mean. This deals with establishing the foundation of a future electronic health record. The Greens believe that universal data will contribute to reducing the incidence of misadventure, save costs and inform performance across our health system. In order to get to that point, we have to start somewhere. As such and with a number of caveats for the future development of electronic health records, the Greens will support this legislation.
However, it seems disingenuous to discuss the issue of healthcare identifiers without consideration of the wider issues of electronic health records, because this is the initial building block. The minister commented in her second reading speech:
The development of a national e-health system will improve safety and quality and patient convenience by ensuring that the right people have access to the right information at the right time.
               …              …              …
The implementation of a healthcare identifiers system for patients and healthcare providers is an important step towards building an effective national e-health system.
The first time many Australians will be aware that they have been assigned the identification number is when they visit a doctor’s office or a Medicare office and a staff member asks them for their identifying information.
In the UK, University College London has just released a report that evaluates the early stages in the development and implementation of electronic health records in the UK national health system. The report, titled The devil’s in the detail, highlights the differences between both sides in this debate. On the one hand, there is the view that centrally stored electronic summaries, accessible by patients and authorised staff, are a part of a broader common good. Advocates speak of choice, empowerment, quality, safety, efficiency and personalised care. The opposite view portrays policymakers as being seduced by a vision of technological utopia, professional leaders as being obsessed with standardisation, the public as being largely disengaged and the government as extending electronic surveillance into intimate parts of citizens’ lives. The problem is that both versions can, unfortunately, be backed up by evidence to some extent.
A unique electronic patient identifier, in conjunction with an electronic health card, was first advocated by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Family and Community Affairs in 1997. The National Electronic Health Records Taskforce recommended in its report in 2000 that a national health information network be developed. The report cited the benefits of national health identifiers and talked about increased community safety, informed consumers being able to make better choices, better healthcare providers providing better health care, provider access to healthcare information, fewer diagnostic tests, improved warning systems, better planning and coordinated healthcare provision.
The National E-Health Transition Authority was endorsed by health ministers and set to work on e-health priorities. One of these priorities was the development of the patient identifier system, which, when combined with a product and medical database and national healthcare provider index, was to form part of the shared e-health record. In June 2009 the government’s National Health and Hospitals Reform Commission endorsed the directions proposed in the e-health strategy on the understanding that personalised health records remain at all times owned and controlled by individuals, who must approve access to these records.
The Senate committee inquiry into healthcare identifiers found that, while most who submitted evidence were supportive of identifiers, concerns were expressed around three themes: protecting the privacy of healthcare consumers from unauthorised access to their medical records; function creep, whereby healthcare identifiers start to be used for purposes other than that for which they were originally intended; and the implementation of the legislation by 1 July this year. It was widely acknowledged by witnesses and submissions to the inquiry that there was a need for a single healthcare identifier as proposed in the bills. In the words of one witness:
This is a fundamental building block that we know has direct payback, immediate payback, in terms of patient safety and cost reduction.
The Consumers Health Forum provided in their testimony a sense of the efficiency gains that a single healthcare identifier can bring for health consumers. The Nursing Federation also expressed support for healthcare identifiers.
Few witnesses or submissions disputed the concepts of healthcare identifiers and e-health. They did not dispute that they were likely to improve delivery and administration of health care in Australia. So it is not that people do not support identifiers; what they have concerns about are privacy and other concerns that I have listed. However, there remains confusion about what this initial piece of legislation does. The issue was identified by the Consumers Health Forum, which noted:
Many privacy concerns that were raised with us are valid … but they relate mostly to e-health records as opposed to individual health identifiers …
This debate is important so that people understand that we are just talking about the identifiers at the moment. This legislation does not allow access to patients’ records. All that further information comes through the e-health process. These bills cover only the creation of a national system to accurately identify healthcare consumers and healthcare providers. They do not allow medical and clinical information to be attached to an individual healthcare identifier—although it is not correct to say that these are unrelated concepts; of course they are.
The Privacy Commissioner emphasised:
Different privacy issues will arise if healthcare identifiers are to be used for expanded purposes within the national health system and if clinical information is to be associated, or held, with a healthcare identifier. In particular we would be concerned if healthcare identifiers could be used for expanded purposes without further consultation and Parliamentary scrutiny being required.
The Privacy Foundation was strongly opposed to the bills and claimed that the benefits to patients that were likely to come from the introduction of healthcare identifiers were outweighed by risks to individual privacy. The foundation asserted that the security of electronic information is difficult to guarantee and suggested that clinical staff may share secure information. These issues are all really felt by people and need to be addressed. If you talk to doctors, nurses and allied health workers, they are quite frank about the fact that they share logon details, passwords and patient records. I am not convinced that electronic health records are somehow less safe than what already exists. As was also pointed out during the Senate inquiry, there are currently privacy breaches in the clinical environment.
Some have argued that the risk to the privacy and security of information lies in the fact that health identifiers are being considered in isolation from future legislation. However, I am not convinced by that argument, which is why we are supporting the bills. We understand very clearly that separate legislation will be needed for e-health records. That is why, as I said, we are keen to make sure that we articulate that we have some concerns about e-health. I am not saying we oppose it; I am saying that there are issues that need to be fixed. We have spoken with the government about our concerns about privacy, which is one of the reasons I am putting up an amendment about opting out. This came up at the Senate inquiry, and the government said that it had looked into it and that it is too hard to opt out. However, they do it in the UK, which is why I will move an amendment. We understand that people do not have to use their identifier number, but people are concerned that there is a number against their name on the record. That still remains a concern for us—it is not the same as opting out—and that is why I will move the amendment. As people will be aware, I also have a second reading amendment, and if people read it they will see exactly the recommendations of the Senate committee report around the involvement of stakeholder groups as the system develops and as the implementation plan develops. It talks about publication of this plan before it is finalised and the development of a targeted education communication strategy.
We think this provides good safeguards around the identifier process and recommend it to the House. We will be watching the development of both this and the e-health process very carefully. We believe there are very strong reasons why we want to go to an e-health process, but there are concerns that need to be addressed. In supporting this we are saying that, yes, we support this first step but we have some concerns. We want to work through the e-health process very carefully and understand people’s particular concerns about privacy. If people are concerned about the privacy of their electronic records, they may actually be deterred—for specific illnesses—from seeking health care, and that is a very strong concern for us. We need to make sure those provisos are there. I move:
At the end of the motion, add:
but the Senate calls on the Government to ensure:
the involvement of key healthcare stakeholder groups, including state and territory governments, private and community health providers, and healthcare consumer groups, in the development of a Healthcare Identifiers Service implementation plan which covers the period from now to 30 June 2012;
the publication of this plan for public comment prior to its finalisation; and
the development and implementation of a targeted education and communication strategy which targets both healthcare providers and healthcare consumers, and which clearly lays out the facts behind healthcare identifiers and provides contacts for people to access further detailed information. This strategy should be implemented prior to the Healthcare Identifiers Service coming into effect and no later than 30 June 2012.",SENATE,<title>HEALTHCARE IDENTIFIERS BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,69,1
"Boyce, Sen Sue",LP,2010-06-24,"—I can do nothing but reiterate the comments of Senator Fierravanti-Wells and Senator Siewert about the bizarre and quixotic way the government has gone about attempting to bring this legislation in. After lunch today, this legislation was not on the list, yet Minister Roxon has been lecturing the coalition for months now about how we needed to get our act together to get this legislation through. In terms of getting one’s act together, I do not think I have seen any thing more bizarre than today’s activities. The government did not have this on the list; now the government has it on the list. As I understand it, the identifier system that this legislation will support is supposed to start operating on 1 July. It cannot do that without this legislation. We are now informed that the House of Representatives, where the government has the majority, is about to stop sitting, or has stopped sitting, and therefore this legislation cannot go back to them to be passed in time for it to start on 1 July. I have subsequently been told by Senator Siewert that this legislation is now not supposed to start until 1 October. Can we get this right? I continue to be bemused by Minister Roxon’s pathetic efforts to get legislation through and her attempts to blame us for it. I would like to read to the Senate a line from an article by Karen Dearne in the Australian on 1 June. She said:
One month out from the start of the Rudd government’s mandatory Healthcare Identifiers regime, Medicare is yet to sign a contract for service delivery.
They had not signed up the service deliverer a month out from when they said the only thing stopping this from happening was the opposition’s opposition. What complete and utter garbage! In any other organisation the current health minister would be out of a job in 10 seconds. She is the implementer from hell. Given the record of this government, she will probably get a promotion. Implementation is certainly not high on their agenda, and the way that they have gone about this is even more hopeless.
—Nurse Roxon might become Dr Roxon!
—That is true. I certainly think that this effort will probably earn Minister Roxon a very, very big promotion, given that implementing successfully is a black mark against you in this government.
The coalition has long had a supportive attitude to e-health. Ten years ago we began the process of getting Australia an e-health program. The groups that will particularly benefit from this are people with chronic illness who need frequently to go to doctors and specialist for tests and who need frequently to tell their health professionals what has been done. In the end, this program is the first step towards a system which can be automatically brought up on their computer. We are currently in a situation where this cannot now proceed from 1 July. This is entirely in the hands of the government and Minister Roxon. Even if it were to proceed, there is absolutely no confidence anywhere that it is going to work. As I said, a month out, Medicare had not been signed up as the contract service provider.
During estimates, I asked questions on this area. In early June NEHTA, the National E-health Transition Authority, had finally managed to get itself sufficiently sorted out to invite medical software companies to tender and to get involved in the process of providing the software. On 6 June they had signed up three companies out of a potential 200. Had the trials happened? No. We kept being told that NEHTA had trialled the identifier systems with Medicare in a practice environment but there had been no real testing. Yet every medical software developer in the country has said, ‘You’ll need at least six months of live testing to have any confidence that what you are going to do will work.’
In the middle of this we already have concerns about Medicare wrongly sending out information, wrongly advising GPs of tests and getting the current Medicare numbers confused, let alone using a system that is meant to be more sophisticated than they currently have. I want to give you a sense of the size of this. I asked for an idea of what was going to be involved. The list goes like this: 100 million GP consultations, 100 million GP prescriptions, 200 million medications dispensed, 40 million GP pathology requests, 60 million pathology reports to GPs, 10 million GP imaging requests, 10 million imaging reports to GPs, eight million GP specialist referrals, and eight million specialist reports to GPs. That just begins to give you the scope of what this system is designed to deal with.
They cannot get themselves to stay long enough to get their own legislation through. They cannot get their medical software industry consulted in a timely fashion. Why would we believe that they could ever implement this system correctly? We agree with the Pharmacy Guild and the AMA that we should just get on with this. If there are problems with it, let’s fix them and just get on with passing this legislation and getting the system going. But how can we?",SENATE,<title>HEALTHCARE IDENTIFIERS BILL 2010</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,69,1
"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2010-06-24,"—This debate is perhaps more important than many honourable senators appreciate. It has long-term implications for our community. Senators more eloquent than I have pointed out the importance of e-health. It will assist in the diagnosis and treatment of illness and it will help patients in rural areas particularly, and it is true that services will be cheaper and, perhaps, more efficient. But there are implications for privacy, and they are fundamental concerns in any liberal democracy. The balance to be struck between the efficient delivery of government services and medical services on the one hand and the right of individuals to keep intimate information private on the other is a difficult one. One of the best examples of this the most intimate of all information: the health record. For example, we have a public figure, a politician, who suffers from depression. We now know that there will be hundreds of thousands of people who will potentially have access to those records. If those records are not absolutely confidential it could, for example, not only destroy the parliamentarian’s career but also potentially influence national security.
These are weighty, difficult and important issues. Whenever a state or government seeks to number its citizens, it bears the heavy onus of showing why that is necessary. As Senator Siewert mentioned, the fear amongst some members of the community is that this bill could provide the architecture for a national surveillance system. All of us would agree that we should never meet the needs of government and administrative convenience and meekly surrender to perpetual surveillance. No government efficiency is ever worth some sort of Orwellian dystopia. Mr Rudd was never quite Big Brother and I am sure the new Prime Minister, Ms Gillard, is no big sister, but all democrats should share a scepticism of enhancing the capacity of the state to monitor and survey its citizens. All of us should share that scepticism, and government bears the heavy onus of showing why it is absolutely necessary.
The purpose of these bills is to establish an individual health identification number for every Australian. Whilst the coalition supports the uptake of important advances in the delivery of contemporary medicine such as e-health, the fundamental problem with these bills is that it is so hard to determine where we are going to go from here. The bills are essentially incomplete. They cover only a small but essential element of a much broader health identification and surveillance system, including future personal e-health records. They leave so much detail to be worked out later on by parliament and administratively, and that is the difficulty. It is very hard to know where the government will go next.
Any data-matching scheme, and these bills contemplate a data-matching scheme, must look at two essential elements. First, who has control over the access to the data, the information or the unique number? Second, what data is linked to that unique number, to that individual health identifier? Both those aspects must be controlled and very closely monitored by the Commonwealth parliament. We must never abdicate our responsibility to another parliament, to a minister or to administrators. That is why I strongly argue that any extension of the use of information or a unique number should be explicitly authorised by the Commonwealth parliament.
Function creep, as Senator Siewert mentioned, is the most significant issue not addressed by government and not sufficiently appreciated in this debate. Under these bills, health information may be disclosed for other purposes not detailed in the bill where that disclosure is authorised under another law. This means that it might be authorised by other Commonwealth, state or territory legislation or regulation. I believe that, where other agencies seek access to a unique identifying number or any information attached to it, access to such information should not be granted automatically by virtue of other Commonwealth legislation or, more importantly, by regulations or legislation passed by a territory or state parliament. This will ensure that the Commonwealth parliament retains direct oversight and responsibility for any extension of the entitlement to access information by government agencies.
The individual health identifier, that number, is a creature of the Commonwealth parliament. No other parliament should be entitled to legislate access for their own instrumentalities. For example, why should the Queensland parliament, the parliament of my home state, be able to legislate access for the Queensland Police Service? Why should they be able to do that? In my view they should not. No-one should be able to legislate for access to this unique identifying number except the Commonwealth parliament. So should access to this unique number be at the mercy of state parliaments or even regulations made by state parliaments? No, it should not. I accept that this number might facilitate administration but this parliament and this parliament alone should decide who has access to this information—not a state and not a territory and not their parliaments. It is as simple as that.
The second issue, and there is progress on this, in any data-matching scheme is that the Commonwealth parliament should explicitly authorise what information or what data is linked to the individual’s unique number. The parliament should explicitly authorise the data that is linked to this number. It has critical implications for privacy. The responsibility for that can never go anywhere other than to the Commonwealth parliament—not to a minister by regulation and not to other parliaments. We have had progress on this issue and I hope that the government will move an amendment to address this issue. I understand they will and I look forward to it.
My friend Senator Fierravanti-Wells has spoken about the appointment of a service operator. To save time I will not go into that. I understand that is being addressed. Guaranteeing the right of appeal I understand is also being addressed and I will not address that either. I understand those issues have been catered for by the government.
The compulsory nature of the scheme means it is compulsory to have a number. Every Australian will have to have a number. I am not happy about that. Ideally, citizens should be able to opt out if they do not want it. But I understand that you will not need to provide a number to supply or to obtain medical services, so this is something that is at least better than it was. I thank the government at least for that.
I conclude with a few remarks which I make somewhat pointedly. With the passage of this bill we have the first essential element of a national identification scheme. For the first time since World War II we will have a unique identification number for every Australian, and we have never had that before. Neither the Medicare number nor the tax file number is universal and none of them is compulsory. My point is that this is a unique identifying number for every Australian. If it is the intention of the government to use these bills and this number as a legislative subterfuge for the introduction of a national ID card, they have got it wrong. I raise it for this reason. The previous government tried to use the argument that to facilitate the access to welfare with a smart card was a good idea.
—We cancelled that.
—Yes. In fact, I chaired the committee that, without dissent, recommended against the adoption of that scheme. You may remember that, Acting Deputy President Trood. Why? Because that would have led to a de facto national identification scheme and an ID card.
The critical issue for this parliament over the next few months when this debate is fully ventilated will be this: what form will the use of this number take? Will it be a number on a card with a photo? If it is, let me put this on the record. It will become a de facto national identification number. The critical part of this debate that has not been caught today is how the government is going to use this number and how individual Australians will carry it. This is a critical issue for the citizens of this country. If the government is trying to use this to camouflage a broader intention to bring in an ID card or some such thing, they should think again. If there is an attempt by any government to extend access to this unique number beyond health professionals, or to expand the data to be collected beyond patient records and health matters, or to use the unique number as part of a de facto ID card, this debate will erupt. It will not be like a nice calm debate on the last Thursday before eight weeks without sittings; this debate will erupt. To any public servant, any doctor, any lobbyist or any politician who thinks that these bills are the first step towards greater surveillance of our citizens, I say they should think again.

—It is de facto.
—I am happy to add ‘or a de facto national ID card’. I am advised that it is even specific within the legislation itself.
—But that does not stop it from being used de facto.

"Trood, Sen Russell (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)",N/A,2010-06-24,"— On behalf of the President, and in accordance with the usual practice, I table a report of parliamentary committee reports to which the government has not responded within the prescribed time. The report has been circulated to honourable senators. With the concurrence of the Senate, the report will be incorporated in Hansard.

The report read as follows—


PRESIDENT’S REPORT TO THE SENATE ON GOVERNMENT RESPONSES OUTSTANDING TO PARLIAMENTARY COMMITTEE REPORTS AS AT 24 JUNE 2010


PREFACE

This document continues the practice of presenting to the Senate twice each year a list of government responses to Senate and joint committee reports as well as responses which remain outstanding.
The practice of presenting this list to the Senate is in accordance with the resolution of the Senate of 14 March 1973 and the undertaking by successive governments to respond to parliamentary committee reports in timely fashion. On 26 May 1978 the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Withers) informed the Senate that within six months of the tabling of a committee report, the responsible minister would make a statement in the Parliament outlining the action the government proposed to take in relation to the report. The period for responses was reduced from six months to three months in 1983 by the incoming government. The Leader of the Government in the Senate announced this change on 24 August 1983. The method of response continued to be by way of statement. Subsequently, on 16 October 1991 [tabled 5 Nov 1991] the government advised that responses to committee reports would be made by letter to a committee chair, with the letter being tabled in the Senate at the earliest opportunity. The government affirmed this commitment in June 1996 to respond to relevant parliamentary committee reports within three months of presentation. The current government indicated on 26 June and 4 December 2008 that it is committed to providing timely responses to parliamentary committee reports. 1

This list does not usually include reports of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works or the following Senate Standing Committees: Appropriations and Staffing, Selection of Bills, Privileges, Procedure, Publications, Regulations and Ordinances, Senators’ Interests and Scrutiny of Bills. However, such reports will be included if they require a response. Government responses to reports of the Public Works Committee are normally reflected in motions in the House of Representatives for the approval of works after the relevant report has been presented and considered.
Reports of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit (JCPAA) primarily make administrative recommendations but may make policy recommendations. A government response is required in respect of such policy recommendations made by the committee. However, responses to administrative recommendations are made in the form of an executive minute provided to, and subsequently tabled by, the committee. Agencies responding to administrative recommendations are required to provide an executive minute within six months of the tabling of a report. The committee monitors the provision of such responses.
An entry on this list for a report of the JCPAA containing only administrative recommendations is annotated to indicate that the response is to be provided in the form of an executive minute. Consequently, any other government response is not required. However, any reports containing policy recommendations are included in this report as requiring a government response.
Committees report on bills and the provisions of bills. Only those reports in this category that make recommendations which cannot readily be addressed during the consideration of the bill, and therefore require a response, are listed. The list also does not include reports by committees on estimates or scrutiny of annual reports, unless recommendations are made that require a response.

*      See document tabled in the Senate on 23 June 2010, entitled Government Responses to Parliamentary Committee Reports–Response to the schedule tabled by the President of the Senate on 26 November 2009 for Government interim/final response.
**   Report contains administrative recommendations – any response to those recommendations is to be provided direct to the JCPAA committee in the form of an executive minute.

"Brown, Sen Carol",ALP,2010-06-24,"—In this place last week, we heard some extraordinary remarks from Senator Bushby. It would seem that once again Senator Bushby has resorted to political grandstanding in a disappointing attempt to score cheap political points. Senator Bushby’s claim that Tasmania has suffered from neglect from the federal Labor government is beyond belief.
Let us start where all good public policy begins and that is with a strong economy. Only the Labor government advocated appropriate public policy to shield the Australian economy from the worst effects of the global recession. Need I remind Senator Bushby that he was part of an opposition that, in the face of the greatest financial crisis in 75 years, advocated a wait-and-see approach. That’s right: Senator Bushby and his colleagues wanted to sit on their hands and do nothing. By doing nothing, they would have plunged the Australian economy into recession, because that is exactly what a do-nothing approach would have achieved. Doing nothing would have abandoned workers at a time when they most needed support.
Let us contrast this with what we on this side of the chamber did. We acted quickly and decisively to implement a range of short-, medium- and long-term stimulus measures to protect the Australian economy from the worst effects of the global recession. The stimulus measures have helped support thousands of Australian jobs in these difficult economic times.
It was Labor that acted to protect the interests of Tasmanian workers, and the actions taken by the Labor government seem to have been vindicated, with the Australian economy being one of the best performing economies in the advanced world. We were one of only three advanced economies not to fall into recession as the global financial crisis struck around the world, sending the rest of the world into deep recession. Our unemployment remains relatively low, recently falling from seasonally adjusted 5.4 per cent in April to 5.2 per cent in May—more good news highlighting the strength of the Australian economy.
The Building the Education Revolution also supported local businesses and provided Australian schools with new and upgraded classrooms, libraries, and school halls. This was a $15 billion investment in Australian schools which delivered 24,000 projects in 9,500 schools around Australia. In Tasmania alone, under the Primary Schools for the 21st Century program, my home state received $360 million to fund 296 projects in 227 Tasmanian primary schools. It was, after all, those opposite, under the leadership of Mr Abbott, who want to axe that program, which has enormous benefits for schools and school communities. I doubt that Senator Bushby would have been seen in our home state of Tasmania fronting up to local schools and telling them they could not have their new library, their new school hall or their new classrooms. But those opposite do not plan to stop there. We know that the Liberal Party and Mr Abbott now want to axe trade training centres. To axe training centres would be unacceptable. It would deprive young people of the opportunity to gain vital hands-on skills and would be a blow to their chances of securing full-time employment. But do not take my word for it. A letter to the editor of the Huon Valley News on 16 June, headed ‘Trades training centre’ stated in part:
For Federal Liberal candidate Jane Howlett to refer to the proposed $6.4m Huon Valley Trade Training Centre as, ‘attaching a relatively small technical section at the back of a secondary school’ it shows just how out of touch Tony Abbott’s party is.
It also shows how out of touch Jane Howlett is with her electorate and with the Huon Valley.
The purpose-built Huon Valley Trade Training Centre will provide training opportunities for years 9-12 students in a range of industries … It will be a state-of-the-art industry standard facility.
The biggest bonus for those students is that the training will be locally-based, and placements will be with local employers.
The retention hurdle of distance and city-based training will be removed.
Our young people will remain in our Valley and add value to our community.
The letter goes on to say:
Tasmania continues to face a skills shortage in industries vital to the state’s future.
Huon Valley students have traditionally faced educational challenges of retention and, more importantly, stickability at Years 11/12.
The Trade Training Centre is vital for addressing these issues as an innovative and locally based solution.
Any party which wants to abandon this program now is not only short-sighted, and out of touch, but is selling short the future of our young people.
That letter was from Mr Steve Harrison from Dover, the local community. Whilst that is disappointing, this decision by those opposite is not unexpected; after all, it was those opposite who presided over the greatest skills shortage in Australia’s history. Whilst those opposite are busy announcing funding cuts to education and health, the Labor government is getting on with its long-term reform agenda. In Tasmania, we are benefiting significantly from this reform agenda. The National Broadband Network, NBN, stands to give Tasmanian homes, schools and workplaces enormous benefits by rolling out fibre-to-the-node cutting-edge broadband technology. The NBN will connect 90 per cent of Australians to broadband with speeds of up to 100 megabits per second. In my home state of Tasmania, a number of rollouts have already been announced, and recently the government announced stage 3 of the NBN rollout in Tasmania. The $100 million Tasmanian stage 3 rollout will connect 90,000 premises in Hobart, Launceston, Devonport and Burnie. This is on top of the already announced stage 1 and 2 rollouts in Tasmania, where the residents of Smithton, Scottsdale, Midway Point, Sorell, Deloraine, George Town, St Helens, Triabunna, Kingston Beach and South Hobart will be the first in the state to benefit from increased broadband speeds with the fibre-to-premises rollout. And, I am pleased to say, the first towns stand to be switched on to the NBN very soon.
Needless to say, those opposite, after presiding over a decade of failed broadband plans, now want to axe the NBN. We know that Senator Bushby’s state Liberal Party colleagues are supporting the NBN and the federal Liberal Party candidate for the electorate of Franklin, Ms Jane Howlett, was supporting the NBN only a matter of months ago as a state Liberal Party candidate, so who knows where she stands on the NBN now? Ms Howlett has enough problems convincing the Franklin electorate that she is a local and not a blow-in from Lyons. Her problems are made worse by the fact that she sits on both sides of the fence when it comes to the NBN.
Tasmania also stands to reap the rewards from the Labor government’s historic health agreement with the state. In Tasmania, we stand to receive an additional $340 million of funding from the historic agreement. This will provide an additional 500 elective surgery procedures a year, around 126 GP training places over 10 years and capital injections to cut emergency department waiting times. Again, it is no surprise that the Liberal Party opposes these key health reforms. This is what we would expect from an opposition that has no alternative health policy and whose leader, Mr Abbott, was the former health minister who ripped $1 billion from the health budget and capped GP training places.
In fact, in the electorate of Franklin, where Senator Bushby’s office is located, they stand to benefit greatly from the Labor government’s reform agenda, due to the hard work of the federal Labor member for Franklin, Ms Julie Collins MP. Ms Collins has worked tirelessly for the people of Franklin. The Labor government has invested $5.5 million to improve GP services, with the construction of the Clarence GP superclinic, a $721,000 investment for rural and regional health initiatives across Franklin and a $351,000 investment to train aged-care workers across Franklin.
But the funding for Franklin from the Labor government does not stop there. Ms Collins has helped secure more than $70 million for Franklin’s schools under the Building the Education Revolution program. Some of the projects are: $3 million to upgrade existing classrooms, teacher support spaces, gymnasium and amenities at Huonville primary school; $1.2 million to construct a new multipurpose hall at Montagu Bay Primary School; and $2 million for Illawarra Primary School to construct new classrooms. Senator Bushby is happy to come into this place and support the axing of the BER program, but is Senator Bushby really going to turn up at Huonville primary, at Illawarra primary and at Montagu Bay primary and tell them they cannot have their new classrooms and facilities?
Senator Bushby reached new levels with his claims regarding the Kingston bypass. Senator Bushby has always played politics over the construction of the Kingston bypass. Senator Bushby has consistently criticised this project. All he has done is mount a fear campaign in the local community, when he should have been supporting local residents who have wanted this bypass built for decades. Senator Bushby and his Liberal colleagues had 12 years to build the Kingston bypass but they did nothing. It has taken state and federal Labor governments to work together to get this bypass underway. In just 2½ years Ms Collins has delivered significant investment from the Labor government for the electorate of Franklin. She is a terrific local member who works tirelessly for the people of Franklin. Mr President, Senator Bushby’s political grandstanding and attempts to score cheap political points are exactly what you would expect from an opposition that lacks alternative policies and is more interested in cutting health and education funding.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>Tasmania</title>,Adjournment,83,1
