"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2006-10-17,"—The Greens do not support the Parliamentary Superannuation Amendment Bill 2006 being subject to the cut-off order. It is a matter that should be publicly discussed; it is a matter that ought to have been to a committee. I note that the bill is listed on the Notice Paper for discussion later in the day. It reminds me of 1987, I think it was, when my colleague Gerry Bates was out of the Tasmanian chamber for a few minutes and I was up here on parliamentary business. The two parties in the Tasmanian parliament managed to get through a 15 per cent pay rise in six minutes. I have often thought I should have submitted that piece of self-invested rearrangement of parliamentary business to the Guinness Book of Records but it does seem that it is untoward, to say the least, that we see a bill coming in, a cut-off and a discussion on the same day in relation to parliamentary superannuation. It should be going through the usual course of events.
If the government can explain why this should have priority over other legislation and the business of the nation, then let it do so. My understanding is that this will increase the top-up from taxpayers to new members of parliament to 15 per cent. That is a matter that the government has the numbers on, and it will no doubt get its way, but this clearly is a case of the government running from a public debate on the matter. It ought to be publicly debated. Ought not everybody in the community be getting an equal top-up of their superannuation?
The Greens will oppose the legislation. The process, though, is worse—it is not responsible, and it is not paying due honour to the electorate of Australia. It is not fair to the Australian electorate that, while this piece of legislation will give what could be argued from a number of different points of view a fair advantage to newer members of parliament, it is something the Prime Minister repudiated in the run to the last election; therefore it is an effective dishonouring of an election commitment to the people of Australia that this should be rushed through here in the same day from go to whoa. In fact, I have been here 10 years and I have not seen this process before. And it is what comes of there being a government majority in the Senate. It is an abuse of the Senate, and this process should not be permitted.

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-10-17,"—I rise today to speak on the Privacy Legislation Amendment (Emergencies and Disasters) Bill 2006. This bill inserts a new part VIA in the Privacy Act to enhance the information exchange in an emergency or disaster situation. New part VI permits but does not compel the collection, use and disclosure of personal information about deceased, injured and missing individuals involved in an emergency or disaster, whether in Australia or overseas, between Australian government agencies, state and territory authorities, private sector organisations, non-government organisations and others.
Schedule 2 of the bill makes consequential amendments to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979. The need for these measures to address the practical issues faced by government agencies, the private sector and non-government organisations in times of emergency or disaster situations was highlighted during recent experiences, including September 11, the Bali bombings, the 2004 Asian tsunami and the evacuation of Australians out of Lebanon. While schedule 3 of the Privacy Act 1988 contains provisions that allow for the disclosure of personal information in times of emergency and disaster, the structure of the act is such that it is expected that these provisions will be applied on a case-by-case basis after careful analysis of the circumstances.
Recent emergencies and disasters highlighted the difficulties of applying these provisions with confidence during large-scale emergencies. In its review of the private sector provisions of the Privacy Act 1988, the Office of the Privacy Commissioner considered the issue of balancing the flow of information and privacy considerations during times of large-scale emergencies and noted:
The scale and gravity of large scale emergencies have tested the application of the Privacy Act and raised questions as to how privacy protection should operate in such situations. The Privacy Act received criticism in the media after the tsunami disaster for lacking commonsense and for being unable to anticipate and cope with the extent of the tsunami disaster.
Evidence to the OPC inquiry and to a subsequent inquiry into the Privacy Act 1988 by the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee revealed that some government agencies and private sector organisations adopted what can only be described as an overly cautious approach to interpreting the Privacy Act, impeding effective and timely assistance to Australians caught up in emergency situations.
The OPC’s March 2005 review, for example, highlighted the difficulty faced by airlines in the aftermath of the 2004 tsunami, when many Australians contacted them to find out whether those who were believed missing had continued flying after the tsunami hit. The Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee report also noted similar evidence from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, DFAT, and from the Australian Red Cross in relation to the Privacy Act’s impact on information-sharing on response and recovery in emergency situations overseas.
DFAT noted that the privacy legislation had restricted its ability to coordinate a whole-of-government response to these crises and that it particularly impeded its ability to access personal information held by other government agencies to help in its location, identification and assistance efforts, to provide personal information to other government agencies directly involved in the crisis response and to provide personal information to other government agencies to ensure that inappropriate actions, such as those concerning Centrelink payments and the like, were not taken against affected Australians.
DFAT noted its difficulty in accessing information from private sector organisations, particularly airlines and travel agencies, whose records would be useful in locating Australians. The submission by the Australian Red Cross to the committee highlighted difficulties experienced by the organisation in the aftermath of the 2002 Bali bombing. The ARC, for example, was unable to access lists held by DFAT of deceased, injured or missing persons nor was it able to share its own list of deceased and injured persons. The ARC noted that the organisation had to seek individual client permission to share even basic information about assistance provided. It observed that many affected Australians suffering injury and trauma expressed surprise and concern about having to provide the same information to many different agencies and, quite frankly, did not understand why this information could not be provided once and then shared across relevant agencies.
The OPC review and the Senate committee report both made a number of recommendations to address these difficulties. While the bill addresses the issue raised by both of these reviews, it does not act on the specific recommendation of the OPC as endorsed by the Senate committee. Rather than amend existing provisions to deal with emergencies and disasters through temporary public interest determinations made by the Privacy Commissioner, as recommended by the OPC, the bill inserts a new part and framework into the Privacy Act.
The bill covers both government agencies and private sector organisations and addresses information-sharing between government agencies in emergency situations as recommended by the Senate committee. Recent events where difficulties were experienced not only by departments and agencies such as DFAT, organisations such as the Australian Red Cross and travel related industries such as airlines but also by Australian families caught up in these tragedies demonstrate that these amendments to the Privacy Act should not be delayed.
Labor understands that the Attorney-General’s Department consulted extensively with stakeholders in drafting this bill and notes that most submissions to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs examination of the bill expressed broad support for the proposed amendments. Labor is satisfied that the proposed laws offer greater assurance to both government agencies and private organisations that personal information may be lawfully disclosed and exchanged during times of emergency or disaster either at home or abroad. This legislation will further ensure that assistance and relief to victims and their families will not be unduly delayed or complicated by privacy concerns.
I will now turn to some of the specific provisions in the bill. Time will not permit me to deal with all but perhaps some of the more important or cogent ones. Schedule 1 of the bill inserts a new part VIA in the Privacy Act 1988. The new provision in part VIA will operate only upon the making of a declaration under clause 80J or clause 80K that an emergency or disaster has occurred in Australia or overseas. These provisions specify that the emergency or disaster must have occurred. A declaration cannot be made in respect of an imminent event or warning.
Clause 80J provides the preconditions for the declaration by the Prime Minister or the Attorney-General of an emergency or disaster in Australia. Clause 80K provides the preconditions for the declaration by the Prime Minister or the Attorney-General in consultation with the Minister for Foreign Affairs of an emergency or disaster outside Australia. The requirement for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to be consulted in relation to events outside Australia reflects the sensitivity to diplomatic relations with other countries—an approach which Labor concurs with. According to clause 80L(1), an emergency declaration must be in writing and signed by the person making the declaration and it has effect from the time at which it is signed.
Clause 80M provides that an emergency declaration cannot be retrospective. It has effect from the time at which it was signed. Clause 80L(2) requires that an emergency declaration must be published on the Attorney-General’s Department website as soon as practicable after it has taken effect and by notice published in the Gazette. Clause 80N provides for when declarations cease to have effect. The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs recommended that a maximum period of 12 months should apply to a declaration of emergency under clause 80J and clause 80K. We understand somewhat belatedly that the government has proposed amendments to reflect this recommendation, and I will deal with those in the committee stage of the bill.
However, it does bear comment that the Attorney-General’s Department realised that what was proposed in the recommendations was worthy of support. Therefore, we are surprised that it took them so long to get to that place and also to ensure that, if they are going to read committee reports and pick up any recommendations, it is necessary for them to signal at the earliest possible time that they intend to do that. The simple courtesy of contacting the office of the shadow minister for the Attorney-General and letting them know that these amendments are to be forthcoming might make the passage through both houses of parliament a little easier, rather than just dropping the amendments in here and expecting us all to read them and work out that they relate to those recommendations and are a true reflection of them. If they have departed from them, then they can take that up as well. We will look carefully at the amendments during the committee stage of the bill.
The making of an emergency declaration under clause 80J or clause 80K triggers the operation of new part VIA. Clause 80R(1) provides that part VIA of the bill has a broad operation and is not limited by any other secrecy provisions in the law of the Commonwealth unless that secrecy provision expressly excludes the operation of 80R. Importantly, clause 80R(2) provides that nothing in the part compels the collection or use or disclosure of personal information; it is simply a permissible act. The decision to disclose personal information will remain at the discretion of the individual agency or organisation.
Clause 80H defines the meaning of ‘permitted purpose’. Clause 80H(2) provides examples with that limitation of the types of situations in which the collection, use and disclosure of personal information may be authorised under clause 80P. We note that the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs recommended that clause 80H(1) be amended to limit ‘permitted purpose’ to a purpose that directly relates to the Commonwealth’s response to an emergency or disaster. We also understand that the government has proposed amendments to this effect. As I said, we will deal with those during the committee stage.
Clause 80H(2)(e) confirms that a disclosure of relevant information to a person responsible, as defined in National Privacy Principle 2.5 of the Privacy Act, for the individual involved in the emergency or disaster, is a permitted purpose under part VIA. According to the explanatory memorandum, this clause addresses the concern that people, such as relatives, could be denied information regarding the welfare of family members because of concerns about the application of the Privacy Act. This provision takes up the OPC’s recommendation to enable disclosure of personal information to a ‘person responsible’ in times of emergency, but it has not extended or clarified the definition of ‘person responsible’ in National Privacy Principle 2.5.
We are concerned that there is no mechanism providing for the number of family members who may come within the definition of ‘person responsible’ under National Privacy Principle 2.5. It may be preferable in such situations for one such person to be a nominated individual, rather than for information to be disclosed numerous times—or it may be vital that all can have access. That is a matter that needs to be looked at further. In addition, National Privacy Principle 2.5 appears to define ‘person responsible’ for the purposes of 2.4, relating to the disclosure of health information, and therefore may require amendment if it is for this wider purpose. We urge the government to address these concerns.
Clause 80P(1) permits the collection, use or disclosure of personal information relating to an individual if the person, agency or organisation collecting, using or disclosing the information reasonably believes that the individual may be involved in the emergency or disaster; and the collection, use or disclosure is for a permitted purpose. Clause 80P(1)(c) deals with who government agencies may disclose personal information to. There are a couple of other provisions. Time will not permit me to deal with some of the other matters in detail.
Clause 80P(2) ensures that an entity is not liable for contravening a secrecy provision by using or disclosing personal information—it is important to ensure that the legislation contains that safeguard—unless the secrecy provision is a designated secrecy provision. A designated secrecy provision is defined in clause 80P(7) to include secrecy provisions binding the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. In that way we ensure that there are reasonable safeguards in the legislation. It also does not exclude, but deals with, the secrecy issues that sometimes, unfortunately, arise. Clause 80P(3) provides that an entity is not liable for contravening a duty of confidence in respect of disclosing personal information where authorised to do so by clause 80P(1). The department has advised that this most commonly would relate to the common-law duty of confidentiality to which banks are subject.
Clause 80Q creates an offence for unauthorised secondary disclosures. The government is proposing to put in place a scheme where you can protect the information that is disclosed and also protect any secondary disclosure. It is also intended to ensure that the bill has its widest possible operation, consistent with Commonwealth and constitutional legislative power. As such, we have clause 80S, concerning severability. Clause 80T concerning compensation for acquisition of property is, according to the EM, ‘the standard constitutional safety net provision’. It is comforting to see that the government has sought to ensure that that is there. The Auditor-General’s Department advises that, although it is not expected that the new part VIA will result in an acquisition of property within the meaning of that expression in the Constitution, clause 80T was included on advice from the AGS—perhaps with an overabundance of caution, given that it was the Australian Government Solicitor. This seems an inappropriate provision in this bill and we cannot understand why it is here, even out of an abundance of caution. It seems a little inappropriate, but maybe we will get an opportunity at the committee stage to question that further.
Schedule 2 of the bill is a consequential amendment to section 18(3) of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979, which provides for circumstances where the Director-General of ASIO, or a person authorised by the director-general, may communicate information that has come into the possession of ASIO in the course of performing its functions under section 17 of the ASIO Act. It adds a paragraph which enables ASIO to disclose information where an emergency is declared under schedule 1 of the bill, to ensure that their work continues.
Labor believe that our privacy laws need to strike a balance between the value of sharing information for the benefit of individuals and the wider community and the privacy considerations that protect an individual’s personal information. It is important that the need for efficient responses to emergency and disaster situations are balanced by laws and systems that protect personal information from misuse. Labor support this bill. We believe that the measures it contains effectively strike the delicate balance that is needed. We commend the bill.",SENATE,<title>PRIVACY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EMERGENCIES AND DISASTERS) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,1,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-10-17,"—The Democrats have significant concerns with the Privacy Legislation Amendment (Emergencies and Disasters) Bill 2006. On the face of it, the justification given sounds perfectly reasonable—modifying privacy laws to ensure that they do not impede our ability to respond to major emergencies and disasters. Nobody could be concerned about that, but the big question is whether this bill does that and whether it does it to the minimum extent necessary or whether it is in fact being used as a Trojan Horse for dramatic weakening of the Privacy Act.
The Boxing Day tsunami and the Bali bombings were unquestionably major disasters—tragedies on a scale which, thankfully, we do not experience often in this county. The pain of those disasters is still with us in the hearts and minds of our population. We have had natural disasters in Australia before—Cyclone Tracy, the Ash Wednesday bushfires and a number of others—but the Bali bombings and the tsunami disaster not only were significant in scale but took place overseas, in some ways making them even more traumatic, making our ability to respond more difficult for reasons of distance. The need to operate in different jurisdictions, working with other governments and agencies of other nationalities added unique difficulties. We can all appreciate the anguish of families and friends seeking information on the whereabouts and news of their loved ones. And we can appreciate the difficulties of organisations attempting to help those caught up in the disasters, as they had to contend with both the sheer number of people involved and the mounting of assistance operations across international borders in circumstances of significant chaos.
We would all like to assist where we can in these times of emergency and appreciate the need for individuals and aid agencies to access necessary information. In these traumatic situations, Australians expect information to be accessible in order to assist in the disasters. They expect no less information than necessary but also no more than needed would be made available.
The Democrats believe that with small changes to our current privacy laws we can achieve what is necessary. We should remember that the current law already permits personal information to be used and disclosed in particular circumstances where individuals’ lives and health are at risk and in circumstances of national emergency. We support any minor modifications to our existing legal regime that would help facilitate the location of and assistance to Australians in these situations without undermining the central protections of our privacy laws.
The key question is: does the bill before us achieve this? The government will tell the Australian people that it does. If the problem as recently experienced by some aid organisations following the Bali bombings was to gain ready access to information about individuals to the extent necessary to assist them, then this bill does not achieve that. This bill allows the Prime Minister or Attorney-General, with the stroke of a pen, to dispense with all our privacy protections not only for tsunami or bomb situations but for any reason he or she may consider to be of ‘national importance’.
The government response in the form of this bill, in the view of the Democrats, goes well and truly over the top. It risks washing away significant parts of the privacy protections, which, it should be remembered, have taken a long time and a lot of effort and urging to put in place. It washes away those protections far beyond what the Democrats believe is necessary. Rather than start with the privacy structures already in place and take away only what is necessary to achieve the very precise and limited purpose, the government, in typical fashion, have thrown away all the privacy protections and merely added back some minimal and inadequate protections, putting all the power for doing so in their own hands.
The Democrats have a long history of fighting for the rights of individuals to privacy back to the days of former senator the late Janine Haines in the 1980s. This is a fundamental human right. I note that some members of the current coalition contest how valid the right to privacy is. It is certainly something the Democrats still believe is a basic and valid right which we should protect.
The Privacy Act itself highlights—indeed, it starts by reminding us—that Australia is a party to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. This underlines the importance that the right to privacy holds in a democratic society like ours, one that seeks to uphold civil and political rights. We should not limit or remove those rights except in particularly dire circumstances and then only the minimum amount considered necessary to deal with the situation. I do not believe that Australians want to be exposed to ongoing potential breaches of their privacy for extended periods of time in a circumstance determined only by the Prime Minister or the Attorney-General of the day, and that is what this bill does. It is a blanket approach to curtailing the fundamental rights in relation to privacy, beyond what is necessary, which tips the balance in favour of government against the individual.
None of this should in any way be used to suggest that the Democrats do not recognise that there have been some difficulties experienced by aid agencies in getting access to information in times of disaster, but I draw attention to the evidence given by the Australian Privacy Foundation to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs examining this legislation. They said:
... examples given of the Privacy Act preventing sensible use of personal information are due either to a wilful or inadvertent misunderstanding of the Act, which would be best addressed through better short-term communications and long-term education rather than wholesale changes to the privacy protection framework in the Act.
In other words, in many cases the examples that people have given where they are saying that the existing act prevents sensible use of personal information are due to the fact that they do not understand the provisions of, and existing exemptions within, the act as it currently is.
There are already far less drastic means by which we can address the situation. For example, it is currently possible for the Privacy Commissioner—who is an independent officer, not a politician—to make a public interest determination where, after considering all competing issues, the commissioner considers whether the public interest in doing the act or engaging in the process ‘outweighs to a substantial degree’ the public interest in adhering to the Information Privacy Principles. Why can’t such a process, with a definitional guide that acknowledges what protection is being given up in a specific circumstance, be modified for emergency situations? There is no such guide at present in the emergency regime that the government is seeking to put in place.
Let us compare further. Currently, the Privacy Commissioner, in making a public interest determination, is required to give reasons, but under the declaration process that the government wants to put in place neither the Prime Minister nor the Attorney-General are required to give any reasons. All they need to say is that in their opinion this is a matter of national importance or national emergency. Let us draw comparisons with what is unfortunately a growing number of examples in other areas in the Attorney-General’s purview or areas like migration. There is, sadly, a growing number of areas where ministers can just make determinations or declarations, say it is in the public interest or the national interest and not need to give any reasons at all—just simply say: ‘It is because I say so.’ I do not believe, and the Democrats certainly do not believe, that that is adequate protection. The current regime also requires the commissioner to specify a time period for which a public interest declaration is to be in force. Limiting the time is something that the Prime Minister or the Attorney-General is not so adequately obliged to do by the declaration process contained in the legislation before us.
To give another example: another process for addressing emergencies that we currently have in place would begin by leaving the privacy regime and existing protections in place but suspending the effect of sanctions for breaching the privacy provisions—effectively, providing for exceptions in cases of national emergency. This already exists under section 23YUF of the Crimes Act, where the minister has the discretion to determine any situation to be an incident appropriate for the usual sanctions to be suspended. The Bali bombings are a specific example of one such incident. Why is it not possible to utilise these existing sections, which already—and quite reasonably, I might say—allow for part of our laws to be overridden where there is a genuine emergency?
Certainly, some aid organisations which gave evidence to the so-called ‘Big Brother’ inquiry expressed frustration that, following the Bali bombing and tsunami incidents, some organisations were still reluctant to disclose details of names, dates, actions and personal details of individuals, and this occasionally added to the difficulties in tracking down and assisting victims and their families. It should be emphasised that there were a lot of much larger difficulties that also impeded that important task. It must be emphasised that these incidents were of an enormous magnitude and a relatively uncommon type. The appropriate and proportional response is to allow limited circumstances for departure from our privacy regime for such uncommon and limited situations.
I do not believe that the departures contained in this legislation are very limited at all. I think they are quite disproportionate. The government’s bill will insert a whole new part into the Privacy Act, a whole new regime that can be implemented in place of our current regime at the stroke of a pen. The bill before us will allow emergencies to be declared in any type of situation that the Prime Minister or Attorney-General considers to be of national significance. The lack of definition or constraints around that do cause concern. It is worth noting that the government has explicitly included the words ‘assisting with law enforcement’ as a single legitimate permitted purpose for the purposes of such a declaration. How convenient it is for the government to be able to dispense with all manner of privacy protection for individuals when enforcing the law following a disruption that the government considers significant.
I believe that Australians should be concerned about the new power this gives to the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General—and to all future prime ministers and attorneys-general. Australians should be concerned about the capacity of government agencies, organisations and individuals to disclose and use their personal information in these as yet unknown circumstances and for potentially very significant amounts of time. Furthermore, if you, as an individual, have had your personal information disclosed by and to other entities, the government, in this legislation, has conveniently overlooked the need to destroy such information once the disaster is over or the information is no longer needed for the specific purpose at hand. It provides an open door to abuse of an individual’s privacy, all for the sake of government convenience.
I can understand the attraction for the government in having it made convenient and easy for them, but that is precisely why we have protections like these in the first place. It is always more convenient for government to not have to worry about these sorts of constraints and requirements for protecting citizens’ rights. That is inevitably the case. Again, I can point to a range of examples, both in Australia and amongst some of our allies overseas, where governments have seen great benefit to themselves in being able to work around or ignore the so-called constraints that ensure that the rights of individuals are protected. There are always those constraints, but they are meant to be constraints. They are there precisely because history shows us time and time again that, if you do not have the constraints, governments will abuse their powers. That is not particularly having a shot at this government; it is a simple inevitability. It is the nature of government, particularly for governments that have been in place for a prolonged period of time, to not respect the individual rights of citizens unless there are constraints in place that require them to do so.
Instead of addressing problems encountered during disasters and emergencies, the government has created a privacy disaster situation. The Democrats’ preferred approach would have been to modify only what is necessary under the existing privacy legislation structure, but we are not in a position to implement our preferred approach here; instead, we will be seeking to move amendments to the legislation in the committee stage of the debate to try to address some of the wrongs against our basic civil rights that arise under this bill.
It is worth emphasising that passing this bill unamended does not mean that the current government will automatically breach those rights. It does not mean that I am alleging that there is some devious, nasty, hidden plan where the government is just waiting for this bill to be passed so that it can leap forward into the breach and immediately start abusing privacy rights. But the legislation does, completely unnecessarily, open a significant loophole that will allow any government—future governments as well—to avoid complying with basic privacy rights if they happen to believe at the time that it is convenient or necessary. And what might seem necessary to a government is often very different from what might seem necessary to the wider community.
A balanced solution is possible—one that addresses the concerns of aid agencies and victims in times of emergency while protecting the Australian population from the overzealous dismantling of our privacy laws merely for government convenience. Again, I remind the community that it took a long time to put these privacy laws in place and it has taken a lot of effort to get them strengthened to the point they are at now. Of course, there are still inadequacies with those laws. Not least is the fact that political parties are not required to comply with the privacy laws. That is a perfect example of how political parties have chosen to exempt themselves from inconvenience. We in the Democrats try to ensure that we operate in a way that complies with the privacy laws even though we are exempt from them, because we believe that, in principle, political parties should be required to comply with them. It is an inconvenience—there is no doubt about that—but I think the Australian community would judge that it is an important or necessary inconvenience as a way of ensuring that people’s privacy rights are protected, or at least maximising the prospect of that.
If the government has been criticised for its slow response to emergencies in the past, I do not think that it can seriously blame the Privacy Act for that. A much better place to look is in its own internal procedures for responding promptly. It should have done that before invoking such a radical and unnecessary regime to deal with emergencies. We also need to recognise that in emergencies such as those I have been describing it is very easy to just point to the Privacy Act or some other piece of regulation and say, ‘That’s the problem there; it’s not our fault; it’s something else.’ We need to recognise that these circumstances, precisely because they are disasters, are inevitably chaotic. While that should not be used as an excuse for a slow response, we also need to recognise and accept across the political spectrum that we do not immediately leap in and start criticising agencies, whether government or otherwise, for failing to respond instantly. Sometimes that is just not possible; sometimes responding in a slightly more measured but well thought through way will lead to a much better long-term response than immediate and instant action for the sake of making it look as though action is happening.
On balance, this bill tips the balance too far against the individual in favour of restoring some of the ‘Big Brother’ power to government. I do not believe it is necessary in the circumstances. The Democrats will seek to remedy the situation, at least somewhat, via amendments in the committee stage.",SENATE,<title>PRIVACY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (EMERGENCIES AND DISASTERS) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,1,1
"Ellison, Sen Chris",LP,2006-10-17,"—I thank senators for their contribution to the debate on the Privacy Legislation Amendment (Emergencies and Disasters) Bill 2006. This is an important bill. It is important because it amends the Privacy Act and makes consequential amendments to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act.
The bill enhances information exchange between Australian government agencies, state and territory authorities, private sector organisations, non-government organisations and other bodies in an emergency or disaster situation. We have seen that happen with recent events, and I will not go into those at length; other speakers have canvassed the Bali bombings, the tsunami disaster and other emergencies which have required an immediate response from Australian authorities. I just want to say at this point that the response is required in a substantial form, not just for cosmetic reasons, as some might say. In fact I would totally reject that. When you have a disaster, you need to respond in a whole-of-government sense and you need to have that exchange of information between the agencies.
How does this interact with privacy in the privacy legislation? It is interesting. When you look at the evidence given to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, which looked into this bill, you see that the Office of the Privacy Commissioner considered the issue of balancing the flow of information and privacy considerations during times of large-scale emergencies. It noted:
The scale and gravity of large scale emergencies have tested the application of the Privacy Act and raised questions as to how privacy protection should operate in such situations. The Privacy Act received criticism in the media after the tsunami disaster for lacking commonsense and for being unable to anticipate and cope with the extent of the tsunami disaster.
That came from the Office of the Privacy Commissioner. It was a concern that was echoed in the evidence given to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs—that is, we need to do something to address this need for exchange of information during an emergency. That is precisely what we are doing here.
I commend the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for its work. In fact, as a result of that report the government will be putting forward two amendments in the committee stage. I will not go into those details; I will leave that for the committee. But there are a number of issues that were raised by Senator Ludwig and Senator Bartlett, and I feel I need to address those in my speech in reply.
Senator Ludwig talked of the lack of notice given in relation to these amendments. As I understand it, the Senate committee reported last Thursday. The government then obtained approval for amendments to be made. They were circulated yesterday. I understand the Attorney-General spoke with the shadow Attorney-General’s office in relation to that, but that could not be done until policy approval had been obtained. What we had was a fairly quick consideration of the committee report, a response from the government and communication of that to the opposition.
Senator Ludwig also inquired as to the way we were couching this amendment in relation to the legislation that is in existence. Consideration was given to amending the Information Privacy Principles and the National Privacy Principles in the Privacy Act, as these principles govern the collection, storage, use and disclosure of personal information. However, the proposed amendments do not lend themselves to a simple amendment of these IPPs and NPPs, and the government thought it would be much clearer if a new part VIA was inserted in the Privacy Act to comprehensively deal with information exchange in an emergency or disaster situation. That deals with the point that Senator Ludwig makes as to how we have framed this amendment. We believe it is much clearer to have a new part VIA inserted in the act.
Senator Bartlett queried why this bill is needed when the Privacy Act already has exemptions which allow for disclosure of information in an emergency or disaster situation. Certainly disclosure of personal information in an emergency or disaster situation is permitted, but only if consistent with the Privacy Act. Some agencies and organisations take an unduly restrictive view of this; certainly that has impeded them in relation to the exchange of information in a disaster or an emergency situation. In an emergency, there simply may not be the time to resolve any potential privacy issues and apply the Privacy Act on the case-by-case basis that is required.
Of course, we have already gone over the fact that this delay in the exchange of information and in the response by government authorities, which is so important, can cause trauma to the families of victims. We believe these amendments provide a clear and certain legal basis for the collection, use and disclosure of personal information about deceased, injured and missing Australian individuals in an emergency or disaster situation. This gives a clear direction to those authorities, which is so needed in these events.
The other point raised by Senator Bartlett was the question that we were in some way displacing the Privacy Act or doing away with it. This bill provides for an emergency declaration; it will not displace the usual operation of the Privacy Act. It is a mechanism only for the emergency response for the whole of government, and the proposal to use this declaration is very much one which can accommodate the urgent needs of the situation at hand. We would submit that the public interest determination which can be used in the Privacy Act is too slow. It involves consultation and would simply be unwieldy in a situation where you needed that immediate response. We believe the emergency declaration, as such, is preferable over the current regime but, in other respects, the usual operation of the Privacy Act is not dispelled.
Senator Bartlett also asked why we do not adopt existing declaration mechanisms in other legislation, such as the Crimes Act, instead of creating this new emergency declaration mechanism. Of course there are a number of other mechanisms available in other pieces of legislation. But what senators have to remember is that this is related to an emergency situation, or a disaster, as it applies vis-a-vis privacy considerations. Those other determinations or declaration mechanisms that Senator Bartlett referred to involve different trigger mechanisms and different situations. It really would become somewhat of a muddle if we did not have a specific regime which applied to disasters and emergency situations as they related to the Privacy Act.
That deals with the points I wanted to cover in the speech in reply to the points raised by senators opposite. This bill will assist agencies and organisations in applying the Privacy Act less restrictively and with greater confidence, but it will also maintain those safeguards, which are so important. As I say, the government has two amendments in the committee stage which will reflect recommendations made by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I commend this bill to the Senate.

"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2006-10-17,—I seek to clarify an answer that I gave earlier today in question time. During question time Senator Kirk asked me about the Rau compensation claim. The answer I gave her confused the Rau and Alvarez compensation claims. I take the opportunity to make it clear: it is the Alvarez claim that we expect to be resolved very shortly. That was done by arbitration. That is all as is. But the Rau compensation claim is not resolved.

"Hurley, Sen Annette",ALP,2006-10-17,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Senator Vanstone) to questions without notice asked by Opposition senators today relating to immigration.
Now we know it is more or less official: Senator Vanstone’s department is completely out of control. The disgraceful treatment of Cornelia Rau and Vivian Solon and now the latest and highly disturbing findings regarding the Curtin detention centre show that this minister is not up to the job. It is an out-of-control department run by an out-of-control minister. That is perhaps why the parliamentary secretary, Mr Andrew Robb, rather than the minister has been given the job of overseeing the running of detention centres.
But we must give Minister Vanstone credit for one thing, because she has managed to get one thing right. She has ensured that John Howard’s goal to drive down wages is being achieved through the 457 visa system. Last night there was another example of the way the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, Amanda Vanstone, is overseeing a 457 visa system that is completely in control. It is in control because it is driving down wages—in this case from $41,000 to $27,000 for those workers. It is in control because it allows unscrupulous employers to intimidate vulnerable workers, and it is in control because it fits perfectly into the Howard government’s extreme Work Choices legislation.
Instead of admitting this today, we saw the minister criticise the Labor Party’s decision to revise the TP visa at next year’s national convention. What was the Liberal Party’s reasoning for this? Border security. Let us look at a recent example of the Howard government’s history on border security. I would like to draw the Senate’s attention to a report by the Australian about 110 Chinese nationals from China and Hong Kong who entered Australia illegally over a number of years up to March 2000. They illegally obtained citizenship and passports from corrupt Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs officials by paying them up to $200,000. The minister then encouraged this immigration racket by allowing these 110 people to keep their passports and their citizenship. It took over six years for this criminal racket to be detected. That does not sound to me like the best border security.
There are different rules for different groups. One group pays people smugglers; the other group pays huge amounts of money to corrupt officials and its members get their citizenship ratified. After all this, the minister has the audacity to come into this place during question time and lecture the Labor Party on border security—a tad hypocritical, I would say. This is from a minister who says that the government’s primary role is in border security.
In the short time that I have left to me, let us have a look at these 457 visa cases. What has the minister said every time that the Labor Party has brought these cases to her in question time? ‘I’ll look into it and get back to you,’ she says. She says that about so many issues when it is clear that her department has not managed its rules and its policies properly. In the case of the holders of 457 visas, how many times so far has she got back to us? Not once.
The Howard government is successfully using its 457 visa program to drive down wages and yet hopelessly failing in the area it declares to be of primary importance: border security. Are the people who are getting their wages pushed down by all this, the skilled workers who are coming to Australia, benefiting? No. Are the workers here in Australia benefiting as the minister says? No, because their wages are getting driven down as well. Every time that one of these skilled workers is brought in and underpaid because the government is not paying enough attention to this program, it makes it harder for Australian workers to get a fair day’s pay for a fair day’s work, to work decent hours for decent remuneration. That is what the 457 visa program is all about under this government. (Time expired)

"Brandis, Sen George",LP,2006-10-17,"—That rather contemptible speech by Senator Hurley shows how low the Labor Party has gone in this debate about 457 visas. And it is of a piece—as we heard from Senator Vanstone in her answer to Senator Johnston’s question—with the disgusting and dishonest remarks that were made at a doorstop interview this morning by Mr Tony Burke, the Labor Party’s shadow minister for immigration. Remember that Thursday two days hence is the fifth anniversary of the tragedy of SIEVX. On 19 October 2001, a refugee boat sank in international waters south of Java. It contained 397 passengers, of whom 352 were drowned, many of them children. It was one of the saddest episodes in this part of the world in recent history. This is what Mr Tony Burke had to say about it at a doorstop interview this morning: ‘The problem for me with temporary protection visas … is that in terms of having an impact on people-smuggling it actually works the opposite way.’
—Rubbish.
—Thank you, Senator Ferguson, and I will come to you in a moment. Mr Burke continued: ‘Once it was introduced, more boats came—the boat that we remember being sunk five years ago this week, filled with 146 children—for one simple reason: the reason there were so many children there was that overwhelmingly they had dads in Australia who were not allowed to sponsor their infant children to join them.’ Wrong, wrong, wrong! Senator Ferguson, who sat with me on the Senate Select Committee into a Certain Maritime Incident in 2002, which exhaustively canvassed the circumstances of the sinking of SIEVX, well knows that each of those propositions is absolutely false.
As the minister pointed out in her answer to Senator Johnston, there was not a skerrick of evidence given to that committee, nor has it ever been asserted, that the overwhelming majority of the children who drowned as a result of the SIEVX tragedy were seeking to join their parents in Australia. That callous, ignorant and untruthful statement by Mr Tony Burke just goes to show how free the Australian Labor Party are with the truth and how they have even been prepared to sink so low as to play fast and loose with the truth about a personal tragedy.
—It is absolutely wrong.
—What Tony Burke said, as you interjected, Senator Ferguson, was absolutely wrong. It is also absolutely wrong, as Mr Burke and now Senator Hurley have suggested, that the 457 visa policy has in fact encouraged unlawful boat arrivals. The truth is the opposite. Since the Howard government adopted in the second half of 2001 the border protection policy administered by the joint task force of ADF personnel known as Operation Relex, what we saw—as Senator Ferguson knows better than anybody else in this chamber—was the sudden surge in unlawful boat arrivals abate. After December 2001, at the end of a six-month period during which there had been approximately a dozen attempted illegal entries into Australian waters by these people at great personal peril, there were none—not one.
Every one of the people who sought to make the Australian shoreline in those suspected illegal entry vessels put themselves and their children in the peril which, tragically, those who embarked on SIEVX suffered. The boats were run by people smugglers. They were leaky fishing boats that were filled beyond capacity and they sailed through choppy seas. They were always a danger to their occupants. The tragedy of SIEVX was bound to happen as long as the people smugglers got the encouragement to believe that they could make it to Australia. What SIEVX tells us is how timely and necessary the Australian government’s policy was. (Time expired)

"Kirk, Sen Linda",ALP,2006-10-17,"—I rise this afternoon to speak to Senator Hurley’s motion, which refers to answers given to questions asked of Senator Vanstone this afternoon in question time. Senator Vanstone made reference to the government’s system of temporary work visas known as 457 visas. What we have seen over the last couple of days, particularly in a story that emerged yesterday, is yet another example of foreign workers, in this case workers from the Philippines, being exploited by Australian companies. I am sure that most people are familiar with the program that appeared last night, but what has happened in this case is that three Filipino workers on 457 visas have been sacked for joining a union and another five have been threatened with the same fate by the company which employs them.
The Filipino workers that I refer to are welders and were brought to Australia by a Brisbane company which promised to pay them more than $40,000 per annum, but as a consequence of various deductions being taken from their pay this has now been reduced to just $27,000. It was quite disturbing to see on the program last evening that accommodation payments that were being deducted from their salary amounted to $175 per week for each of the workers. All eight of them were living in the same house and all were paying $175 a week for the privilege of such accommodation. I also understand that there were deductions made from their wages in order to pay for their transport from their home to their workplace. This, of course, also contributed to the reduction in their salary.
What emerges from this example is a pattern that we are seeing time and time again with the misuse of these 457 visas. I have spoken before in this place about the way that 457 visas are being abused and the urgent need for a full-ranging inquiry into the use of 457 visas. What we can see, and this is a very good example, is that 457 visas are being used simply to drive wages down—to drive them down deliberately and drive them down rapidly.
Of course, it is the case that foreign workers are especially vulnerable to exploitation because their employer effectively acts as their migration agent. The agents have what the workers perceive to be the power to remove them from the country if they do not do as they are told. It has emerged that this was the case with these Filipino workers: they were threatened that they would be removed from the country if they did not work more quickly.
This also has to be seen in the recent context of the new workplace relations laws—‘Work Choices’, as the legislation is apparently called—and the impact of this new legislation in conjunction with these 457 visas. What has emerged is that now, when employees attempt to negotiate with their employer, not only will they miss out on the job if they refuse to sign the AWA that is presented to them but they will also miss out on a visa—in this case a 457 visa, which entitles these workers to stay in our country and to work.
Of course, these are people who are the least likely to report any abuses because they believe that their employer has not only the right to dismiss them but also the right to deport them if they make complaints. These people are incredibly vulnerable workers and for the visa holder to be exploited in the manner that is occurring is absolutely wrong, and similarly it is wrong to see the knock-on effect to the Australian workforce as a whole. It is imperative that there be an inquiry into 457 visas, and I am pleased to say that the Joint Standing Committee on Migration is looking very carefully at conducting an inquiry into 457 visas in the near future. I think it is very important that that occur.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Immigration</title>,QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS,5,1
"Bernardi, Sen Cory",LP,2006-10-17,"—I rise to take note of the answers given by Senator Vanstone during question time today. In doing so, I thank the Labor Party for raising these issues about 457 visas because there is no other opportunity for someone like myself to stand up and say that, if this were ‘football foul-ups’, the Labor Party would star in every single edition for kicking an own goal. For me to stand here and talk about the responsibilities and the need for this country to bring in skilled migrants to fill jobs is an opportunity to remind the Labor Party and the people of Australia that we have the lowest unemployment this country has seen in over 30 years. At 4.8 per cent unemployment, everyone in this country who wants a job can get a job. We are unashamedly a business- and employment-friendly government seeking to allow people to work and to ensure that businesses can thrive and prosper. A key part of a business thriving and prospering is being able to employ staff.
If you cannot get staff to come and work with you because of the economic conditions—and I remind you that we are talking about the most prosperous economy that we have seen—then this government has found a solution. Every time the Labor Party raise the issue of foreign workers, they are demonstrating their clear xenophobia, because they do not talk about overseas workers that are coming out here from the UK or the US. They are constantly referring to Filipino workers or Chinese workers. There is always some Asian implication to it. I say that is raising some very base instincts that I find quite reprehensible.
But let us just talk about this. Skilled workers operate in many industries: in the steel industry, where there are welders, as Senator Kirk just mentioned, the meat industry and also the health care industry. These are critical industries to the prosperity of this country. That is where skilled workers are coming in. They are bringing their spouses and their spouses are also supporting this economy. They are bringing their children in and that is fantastic for this country. We are having a range of people coming here, helping our prosperity and doing the right thing.
But what I find interesting is how the opposition in this chamber are diametrically at odds with their state Labor governments, because around the country the largest users of 457 visas under the skilled migration program are the Labor states and territories. South Australia, a state with critical skill shortages, has more than quadrupled its state sponsored skilled migration intake. It has done that in a range of areas, such as regional communities like Murray Bridge, where T&R Pastoral have brought in a number of workers to work in their meatworks. They are doing it in other areas, such as rural areas, for medical and health reasons. Skilled migrants provide desperately needed relief in areas of labour shortage. They aid in the expansion of our economy and they complement employment opportunities for Australians. But do not take my word alone for it. In 1998, even Mr Beazley said:
Far from taking a job from other Australians, a migrant finding a job in Australia, as we all know, creates jobs elsewhere in the economy ...
The 457 visa is critically important to ensuring that this country can function and facilitate continued economic prosperity. Certainly it is going to be another 15 to 20 years before the next generation of Australians—their parents having been encouraged by things like the baby bonus and Mr Costello saying, ‘Go forth, prosper and multiply’—come on stream to be able to fill a range of jobs. But in the meantime we have the opportunity for new migrants to come to this country to fill jobs that desperately need to be filled, to ensure there is an ongoing prosperity and to allow Australia to lead the world in a multiracial, harmonious and positive society.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,2006-10-17,"—Thank you to colleagues for their support for this matter of public importance, which was slightly overwhelming. I have pleasure in bringing forward this matter of public importance today and in being joined by a Greens and a Democrat senator. It was designed to allow the government to support the motion as well. I hope they will when they speak. Unfortunately, we were not able to get a government senator to co-sponsor the matter. It was designed to be an expression of the will of the whole Senate.
In a society like ours, where most people enjoy prosperity and opportunity, it can be easy to forget that not everyone has it so good. There is a lot of focus these days on property prices and share market trading and very little focus on those who are doing it tough. Around the world hundreds of millions of people struggle to survive without the basic requirements for a decent life. For most Australians the harsh reality of daily life for so many people is a world away from the comfort and prosperity of Australian life.
International Day for the Eradication of Poverty provides us with an opportunity to reflect on the presence of poverty and disadvantage and to focus on what can be done to tackle it. I would like to focus close to home, on poverty and disadvantage in our community. Despite our prosperity and the opportunities most of us take for granted, poverty, disadvantage and social exclusion in our community are very real. We need to open our eyes to the life experiences of those Australians who struggle to make ends meet, who lack access to services and opportunities and are excluded from the social and economic mainstream. In focusing on disadvantage in our community, we have a duty to also focus on solutions—what we can do to ensure that Australia’s prosperity and opportunity is open to all Australians. Above all, we need to be positive. We are a wealthy country. We can and we must work to ensure a decent chance for every Australian. Labor believes that we need a long-term, national plan to meet a renewed national commitment to tackling poverty in our community.
Depending on how you define it, hundreds of thousands if not millions of Australians are currently living in poverty. ACOSS estimates that two million Australians—10 per cent of us—live in poverty, based on a poverty line of 50 per cent of average disposable income. Even by the most conservative estimate put forward by the Centre for Independent Studies, poverty affects around one million Australians. The people most at risk in Australia include Indigenous Australians, people with a disability, the unemployed, single parents, people living in lone-parent households, renters, homeless people, and people living in rural, regional and remote areas.
Living in poverty means constantly struggling to make ends meet. According to Anglicare’s State of the Family Report 2006, there are hundreds of thousands of Australians who routinely struggle to meet basic costs like food, rent, electricity and gas bills. According to Anglicare’s report, more and more Australians are relying on emergency relief from welfare organisations to meet these basic expenses.
But poverty is about more than just income; it is also about social exclusion—being disconnected from the community. People may not be able to afford the cost of transport to visit friends or be able to afford to make phone calls to family. I have had to help a number of men who have been unable to afford rental accommodation in our suburb any longer because of the rising cost of that rental accommodation. They have been forced to suburbs which they have no connection to, because they cannot afford to live in the area where they have lived most of their lives. In many disadvantaged areas, there is a lack of community facilities, basics such as parks, which allow children to interact and parents to meet other members of the community. Social exclusion can also be the result of problems with self-esteem, trauma, hopelessness, disconnection from the workplace, poor social and interpersonal skills and deeper mental health issues.
Aboriginal Australians are more at risk of falling into poverty than any other group in our community, with ACOSS estimating that 58 per cent of Indigenous people are at risk. This disturbing fact is a result of the extreme social and economic disadvantage that Indigenous people face on every available indicator, be it employment and income, education, Third World health conditions or housing. It is a national disgrace that Indigenous Australians face such extreme levels of disadvantage. I echo the sentiments of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, Tom Calma, that it is simply not credible to suggest that a country as rich as ours cannot solve a health crisis affecting around three per cent of our population. We can do it. In the debate around poverty generally and Indigenous disadvantage in particular, we need to confront that pessimism that these problems cannot be solved. These problems are fixable if we have the will and the right strategy. It is up to us to make the decision to tackle and end these problems.
There is no single way to define or measure poverty. It is a complex problem which calls for complex solutions. I do not want to engage in the sort of definitional argument that the Howard government seems to have been so focused on: the quibbling over how you define poverty. In its submission to the Senate’s inquiry into poverty, the St Vincent de Paul Society, which does tremendous work, said:
Regrettably, the polemical debate over poverty lines has distracted rational discussion on solutions to a known problem.
It was dead right. The Senate committee report included 95 recommendations. Unfortunately, the Howard government rejected every single one of them. Again, its response was to quibble over the definition of poverty rather than to focus on the issues.
Labor is serious about addressing poverty in Australia. We believe that the care we provide for those in need and the opportunity for all to realise their potential are important measures of our society. Tackling poverty not only is a responsibility but offers huge benefits to all Australians by fostering a more inclusive, fairer, more cohesive society where all members of our community have a decent chance to realise their potential. Tackling poverty requires a commitment based on the values of justice, equity, compassion and a fair go for all. A strong economy is a necessity if we are to improve the life chances of Australians in need, but it is also the case that tackling poverty is a task that goes way beyond simplistic assertions that the best form of welfare is a job. Poor people in this country face complex issues that need to be tackled. Just referring them to the need to get a job does not tackle those issues. We need national commitment to getting results and a strategy for doing so.
On previous occasions, I have outlined some of the approaches that a Labor government would take, including developing integrated services; building a national program that engages local communities; providing long-term funding arrangements to facilitate certainty in planning a strategy, because we are plagued at the moment by short-term funding and programs that end; research and data to monitor the impact and effectiveness of programs; and long-term benchmarks and goals to ensure political accountability and keep governments focused on the task. If you do not set goals, then you never reach them. If you do not hold yourself up to be measured against the attainment of set objectives, you will not make progress.
There is no better time than now to recognise and confront the poverty and social exclusion that many in our community experience. It is something that this parliament must play its role in. Part of the challenge is accepting the reality of poverty and disadvantage in our community. We cannot tackle the problem until we acknowledge that it exists. But we do need to question the assumption that poverty will always be with us, and we have to focus on solutions.
One of the energising things about these issues is the number of groups and individuals in the community who work so hard to tackle disadvantage. I would like to acknowledge their hard work and commitment. Recently I met the National Council of Churches, which runs the National Make Indigenous Poverty History campaign. Today I met the Catholic Social Services people, who are having their annual conference in Canberra. They represent all the people who work for services on the ground—helping disadvantaged Australians, visiting prisons, supporting communities and supporting families in crisis.
Yesterday I also met some young people from Cabramatta High School who are engaged in the Micah Challenge and Make Poverty History campaigns. They challenged me and other politicians to make a difference on these issues. They asked very hard questions like ‘Why aren’t we making progress?’ and ‘Why aren’t we able, given our wealth, to end poverty?’
—But we are.
—If you do not think there is poverty in our community, Senator Fifield, I am disappointed; you are less informed—
—Things are getting better.
—Whether they are getting better or not, I was hoping that you would take a much more statesmanlike position in this debate. We sought to get your support for an expression of the parliamentary will, but it seems that you cannot rise above petty politics. But I want to say that I hope— (Time expired)

"Mason, Sen Brett",LP,2006-10-17,"—This afternoon I want to mention three things briefly: firstly, the difference that the major parties in this place have in dealing with poverty and the challenge of poverty; secondly, the lessons we have learned over the last 20 years in fighting poverty; and, finally, what the government has done to meet that challenge.
When I first read the wording of the issue we are discussing today, I thought that the three parties of the Left—the Greens, the Democrats and the Labor Party—were concerned about poverty, as they should be, as we all should be. Parties of the Left tend to believe that welfare is the answer to poverty, that individuals need to be rescued from poverty by government, and that more welfare means less poverty. Liberal and conservative parties do not agree with that. We argue that individuals need a hand up, not a hand-out. We believe that what the vast majority of individuals need is opportunity, and that that is far more important than welfare. Welfare of itself will never break the poverty cycle. Sure, welfare can be used in the short term to alleviate poverty, but it is not the answer.
What have we learned over the last generation about the challenge of poverty? Let me give a few examples from the Third World. Sir Bob Geldof and Bono were serenading the poor in Live Aid and Live 8. That was important, and they raised a lot of money to fight poverty. But that is absolutely nothing compared to the transfer of wealth to the Third World that has come about by the freeing of trade with the Third World. All those awful bureaucrats, diplomats and politicians demanding free trade have done more for the Third World than all the aid ever raised by Bob Geldof or Bono—much, much more. They have given access. The Third World countries have access to First World markets and can sell their products. We never hear about that. The Left never thank the government for freeing up trade and allowing developing countries to trade with the First World and therefore opening up our markets so that people living in the Third World have opportunity. It is not aid but trade that is rescuing the Third World. That is a very important message from our side of politics—a message that somehow seems to get lost in all the sanctimonious concern from the Left.
Just a couple of weeks ago, the new Nobel laureate for peace, Professor Muhammad Yunus, spoke about developing microcredit. That system gives a small amount of money to individuals in Bangladesh to open up businesses—for people to become small business men. It is not welfare. Welfare never rescued people in Bangladesh from poverty. What did is giving people money to create their own opportunities. For that reason, Professor Yunus was recently awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace. The other day a commentator described microcredit as the single most important development in the Third World in the last 100 years—giving individuals the opportunity to make a living for themselves and their families. It is pretty simple stuff: a mixture of capitalism and social responsibility has done far more to deliver people from poverty than all the aid in the world ever has.
Let me give another example—Indigenous Australians. I can remember 20 years ago being denounced as a racist because I thought that perhaps we should restructure welfare to Indigenous Australians. But Noel Pearson told the truth, didn’t he? He said that sit down money, welfare for no work at all, is a drip that is killing Indigenous Australians—that it is the financial equivalent of petrol sniffing. The drip—drug abuse and welfare without work—is killing Indigenous Australians. Again, we had to readjust policy to make connection with Indigenous Australians and to fight poverty. Noel Pearson got it right. You do not fight poverty among Aboriginal communities by giving welfare. Sit down money destroys communities; it does not build them.
And what have we learned among non-Indigenous Australians? We have learned that a job is the best way to alleviate poverty. As Senator Minchin so eloquently said today during question time, a strong economy and job growth have alleviated more poverty for more people in this country than ever before in its history. He said also that real spending on welfare has gone up by 35 per cent. There has been a great growth in private philanthropy, which has doubled in 10 years.
There are those people on the Left who say, ‘The rich are getting richer.’ That might be right, but just because the rich get richer does not mean the poor get poorer. In the last 10 years, wealth has gone up 22 per cent in low-income households and only 14 per cent in high-income households. Over the last 15 years, Australia has gone from 19th to eighth on GDP per capita—enormous growth in the Australian economy over the last 15 years.
Perhaps the most sophisticated assessment of living standards in the world is what the United Nations calls the Human Development Index. This is an index of national wealth, health, education, welfare and lifestyle. Do you know what the United Nations’s Human Development Index says about Australia, Mr Deputy President? There are 177 nations on earth that are assessed according to the United Nations’s Human Development Index. And guess where Australia falls? It is third in the world out of 177 nations.
The economy in this country has more than doubled over the last eight years. More people have more wealth to spend the way they want than ever in our history. Sure, poverty is a problem; there is no question that poverty is a problem in this country. The difference between our party and the Labor Party, between the government and the opposition, is that we believe the way to tackle poverty—except for those people who really, really cannot look after themselves—is by giving people opportunity, not welfare, and by allowing people to build their own businesses, get jobs and get educated. The last thing we want is a return to the 1970s mentality of government as a bottomless pit to pay poor people off. This patronising attitude that somehow all Australians need government welfare, that we should all be on the teat of the government, is wrong. It is patronising and destroys communities.
Finally, poverty, both nationally and globally, is a huge issue—we all acknowledge that. I know other speakers today do not take this issue lightly. Senator Evans is right to say that there are still pockets of shocking poverty in this country, and we should never look beyond that. But the great achievement of this government, of the Howard government, is that more people have been pulled from disadvantage than ever before in history. More people have been pulled out of poverty by freer trade over the last 10 years than ever in the course of human history. Two hundred million Chinese have been pulled out of poverty in the last 10 years by freer trade. Not by welfare, not by government action, but by freer trade. This is the greatest movement of people out of poverty in the history of mankind. Why? Because of freer trade, and that is what separates Liberal conservatives from the Left.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Poverty</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,12,1
"Siewert, Sen Rachel",AG,2006-10-17,"—As one of the sponsors of this motion, I obviously support it. This week is Anti-Poverty Week and today is International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, and I join the Australian Labor Party and the Democrats in calling for the need for urgent attention to address the plight facing the hundreds of thousands of Australians still living in poverty.
ACOSS estimates that there are about two million people living poverty today—that is one in 10 Australians. There are 100,000 homeless people, and nearly half of all Aboriginal children live in poverty. Perhaps what we should be doing as a nation is looking at how best we invest our good fortune in helping those most disadvantaged in our society. I believe we would be better off investing the tax cuts that were given out so widely during the last budget in addressing special issues and addressing the major issues that affect those most disadvantaged in our community—for example, providing the billions of dollars that are needed to address Aboriginal housing and providing the hundreds of millions of dollars that are needed to address Aboriginal health.
This week is also National Carers Week, so I would first like to look at how carers are managing in our affluent society—affluent for some. If you look at NATSEM’s report on the cost of caring in Australia from 2002 to 2005, titled Who cares?, it says:
One-third of people providing primary care for elderly or disabled people live in households whose income places them in the poorest fifth of households in Australia.
It estimates:
… that if a single person on average weekly earnings in December 2005 of $1,030 per week—
before tax—
were to leave his or her employment to care and receive only the carers’ income support payment, their weekly income would drop to $294.
In a further blow to carers, those on low incomes or government pensions are likely to be receiving little or no superannuation—which could present significant problems when it comes to funding their own retirement or future care needs.
The situation becomes even worse for Australian women who provide the majority of care to the young, old and people living with a disability in Australia. The report says:
… women already, on average, have lower net worth and less superannuation than men—
when it comes to retiring. Therefore, they are in an even worse situation. This is an example of how poverty is impacting on our community. These are real figures published just a couple of months ago.
The Carers Australia submission to the recent Senate inquiry into the Commonwealth State Territory Disability Agreement said:
… carers are over-represented in the lower household income quintiles and under-represented in the top income quintiles …
It also pointed out:
… the mean gross income per week of a primary carer was $237.00.
That is from 2005 ABS data. You can see that carers are suffering at the lower end of the income scale. They also have other issues they need to deal with on top of that, which are a result of their caring. They end up with poorer health. They sometimes end up being injured while doing their caring. Two-thirds of carers feel that their mental and emotional health has also been affected by providing care.
This picture is no better for single parents. The National Council for Single Mothers and their Children have highlighted some of the significant issues facing single mothers, and ABS data continues to show that single parents with primary care of dependent children are at the highest risk of poverty of all family types. Income and housing research has identified that 46 per cent of all sole parents with dependent children live on very low incomes. According to the ABS 2001 census data, an estimated 28 per cent live in public rental, 34 per cent in private rental and 32 per cent are homeowners or purchasers. This is compared to 67 per cent of the general population who are homeowners or purchasers. With the changes that have been made in child support combined with Welfare to Work, which has been debated at length in this place, where many single parents end up having their income further reduced, we are potentially making this situation worse.
As has been highlighted during this debate, there is, of course, the poverty that faces many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people in our community. I articulated just last week in this place the poor health outcomes for Aboriginal Australians that are, I believe, directly associated with poverty. The UN Special Rapporteur on Adequate Housing spoke just a couple of months ago of the hidden national crisis that faces Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, highlighting the terrible conditions he had seen in Indigenous communities and describing this as ‘a humanitarian tragedy’. Poor housing and a lack of basic services combine with poverty and the high cost of food in remote communities to produce, as many people have described, Third World health outcomes. This is shameful in a so-called affluent community.
ACOSS has called for fairness impact statements to look at the impact on fairness and social inclusion of government decision making and policy initiatives—to ask the question: what impact does or would this policy have on fairness in our community and the right to a fair go for all? Poverty impact statements are a way to highlight some of the social impacts that policies can have on life expectancy, health conditions, child care and access to education. All should be looked at in terms of what impacts policy decisions have there.
I was very disappointed that the Anti-Poverty Week motion that I put to the Senate was not supported by all parties, because I thought it was very sensible. It highlighted the poverty issues that face our community and made some sensible approaches. It did not call for increases in welfare; it called for poverty impact statements so that we can highlight impacts of government decision making and ensure the reporting on these. It also asked for Australia’s strong economy to be used to improve the living standards and life chances of all Australians. I would have thought that would have been something that every senator in this place could have supported. I urge that we consider what poverty means in our community in the year 2006. We are supposed to be living in the strongest economy ever, yet we are not taking all Australians with us.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Poverty</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,12,1
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2006-10-17,"—This afternoon, on International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, we have an opportunity in this place to come together to make a statement that we accept there are people in Australia who are not sharing as they ought in the general welfare and wonder of the economy that is operating in our country at the moment. I hope that through this discussion, short as it is, we will be able to agree on some simple statements and come together with movement forward rather than degenerating into some kind of debate about whose policies are bigger. It would be really useful if we could just extract from the statement that is before us that there are people in Australia who are living in poverty and there is a need for urgent action. That does not say that action is not currently being taken. I am sure there will be a litany of things brought forward about things that are being done through various systems in Australia to address poverty—and we applaud that. We think that what we can gain from this afternoon is actually just accepting that perhaps we can listen to each other and, more importantly, listen to those people who are living the experience to look at how we can improve what we are doing.
Some of us have been privileged to attend a range of Senate inquiries over the last few years. I have only been here a few years, but already through the community affairs process I have been part of an inquiry on poverty in Australia. I think we should remember the title of that inquiry report: A hand up not a hand out. It was not a demand for greater welfare. Whilst it took months and months to get a government response and there were significant differences about figures that were being used and about motivations, I thought we had agreed as participants that there were people in Australia who needed assistance.
I will just quote from a couple of the people who came before us. There were over 500 submissions to that inquiry from people who are living the experience in Australia. This came from St Vincent de Paul—and no group has more knowledge of what is going on in our communities than they do. One of the witnesses said:
I want to stress in relation to this delegation that we are not policy experts but we are experts on the lived experience—the lived experience of these people who have suffered the pain and heartache of poverty in the city of Sydney.
In that case it was in the city of Sydney. That experience came across throughout the country. It did not matter whether we were meeting in the Northern Territory, in Sydney, in Queensland, in Western Australia or wherever—the people who were working most closely in the community were telling us of their lives and the lives of the people they were serving. It is our job—the job of everyone in this chamber—to listen to those voices, to see what we can learn and not to judge. One of the major messages is that it is not our job to judge. It is our job to look at reality, to look at experience and to see how we can best build the opportunity that Senator Mason was talking about, because there is a great deal of common ground here. I just think sometimes we forget it—we are so busy hearing our own voices that we forget that perhaps there is something we can do to pull this together.
Out of that Senate inquiry, there were a wide range of recommendations, most of which did not actually come forward in a way that people could agree about. But one was the overwhelming interest of people across the country in working together to find a solution. I think we can still hold on to that. On a day like today, we can actually take those steps forward. We can say that, yes, we can do things better. It does not matter how many statistics are rolled off about whether the percentage increase over the last 10 years has been greater than that of the 10 years before and how in every person’s pocket there are X more dollars. We can argue about that until we are all very old. But there is the reality of the experience that came before us not just in that Senate inquiry but in the one we did on mental health, the one we did on child support and the one we did on people in institutional care. What they had in common was that there are people who are not sharing in the wealth of this country.
That is the challenge for us, because that is fact. It does not matter how many graphs or statistics you put forward; the people themselves are suffering. They are telling us that their kids are not able to go on school excursions because they cannot afford the extra time. Parents cannot look their kids in the face and explain to them why they cannot get the same activities or entertainments that the other kids can get. That is fact. We have people who do not have enough food at home on a weekly basis. They cannot get nutrition because they cannot afford it. We had the horror stories of people who turned the lights off in their home and did not use electricity because they could not afford the utilities bill.
These are not just horror stories. They are not coming out of some movie or some claim for extraordinary support. They are the real-life stories of people who are living, the same as we are, in our community at the moment. They are experiencing poverty.
Other speakers this afternoon have talked about the activities in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. Everyone in this place has had personal experience of working with people from those communities and understanding the special plight that is facing people in remote locations without health care, without education opportunities and also without that spark, about which we talk here sometimes, of hope. The message for us—and I think the challenge for us—is how we turn rhetoric, the policies and the pages of statistics into a message of hope and how we remove ourselves from the political rhetoric, from saying, ‘Our policies are much better than their policies because ...’ and come back to the hub of the matter, which is how we make the policies work and how we ensure that the people in our communities share the advantages that most of us have as a matter of course.
When we do that, we have responded to the challenge that has been put before us by this motion and, as I know speakers have talked about, by the youth representations in this place today and at other times. I think there is an expectation by many young people in our community that we do our job and that we respond to those challenges, because they are not caught up in the rhetoric of political promises. What they see is the need in the community. While we are focusing here today on Australia, and I think that is an important thing, on this international day we also look across our international community.
It is not a debate between welfare and work. What we are saying is that a caring, economically sound government acknowledges its responsibility to citizens who need support. There will always be a need for some welfare system. There needs to be encouragement towards effective education and employment. That is a given. But, if you ask questions about the current government’s policy, they immediately take that as an attack and then throw across the chamber that people on this side—allegedly ‘the Left’—do not understand, are drowning in an outdated methodology and are focusing exclusively on welfare.
That is just not true. It is running away from the truth; it is running away from the real-life experiences of the people who want to tell us their stories. But one day they will stop telling us their stories because they are tired of telling us about how it is and not being listened to and not being understood. Rather than being part of the solution, once again they will be dismissed, marginalised and labelled as somehow having failed because they have not been able to share the successes that other people have. We must move beyond that. We have the opportunity to do that. We have the opportunity this afternoon as a parliament to come together and say, ‘There is poverty in our community; there is an urgent need to do something about it, and we will.’ That does not seem to me to be such a big ask. We can do that.
We can then go into the political discussions about how we actually implement that, but surely we can agree that the data indicates that there are people who are suffering poverty in this country. Their stories tell us that they are suffering poverty in this country. The amazing work of the various agencies which support our community tells us that they are working with this. I applaud Senator Minchin this afternoon talking about the greater philanthropy that is happening in this country. But the greater philanthropy is responding to a need that we should also work towards a solution for. We can do it. It is a bit of a challenge to move beyond the political argy-bargy, but I think we have a job to do and we can achieve that.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Poverty</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,12,1
"Humphries, Sen Gary",LP,2006-10-17,"—It is disappointing that, once again, as in previous years when we have come to mark International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, we have descended into a partisan approach towards the issue of poverty in Australia. It is disappointing because I believe that, if we were to erect a bipartisan or multipartisan platform in this country on which to talk about poverty and the ways in which government and the community might work to eradicate remaining areas of poverty, we would create great opportunity and we would make very great inroads in those remaining areas where we would have to say that our record is not up to the mark that we would expect. But that platform is, unfortunately, lacking and that is disappointing.
We on this side of the chamber were accused this afternoon of not being statesmanlike with respect to this issue. It needs to be recorded that the debate about poverty did not start today with this matter of public importance. It did not even start with the Senate Community Affairs References Committee 2004 inquiry into and report on poverty in Australia. It has gone on for some time, and it has remained an issue which has been the subject of intensely political and partisan debates in this place. Although I accept a number of the points made in the course of this debate by those on the other side of this chamber, we need to reconstruct the way in which we approach this issue.
First of all, let me say what it is that we in this place agree on. Australians at the present time bask in historically unprecedented levels of wealth. We are by any measure—international comparisons, historical comparisons or whatever—tremendously wealthy as a nation. We have wealth today that would stun our ancestors if they could see us. But it remains true also that there are Australians—large numbers of Australians; too many Australians—who face serious disadvantage and hardship. That is tragic and unnecessary in the face of the wealth that our community overall enjoys.
It is also true to say that poverty is often not the fault of the poor. For example, from the Senate Select Committee on Mental Health—which examined over the last year or so the question of mental illness in Australia—we know that very often there is a strong connection between mental illness and poverty. Strong economic conditions will not of themselves always catch those who do not have the means to take advantage of those stronger economic conditions. We need to build mechanisms that will still address the needs of those people who cannot take advantage of those circumstances.
But there are, unfortunately, many things that I suspect we do not agree on. I, for example, would argue that the evidence points unquestionably to poverty having eased, and eased dramatically, in Australia over the last decade. Why do I say that? There are clearly many more Australians in employment. Employment—a job—is a passport out of poverty. Over 1.9 million jobs have been created in Australia in the last 10 years. We have the lowest unemployment rate, more or less, of the last 30 years, at 4.8 per cent. There has been an unprecedented transfer of people into work, people who can now provide for themselves and their families. What is more, to address the issue that is sometimes raised of people becoming working poor—people in employment who do not have the means to generate the wealth that they would like—we have much higher real wages. Real wages have increased by 16.4 per cent in the course of the last decade.
On top of that, we can also point to the fact that the social safety net in Australia has had its capacity to deliver benefits to those who are the poorest Australians very significantly increased. Real spending on social security and welfare has risen by 35 per cent since the present Howard government came to office, despite being relatively steady as a proportion of GDP. Research by NATSEM has found that, before any intervention by government, the private earnings of the top income quintile are, as Senator Minchin told the Senate today in question time, 43 times higher than that of the lowest quintile. But once you factor in taxes and benefits and the way in which those things have been structured differently in the last decade, that ratio falls to three to one. In other words, although it is true to say, I suppose, that the rich are getting richer in this Australia, the poor have also had advantages from those arrangements. They have also had their conditions lifted—although obviously not in every case.
Obviously, there are some people who have not been advantaged under those arrangements whose condition individually is worse than it might have been at some point in the past. But that will always be true. No system of alleviation of poverty, no system of taxation or welfare distribution will ever prevent that from occurring. We therefore have to focus on what it is that we can do to increase the extent to which our social safety net captures those people. ABS data shows that between 1995-96 and 2003-04 the real income of low-income households increased by 22 per cent and there has been no significant change in income inequality since the mid 1990s. That is a very significant set of circumstances.
Obviously, there is a great deal more to be done. We have pockets of poverty in Australia which are simply intolerable, given the wealth that we enjoy as a community. But it is true to say that we cannot hope to have an effective community debate about how we attack those remaining areas of poverty without some better explanation by Australia’s leaders to the community of how far we have come and how far we need to go. In this debate, Senator Moore applauded the initiatives which the government has taken, and I acknowledge that comment. But I have to say that I do not always get that message from the Australian Labor Party when I hear it talking about issues associated with poverty. In fact, it sends a message that is often stated in the community, which is that poverty is getting worse, and that simply is not true. The problem with that message is that it disempowers so many in the community who think that that repeats the message that poverty will always be with us. We need to say to the community: ‘Actually, poverty is a summit that we can scale, and we can scale that summit because we are already more than halfway up that slope.’ That is the message that we need to get out to Australians today, and I believe that we can and we should be imparting that message to all Australians.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Poverty</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,12,1
"Bartlett, Sen Andrew",AD,2006-10-17,"—I welcome the fact that the Senate is marking the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty by turning its mind to the importance of this task and the need to focus on how best to address the fact that hundreds of thousands of Australians currently live in poverty. It is important, I believe, to try to address the issue in as balanced a way as possible and to recognise facts and reality rather than just pick ideological assertions that might suit our preconceived prejudices. In that respect, looking for opportunities to conduct debates like this in a multipartisan way is important.
I would suggest there has been somewhat of a failure by some on what is usually called the Left of politics. I think labels like ‘Left’ and ‘Right’ are sometimes fairly limited if not grossly misleading in their value—although, having said that, I will use them myself nonetheless. People who normally would be labelled as being on the Left often do not adequately recognise the importance of a well-functioning economy in generating wealth and employment opportunities. That is something where there have been areas of progress in Australia. More importantly, I think we need to recognise that part of the way to alleviate existing poverty is to continue to look for ways to generate that wealth in a sustainable way, ecologically as well as economically.
But there is also a failure of those who would normally be seen as being on the Right to recognise that alleviating poverty is about more than this. It is about more than just generating jobs and keeping interest rates low and all those sorts of things, important as they are. Something that I do not think gets enough recognition in addressing poverty is not so much the issue of income redistribution—of taking more money away from people who have lots of it and giving it to people who have less of it, though there is some value in doing that up to a point—but rather that we need to recognise the importance of providing opportunities for people to generate their own wealth to get themselves out of poverty, whether that is financial or other forms of poverty. In my view, in many cases the heart of poverty is a lack of opportunity to alleviate not just financial need but other need. Wealthy people are people who have the opportunity to alleviate their needs, whether it is the need to reskill and retrain, to develop their education, to access health services, including mental health services, or to access the underrecognised but essential component of secure, appropriate and affordable housing. They are areas where we do not do as well we should.
We also are not recognising that, whilst there is statistically some basis for what Senator Humphries said about there not being an increase in income inequality, there has undoubtedly been a statistical increase in wealth inequality. There is a much greater and continually growing gap between those who have wealth and those who do not. That is particularly driven by our inequitable and very inefficient housing market. One area where we have failed to address a growing area of poverty is that whole area of housing affordability or the lack thereof. A growing number of Australians are having to spend greater and greater proportions of their income simply to keep a roof over their heads, let alone a roof over their heads in an area where they might be able to access employment, health and educational opportunities.
These are the areas where we need more national leadership. That is why I think debates like this are important, because it is another area where for some reason poverty is seen as a politically loaded word—that by acknowledging the fact that we have failed to deal with poverty properly we are somehow saying that our society has failed or we are condemning our economic system. I think there is ample evidence to show that our economic system with all its flaws does better at getting people out of poverty than plenty of other systems. But it is a simple fact that to really address or eradicate poverty—as the ultimate goal should be, however unachievable it might seem—you must have a strong set of goals to achieve it. You cannot just have a fuzzy notion of: ‘We’d like to get rid of it.’ You need to actually make a strategy out of it and take it on as a national agenda.
Where this government has failed is that it refuses to set forward a national strategy to tackle poverty and it will not take on a national strategy or national leadership to deal with housing affordability problems. In any of these areas it prefers to step back and say, ‘That’s a matter for the states,’ or, ‘It’s just a matter of economic management.’ It is not just a matter of economic management. That is important and necessary, but it is not sufficient. Until we actually get enough courage in our political system in general and national governments take national leadership and national responsibility for the hard stuff as well as the easy stuff, we are never going to get as far as we need to.
The most obvious example of that is demonstrated by the situation that many Indigenous Australians still find themselves in. It is impossible to talk about success as a nation in removing inequality and alleviating poverty until we get major advancement in the situation faced by Indigenous Australians. That is not just about ensuring there is more money available. In fact, in many cases, that is the least of the problems. When we have a group in our community whose average life expectancy is at least 17 years less than that of the rest of us—so one quarter of their life is taken away before they start—that is what poverty is really about and that is what we have to tackle.
I would take this opportunity to reinforce the Democrats’ strong belief that all of us across the political spectrum and in the wider community must give greater priority to removing that inequality faced by Indigenous Australians and the poverty that they are facing. We have all failed collectively in that regard from across the political spectrum. Until we give more priority to it, we will continue to fail.
I would also like to say in closing that we should also not forget other countries in our region. For all the difficulties our region faces with poverty and other challenges, we are much better off on average than most other people who live in our region and elsewhere on the globe. We need to make sure that we try to do more to alleviate the absolute poverty that many of those people still live in today.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE</title>,<title>Poverty</title>,MATTERS OF PUBLIC IMPORTANCE,12,1
"Fifield, Sen Mitchell",LP,2006-10-17,"—The authorship of this motion is worth noting. It is interesting that it is a collaborative effort of Labor, the Democrats and the Greens. This is interesting at a time when the ALP is endeavouring to convince the community that they have joined the economic mainstream. There is no point pretending that the policy responses to the issue of poverty are something that we agree upon; we do not. I merely note this because the authorship of this motion indicates a world view—a philosophical outlook which Labor, the Democrats and the Greens share—and that leads to particular policy proposals. I do not think that we should pretend that we actually agree on what those policy proposals are.
None of us likes poverty. All of us are in the business of public service, I think, because we want to raise the living standards of Australians and to do whatever we can to achieve that outcome. All of us want to reduce poverty. All of us want to ameliorate the causes and consequences of poverty, but the two sides of this chamber do not, as I have said, agree on how to get there.
I think we should remember Bob Hawke’s declaration that by 1990 no Australian child need live in poverty. Poverty is not something that you can will away; it is not something that you can legislate away. I well recall the debate at that time about the original text of Mr Hawke’s speech. The text originally supposedly said that no child need live in poverty. I think that original text was right—that such is the social welfare system in Australia that no-one should or need be hungry, homeless or lack the medical care and attention that they need.
I would like to say something that I know might not be fashionable or popular: there will always be income inequality in Australia. Some people will always be relatively better off than others will. For a variety of reasons, there will always be people who are at the margins of society. Some of these people will be in difficulties because of circumstances entirely beyond their control—domestic violence, family break-up, mental illness or just plain bad luck. There will always be people in those particular circumstances. We can, we should and we do look after people who are in those particular circumstances.
There will also always be people who are in difficult circumstances that are partly of their own making—it might be through drug abuse. We can, we should and we do look after those people as well. There will also always be people who are in difficult circumstances entirely as a direct result of decisions and choices that they themselves have made in their lives. It is unfashionable and not popular to say that, but that is the case.
Again, as a community we can, we will and we should do what we can to help those people. We can and we should do what we can to help all those three categories of people to reduce the incidence, the number, of people in those circumstances and to help them once they are in those circumstances. That is something that I think we agree upon around the chamber.
But I am troubled by the premise of this motion. It presumes that poverty can be eradicated. As noble as that goal may be, I do not think it can be. The second premise that I think is false is that the government has not done all that it can to address poverty. I think that is implied in the motion. On this side of the chamber, our approach—and it has been partly ridiculed today—is that the best poverty buster is a strong economy because a strong economy leads to lower unemployment. The best way to lift a household’s income is to give the members of that household a job.
I believe that many of those opposite do not understand that economic and social policy are not mutually exclusive; each is necessary to the other. You need a good and strong economy to afford a good social policy. Many other countries in our region would love a good social policy; they would love to reduce poverty. It is not that they are against doing that; it is that their economy does not give them the financial capacity to do so—to ameliorate the effects of poverty. A good economy, a growing economy, creates jobs, lowers unemployment and lifts people’s individual incomes as well as their household incomes.
But a strong economy does something else. It allows a government and a community to fund a social safety net for those who, for a range of reasons, are left behind. We all acknowledge that there are people who are left behind. Sadly, it is those opposite who have routinely opposed every measure that this government has designed to create the foundations for a good and strong economy—whether it has been through balanced budgets, of which every single measure designed to bring the budget back into balance has been opposed by those opposite, whether it has been through tax reform or whether it has been through industrial relations reform.
Those collective policies have achieved a fantastic result for the Australian people. Under the coalition, real wages have increased by 16.4 per cent; under 13 years of Labor, they actually decreased by 0.2 per cent. There have been 1.9 million new jobs created. Unemployment is now at 4.8 per cent; when Labor left office, it was 8.2 per cent and it peaked under them at 10.9 per cent. Under Labor, household wealth increased in net terms by only 2.9 per cent per annum; under this government, household wealth has actually doubled since 1996 and the spending power of Australians has increased as well. It has been a good result for the Australian people. We all want to do more to help those who are poor. But I have to say that, if I had to pick any country in the world in which to experience hard times, I would pick Australia—and, if I had to pick a government under which to experience hard times, I would pick a Liberal government.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2006-10-17,"—This is a continuation of my contribution in this debate on the Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2006 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2006—I had started my remarks last night but had only about two minutes then. In recent weeks we have seen yet another report, an OECD report titled Education at a glance 2006, with some very unfavourable comments about Australia in relation to higher education. It certainly shows that this Prime Minister and this government deserve an ‘F’ for education and training. There can be no doubt about the meaning of this report: ‘F’ signifies failure. While the rest of the OECD countries around the world have increased their public investment in tertiary education by an average of 48 per cent, Australia is the only country in the developed world—I emphasise: the only country—to see a decline, of seven per cent. Surely that must be not only a national but an international disgrace.
Let me give you some comparisons. In the OECD report we see the increases by other countries in their funding contributions to tertiary education. In the United States, the increase has been 67 per cent; in Canada, 37 per cent; in Japan, 32 per cent; and in Switzerland, 74 per cent. But what we see in Australia is a decline in public investment of seven per cent—so not an increase but, in fact, a decline. And it is not as if we do not have the money. This government boasts of its enormous budget surplus; we often hear about good times and economic prosperity in this country. It is simply down to the government’s short-sighted ideology and its blind desire to turn our higher education system into an American copy. So Australia is going backwards internationally while everyone else is going ahead. No wonder we have a massive skill shortage impeding our future development and prosperity—a skill shortage brought about solely by this government and its lack of attention to higher education.
Furthermore, the report shows that the Howard government’s HECS hikes have meant that Australian university students are now paying the second highest fees in the world. Under the Howard government Australians are paying more and more simply to get a degree. These massive increases in university fees are forcing up the total debts faced by students and graduates by $2 billion a year, taking Australia further down the track of an American style university system. The new Senate estimates figures from the Department of Education, Science and Training show that university graduates and students will owe $18.8 billion—that is billion, not million—in HECS debts by 2008-09. We have the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Minister Bishop, trying to spin herself out of trouble by saying that the massive rise in debt is simply due to the rise in student numbers. Try again, Minister. That is simply wrong, as the student numbers have risen by only a small percentage, in fact 0.2 per cent, according to DEST’s own figures, between 2004 and 2005, compared to the rise in student debt. What we have seen from this government is a deliberate shift: a decline in university funding and the onus being moved onto students through their HECS increases over the life of this government.
Included, of course, in the funding this bill proposes is the application of indexation to university grants across the forward estimates years. This is a major matter—indeed, our universities continue to suffer from inadequate indexation, as they have done for 10 years under this government. The rate of indexation being applied to university operating grants by the government averages around two per cent per annum. By comparison, average weekly earnings rose by an average of 4.5 per cent annually between 1998 and 2004. Salary costs are the largest component of any university’s operating expenses, ranging between 45 per cent and 70 per cent—more like 70 per cent or more, I would have thought. The gap between indexation and the growth in wage costs continues to rise. In fact, I understand that what is needed to compensate universities for the gap between indexation and the rise in wage costs is somewhere around $500 million. As the gap rises, so do the financial pressures on universities—their staff, courses, class sizes and students. The ratio of students to tutor or lecturer in higher education in 1991 was about 15.6 to one. That ratio in 2004 was 20.7 to one. So there has been an increase in class sizes.
In particular, the shift in responsibility from the Commonwealth and public purse to either students or universities themselves has been most significant in the last 10 years. For example, Commonwealth grants to universities in 1996 when this government took over represented about 57 per cent of total university revenue. More than 50 per cent of funding going to universities was from the Commonwealth government. In 2003 around 41 per cent of university revenue came from the Commonwealth. So we have seen a downward shift of 16 per cent.
What has been the reaction from the sector? The universities have no other option but to impose fees. Somehow the 16 per cent difference has to be made up. In 1996 universities had 13 per cent of their revenue base made up of fees from students. In 2003 universities relied on about 24 per cent of their funding to come from student fees. So from 1996 to 2003 we have had a 16 per cent decline in the funding coming from the Commonwealth to universities. At the same time, universities have compensated for that by imposing fees on students which have risen from 13 per cent to 24 per cent of their revenue. So it is not surprising that we do not come up to the mark in an international report such as the one produced by the OECD.
Let us look at the impact on regional universities, and in particular Charles Darwin University in the Northern Territory. Charles Darwin University has about 17,665 students—people, that is, not equivalent full-time students or TAFE students, but actual bodies—according to their 2005 statistics. Out of that about 5,380 people are in higher education. Charles Darwin University suffered a $6 million cut in the first year of this government coming to power. We know what that meant at the time for the then Northern Territory University. It meant that they had to abolish courses, areas of faculties and departments. The English faculty, for example, was one that was abolished to much hue and cry from the local community. The arts department suffered as a result.
All up, since 1996 Charles Darwin University has faced nearly $40 million in recurrent funding being withdrawn by the Howard government. Forty million dollars over the course of 10 years is a large cost for a university like Charles Darwin University to have to wear, particularly when they do a splendid job in trying to deliver higher education right around the Territory in places such as Gove, Nhulunbuy, Katherine, Alice Springs and even in the remote centres. It is extremely expensive and time consuming to get lecturers out to those places and to service students in those places. This university has had to struggle to survive and to continue offering higher education right around the Territory while they have suffered a $40 million reduction in their recurrent funding under the Howard government. So reduction in funding has a massive impact on small and regional universities such as Charles Darwin University.
At a time when our university system is grossly underfunded and in need of serious attention, all we are getting from this government is an inadequate, incoherent policy response to the needs of our university system to diversify, innovate and meet Australia’s higher education needs.
I want to spend some time having a look at Indigenous people participating in higher education. I have not heard any comment about that in this debate in this chamber or from my colleagues in the House of Representatives. We know that this government set up the Indigenous Higher Education Advisory Council. Let us give that a tick because that is a good thing. It is time Indigenous people have an avenue in the tertiary education sector through which advice can be given directly to the minister. I notice that we do not have it in the school sector but at least we have it in higher education. I want to commend the government for putting representatives from the trade union movement on it—people like Joel Wright, who works for the National Tertiary Education Union—who have a broad network of connections in the education sector. Their expertise is welcomed and recognised.
On 18 July the new minister, the honourable Julie Bishop, launched the Indigenous Higher Education Advisory Council’s report called Improving Indigenous outcomes and enhancing Indigenous culture and knowledge in Australian higher education. The report also included the outcomes of the Indigenous Higher Education Advisory Council 2005 conference—because, remember, there was a commitment from this government to have an Indigenous higher education conference each year—titled Education led recovery of Indigenous capacity: reshaping the policy agenda. The reforms and initiatives in the report aimed to substantially improve the quality of Indigenous peoples’ participation in higher education as staff and students. It put forward, though, one overarching recommendation. The cornerstone or the keystone of that report stated:
A major national project be undertaken to investigate and report on Indigenous education initiatives and strategies in higher education that are successful in improving access and rates of retention and completion.
There were 35 specific recommendations in that area and they went to: encouraging universities to work with schools and TAFE colleges; developing a concerted strategy to improve the levels of Indigenous undergraduate enrolment; improving the level of Indigenous postgraduate enrolment; improving the rates of success, retention and—let us not forget—completion for Indigenous students; enhancing the prominence of Indigenous culture and knowledge; increasing the number of Indigenous people working in universities; and improving the participation of Indigenous people in university governance and management.
But what have we seen since that the report was handed down in July? Each month I carefully look and watch to see if we have got another announcement about how this is going to be implemented, but I suspect that it is going to be another report that sits on the shelf gathering dust without any strategic plan or performance indicators to put it in place. One of the critical issues addressed by the Indigenous Higher Education Advisory Council report was the ongoing debate about the decline in Indigenous student commencements since the invincible date of 2000. We all know what happened at that turn of events. The report went on to say:
Despite some advances, Indigenous people remain significantly under-represented in Australian higher education. The number of indigenous students commencing higher education rose steadily throughout the 1990s—
that is true—
but dropped significantly in 2000 and has fluctuated since.
In the latest report to the federal parliament on Indigenous education there was a decline of nearly 600 students in the 12 months of that reporting period. Despite the fact that this government continue to deny this, the decline has been brought about by the changes to the Indigenous student income support, Abstudy, introduced between 2000 and 2003. Every significant report I have seen, every academic who has researched this and every person who wants to point to the reason Indigenous education is declining in the higher education sector points to that moment when the Abstudy changes occurred. Everybody seems to recognise this except this government. They are still in denial about that. The Indigenous Higher Education Advisory Council report says:
Changes to ABSTUDY with the aim of aligning the means tests and payment rates with those of Youth Allowance and Newstart took effect from 1 January 2000. There was a sharp decline in higher education Indigenous enrolments in 2000 and ABSTUDY recipient numbers in higher education declined significantly in 2002 and 2003 (DEST, 2004). It is likely that both the means test and the payment rates need urgent reconsideration”.
And now we have got the government’s own Indigenous Higher Education Advisory Council in a report to government also confirming that they believe that was the trigger for the decline.
One of the most significant changes was the abolition of the Student Supplementary Financial Support Scheme. This provided students in receipt of Abstudy or Austudy with loans to pay for additional living and education costs associated with university study. We know that in the years prior to the abolition of the loans the number of commencing Indigenous students had been steadily increasing from 7,342 in 2001 to 8,871 in 2002 and then to 8,998 in 2003. But the loans scheme was abolished in April 2003, after which there was an almost immediate decline of 12.1 per cent in Indigenous student commencements in 2004, going down to 7,902, and in 2005, based on half-yearly figures, an 11 per cent decline was already evident. So since 2003 we have actually seen 1,955 fewer Indigenous commencements, representing a decline of 21.8 per cent. Under this government we have seen a massive underspending in higher education, a deliberate shift to include the cost—(Time expired)
",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2006 BUDGET AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,18,1
"Webber, Sen Ruth",ALP,2006-10-17,"—The Higher Education Legislation Amendment (2006 Budget and Other Measures) Bill 2006 amends the Higher Education Support Act 2003, the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 and the Australian Research Council Act 2001. This amendment bill contains no fewer than nine schedules. It is noteworthy that under this government the public investment in higher education has fallen while in all other OECD nations it has increased.
There are enough studies and research available stressing the impact of higher education on our community. Whether a university degree, a diploma gained at a TAFE college or a trade acquired through the apprenticeship system, higher education is the best means to build a more prosperous Australia. This week we have a report from the Queensland Council of Social Services that shows that lack of education is a key determinant influencing the cycle of poverty, an issue that we discussed earlier this afternoon.
Higher education should not just be equated with gaining a university qualification. Higher education is the path by which all people can move upwards. Yet this government has demonstrated that higher education is not as important to it as it should be. Australia is now the only OECD nation that has been cutting public investment in higher education as a percentage of GDP since 1995. The figures speak for themselves. In real terms this government has presided over a system that has seen its expenditure reduced by eight per cent as a proportion of GDP. The OECD average, on the other hand, has been an increase of some 38 per cent. This falling public expenditure has had its effects not only on university campuses around Australia but also at TAFE colleges.
As I have said on numerous occasions in this place, the current skill shortages in our economy are the responsibility of this government and this government alone. It does not matter whether it is a shortfall of doctors, nurses, engineers, plumbers or carpenters. When you fail to invest in higher education you are failing to invest in the future development of your economy. Now that we have a fully-fledged skill shortage, out come the bandaids from the government. Out come the increases in temporary work visas, out come the Australian technical colleges and out comes last week’s announcement on training. Now in schedule 1 of this legislation we see the increase in nursing places and medical places.
This government is not concerned with nation building. This government cannot see beyond the next election. Even if it can see beyond the next election, it certainly does not have a plan for it. Let us consider for a moment what its current term of government has delivered: legislation about student unionism that does nothing more than suit its ideological purposes and Australian technical colleges that will not deliver any additional tradespeople until 2008. Even now only some five out of 24 are up and running. In fact, this week we have seen the directors of TAFE colleges urging the co-location of Australian technical colleges within the existing TAFE system—an approach that is actually taking place in the Pilbara. We have a government that only takes action after the crisis has occurred.
One of my major concerns about the effect of decisions of this government and the skill shortages relates to the analysis of the labour market. It used to be the case in this country that the department of employment monitored and analysed emerging trends in the workforce. This allowed government to introduce policies and to adjust immigration intakes to take into account changes in the labour market. How is it that we have been caught short on the skill shortages? Is it that the department has not been conducting the analysis of the emerging trends, or that successive ministers have been ignoring this advice? Whichever is the case, there is no doubt that information must have been available that highlighted potential or actual shortages.
Take the case of the additional Commonwealth supported places funded by the Commonwealth Grant Scheme that are included in schedule 1 of this amendment bill. Two hundred additional medical places will commence in 2007, and that will increase to 405 places by 2009. We know that the Productivity Commission identified that shortages existed in a number of health professions and that in essence we needed to train more health workers to meet projected needs. So out come the government, and they announce with great fanfare that more medical places will be created. What they of course omit to mention is that it was their decision when they came into government 10 years ago to reduce the number of Commonwealth supported places that led to the problem in the first place.
We also have to acknowledge that, even with the increased emphasis on training medical students in the area of general practice, these changes will mean a reduction in the number of patients that a doctor will be able to see. I was talking recently to doctors in Perth and they pointed out to me that each student they train and supervise in their practice will mean a 25 per cent decrease in the number of patients that they can see. That is the problem with this government: it fixes one problem only by creating others. Australians are entitled to wonder what would be the current situation if the government had not made that original decision 10 years ago to reduce the number of places for medical students in our universities.
The same sorry story exists for trades and traditional apprenticeships. With great noise the government launched its new apprenticeships and traineeships schemes. But it overlooked one problem. The numbers undertaking traditional trades were decreasing, and increasingly people were not completing the apprenticeships they commenced. This government has no real understanding of the difference between seeing public expenditure on higher education as an investment and seeing it as a cost. When all you are driven by is recording record surpluses and you are not also driven by investing in the future, you get the situation we now face in Australia. Those opposite need to understand that public investment in higher education benefits all of us and should be treated accordingly.
Let me turn to some of the specific details in schedule 1, in particular those that are part of the COAG mental health package. The bill funds 431 additional new places in undergraduate nursing courses, with a mental health major commencing in 2007. We are told that this will increase to 1,148 places by 2010. As part of the COAG mental health package, 210 additional Commonwealth supported postgraduate clinical psychology places will be commencing in 2007. This also will increase to 400 places by 2008.
I have some concerns with this approach generally and more specifically. My first concern is that these changes are to commence in 2007. What work has been undertaken already for the institutions that are to receive this funding to ensure that those additional places can be accommodated and that sufficient educators are in place to commence from next year? I for one hope that sufficient work has been undertaken in anticipation of this change that ensures that, as of next year, institutions will have in place the resources to take in 210 postgraduate clinical psychology places and 431 nursing places with a major in mental health and that arrangements are also in place for these students to have access to training placements.
These arrangements are traditionally at public hospitals and other health institutions. There is a need for them to be put in place in a cooperative manner—not in the current dictatorial manner coming from this government when it comes to mental health funding. There is always a concern about the timing of policy announcements and whether they are achievable. We saw the time lag between the announcement of the Australian technical colleges policy in 2004 and the graduation of the first student.
My other concern with these announcements is how they will affect Western Australia. As a general rule of thumb, Western Australia typically receives about 10 per cent of any new initiative. These figures tell me that we can expect about 20 postgraduate clinical psychology places and about 43 nurses with a mental health major. I am not confident that this will address the needs of the Western Australian community, particularly for those living in rural and regional areas. As a member of the Senate Select Committee on Mental Health I think that the government should have done better.
The COAG mental health package was announced back in April and here we are halfway through October and only now are these measures being debated in this place. The report of the senate select committee made this clear: surely there is a degree of urgency with how we deal with the issue of mental health. A time lag of six months between the announcement and the presentation of enabling legislation does not fill me with confidence. I can only trust that these places will be available at the start of the 2007 academic year.
One of the other concerns I have is that many of the people in our community with qualifications and skills in a particular area do not work in that area. Surely a task for government is to determine the factors why so many holders of nursing qualifications, for instance, do not work in the nursing occupation and why so many people who commence apprenticeships do not complete them. Once the government is able to make that determination, ensuring that suitable policies are in place will assist us in overcoming future skills shortages.
Let me now turn to schedule 2 of the amendment bill. Schedule 2 deals with FEE-HELP. FEE-HELP, as most of us know, is an income contingent loan scheme. Essentially, full-fee-paying domestic students are eligible for a loan to pay for the cost of their degrees. As we are now seeing universities charging in excess of $200,000 for a medical degree, is it any wonder that the government has had to increase the FEE-HELP loan limit to $100,000 for medicine, dentistry and veterinary science students? FEE-HELP is just another step on the path of the Americanisation of our universities.
Full-fee-paying students gain entrance to universities on one basis only: their capacity to pay. The Australian Medical Association is already on the public record as saying that all medical school places should be Commonwealth supported places. The AMA is, of course, dead right on that one. What this government is doing is going to make it increasingly difficult to gain a university place based on merit selection and increasingly easier to buy a place. In future, the ability of Australians to gain a degree will be about not only whether they can pass the course but whether they can apply for a loan to help pay their way.
It is clear that we are yet to see the full impact of full-fee-paying students and their effect on the university sector, but increasingly we are seeing the start of those changes. One of the areas that have recently been in the press is how the fall-off in enrolment in some courses results in universities having to return money to the Commonwealth. This is an area that deserves close attention. Universities have to provide government with an estimate of how many students they expect to attend a particular course. Universities then set their entry mark and await applications. In the event that the application numbers do not meet their estimate, they have to return the funds to the Commonwealth.
One of the issues is that universities have recently been in the press saying that they will be lowering their admission marks to increase the number of enrolments. Personally I am concerned that this approach puts the cart in front of the horse. What I mean is that entry should be on the basis of merit. Merit is determined by having an entry mark to the course. So if university administrators are wrong in their estimates at the moment then they pay back the money and lower their standards in the next year. I believe that our higher education institutions should be centres of excellence—excellence in research and in teaching.
Through all this we must remember that investment in higher education for our community should not be treated simply as a cost. Higher education benefits all of us. Higher education ensures that we will have a skilled workforce in the years ahead. The value of higher education should not just be measured in a budget bottom line but be seen as a way of ensuring that our country continues to be a prosperous one with decent education and incomes for all.",SENATE,<title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (2006 BUDGET AND OTHER MEASURES) BILL 2006</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,BILLS,18,1

"Ludwig, Sen Joe",ALP,2006-10-17,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
I rise to take note of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission report, the detailed title of which is Breach of Ms CD’s human rights at the Curtin Immigration Processing and Reception Centre. I notice that it got some air today during question time, and the minister undertook to provide some further information in respect of it. What I wanted to do was canvass some of the issues that are contained within it. What concerns me most of all is that the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs suffered significant problems during 2000 and 2001, particularly in relation to what are more commonly referred to as the Rau and Solon cases and then the subsequent Palmer and Comrie reports into those issues.
What has now occurred fits into that earlier time frame of 2002 or slightly thereafter, and so it could be argued that in a historical context the department has moved on. However, the way that this is being handled by the department in 2006 raises concerns. These concerns are stated by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner, although stated silently. There was an inappropriate action taken in relation to the human rights of a person who is referred to as Ms CD. The commissioner said, ‘I was of the tentative view that the act of the department of continuing to accommodate the complainant in Charlie compound through June, July and August 2002 and failing to move her to a more suitable compound in the circumstances constituted an act or a practice by or on behalf of the Commonwealth in the meaning defined.’
Therefore, there was an adverse finding against the department that they had inappropriately housed Ms CD. The finding went to a number of issues. One of them was a recommendation for financial compensation, which is not that unusual in these circumstances. Where someone has been wronged, there is a redress—both an apology and a finding for financial compensation. In this instance, the apology was quick off the mark, if I can say it that way. As noted under heading 5, the report went on to say that on 2 September 2005 the department provided a written apology to the complainant. But it was different when it came to the financial compensation.
The commissioner’s quietly understated comment on this was to refer back to the report, in which, after taking into account all the matters, he recommended that $15,000 be paid. The commissioner then referred those reading the report back to section 1.3, which was the response from the Commonwealth to the commissioner’s comment that the respondent was invited to advise the commission whether:
... it has taken or is taking any action as a result of my findings and recommendations.
The department were aware for some time of what the recommendation was. The department responded by letter on 23 June 2006, so presumably the commission had given the department reasonable notice up to that point. However, their response was:
The President recommends that, in addition to the general efforts of the department to ensure all immigration detainees are treated in a culturally appropriate way, the department should have particular regard and act appropriately to circumstances in which there may be a history of hostility between certain groups of people ...
The response goes on to explain that they are going to do something about the way that they detain people to ensure that there will be a new client placement model for the immigration detention services network and those matters. They then go on to note the $15,000 compensation and say:
Please be assured that we are working on this matter as a high priority and will get back to you on this as soon as possible.
The report went to print. It is now well into October. Clearly, the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commissioner is still waiting for the ‘high-priority’ and ‘as soon as possible’ response to eventuate. (Time expired)

"McGauran, Sen Julian",LP,2006-10-17,"—I rise to bring to the attention of the Senate an event held on 8 August this year that took place at the Melbourne Shrine of Remembrance. It was a ceremony to reinstate the 39th Battalion to active service in our armed forces for the first time since that battalion was disbanded in 1943. I am proud to say that for some time now I have been a honorary member of the 39th Battalion and regrettably, due to parliamentary sittings, I was unable to attend this fine and proud ceremony, which was attended by the Governor-General.
The 39th Battalion’s story is one of the greatest stories told in Australian history. It is the Kokoda Track story of 1942. Yes, those of the 39th Battalion—and many are still alive today—are the men of the Kokoda Track. They faced odds of six to one when, on 21 July 1942, the Japanese forces landed by surprise at Buna on the north coast of Papua and, marching west, advanced rapidly across the Owen Stanley Range toward Port Moresby. The Japanese were battle hardened, well equipped and specifically trained for jungle warfare and, to that date in the war, they were the undefeated conquerors of all South-East Asia and China.
Those famous ‘mud over blood’ colours have now risen again, though in a very different and modern form to the old 39th Battalion. Nevertheless, the colours, the motto ‘factis non verbis’—deeds not words—and the legend are to be passed on to a new and proud generation of 39th fighting men and women. The name 39th Battalion has existed since 1916 when volunteers for the 1st AIF formed the unit in Ballarat, Victoria. As a member of the 3rd Division, the 39th served with distinction in all the major battles in France. Its colours, emblazoned with battle honours, were laid up in the Ballarat Anglican cathedral. They have since been brought to Melbourne and now hold their place of honour in the crypt of the shrine.
The reason the 39th was disbanded in the first place was bewildering. The President of the 39th Australian Infantry Battalion Association, and 39th veteran, Alan ‘Kanga’ Moore, said:
The reason could not have been associated in our performance in action which had been widely applauded. Our conclusion was that we were so reduced in numbers that it was too big a job to reform and re-equip us.
It has aggrieved us for 63 years that our name, the 39th Battalion, which had existed since 1916 was struck from the Order of Battle of the Australian Army.
Gladly this is now rectified.
The Kokoda story is, without doubt, comparable to the Gallipoli story in every way—except that at Kokoda we won. The 39th fought like they did because they believed they were the last line of defence of Australia—and they were. The reason 8 August was chosen for the ceremony at the shrine was because that is the date on which A Company of the 39th recaptured Kokoda in 1942. It has since become known as Kokoda Day, and although that is not official in our national calendar I believe it ought to be. There is an ongoing campaign by the RSL and so many others to establish this day in our national calendar.
I would like to borrow from the address by the Governor-General which was published in The Good Guts, the official magazine of the 39th Battalion, to epitomise the spirit of the 39th that made the story we know today. He said:
... Lieutenant Colonel Ralph Honner ... taking up his new command on 16 August 1942 ... found his soldiers already exhausted from fierce fighting in the most inhospitable of conditions, many suffering tropical diseases, and facing a numerically superior, confident and ruthless enemy.
                  …         …           …
Ralph Honner later wrote: “When, on the 27th, the complete relief of the 39th was ordered for the following day, I had sent back, under Lieutenant Johnson the weakest of the battalion’s sick to have them one stage ahead of the long march to Moresby—they were too feeble for the fast moving fighting expected at the front.” Two days later, Johnson, learning of the plight of the ... 39th ... led his soldiers back—the fittest of the unfit returning into battle.
To capture the essence of this bravery, the Governor-General went on to quote from the book We Were There:
“The battalion was in trouble, so twenty-seven out of the thirty went back. The three who didn’t were minus a foot, had a bullet in the throat, and a forearm blown off. We never did it for God, King and Country—forget that. We did it because the 39th expected it of us.”
The Governor-General went on to say:
Such conduct in the face of unimaginable odds, of men prepared to give every ounce they had, physically and mentally, when nothing more could reasonably be expected of them, epitomises the incomparable spirit of the 39th.
Time is marching on for these old soldiers. I received notice that Gordon ‘Rocket’ Bailey passed away last Friday, and I offer my sincere condolences and prayers to his widow and family in this time of their sorrow. However, the 39th now lives on. And I say to all the young soldiers joining the force: no battalion could give a greater example of doing your duty for your mate and for your country than the 39th.",SENATE,<title>ADJOURNMENT</title>,<title>39th Battalion</title>,ADJOURNMENT,20,1
