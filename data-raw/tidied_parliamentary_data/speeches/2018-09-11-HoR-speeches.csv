Ms CATHERINE KING
 (Ballarat) (12:03):  I want to speak briefly to the amendments. These are of course government amendments to its own legislation. We're seeing this government as a bit of a shambles in that it's now having to once again introduce amendments to its own legislation because it hasn't been able to get this legislation up through the parliament in the time frame that it said it would.


I understand there are a couple of issues that the government has also decided to now include in this Private Health Insurance Legislation Amendment Bill 2018, relating in particular to the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman having to provide 48 hours notice to insurers, where the ombudsman will exercise his new entry powers, and to only delegate his functions to persons with appropriate expertise. Whilst the latter we certainly agree with, I do want to flag that we'll have a look at how the operation of the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman's provision of 48 hours notice to insurers operates in practice. We'll support this amendment, but I do want to have a look at how over time that operates in practice. What the legislation was trying to do was to ensure that the Private Health Insurance Ombudsman had greater powers to investigate complaints that have been arising in the private health insurance field. We understand, through the Senate committee process and the scrutiny of bills, it is believed that, due to fair process, the 48 hours is necessary. But I want to flag that that's certainly one of the areas that, in practice, we want to have a look at.


Again, here we have a government that has been so distracted by itself, so distracted by the plotting within the party, that it wasn't able to get its own legislation correct in the first place. So it's had to come back into this place and has had to move amendments to its own bill—not accepting amendments that others may have moved. If we had had a Minister for Health who was concentrating on his day job, rather than the plotting that this minister was engaged in, we might have been able to have a bill that didn't require the government to amendment it. As I said at the outset, Labor will support these amendments, but that the government is once again having to come forward with amendments to its own legislation certainly shows how distracted and in complete disarray this government is.

"Keay, Justine, MP",ALP,2018-09-11,"



Ms KEAY
 (Braddon) (13:30):  During the Braddon by-election, I challenged the Prime Minister, then Malcolm Turnbull, to come to Burnie and walk in the shoes of an aged-care worker after his despicable comments in question time, devaluing aged care as an occupation and telling a 60-year-old aged-care worker that they are entitled to aspire to get a better job. Unsurprisingly, he ignored my request. Last week, it was my privilege to spend a day walking in the shoes of Elaine, an extended care assistant at Meercroft Care in my home town of Devonport. Her aspirations aren't for a better job, but for better conditions and pay, and for a government that respects her, her colleagues and the residents they care for.


My electorate is the fastest-ageing electorate in the country, and the demand for aged-care workers is increasing at an enormous rate. To suggest that aged-care workers should aspire to do something else so they can increase their take-home pay is not only hurtful, but the opposite of what our community needs. We need people like Elaine, who are not afraid to get their hands dirty; who are not afraid to speak up for the rights of people they care for who feel that they may no longer have a voice; and who are there for those in their care, in their final moments, to hold their hand, to afford them the dignity and respect that they deserve.


Tomorrow is the inaugural Thank You For Working In Aged Care Day, a day organised by the Health Services Union for their campaign, Our Turn To Care. I want to put on the record my sincere thanks to the hundreds and thousands of committed and passionate workers who look after and care for our elderly and loved ones. They are very dignified jobs.

"Butler, Mark, MP",ALP,2018-09-11,"



Mr BUTLER
 (Port Adelaide) (15:14):  We've had a few MPI debates on energy policy over recent weeks because, frankly, this has been a movable feast, to say the least. We had a matter of public importance on energy policy debated in the last week of Malcolm Turnbull's prime ministership, a time when he had just announced the third version of the National Energy Guarantee in just seven days. It was a week that featured surrender after abject surrender and retreat after cowardly retreat by Malcolm Turnbull in the face of an onslaught by the hard right, led by the usual suspects, the member for Warringah, who's not here for this debate, the member for Hughes, who's always in this debate, and the member for Hume, who has been rewarded for his treachery by being appointed the Minister for Energy.


We warned Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull at the time that he would not be rewarded for his abject, weak surrenders to the hard right agenda on energy policy. We warned him and we were proven right. The member for Warringah, always grateful for a bit of weak surrender, said that it was just 'a conversion of convenience' that Malcolm Turnbull had undertaken. Of course, true to form, he didn't let up, and now we have the member for Cook as the Prime Minister of the country. Everyone is asking, 'Why did this happen?' Was it just the personal ambition of a number of the people who now find themselves on the front bench, was it just the petty hatreds that get built up after leadership coup after leadership coup or was it something deeper?


I've been talking for a little while now about this deep, philosophical division that lies at the heart of the coalition, particularly in the Liberal Party. A key reason is that there is a battle for the soul of the Liberal Party underway at the moment. The centrepiece of the battle is climate and energy policy. What the deposal of the last Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, involved was a fight within the coalition to place the hard right agenda on climate and energy policy right at the heart of this government.


The new Prime Minister, the member for Cook, pretends that he had to have his arm twisted to be appointed Prime Minister and he just happened to be in the right place at the right time when someone said, 'Surprise, surprise, Member for Cook, you're going to have the job of Prime Minister'—with no treachery on his part and no numbers being done on his part to try to come through the middle between the member for Dickson and the then member for Wentworth! We see what he has ultimately given to the hard right in response to their support. He has given us the member for Hume as the energy minister, perhaps the key piece of surrender to the hard right. But he has walked away from the National Energy Guarantee. He's walked away from National Energy Guarantee version 3.0, which—count them—was the fifth energy policy this government had in just three years. He's walked away from any policy to deliver on the commitments to reduce carbon pollution under the Paris agreement and walked away from any responsibility to future generations of Australians—our children and our grandchildren—to ensure that they live in a safe climate.


But, as the member for Wakefield, soon to be the member for Spence, said, 'The key concession was to hand the energy portfolio to one of their own'—to one of the hard right who has been fighting this fight within the Liberal Party since he came to this building. We now have the most ideological person ever to hold the Energy portfolio sitting at this table in this debate. There is no clearer example of this government focusing on their own divisions and their own ideological obsessions, instead of on the interests of the Australian people, than the shambles of energy policy debate that's gone on in their party room. The evidence is clear. What this extraordinary turn of events over recent weeks has shown, and what it will make absolutely sure of, is that the energy crisis that's emerged under this government is going to get far, far worse.


Sensible members of this government understand that—even the new Treasurer, who profited, coincidentally, out of this coup against the member for Wentworth. Even he recognised this on Insiders on Sunday. He said that no-one was more disappointed than him at the death of the National Energy Guarantee. Again, it's all about them. It's all about the poor old new Treasurer and his disappointment; not about the thousands of businesses that have been waiting for an energy policy finally to be settled by this government after seeing the power prices skyrocket over the last five years under this government and the viability of their businesses placed in jeopardy while this coalition party room undertakes its parlour games over whether climate change is real or not real. There was no thought to the millions of households who are seeing their household bills skyrocket under a government that is completely incapable of settling an energy policy. It was all about them.


In his heart, the new Treasurer knows this is a disaster for the country and, I suspect, a disaster for the government. He and the new Prime Minister, when the new Prime Minister was the Treasurer, were promising households and businesses for weeks and months that the National Energy Guarantee was the best chance of bringing this energy crisis to an end. Only last month the now Prime Minister told Leigh Sales on 7.30 that he had never come across an initiative in his 10 years in parliament that had broader support than the National Energy Guarantee—except for five or six people on the other side of parliament who vetoed it. Every business group in this nation supported the National Energy Guarantee. Every single business group supported it.


The new minister issued a media release on the National Energy Guarantee, entitled 'National Energy Guarantee to deliver affordable, reliable electricity'. But I've looked at the minister's website, and the current version of that media release says, 'Page not found'. It says, 'We are sorry, the page you are looking for could not be found'. It's been erased from history. The energy policy that dare not speak its name again.


We actually know the member for Hume never supported it. He never supported the National Energy Guarantee. This man is the member for Warringah's candidate for energy minister. Alan Jones made absolutely clear how delighted he is about this appointment. It's one of the best appointments in politics in years, he said, because the member for Hume doesn't accept the science of climate change. In this building, in this chamber, he described climate change science as 'the new climate religion' that 'has little basis on fact and everything to do with blind faith'. He's a man who made his name campaigning against renewable energy. He was the headline act in a ridiculous rally out the front, co-headlined by Alan Jones, called the National Wind Power Fraud Rally. He said, 'Large-scale wind it's very clear that it's not economic on any grounds.' He might want to talk to the Energy Council or any other energy expert in the country who has seen these strike prices on wind and solar energy come in way, way lower, even with firming-up technology, than any other technology those opposite continue to talk about.


We do know what we're going to get from this energy minister. We're going to get no cuts in pollution and a complete abdication of any responsibility to discharge our responsibility to future generations around climate change. We're going to see a smashing of jobs and investment. His mentor, the member for Warringah, did exactly that a few years ago. There was an 88 per cent collapse in investment and thousands of jobs lost after pursuing the sort of policy the hard right in the coalition party room want. But the surest thing we will see is that prices will rise. The government's own modelling made this clear. They promised a $550 cut to power bills, but the same modelling warned that prices would go up by $300 if the National Energy Guarantee was not delivered. Tony Wood said as much in the Financial Review this morning. What we also see on the front page of the Financial Review is that future prices, the price that markets are betting on in the future, have already started to rise because of the policy uncertainty involved in this government.


The Prime Minister, in a previous life, when he was Treasurer only a few weeks ago, recognised that policy uncertainty is the key driver of price rises in this country. He said in that 7.30 interview a few weeks ago, 'If you're not for the National Energy Guarantee, then you're for continued uncertainty which leads to higher prices.' Perhaps the stand-out sentence from this minister's first speech was that he wouldn't 'even try' to deliver policy certainty or investor certainty in the delivery of an essential service in a mixed economy that their party is largely responsible for privatising over the last quarter of a century—a complete abdication of government responsibility. This government is an absolute shambles on energy policy. It has cost another Prime Minister his job, but the most important thing is it's going to cost households and businesses much, much more on their power bills.

Mr TAYLOR
 (Hume—Minister for Energy) (15:24):  Well, I don't know when lower prices became ideological, but I accept that I am absolutely committed to lower prices, getting them down, down, and down. But it's clear that Labor's reckless policies at both state and federal level are why power prices are where they are today. The member for Port Adelaide has written a book on this. It was published in 2017. The reviews are mixed, I would say, to be kind. One of them described it as 'longwinded and boring, don't bother', but I will put that aside for the moment. In his book Climate Wars, he admitted that Labor made many mistakes on energy. He said:


… we've made mistakes in both the design of our policies and their presentation … In hindsight, it's also clear to most that the carbon price introduced under the Clean Energy Act was too high …



Dr Aly interjecting—




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Hogan
):  The member for Cowan is warned!




Mr TAYLOR:
  We abolished it, and prices came down 10 per cent. During six years of Labor government, power prices doubled and went up each and every year. It was Labor who gave us pink batts, cash for clunkers, a citizen's assembly and of course the carbon tax, which I've already referred to. But they haven't learned from their mistakes, their errors of judgement. They're itching to have another crack. They want to implement a 50 per cent renewable energy target.




Dr Aly:
  You've made five mistakes!



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The member for Cowan will remove herself under 94(a).




The member for Cowan then left the chamber.





Mr TAYLOR:
  That's going to mean more subsidies and higher prices paid for by every single hardworking household and business in this country. I'll come back to what the 50 per cent will mean in a moment.


Let me talk about our track record as a government in this area. Under my predecessor, now the Treasurer, prices came down. On 1 July we saw retail price reductions—as he said only about an hour ago—in Queensland, South Australia and New South Wales. To take examples, in South-East Queensland we've seen price reductions of up to 14 per cent, $1,400 a year, off the bills of small businesses. In South-East Queensland we've seen price reductions for residential users of up to nine per cent, $140 a year. That's $140 a year for hardworking Queensland households. We've seen similar reductions across the other states that I mentioned.


Wholesale prices have also turned a corner. They're up to 25 per cent down this year on the previous year. We've secured more gas for Australia. We've seen prices up to 50 per cent down from their peak, from $20 a gigajoule down to $10 a gigajoule in 2018, and of course that's been a big part of what's been responsible for a reduction in prices.


We have reined in the power of the networks. We saw investment increase by 100 per cent in the assets of the network companies and the charges of the network companies under Labor between 2007 and 2014. We've abolished the limited merits review, and we're seeing those charges come down. But the impact of those charges has been over $1 billion a year on Australia and hardworking Australian businesses and households. As the member for Port Adelaide himself acknowledged, past overinvestment in networks has been a big part of the problem here. They had six years to deal with this, and they failed to do that.


We have taken action, and we're taking action in three areas. One is stopping the price gouging by big energy companies. It has happened, unfortunately. We saw significant increases in the bids made in the wholesale market after the closure of Hazelwood. Bids increased by over 100 per cent at the time of the closure of Hazelwood. This is what happens when you take reliable, fair dinkum, base-load power out of the system.


Secondly, we're providing customers with a price safety net. We've already seen 1.8 million households better off because of the work of the government to bring down retail prices, and we have accepted the recommendation of the ACCC to establish a default market price, which will ensure that those Australians who are least positioned to negotiate a better price will get a better price. The ACCC itself has estimated that the price savings for a typical Australian household will be between $200 and $400.


We have said that we will back investment in reliable generation, encouraging more competition. That means we need to have base-load power in the system, and we're going to back it in. Already, we're seeing a number of projects coming forward to be supported—to make sure we have the affordable base-load power that everyone in Australia wants. We have turned the corner. There is more work to do, and, with that suite of measures in those three areas—stopping the price gouging, providing customers with a price safety net, and backing in investment in reliable generation—we believe we will do that work.


There is an alternative: Labor's 50 per cent renewable energy target and 45 per cent emissions reduction target. If you look at Labor's national platform, what I like to call 'Bill's little red book', you will see that they have a plan to reshape the economy, and it will be expensive. Labor's true thinking was revealed by their environment action network, a group called LEAN, which said, 'Higher prices are not market failure; they're proof of the market working well.' They want higher prices. They believe that's a good outcome. The member for Port Adelaide endorsed LEAN. He commended them for their work. Not even the unions support this Green-left ideology. The CFMEU president said that a 50 per cent RET by 2030 will increase the cost of electricity for manufacturing and households while being a 'poor tool' to reduce Australia's overall emissions. Ben Davis, secretary of Bill Shorten's branch of the AWU, said:


The rush away from coal and gas-fired electricity power stations to renewables is a little unseemly in its haste, because we are potentially crucifying hundreds of thousands of manufacturing workers.


They are the people you used to stand up for but clearly don't anymore.


The unions aren't the only ones who have seen through this shady Leader of the Opposition and his crony, the member for Port Adelaide. You mentioned Tony Wood from the Grattan Institute earlier. On Labor's claims that prices would go down as a result of a higher emissions reduction target, what has Tony got to say? He said that it is 'unlikely to be sustainable' and will 'accelerate plant closures'. Which coal-fired power stations do you want to shut down early? Is it in Gladstone? Is it in the member for Flynn's electorate? Is it Tomago that you want to shut down? Do you want to make sure every aluminium smelter worker in Australia is out of a job? Tony Wood goes on to say that it 'requires higher consumer prices' and would be 'inherently uncertain'. That's your 50 per cent renewable energy policy.


The Business Council of Australia has described Labor's 45 per cent emissions reduction target as 'economy wrecking'. We want the subsidies to phase out, and they will. They want the pork to continue forever. Labor want to stuff the system with an intermittent generation, forcing the closure of reliable base-load generation. The fact is that Australians will pay higher power bills under Labor and will be left in the dark. Their ideologically driven plan is for higher prices and less security. Our plan is for lower prices.


We know exactly what a 50 per cent renewable energy target will do, because we've seen it in South Australia. In South Australia we've seen electricity prices amongst the highest in the world, at 47.8c per kilowatt hour. Compare that with Latvia, at 25.6c per kilowatt hour; Estonia at half that—23.4c per kilowatt hour; Romania, that energy powerhouse, at 21.2c per kilowatt hour; and Hungary at 19.3c.


The contrast could not be clearer. We've taken action. We're securing better deals for 1.8 million households, and prices are coming down. We will not be distracted from our goal of getting power prices down for Australian households and businesses by motions like this.

"Albanese, Anthony, MP",ALP,2018-09-11,"



Mr ALBANESE
 (Grayndler) (15:34):  They just had an opportunity for the new minister for energy to outline what the coalition's energy policy is, and what did we get? Nothing. 'Lower prices', he said. What's their policy to fix the drought—'More rain'? These people just cannot be taken seriously over an issue which is serious. We know what their policy was, because the now Treasurer said this just a couple of months ago:


… if you believe in lower power prices, if you want to see Australian households $550 a year better off, if you want to see the wholesale price down by 20 per cent, if you want to be side by side with the big employers across the country, you get behind the National Energy Guarantee …


That's what they were saying when parliament last sat, but now they've ripped it up. This is a new minister who doesn't know the difference between a coal-fired power station and an aluminium smelter in the Hunter Valley. This is a minister who, when he was the minister for cities, was known as a walking wind farm. There was lots of movement and lots of air around, but not much actually happened as he ran around the country.


Of course the tragedy of this is that, like in other areas of infrastructure development, what you need here for business to drive investment is certainty. But what do we have from this government? What we have when it comes to transport is that those opposite have moved away from the Infrastructure Australia model. They've taken money off projects that were ready to go and given it to projects that never, ever happened, and therefore we've seen a drop in investment. What we've seen on water is the National Water Initiative trashed by this mob. We've seen all sorts of water siphoned off to mates, with various corruption inquiries in New South Wales, and South Australia suffering at the end of the system. What we've seen on communications is the National Broadband Network abandoned, with a system now based on copper rather than fibre.


What we've seen on energy is perhaps the worst of all of the infrastructure modes. In 2007, in this parliament, both sides supported a price on carbon, an emissions trading scheme and ratifying the Kyoto protocol, but in December 2009 those opposite combined with the Greens political party to destroy that price on carbon. What we saw then was that, despite that, against the odds, we did legislate for an emissions trading scheme with a fixed price in the initial stage. But those opposite walked away from that. They trashed that, and we saw a doubling of wholesale power prices. Then we saw an EIS, an emissions intensity scheme, which they walked away from. Then there was the clean energy target. We were prepared to talk about that, but they walked away from that. The National Energy Guarantee in its various forms—they walked away that. What we've seen from this ATM government over here, the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government, is: insert some policy, but nothing coming out. Nothing constructive comes out at all, and it is Australians who are paying the price through higher prices.


If you are going to get that certainty, you have to know what you stand for and you have to be prepared to take people with you. You have to be able to work collaboratively. For the former Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, who's now in New York, even obscurity is better than trying to work with this mob opposite. And, if you know Malcolm Turnbull, that's really saying something. But for this minister to be given responsibility for this portfolio shows just how bereft those opposite are. We on this side of the House know that the future is renewables. We on this side of the House know that by driving down emissions you drive down prices. Supply and demand—when you increase the amount of supply in the energy sector through growth of renewables, you drive down prices. Those opposite talk about business. The fact is business wants certainty; business wants what those opposite have refused to give them. (Time expired)

Mr BROAD
 (Mallee—Assistant Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister) (15:39):  I come here for the betterment of Australia. We have a standard of living that is the envy of the world. Our life expectancy is high. Our safety, our security and our prosperity are the results of the endeavours of Australians. We have an abundance of natural resources—our sunshine, our gas, our coal, our uranium, our soils and our water. Water, which the member for Grayndler was talking about, is pumped by electricity to produce product. That product is cooled by electricity and that produce is then marketed. Our cities and offices are powered by electricity. The people who work in those offices catch trams or trains when heading home after work. Those trams and trains are powered by electricity. Those people go home to their houses which are cooled or heated by electricity.


You may ask, 'What is the threat? I can say it with one word: Labor—a party made up of nice personalities with no management ability at all. You may ask, 'What is the threat?' I say it again: it is Labor, who are so concerned about losing their seats to the eroding ideology of the Greens that they no longer care about the pensioners who are unable to turn their power on and keep themselves warm. You may ask again, 'What is the threat?' It is Labor with a 50 per cent renewable energy target that makes us feel so warm and fuzzy but sends us broke.


You may ask what our aim is. Our aim is to get power prices down. The coalition is the party for lower power prices. You may ask what our aim is. It is a new coal-fired power station. Australia exports coal and iron ore—little black rocks and little red rocks; those two things that are driving our domestic product—and yet we're so scared to want to build a coal-fired power station in Australia. It's good enough to export, but we should be game to export. You may ask what our aim is. It is to refurbish coal-fired power stations so that they're cleaner and more responsive and they can interact with renewables. You may ask again what our aim is. It is solar power generation—fields of sun-catching panels like you can see in the Mallee. You may ask again what our aim is. It is new gas-fired power stations. This government introduced the Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism, which has started to bring gas prices down and has not stifled investment in gas exploration.


You may again ask what our aim is. It is new pumped hydro. Snowy Hydro, started by Prime Minister Ben Chifley when the Labor Party used to stand for something, is going to be completed and commissioned by Prime Minister Morrison in the next term and the term after that.

  We will show you that we will win government again and again. You may ask what our plan is. It is stability—so the lights stay on and your business can expand. You may ask again what our plan is. It is certainty—so the lights stay on and your son, daughter and grandchild can have a job. I say to the grandparents of Australia: if you want your child to have a job, you need to be voting for the coalition so they can have a job.


You may ask again what our plan is. It is prosperity. Our wages, by world standards, are historically high, but our power prices have also been historically low. It is because of this that we've been competitive. The member for Grayndler may not know, but the biggest export out of the Port of Melbourne has been dehydrated milk. You didn't know that, did you? The reason that the milk industry has been able to expand is that we've been able to ultraheat treat it or dehydrate it and make it competitive. But, if you trust Labor, power prices will go up. If power prices are up and we have high wages, we will no longer be competitive and our capacity to gave pay rises to our sons, daughters and grandchildren will be greatly diminished.


I come here for the betterment of Australia, and I say to Australians that there is really only one side of this chamber that you can trust—and it is the coalition government. The coalition government will bring down power prices. The coalition government will not get caught up in some ideology to keep the Greens happy, to stop the erosion. The coalition government will bring power prices down. That is what we are taking to the people of Australia at the next election—and that is why we will still be here on this side of the chamber after the next election.

Mr CONROY
 (Shortland) (15:44):  What an embarrassing performance by the member for Mallee. I congratulate him on his promotion, but, let's just pause for a second—this is a debate about climate change and energy policy and the second speaker for the government is on the record as saying, 'I'm a self-described sceptic of policy response to climate change.' A sceptic of policy responses to climate change and he questions the science regarding the impact of humans. So the second speaker for the government on a debate about energy and climate change questions the science, doesn't think we can do anything on policy and has just called for, in his speech, the construction of a new coal-fired power station. This is the quality of debate from those in government. What a disgrace. Well, I can tell him, 'If you want to build a new coal-fired power station, that is a recipe for higher pollution and higher power prices.' It's a recipe for both. This is the state of the debate from the government.


And we only had to see the minister's contribution. The member for Dickson's numbers man—a man who couldn't even count to 43 in the party room—is now in charge of getting power prices down. God help us all. If you can't count to 43, how can you get power prices down? I say you can't. This is the shame of this debate. Because the government has had five energy policies in two years. In fact, they've had four in the months of August and September. They've had four in a month and a half. What a disgrace. But at least the new minister is clear. He has completely surrendered on emissions policy. The tragedy of this is that it means not only higher pollution but higher power prices.


What is going on now is, if you don't invest in renewable energy and if you don't attempt to provide any certainty to the market, you see higher power prices. Don't just ask for my opinion. Don't just take it from me. The Australian Energy Market Commission said:


The result of this uncertainty has been delays in investment and consequent increased electricity prices …


Or the Australian Energy Council who said:


A lack of robust or bipartisan energy policy means there is a lack of investment confidence, which means there is more risk to be managed, and this in turn leads to higher prices …


So we've got the government's own regulator and the peak body for all the power companies in the country—not just renewables—saying their actions, their decision, to surrender any attempt to provide certainty on energy policy means higher power prices.


The market has responded most emphatically. In the last month and a half, wholesale electricity spot prices in Victoria have risen by 81 per cent. Let me repeat that: in the last six weeks, since this government has changed its policy four times, spot prices have risen by 81 per cent. That is flowing through to retail power prices very shortly, because spot prices lead to higher power prices for consumers. So we're already seeing the impact of this uncertainty. It's there, plain to see, if you read the government's own modelling. The government's own modelling says that, if you don't go through with the NEG, if you have no policy, you will see a $300 increase in power prices. That is what is going on right now. That is what the now Prime Minister said as Treasurer only four or five weeks ago.


What we have now is a government riven by divisions. We have a government that has an energy minister who is a climate change sceptic, who hates renewable energy and who doesn't want to provide certainty to the industry, and we have a second speaker who denies the science of climate change. It's no wonder they've given up. The great tragedy of this is it's not them who suffer or pay the price; it's the households in this country. Every single household in this country will pay higher power prices and will face higher emissions because this government has given up. They've given up because they are so hopelessly divided. History will condemn them—the Australian population, right now, is condemning them as a government that has given up governing and is just interested in fighting themselves.

Mr ALEXANDER
 (Bennelong) (15:49):  I thank those opposite for bringing forward this debate. In this technology fuelled world, access to cheap and reliable electricity is one of the fundamental needs of our homes. Power prices are a key part of the cost of living and greatly affect my constituents and local businesses. We know that power prices have risen 56 per cent over the past 10 years. We understand Australian families are struggling with the cost of living, and rising power prices are impacting on their household budgets. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy and are amongst the biggest employers in Bennelong. They're also struggling with rising power prices, and every cent that small businesses puts into their energy bills is one they can't put into employing a new person, lifting wages or taking advantage of new opportunities. That is why this government is absolutely committed to reducing power prices while keeping on the lights. We cannot afford to be distracted from our goal of lowering power prices for Australian households and small businesses, and we will not be.


The electricity sector has lost the trust of our community. It desperately needs to re-establish its credibility, and the coalition government will keep it to this task and ensure that the interests of customers come first. We're taking practical action to lower power prices. We're stopping the price gouging by energy companies, providing customers with a price safety net, backing investment in reliable generation, and encouraging more competition in the market. We have turned the corner on power prices, with reductions announced in Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia from 1 July 2018.


We have some achievements in this sector that are making a real difference to homes in my electorate. We have secured more gas for Australians and gas prices are down by up to 50 per cent. We're introducing the Australian Domestic Gas Security Mechanism, securing an agreement with LNG exporters to offer gas to the domestic market and committing $90 million in the 2017-18 budget to expand gas supply and increase competition in the market. Let us not forget that 18 months ago gas prices were close to $20 per gigajoule. They now sit at between $8 and $11 per gigajoule. This is real progress. We've done this by engagement with the sector and, frankly, by standing up to the big energy companies. The coalition government is not afraid to use a big stick on the big energy companies to stop the big rip-offs. Through this, we are getting customers a better deal. Following meetings with the government, retailers have simplified their offerings and written to around 1.6 million households to tell them better deals are available. We've set up a website which helps people compare offers. Over one million people have been online to check this out and get a better deal. We are changing the rules to get retailers to lift their game, including banning dodgy discounting practices; getting retailers to notify customers about price rises more quickly, so customers can shop around; and speeding up metering installations. We've reined in the power of the networks, because past overinvestment in networks is the biggest contributor to increases in electricity prices over the past 10 years. What does this mean? It means prices will come down.


As I said, we have already seen prices come down in Queensland, South Australia and New South Wales on 1 July. We are taking practical action to lower power prices: stopping the price gouging by energy companies, providing customers with a price safety net, backing investment in reliable generation, and encouraging more competition in the market. We have turned the corner on power prices. This will put more money in the pockets of families and small businesses in Bennelong, while the lights remain on.

"Keay, Justine, MP",ALP,2018-09-11,"



Ms KEAY
 (Braddon) (15:54):  I want to quickly reflect on a comment the member for Grayndler made in his contribution: with those opposite, it seems like a lot of energy and ideas go into their policy formation, but nothing comes out. It seems like those opposite are suffering from policy constipation. I think they need to do something about it, because the state of Tasmania will suffer. I take the incompetence of the government sitting opposite very, very personally, because they are putting at risk billions of investment dollars into Tasmania and hundreds if not thousands of jobs.


The NEG is dead and, under this government, Tasmania's Battery of the Nation is dead. The Tasmanian state Liberal government and Tasmania's federal Liberal senators' support for Tasmanians, their jobs and the investment potential in future renewable energy projects is dead. We have a state energy minister and a Liberal Premier who have failed to advocate for Tasmanians. They have failed to make a case for a national energy policy which supports Tasmania's place as the renewable energy capital of Australia. They have failed to take their own party to task for allowing the politics of the Liberal Party to ruin this opportunity for our state.


And now, thanks to the Liberals' civil war, we find ourselves with a new energy minister, who has lifted the bar for the most anti-renewable, climate-change denying minister Australia has ever seen. He is the poster boy for the troglodytes and the hard Right ideology of energy policy of those opposite, whose insistence that energy policy should ignore the need to transition to clean energy and that governments have no role in supporting investor certainty throws mud in the face of common sense and basic economics. His ideological opposition to renewable energy is a clear deterrent to anyone wishing to invest in future Tasmanian energy projects, a deterrent to the more than $2 billion planned investment into renewable energy projects on the north-west coast of my electorate alone. These renewable energy projects would create hundreds of jobs and put downward pressures on power prices for Tasmanian businesses and household consumers.


What happens when a weak Prime Minister surrenders to their backbenchers' anti-renewable, climate-change denying ideology? I'm just asking for half-a-million Tasmanian friends. The simple fact is the anti-renewable climate-dismissing Liberal government are incapable of delivering lower power prices or lowering pollution, because they are opposed to the renewable investment that will deliver both. Make no mistake: Australians will now pay even more on their power bills because of this reckless Liberal Party and their chaotic policy and chaotic internal division.


Now they admit that, by dumping this policy, families will pay more for power—at least $300 more. Shame! So, when Australian people open their power bills and see they're continuing to skyrocket, they'll know exactly who to blame: a weak Prime Minister who leads a divided and illegitimate government. Labor was willing to work with the former Prime Minister on the National Energy Guarantee but, without even talking to Labor, the Liberals decided to abandoned the policy they recently said was essential to solving the energy crisis. And now the government has nothing: no policy, no ideas, no leadership and no hope.


Labor announced that the north-west of Tasmania, which is in my electorate, will be Labor's first identified renewable energy zone, a zone that will attract investment to drive Labor's commitment to ensure 50 per cent of electricity from across the country is sourced from renewables by 2030. Labor has a plan to help households and businesses get a better deal on their power prices. Labor have a plan to transition Australia's energy system with our 50 per cent renewable energy target by 2030. At its core, it will drive investment in renewable energy, create almost 30,000 new renewable energy jobs, put downward pressure on power prices and deliver real action to tackle climate change.


Earlier today I had the privilege of speaking to young Indigenous people from across the country. I asked them what the most pressing issue is for them—these are 16- and 17-year-old Australians; the next voters coming through in our democracy—and their No. 1 issue is climate change. Clearly, those opposite will not listen.


The average small business customer under Labor will save up to $1,500 per year. But, most importantly, all consumers will benefit from increased transparency, simpler bills and downward pressure on prices. The choice is clear: Labor is for renewables and lower prices; the Liberals are for more chaos and higher prices.

"Flint, Nicolle, MP",LP,2018-09-11,"




Ms FLINT
 (Boothby) (15:59):  I am always really surprised when the member for Port Adelaide wants to talk about power prices and reliability. It was the member for Port Adelaide and his South Australian Labor mates, the failed Weatherill Labor government, who delivered to my home state of South Australia, my constituents and my community, the highest power prices in the world.


What other world firsts did the member for Port Adelaide, the member for Wakefield and their SA Labor mates deliver for the people of South Australia? An unprecedented statewide blackout. It was one of the scariest experiences of my life, as I think it was for many South Australians, and it was a miracle that nobody died. We had sole policemen and policewomen standing in the middle of intersections in peak-hour traffic, in really terrible weather, trying to get people home safely. We had a number of families who lost embryos, that were waiting for IVF transfer, because of this blackout. People's lives were terribly affected by this. How did the member for Port Adelaide describe this unprecedented statewide blackout? As 'a hiccup'. It wasn't a hiccup for the people I have just mentioned, it wasn't a hiccup for my community and it wasn't a hiccup for the state of South Australia. It was a devastating incident.


I thought that today, finally, the lights might have gone on for and within the Labor Party about the importance of power prices and reliability for the Australian people and for each and every one of my voters and constituents in the electorate of Boothby. Securing affordable and reliable power for my community and, indeed, for all Australians is what I am fighting for in this place and what the Morrison government will deliver. As we know, and as I've outlined already, the only governments who have failed the Australian people, and the people of South Australia in particular, on affordability and reliability of power are Labor governments. This is a fact.


As I said in parliament, just after the unprecedented blackout in late 2016:


I am appalled that my home state no longer has secure, reliable and affordable power. We have suffered an internationally unprecedented blackout and we are now facing, nationally, unprecedented high power prices. South Australian residents and businesses can no longer rely on a secure, affordable electricity supply. Families cannot afford to pay their skyrocketing power prices; pensioners and the elderly cannot afford heating or cooling; businesses must now lurch from contract to contract, pushing up the already climbing cost of living. This is the sad reality of energy security in South Australia, and my residents in Boothby and across the state are dealing with this reality every single day.


Things will get worse if a federal Labor government is ever elected, and I will be working so hard to make sure that that is not the case.


We know that the member for Port Adelaide is keen to introduce a 50 per cent renewable energy target. What would that do to reliability and affordability? I believe those opposite also want to see a 45 per cent emissions target. Again, what would that do to reliability and affordability for each and every hardworking Australian out there? Power prices will skyrocket even higher than they did last time under a federal Labor government, and reliability can only decrease further.


This government, led by the Prime Minister, is absolutely committed to reducing power prices while keeping the lights on. We're taking practical action to lower power prices by stopping the price gouging by energy companies, by providing customers with a price safety net and by backing investment in reliable generation and encouraging more competition in the market. We have put pressure on retailers to simplify their offerings, which has resulted in more than 1.6 million households knowing that better deals are available to them. We're banning dodgy discounting practices, getting retailers to notify of price rises more quickly and speeding up meter installations to give back power to customers. These are hardworking Australians—mums and dads, retirees, hardworking small businesses—that this will benefit. My focus is on energy affordability and reliability for each and every person living in my electorate. That is what I will continue to fight for. (Time expired)

"Stanley, Anne, MP",ALP,2018-09-11,"



Ms STANLEY
 (Werriwa) (16:04):  Last year the House environment and energy committee published a report titled Powering our future: inquiry into modernising Australia's electricity grid. As a member of that committee, I read and heard the many submissions it received. In both public and private hearings the message was loud and clear: a well-functioning energy grid needs policy certainty. In visits to the US, to Germany and here in Australia, the message was always the same: a stable energy grid must be underpinned by stable energy policy. Policy certainty addresses both pricing and supply. Policy certainty allows genuine long-term investment in power generation and provision. Certainty also provides a stimulus for supply through new investment in plant and for innovation through funding, research and development.


Last year the committee heard evidence that the inability of the government to provide certainty has placed the equivalent of $50-a-tonne carbon price on electricity generation. Both industry and experts agree. In today's Financial Review the Clean Energy Council Chief Executive, Kane Thornton, said, 'Abandoning any attempt at long-term energy policy leaves the energy market in a state of further chaos.' Innes Willox from the Australian Industry Group said, 'If we want to bring down prices, we're going to have to sharply reduce policy uncertainty.' There's not enough time in this debate to go through the rest of the experts but there are so many more.


At every step of the way, Labor have been willing to work with the government for a genuine solution to the energy crisis. That's because, along with industry and experts, we recognise certainty. Policy certainty is the key to driving down costs for households and businesses and to mitigating the effects of climate change. During the decade of alphabet-soup energy uncertainty from the EIS to the CET and now the NEG, Labor have been willing to work with the coalition. We were willing to negotiate on the EIS, the Emissions Intensity Scheme, but it was vetoed by the member for Warringah. We were willing to work on the Clean Energy Target but, again, the member for Warringah vetoed it. We were willing to work on the NEG, the National Energy Guarantee, but, once again, instead of a policy certainty, the government surrendered to the member for Warringah and his band of antirenewable climate sceptics.


Some optimists might have hoped that the change in Prime Minister and change in energy minister would see a way forward. Unfortunately, it seems to be bad news for those optimists. Before becoming Prime Minister, the member for Cook brought a lump of coal into this House as a joke. What about the new Minister for Energy? Let's take a select quote from the new energy minister. On climate change science, in a speech to the parliament four years ago, he said:


The new climate religion, recruiting disciples every day, has little basis on fact and everything to do with blind faith.


What is very clear is that, from this quote and from five years of policy chaos, the Liberals are incapable of solving the energy crisis. The only solution, the only way forward, is to change the government. That's because Labor has the real policies, real solutions and real outcomes for all Australians A Shorten Labor government will help households and businesses get a better deal on power prices. We will overhaul the electricity offers available to consumers and scrap outdated deals so Australians pay less for power. We will force energy retailers to introduce simple, honest and transparent pricing so consumers find the best deal. And we will work with the states to implement recommendations from the ACCC's retail electricity price inquiry.


Labor is still committed to 50 per cent renewables by 2030. What would this mean for consumers? Labor's plan would mean households could save up to $165 a year on their energy bill, and average small businesses could save up to $1,500 a year on theirs. Put simply: under Labor, consumers and businesses will get a fair go. They will benefit from increased transparency, simpler bills and downward pressure on prices.


Political commentators in this country like to speak of energy policy as being a political football. Well, I was a rugby league referee for many years and I have never adjudicated a game like this. One team's members are constantly squabbling amongst themselves in the sheds, keep changing captains and are being coached by the likes of 2GB and Sky News. There is only one team on the field, one team listening to the people, and that's the Labor Party on this side of the House.

"Evans, Trevor, MP",LP,2018-09-11,"



Mr EVANS
 (Brisbane) (16:09):  There's a good reason why the majority of Australians say that they trust the coalition more than Labor when it comes to keeping energy prices lower; it comes down to the lived experience. Australians have been through this before. When Labor's in government, energy prices tend to skyrocket, in part because Labor does so many deals with the Greens, pursuing ideology ahead of substance and fact. But it is also significantly down to Labor's sheer mismanagement in office, because you can't get around Labor's incompetence when it comes to running anything more complicated than a closed shop. Whether it's energy or other schemes like pink batts or school halls—you name it—their incompetence is at least consistent across Labor's people, both federal and state, as I will come to in a moment.


The substance of this MPI can be dismissed, as silly as it is, in a single sentence: our electricity prices just came down in Queensland, in New South Wales and in South Australia. It was a matter of weeks ago, around 1 July. It was on the front page of The Courier Mail—those opposite may have missed it and it was in press releases and letters sent to customers from energy retailers like AGL and Origin. It was in the annual pricing determination of the Queensland Competition Authority, where I used to work as an economist in the energy sector. That organisation sets a benchmark price. Everyone can check it out. Go to their website, qca.org.au, and there's a button right there on the front that says 'Regulated electricity prices 2018–19'. If you click on that, the first sentence says:


Electricity prices for most regional customers will fall in 2018–19. The typical customer on the main residential tariff (tariff 11) will see a decrease of 1.3%, and the typical customer on the main small business tariff (tariff 20) will see a decrease of 3.4%.


That reduction, worth about $140, on average, to the typical family, has been a direct result of the number of actions this government has taken over the past year or so to put downward pressure on energy prices, including, most notably, the government's big wins around securing domestic gas supply.


Of course we do need to see further and much larger decreases. There's not one step but many steps that need to be taken to bring energy prices down even lower. It's not enough to simply note that the coalition government has managed to decrease prices in two out of the five past years, whereas they always went up every year under Labor. The minister earlier talked about some of the government's plans, including bringing in a new default price for vulnerable customers, a safety net. The member for Boothby listed a few others. From generation to distribution and retail, this government is taking action on all of those fronts and more.


There's another significant pressure on electricity prices which people really should know more about, especially those of us from Queensland. The Queensland government itself has been caught out gouging profits out of people's energy bills. The ACCC chair, Rod Sims, has pointed this out. The two big generators in Queensland have a significant market share between them, and they're both fully owned by the Queensland Labor government. The ACCC has accused them of using their market power, essentially holding back their supply while waiting for the price in the market to rise as a consequence of that artificial shortage they create and then swooping in to take advantage of the higher prices. Those higher prices meant that the Queensland government got higher dividends through the energy companies they own. Those windfall profits by the Queensland Labor government came at a cost. It came at the cost of families, small businesses and everyone else as they paid their energy bills, which were higher than they otherwise would have been. That's not just the energy bills of those of us in Queensland but the energy bills of everyone throughout the National Electricity Market.


This government called out that Labor government and, as soon as we did, the Queensland government—I presume, through sheer embarrassment at being caught out—instructed one of their two generators to cease the disgraceful conduct. What did we see? Prices immediately came down. It was basically as clear an admission as you will ever get of having market power and abusing it. More Queenslanders should know about that history. Of course Queenslanders can form their own views as to whether the Queensland Labor government wisely spent their gouged profits. But one thing is very clear: this is one more clear demonstration of the approach that Labor always takes when it comes to issues like energy at a federal and state level. It's about ideology over facts, spending over thrift and incompetent management. You will always have higher energy bills under Labor.

Mr GOODENOUGH
 (Moore) (16:35):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, I present the committee's report entitled Human rights scrutiny report: report 9 of 2018.


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Mr GOODENOUGH:
  by leave—Of the new bills examined in this report, 13 have been assessed as not raising human rights concerns as they promote, permissibly limit or do not engage human rights. To complete its technical assessment of compatibility with Australia's international human rights law obligations, the committee has requested further information in relation to two instruments.


Chapter 2 of the report contains the committee's concluded examination of two bills and a number of legislative instruments. Of these, I would like to highlight three instruments made under the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013. As set out in the report, the instruments prescribe the requirements for NDIS providers to implement and maintain incident management systems, set out the rules governing the resolution of complaints about NDIS providers, and provide for the disclosure of information by the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commissioner. Broadly speaking, the measures seek to protect the rights of people with disabilities by providing for the timely and appropriate resolution of complaints about service providers, and enhancing system-level oversight of serious incidents involving the abuse, neglect or exploitation of people with disabilities.


In Report 7 of 2018, the committee sought further information from the minister as to whether the measures engage and permissibly limit the rights to a fair hearing and privacy. Regarding the right to a fair hearing, the minister's response contained additional information which enabled the committee to conclude that, to the extent to which the provisions involve the determination of rights and obligations, the measures are likely to be compatible with fair hearing rights. In relation to the right to privacy, the minister's response provided further information about the sufficiency of the safeguards in place to protect personal information. This information enabled the committee to conclude that the measures in all three instruments are likely to be compatible with the right to privacy.


I encourage my fellow members and others to examine the committee's latest scrutiny report to better inform their consideration of proposed legislation. With these comments, I commend the committee's Report 9 of 2018 to the chamber.

Mr Irons interjecting—




Mr PERRETT:
  Thank you, minister. I'm pleased to speak on the tabling of Report 9 of 2018 of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights. I thank the member for Moore for his chairing of that committee. I am the deputy chair, and we work well together. I particularly wanted to speak on this report as it contains the committee's deliberations and recommendations regarding the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018.


The work of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse has been extraordinary. I particularly wish to acknowledge the wonderful and tireless work of the member for Jagajaga and her commitment over many, many years to addressing the hidden horrors of institutional child sexual abuse. I wish her well in her future endeavours beyond this parliament. I also want to mention former Prime Minister Julia Gillard. Her strength and tenacity made the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse a reality.


The royal commission received 42,041 calls. It received 25,964 letters and emails. It held 8,013 private sessions and made 2,575 referrals to authorities, including the police. The evidence the commission received was beyond shocking—it would make a stone weep at the big, horrific 'Why?'—so I also acknowledge the work of the commissioners and their staff for the tremendous but harrowing work they undertook, particularly in those 8,013 private sessions. May their dreams be filled with sunshine and light after listening to much of that horror. I also thank the many professionals, including my wife, Lea, who continue to work with the survivors of childhood sexual abuse. We now know that many of those victims never got to tell their stories to the royal commission. They had been living their lives with the horror of their childhood experiences hovering over their every move.


The impact of child sexual abuse on victims can be devastating. It is life-changing and life-limiting and, sadly, too often it can be life-ending. Their experiences often limited their educational attainment, often limited their employment opportunities and sometimes led them into criminal activity. That was one particular aspect of the bill that the human rights committee considered through a human rights prism. The redress scheme limits redress being claimed by victims with serious criminal convictions. The committee had some concerns that this was incompatible with the right to equality and nondiscrimination. It is important that victims who have been drawn into criminal activity because of the horrors they have endured and who have been lawfully punished are not being punished a second time by being denied redress for the crimes perpetrated against them. Victims who have serious criminal convictions can still be considered for redress by the scheme operator, who will make a determination. The human rights committee carefully considered the issue. The committee recommended that the special assessment process for persons with serious criminal convictions be monitored by government to ensure it operates in a manner compatible with the right to equality and nondiscrimination.


The human rights committee also considered the provisions relating to determining whether disclosure is necessarily in the public interest. The committee recommended that the scheme's operators' disclosure powers be monitored by government to ensure that any limitation on the right to privacy is no more extensive than what is strictly necessary.


I'm proud to be speaking as the deputy chair of the human rights committee today. It is when this committee considers bills such as this, bills that will have a life-changing effect on the most vulnerable members of our community, that we are reminded why this human rights committee was formed in the first place. It was another former Labor Prime Minister, Kevin Rudd, who introduced legislation to form the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights in 2008. It was in response to the Brennan consultation committee, chaired by Father Frank Brennan. The committee was formed to scrutinise new legislation introduced into the parliament for its compatibility with the human rights treaties that we are a signatory to. When parliament brings in new legislation that can have an enormous impact on the lives of victims of child sexual abuse, people who have already suffered more than any of us, I am comforted that this committee will be carefully looking at the impact through the prism of human rights. The last thing any of us would want is to cause more harm to victims.


Lastly, I would also like to mention the secretariat of the human rights committee and to thank them for the wonderful work that they do. They should be particularly proud that the Australasian Legal Information Institute, known as AustLII to most law students, have recently included reports from the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights in their database, so now people from all over the world will be researching reports tabled by this parliament's human rights committee.


On a final note, I thank Prime Minister Morrison for agreeing to deliver a national apology to victims and survivors of institutional child sexual abuse on Monday, 22 October. May it grant peace to the troubled and help heal wounds whilst forever damning those perpetrators.

Mr GOODENOUGH
 (Moore) (16:35):  On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, I present the committee's report entitled Human rights scrutiny report: report 9 of 2018.


Report made a parliamentary paper in accordance with standing order 39(e).




Mr GOODENOUGH:
  by leave—Of the new bills examined in this report, 13 have been assessed as not raising human rights concerns as they promote, permissibly limit or do not engage human rights. To complete its technical assessment of compatibility with Australia's international human rights law obligations, the committee has requested further information in relation to two instruments.


Chapter 2 of the report contains the committee's concluded examination of two bills and a number of legislative instruments. Of these, I would like to highlight three instruments made under the National Disability Insurance Scheme Act 2013. As set out in the report, the instruments prescribe the requirements for NDIS providers to implement and maintain incident management systems, set out the rules governing the resolution of complaints about NDIS providers, and provide for the disclosure of information by the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commissioner. Broadly speaking, the measures seek to protect the rights of people with disabilities by providing for the timely and appropriate resolution of complaints about service providers, and enhancing system-level oversight of serious incidents involving the abuse, neglect or exploitation of people with disabilities.


In Report 7 of 2018, the committee sought further information from the minister as to whether the measures engage and permissibly limit the rights to a fair hearing and privacy. Regarding the right to a fair hearing, the minister's response contained additional information which enabled the committee to conclude that, to the extent to which the provisions involve the determination of rights and obligations, the measures are likely to be compatible with fair hearing rights. In relation to the right to privacy, the minister's response provided further information about the sufficiency of the safeguards in place to protect personal information. This information enabled the committee to conclude that the measures in all three instruments are likely to be compatible with the right to privacy.


I encourage my fellow members and others to examine the committee's latest scrutiny report to better inform their consideration of proposed legislation. With these comments, I commend the committee's Report 9 of 2018 to the chamber.

Mr PERRETT
 (Moreton—Opposition Whip) (16:38):  by leave—I just want to commend the minister at the table, the member for Swan, on his elevation and to say on the record that he's a great bloke.



Mr Irons interjecting—




Mr PERRETT:
  Thank you, minister. I'm pleased to speak on the tabling of Report 9 of 2018 of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights. I thank the member for Moore for his chairing of that committee. I am the deputy chair, and we work well together. I particularly wanted to speak on this report as it contains the committee's deliberations and recommendations regarding the National Redress Scheme for Institutional Child Sexual Abuse Bill 2018.


The work of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse has been extraordinary. I particularly wish to acknowledge the wonderful and tireless work of the member for Jagajaga and her commitment over many, many years to addressing the hidden horrors of institutional child sexual abuse. I wish her well in her future endeavours beyond this parliament. I also want to mention former Prime Minister Julia Gillard. Her strength and tenacity made the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse a reality.


The royal commission received 42,041 calls. It received 25,964 letters and emails. It held 8,013 private sessions and made 2,575 referrals to authorities, including the police. The evidence the commission received was beyond shocking—it would make a stone weep at the big, horrific 'Why?'—so I also acknowledge the work of the commissioners and their staff for the tremendous but harrowing work they undertook, particularly in those 8,013 private sessions. May their dreams be filled with sunshine and light after listening to much of that horror. I also thank the many professionals, including my wife, Lea, who continue to work with the survivors of childhood sexual abuse. We now know that many of those victims never got to tell their stories to the royal commission. They had been living their lives with the horror of their childhood experiences hovering over their every move.


The impact of child sexual abuse on victims can be devastating. It is life-changing and life-limiting and, sadly, too often it can be life-ending. Their experiences often limited their educational attainment, often limited their employment opportunities and sometimes led them into criminal activity. That was one particular aspect of the bill that the human rights committee considered through a human rights prism. The redress scheme limits redress being claimed by victims with serious criminal convictions.

"Drum, Damian, MP",Nats,2018-09-11,"



Mr DRUM
 (Murray) (16:45):  It's a great opportunity to be able to rise and talk to the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2018. It's very positive that in the House this afternoon the Labor Party has chosen to support this bill and support the continued assistance that we are giving to veterans. This bill is largely an accounting mechanism to enable the Department of Veterans' Affairs to best look after families where, for one reason or another, there has been an overpayment. This generally happens around the time of a death of a veteran who had been receiving a pension and the pension continues to flow for a few weeks after that death. Reconciliation needs to take place. These reconciliations have been going on for as long as military pensions have been paid out. A little reconciliation needs to take place, with a slight overpayment being fixed up by the fact that there is always a bereavement payment. 


We've identified the fact that some administrative changes made in 1995 have effectively meant that this ongoing work, this practice that we see happening each and every day, may not be quite kosher. This piece of legislation addresses that so the common practice can continue in a way that is going to be least intrusive to families when they are going through a period of grief.


So, as I said earlier, we believe that this is not going to alter the current practice. It's going to enable the current practice to take place in a manner that is fully agreeable to all those involved. This practice also happens in relation to Centrelink pensioner payments. The main reason we are bringing this bill forward is to give transparency to the ex-service organisations, who also need to know exactly what this bill is going to bring about—to maintain the status quo, to ensure that these adjustments are made in that one single administrative process. That's hopefully going to be a good outcome for people that are in this position. As I said, this inadvertent issue relates to a provision that was removed way back in 1995, and whilst the practice has continued since that time, we have to acknowledge that we have to clean this up. That's why we are doing this. 


I think it also gives us an opportunity to touch on the lot of our veterans. Everybody in the House makes sure every time they get the opportunity to say how proud we are of our veterans, and I want to add my voice to that growing number of parliamentarians. We don't understand—I'm sure we think we do, but we don't understand—exactly the sacrifice and the service that many of our military servicemen afford this country. We also need to acknowledge how tough it must be for these servicemen and women when they try and assimilate back into civilian life. Having spent a large portion of their time away from their families, moving back into the family on a full-time basis might not necessarily be as easy as everybody thinks it will be. They may be moving into civilian employment, where maybe respect for each other isn't what they've expected over the previous period of time in the armed services, in the military. Their ability needs to be given a fair amount of empathy because the work that has to take place on behalf of these servicemen and women is incredibly difficult.


I might add that these are the people who have come back in 100 per cent good shape—in fantastic shape physically and in 100 per cent shape mentally. It is still an incredibly difficult task for them to assimilate back into civilian life without the feeling that it is incredibly difficult. Sometimes we need to acknowledge that. Then, of course, there needs to be additional support given to those men and women who may be, in one way or another, seriously affected by the service that they've given in the military.


It's really a worthwhile point for us all to ponder: what more we can do. In fact, we have far too many suicides by the people who have returned from combat in our recent skirmishes, in our recent combats. For our veterans to be obviously affected by post-traumatic stress and then to struggle to find the support that they need is something that we need to give continued and growing support towards as best we possibly can. 


I'm very proud of the work that we are doing as a government to try and assist the veterans with the counselling that they need and the counselling that their families may need. When I was the veterans' affairs minister in Victoria, we were able to build accommodation facilities in the city to provide medium- to long-term accommodation and support services in a whole range of health areas. We were able to do that in conjunction with the RSL of Victoria. We were the main funders, but the RSL are still are the operators of that facility. It's located in Richmond, close to public transport and close to a lot of amenities. It's located in an area that can offer single accommodation, husband-and-wife accommodation and also accommodation for a full family. As I say, it was the RSL going back to the government and saying, 'This is the area that we think is currently being missed. It might take somebody approximately six weeks to three months to sort out the mess that they are in. They highlighted that they needed that type of support to be added to the myriad supports that are available for our veterans.


As has been spoken about this afternoon, we've got support for our Veterans' Children Education Scheme and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act Education and Training Scheme to try to assist the children of our veterans with their education and the supports that they need as well. The supports that they need are extremely many and varied. I want to congratulate the minister for bringing this legislation forward. Hopefully, we can sort this issue out. Hopefully, we can make sure that we continue the practice of having minimal impact on these families as they go through their time of loss and grief, we can make the accounting procedures as simple as possible and we can continue to raise the need for government to be in lock-step with our veterans when they return—for all those who are in good health, all those who are struggling at various stages, all those who are struggling every day, and all those somewhere in between, because the lot of our veterans is a mixed and varied lot and they have varying degrees of capacity to live a full and wholesome life. What has to be acknowledged is the respect that the community of Australia has towards our veterans. We need to make sure that they know that they have that respect from each and every one of us.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2018-09-11,"



Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari) (16:54):  I'm pleased to be able to make a contribution to this debate on the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2018 and I want to applaud the government for the passage of this legislation. Clearly, we support the proposals within it. When veterans pass away, it is vital for surviving partners to be assisted and treated with compassion and sympathy. The bereavement payment, which is made up of 14 weeks of the partner's income support payment, is to assist the surviving partner with costs following that death.


As we know, all families need a period of time to adjust their finances in such circumstances. However, surviving partners who have access often receive an overpayment of the veteran's income payments that continue after the passing. Sadly, it is a flaw in the system. This can lead to a debt being raised and add to the grieving and anxiety of the surviving partner and their family. As a result of this legislation, when this happens, DVA will now reduce the bereavement payment by the amount the veteran's partner has received since they passed away. The intention of recouping the cost in this fashion is to minimise unnecessary interactions with DVA during such a difficult time. The amendment will streamline the administrative processes. It's a straightforward amendment with no additional cost, and we're very pleased to be able to support it, and I commend the minister, the member for Gippsland, for bringing this piece of legislation forward.


Like me, I think that the member for Gippsland would support the amendment being proposed by the shadow minister, which reads:


That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:


""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes with concern that the Government has undermined veterans' access to health services"".


I know in his heart of hearts that the member for Gippsland would support this amendment but simply won't, clearly, because it would undermine the policies which were introduced in 2014 by his government to freeze indexation on Medicare payments. The impact of that Medicare freeze has a direct correlation to veterans' access to services.


Currently—as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I'm sure the minister knows—all veterans have been granted access to allied and mental health services for mental health conditions, cancer and pulmonary tuberculosis through the nonliability healthcare policy. Some veterans have additional access through white cards and gold cards for their assessed conditions. As part of accessing these services, psychologists and other clinicians are paid by the government through the Department of Veterans' Affairs with a set fee with no gap to be paid by the veteran. This fee, paid by DVA, is tied to the Medicare rebate and indexed in line with the Medicare rebate. However, as there's been no indexation on Medicare rebates since 2014, there have been no corresponding increase in DVA rebates paid to the health professionals assisting our veterans.


We heard evidence of this last week in a defence committee hearing in Adelaide which is looking at the transition of Defence Force personnel to civilian life and talking about people being veterans whilst they're in service and how they're being cared for post-service. This indexation freeze has led to a situation where, as the rebate is no longer covering the cost of medical treatment and because our veterans cannot be charged a gap payment, sadly and ashamedly, some medical and allied health professionals have had no choice but to turn DVA clients away. I heard this from the College of Psychiatrists in evidence to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade in a hearing in Melbourne last week. It was made very clear that there are people being turned away from specialist services because of the fee. These are people who may well require important interventions for mental health issues, and now we've got to the state where medical practitioners and others who are entitled to charge under the Medicare schedule are turning veterans away or putting them at the bottom of their lists. They are not serving veterans.


I wonder if that's been in the front of mind of the Minister for Health or indeed the Prime Minister. After all, the Prime Minister would know about this. I'm sure that, as he churned through the budget papers as Treasurer, he would have seen this particular item and no doubt would have said, 'Well, this is a saving against the budget, against Medicare, something we will support.'


Well, Prime Minister, I would say to you: here's your chance to show your bona fides for the veteran community. Show your bona fides by going back to the cabinet table and talking to your now Treasurer and your health minister and, with the submission coming from the Department of Veterans' Affairs through the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, make a change to this ridiculous rule. Just get over the freeze, basically. Index the Medicare fee schedule as it should be indexed and ensure that veterans who properly need access to services can get access to services whether or not they can afford them. This is an issue which strikes at the very heart of our claimed support for veterans in this place.


A number of submissions to the Productivity Commission's inquiry into compensation and rehabilitation for veterans have seen some people very critical of the impact of what I've just referred to. The Prime Minister's own Prime Ministerial Advisory Council on Veterans' Mental Health said in their submission:


It would appear there is a limited, but perhaps increasing, number of medical specialists turning our veterans away once they become aware they are DVA clients. The Council understands the concern regarding accepting DVA clients stems from the fact that MBS fees have been frozen for many years.


Well, isn't that a shame job? You'd think, would you not, that the government would say: 'Hang on, this is not good. We're happy to wrap ourselves in the flag and stand next to veterans and say how well we support them, but once we flip the page we see that, as a result of the Medicare freeze, now DVA clients are potentially missing out on access to services.' The Veterans and Veterans Families Counselling Service National Advisory Committee said:


The remuneration gap between seeing veterans versus private patients from the general community or Defence members is now so significant that clinical providers are prioritising other clients over DVA referrals. In some cases, providers are refusing to accept clients with DVA white or gold cards because of the poor remuneration offered.


It's a bit hard to understand how they could put that position forward. Unless they're on the bones of their backside—and not too many of these health professionals are, I have to say—you'd think they'd make sure in any event that these people who require access to services would get access to services. But clearly that's not their interest, because they're driven by the fee rather than the service.


These concerns confirm those raised by the Australian Medical Association over 18 months ago, following a survey of their members which found that almost 30 per cent of clinicians are no longer committed to treating veterans and are turning them away and that only 44 per cent of respondents would continue seeing veterans if the freeze were to continue. There are a couple of issues which arise from this, one of which is a standard of care. How can we guarantee that veterans are getting the quality of service they need to address their health needs when they're being forced to go to the lender of last resort, if you like? I think there is a problem here which is being swept under the carpet and ignored.


Whilst those opposite may protest that it's not their fault, it is their fault. They made the budget decision in 2014. Remember who the Prime Minister was then? It was the architect of the shenanigans that went on here a fortnight ago. He's still in this place. Perhaps he could gee-up the Prime Minister now he's been given a job as an envoy, God forbid, and say to the Prime Minister: 'Hang on, it's probably not a good thing to continue with this. Let's address this Medicare freeze issue.' And I would hope—and I'm sure he would—that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs would be attempting to counsel the government about the impact of this freeze on the treatment of our veterans.


It's not appropriate. It's not fair and it's something we shouldn't do. But somehow or another there is a view on that side of the parliament that this is acceptable. Well, I'd like them to justify how acceptable it is and explain to us—to the Australian community, particularly the veteran community—why it is acceptable that 56 per cent of respondents to an AMA survey say they would no longer service veterans because of this Medicare freeze. You don't have to be Einstein to work out the impact of that. We see, day in day out, people coming into this place and saying how we should be committed to our veterans, both serving and non-serving—those who have passed out of uniform and are now clients of DVA. It's not good enough.


I want to say to the government: we would support you to lift this freeze and address the question in a proper manner. But I'll bet that when we come to the vote on this amendment we'll get no support from the government. If those opposite don't give us support for the amendment, it will say to us that they think it's okay that veterans are unable to access services because of cost. A right which veterans have is effectively being taken away from them because of a budget decision by this government. It's tawdry. It's wrong. It shouldn't be, but it is. The government have an opportunity to fix it, but they won't. And the people who will suffer are those veterans who have served this nation proudly in our uniform. We have an obligation to these people and their families; we all admit it here. We say it all the time. But, by maintaining this freeze, those opposite are saying they only accept that obligation as a partial obligation. They don't see it as we on this side of the House see it—as the need to make sure that veterans have access to the health services they properly require at no cost to them.

"Wilson, Tim, MP",LP,2018-09-11,"



Mr TIM WILSON
 (Goldstein) (17:10):  I rise to support the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2018 as part of this parliament's enduring responsibility to honour Australian veterans. I know that that sentiment is shared by, hopefully, everybody in this place as well as in the Senate. Any of us who have not been veterans will never appreciate the sacrifice or the preparedness to sacrifice that so many have been prepared to give to our great nation. I was reminded of this recently when I visited a veteran community in the Goldstein electorate, many of whom have previously been actively involved in the RSL. I visited Vasey RSL Care in Brighton East with Senator Jim Molan—of course a veteran himself. These champions included people like Bob Larkin, Peter Lanigan, Judy Smith, Dennis Pope, Ray Dunstan, Jordie Burgess, Jeff Walters and Roger Hyde. They have helped guide returning servicemen and women with distinction, and they have my gratitude and of course the gratitude of the Goldstein community. We will never forget your preparedness to sacrifice and to continue to honour veterans and their families.


That is, of course, what we seek to do and to enliven as part of this piece of legislation. The government has introduced a host of measures to improve the lives of veterans and their families and support them through difficult periods. This support is included in the 2018-19 budget, which allocates additional funding to dental and allied health services, improving mental health, assisting veterans in finding work and increasing access to Department of Veterans' Affairs services, as well as assisting veterans with the challenges of depression and associated mental health consequences and, tragically, the example of suicide. In 2017 there were 84 veteran suicides. I'm sure everybody here recognises that that number is simply not good enough.


So we have acted. We've delivered an additional $31 million in funding to support veterans' mental health on top of last year's increase of $58.1 million. We've provided an additional $8.3 million for improving employment opportunities for veterans, both in improving community engagement with veterans' employment and assisting veterans adjusting to civilian work. But the value and the contribution of what we are doing will never properly be measured in dollars and cents. It will only ever be fully realised in the lives lived and the circumstances avoided, to make sure that veterans can make a continuing contribution to their country and are able to stand on their own two feet, be fully accepted and embraced within our community and live full lives.


The Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2018 continues these important efforts. We are seeking to ease the bureaucratic burden and administration for bereaved families of veterans by simplifying the way the Department of Veterans' Affairs dispenses final payments. Importantly, this amendment does not change the amount paid to the veteran's family. We respect the importance of the veterans' service pension, income support supplement and social security pension. The bill reduces the administrative processes to alleviate the period of grieving for families of veterans. I would hope that no nobody would want a situation where you have a bereaved family and the biggest hurdle they face after their grief is red tape. After a veteran's passing, the Department of Veterans' Affairs entitles the surviving family to a bereavement payment, and we recognise that this payment plays an important role in supporting a grieving family in their tragedy.


However, when a veteran passes there is often a delay between their date of death and when the Department of Veterans' Affairs is notified. This means the final payment of pension is often higher than what the veteran's surviving partner is entitled to. This occurs because when the payment is issued to veterans while they are still alive, it is assumed they will be eligible for the entire period. Therefore, it is frequently the case that families owe the difference between the value of the veteran's pension that was paid and the value entitled to the veteran after considering their passing.


The current system is inefficient and unnecessarily burdensome on the families of those who have already lost a loved one. It requires they undergo a formal debt recovery method undertaken by the department. This bill seeks to simplify this process by deducting the overpaid value paid to the veteran and surviving partner over the bereavement payment entitled to the families, cutting out the unnecessary debt recovery stage.


There are 215,000 veterans receiving support from the Department of Veterans' Affairs, and our measures aim to improve their lives, every single one of them. They're Aussies, just like us, and they deserve our support. So, with the measures in this bill, particularly in times of tragedy or in times where people are grieving, veterans' families will know that everything that this government can do to minimise their pain and the burden of bureaucracy is being taken off them so they can have their thoughts and prayers where they're properly deserved.

"Gosling, Luke, MP",ALP,2018-09-11,"



Mr GOSLING
 (Solomon) (17:16):  Labor supports the Veterans’ Entitlements Amendment Bill 2018. The government, as we heard from previous speakers, has a duty to support our servicemen and women whilst in uniform and then when they leave the service and, of course, their families. We support any move to make this support more compassionate and reasonable. If there are overpayments of a bereavement payment, the recovery process should be as sympathetic and compassionate as possible and that is the intent of this bill.


I will now speak specifically in support of Labor's amendment to the bill. Our amendment is bringing attention to an area where veterans are not being treated with respect and sympathy or with compassion. What is happening is veterans are losing access to vital health services. The fact is that the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government's continued attacks on Medicare have now started to affect veterans and their families. We understand that this government do not value Medicare as we do. They have a track record of seeking to undermine it. It could be argued that some opposite actually want to destroy it, and let the market rip. 


Labor established Medicare. We built it, we maintained it and we will continue to protect it because we know how important it is. We value it. The Department of Veterans' Affairs fee schedule, known as the Repatriation Medical Fee Schedule, is linked to the Medicare Benefits Schedule and MBS rebates and, as a consequence of the ongoing Medicare freeze, as we heard from previous speakers, the DVA fee schedule has remained unchanged since 2014. 


The DVA rebate no longer covers the cost of medical treatment and, because veterans cannot be charged a gap payment, some medical and allied health professionals are refusing to treat DVA clients. This is having a serious impact. I know of medical doctors who no longer take DVA clients. I know of many veterans who have been directly affected. Today in the House, the member for Sturt reflected on today's date and the shocking attacks on the US on September 11, 2001. As the shadow defence minister did, I want to acknowledge all Australians who have served in Afghanistan. It continues to be a difficult environment in which to assist that nation to move forward. Even today, we still have members of our ADF there in uniform assisting.


I remember 15 years ago, just two years after those dreadful attacks on September 11, when I was working in security roles in Kandahar, which had been the previous headquarters of the Taliban. I was working alongside the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan and the US military. We were ensuring that the loya jirga elections for the constitutional convention, a very important step for Afghanistan moving forward, were held in a safe manner. When we talk about freedom, the work of not only members of our Defence Force but others who have served us with the Federal Police and with humanitarian organisations and done other security work has been incredibly important for helping that nation to secure freedom.


During that time we were being actively targeted by the Taliban, who had melted back into the community, including through car bomb and grenade attacks. So I understand a little bit about the effect that working in those sorts of environments can have on our people. I understand from my service, both in and out of uniform, in Timor-Leste the sorts of difficult situations that Australians have confronted, confront and will continue to confront, whether they are capacity building, ensuring security as members of ADF, or working as first responders or in other difficult roles, including responding with humanitarian relief to our brothers and sisters in times of crisis and difficult circumstances.


Over those 15 years I've seen many friends—in uniform and then out of uniform after their service—self-medicating. This has happened whilst I've also seen medical and health services withdrawn. It's difficult to reconcile this with the rhetoric of those opposite—the flag waving and the pins on the lapels, which I notice hardly any of the frontbench opposite decided to continue with, having been given that badge of patriotism. It's difficult to see them hiding behind the service of others to try to say that they've got credibility here. I acknowledge the work that the Department of Veterans' Affairs does. I acknowledge the work that veterans' affairs ministers have done. But you can't say that you're doing everything you can. You just can't, because there are veterans out there hurting. There are doctors who are no longer seeing DVA clients, and they're doing that for a reason. It's hard to see people who have served this country suffering. It's hard to see a government that's not doing what it can to alleviate that suffering by improving the opportunities that our current and former serving people have to get the care that they need. It's simple!


The Australian Medical Association says that almost 30 per cent of specialists are no longer committed to treating veterans. Only 44 per cent of specialists said that they will continue to see veterans if the freeze continues, with the remainder considering other ways to charge veterans. I'll repeat that: they are considering other ways to charge veterans. What this means is veterans are now starting to suffer from reduced access to medical services. That must be tough for those opposite who profess to want to have the best medical support for our people, or who have served themselves and profess to want their comrades in arms to have the best access to services possible. I don't just know this from my own observations over more than 15 years; I know this is the case because I listen to the veterans in my electorate, in Darwin and Palmerston. We're a strong defence city with a large veteran community.


Earlier this year I held a veterans forum in my electorate, where the shadow veterans' affairs minister, the member for Kingston, and I heard firsthand accounts of the concerns of many veterans and the difficulties they face in the transition to civilian life. The member for Kingston addressed that gathering and took note of the particular issues faced by veterans and their families in the Top End. We heard of the different levels of service for white card holders in different parts of the country. Veterans move around, Defence members move around and their families move around, but what doesn't move around, and what doesn't get lifted from them, is the cumulative effect of their service. They reflected to us those different levels of service as they've moved around the country. We were told by one veteran that, while he had received good access to services in Sydney, it was much more difficult to access counselling and psychological services when he moved to Darwin.


We heard at the forum that gold card services are increasingly being told by medical practitioners that their books are full, and they are being turned away. Clearly those opposite agree that that is unacceptable. There is a clear need to improve access for veterans to mental health services and to professionals who have an understanding of the particular concerns of ex-service men and women. We must make sure that everything is done to enable those professionals who have that experience base to assist our serving and ex-serving people.


I am acutely aware of the human cost of the effects of the Medicare freeze on veterans not only in my electorate but also across the country. I've seen it across the country. I've seen it overseas. I've seen our brothers and sisters who have served this country on the run, not able to access the support that they need when they need it. I'm the first to applaud the non-liability mental health initiative. I'm not going on some partisan rant here. We need to fix this so that the people who have served our country have the best possible service that they can have.


The Prime Ministerial Advisory Council on Veterans' Mental Health has said:


It would appear there is a limited, but perhaps increasing, number of medical specialists turning our veterans away once they become aware they are DVA clients. The Council understands the concern regarding accepting DVA clients stems from the fact that MBS fees have been frozen for many years.


I thought it helpful to put in a couple of these quotes. Those opposite, while they might not believe me, or agree with me, or think that my lived experience in seeing people who have served our country struggling and hearing their firsthand accounts about how they used to be able to see a certain health professional but then that health professional was no longer accepting DVA clients—if they don't accept that testimony—may well listen to others. The Veterans and Veterans Counselling Service National Advisory Committee has said:


The remuneration gap between seeing veterans versus private patients from the general community or Defence members is now so significant that clinical providers are prioritising other clients over DVA referrals. In some cases, providers are refusing to accept clients with DVA white or gold cards because of the poor remuneration offered.


As I said, I know doctors. I've talked to them and I've pleaded with some of them to continue to take DVA clients. It's a matter of life and death at times. It's a very important issue for our country, but, despite repeated attempts to raise this issue, the fee schedule continues to be out of step with what providers charge and it's resulting in veterans being turned away from services.


From where I stand, I think that Australians are right not to trust the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government with Medicare, and veterans can't trust the government to take care of their health needs until this issue is dealt with. I urge the government to take action on this issue and ensure veterans are not disadvantaged by their DVA healthcare cards and are able to access the services that they need. I know and other service people, such as first responders, know that those who have been in a difficult situation need the best possible health care that our country can give them. That's what they deserve. For DVA clients there is a way that the government can help, so do it.

"Brodtmann, Gai, MP",ALP,2018-09-11,"



Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (17:31):  I just want to commend that very powerful and passionate speech from my colleague, the member for Solomon, who has been an active advocate for veterans for many, many years, including before he came into politics. You can tell from the passion and the power of that speech that he really feels this. I really do want to commend him for that heartfelt speech, that powerful speech, that passionate speech, and also his commitment and constant advocacy for our veterans. I thank him so much. It was an honour to be in the chamber to hear it.


It is an honour to speak on the Veterans' Entitlement Amendment Bill 2018. It's long overdue, as many of my colleagues have said. I welcome the fact that the opposition has suggested an amendment—that, whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes with concern that the government has undermined veterans' access to health services. We heard from the member for Solomon and we heard from the member for Lingiari and we heard from so many of my colleagues, including the member for Eden-Monaro. Two out of three of those men have served our nation in the Australian Defence Force. One was a former minister for defence personnel and veterans' affairs. These are men with lots of personal experience, as well as experience learnt through conversations with veterans over decades and decades. As we heard from them, there are significant challenges facing the veterans community when it comes to health—not just physical health but also mental health.


Currently, as we know, DVA's fee schedule, known as the Repatriation Medical Fee Schedule, is linked to the Medicare Benefits Schedule and MBS rebates. As a consequence of the government's ongoing Medicare freeze, the Veterans' Affairs fee schedule has remained stagnant since 2014. This has led to the situation where the DVA rebate is no longer covering the cost of medical treatment and, because our veterans cannot be charged a gap payment, some medical and allied health professionals have had no choice but to turn DVA clients away. We've heard of the firsthand experiences that our members have had in terms of dealing with veterans who have been turned away. As the member for Solomon said, he's begged medical professionals and mental health professionals to take on these clients. He's begged them because they have been turned away.


What this means is that veterans are now starting to suffer from reduced access to medical services for their physical and mental health needs, and reduced access means veterans are less likely to see their medical specialists unless they fork out cash or their credit card, rather than using their DVA card. In other words, DVA white cards and gold cards are no longer a vet's rolled-gold access to specialist services, as specialists can't charge fees on the client's card. We're talking about access to services, such as psychologists and other allied health clinicians, being denied to these veterans because of the Medicare freeze. It is absolutely outrageous, which is why I commend my colleague the shadow minister for veterans' affairs for actually putting this amendment forward and those who have spoken about their direct experiences of what this actually means.


The undermining of veterans' access to health services by this government, by those opposite, stemming from that appalling 2014 budget, is having a significant impact on those who have proudly served our nation, who have given their all to defend our nation, to defend our national security, to help others in need. And how does this government repay them? I again commend my colleagues who have spoken on this bill and I also commend the shadow minister for veterans' affairs for moving this very, very important amendment.


In discussing the great work being done by the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, I just want to draw the House's attention to three major initiatives that she has introduced since she has taken on this portfolio. The first was announced just recently. The shadow minister announced that a Shorten Labor government, should it be elected, would put in place a formal agreement to ensure the nation's armed forces were fully supported during and after their service. We will legislate regular reporting to parliament on how Australia is supporting military personnel.


Labor, under a Shorten Labor government, should we be elected, will sign Australia's first military covenant, recognising the immense commitment our armed forces make to serve their country, to formalise our nation's commitment to look after those who have served for our nation. The covenant will be similar to the United Kingdom's Armed Forces Covenant, a principles document that promises that those who serve or have served in the armed forces and their families will be treated fairly. A Shorten Labor government, should we be elected, will work with the Australian Defence Force and Department of Veterans' Affairs and ex-service organisations to draft the relevant wording of a military covenant and associated legislation.


Labor would also, should we be elected, introduce legislation that would require future governments to report annually to parliament on how they are meeting their responsibilities to support our serving and ex-service personnel so that it doesn't slip under the radar. It is vitally important that we continue to discuss improving transparency and improving accountability to ensure that we are providing the best service for our veterans and the best service for our serving personnel so that there are no blind spots and so that those gaps are addressed.


I also want to draw attention to another initiative that my colleague announced—last year, actually, but it again highlights the fact that she has been very active in this space, and I applaud her for that. It's not just veterans that we are talking about here and it is not just current serving members, men and women, that we are talking about here; we are also talking about the families. You know, Deputy Speaker Hastie—you've served—that it is not just the serving member who does it tough, who faces a number of challenges; it is also the families who are there supporting them. When you're off serving your nation in Afghanistan, with your family at home not knowing where you are and whether you're okay, it does place an enormous strain on families back home who are trying to provide the most support possible to you. So I was delighted that my colleague, the shadow minister, also said that should a Shorten Labor government be elected we would develop a family engagement and support strategy for defence personnel and veterans to provide greater support to our military families. They play a pivotal role in supporting our current serving ADF men and women and our veterans, and it's important that we ensure that we give them the support they need to address the unique challenges of military family life. 


I want to focus on the initiative that was launched by my colleague, the member for Eden-Monaro, the shadow minister and myself in March this year. It is a comprehensive veterans package, a veterans employment policy, that we committed $121 million to, should we be elected, to provide greater support to our defence personnel as they transition to civilian life. The figures are quite staggering. You would probably be aware of them, Deputy Speaker Hastie, but best estimates cite that veterans' unemployment is currently sitting at 30 per cent. Thirty per cent of our veterans, those who have served our nation, are unemployed. And, for those who did not medically discharge, there is an estimated 11.2 per cent unemployment rate, which is more than double the national average. This is absolutely unacceptable.


That is why this employment policy is well overdue and very, very welcome. And it comes from opposition. I will very quickly run through and translate the policy. It ensures that veterans receive recognition of prior skills and experience within civilian professional organisations and institutions. It ensures that eligible businesses will be provided with a training grant of up to $5,000 in order to help veterans gain the skills and experience they need to move into a civilian job. It will establish an employment and transition service that provides greater individualised, tailored support to transitioning veterans over a longer period of time. There is a range of initiatives in this employment package. Again I commend my colleague, the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, for the extensive consultation she did in developing this strategy and for coming up with such a comprehensive policy, which addresses so many of those areas that are currently being overlooked. 


Finally, I want to focus on two events that I went to recently that commemorated and honoured the veterans who have served our nation and also those who have made the ultimate sacrifice. Just last Friday I joined the new foreign minister, the former defence minister, for the commemoration of the National Service Memorial at the National Service Memorial Day at the Australian War Memorial. Thousands of Australian men undertook national service in the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s, and that was commemorated last Friday. My father did national service in the 1950s. A lot of Australians tend to overlook the scale of national service in this country. Between 1951 and 1959, 18-year-old men were required to register for national service, and over 220,000 underwent six months of compulsory military training in the Navy, Army or Air Force. The exact figure is actually 227,000. At the event on the national service day on Friday we had an opportunity to commemorate those, including those who made the ultimate sacrifice in their national service.


We also had the opportunity to honour the fact that one of the national servicemen, Allen May, donated his medals to the Australian War Memorial. It was a very, very special moment. Mr May was 21 when he was conscripted in 1965 to Vietnam. After arriving in Vietnam, he became a forward scout. Historians believe he fired the first shots in what became known as the Battle of Long Tan. It was a beautiful gesture to present those medals to the War Memorial. They will be a constant reminder to all of us here in Australia and to anyone who visits the Australian War Memorial of the significant contribution that our national servicemen made to our nation over all that period of time, and a constant reminder of those who, in national service, made the ultimate sacrifice. I don't know whether many Australians really understand the scale of the national servicemen who served for that very, very lengthy period of time. It was an honour to be there at that very special memorial, which is nearly 10 years old, alongside the War Memorial with national service veterans. There were some veterans from Canberra and there were some veterans who had travelled from all over the country. It was a great honour to be with them to commemorate their service and to honour their mates who didn't make it home.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2018</title>,BILLS,15,1
"Dick, Milton, MP",ALP,2018-09-11,"



Mr DICK
 (Oxley) (17:46):  I rise to enter the debate tonight on the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2018 and also to strongly support the second reading amendment moved by the shadow minister. I just want to touch on the issue the member for Canberra—who has been a passionate and fierce advocate for Defence Force families and men and women serving in the ADF—raised in the debate tonight about national servicemen. In my electorate of Oxley there is what we call one of the headquarters for national servicemen, the Wacol Barracks. That was a significant area, used during the war and also postwar, where many young men provided great service to our nation. I actually met with the National Servicemen's Association from Queensland two weeks ago. They are on a mission to build a memorial at Wacol for those 'nashos' who lost their lives during service. There isn't a lot of recognition for those men who, through accidents and through incidents, were killed during their national service.


Tonight, in the House of Representatives, I place on record my thanks to, particularly, those great men who gave outstanding service and, in some ways, who've not been fully recognised as part of the nashos. I know, by talking to their leadership in Queensland, just how passionate and dedicated they are to honouring and remembering their comrades, those brave men, that served Australia but haven't yet been recognised. Tonight, I place on record that I will be doing what I can. They want to have a memorial erected for next year. Wacol is a wonderful community. It was the site of a couple of things: great army barracks and, later, through the fifties, sixties and seventies, a migrant processing camp, where the second-largest number of migrants were processed in Australia. That happened in the south-west suburbs of Brisbane. They are very historic suburbs, but, in some ways, they are suburbs that have great military connection to our country.


As the member for Oxley, I want to take the opportunity tonight to place on record my support for this bill. It is a minor amendment, but it is an important amendment that we will be dealing with tonight. We've heard speakers from both sides of the chamber recognising the great service to our nation of those who have served in the ADF, and service to one's country is nothing short of selfless. When a person makes this commitment, we as a nation must in turn undertake a commitment to support that individual and their family both during and after their service.


Tonight's bill amends the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 in relation to how the Department of Veterans' Affairs administers bereavement payments. We know these amendments result in no changes to current entitlements to bereavement payments, but rather insert a new section to the VEA that was omitted in amendments in 1996. We know that the section was inadvertently removed in the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Budget Measures 1995-96) Bill (No. 2) 1995 and provides the legislative power for DVA to reduce bereavement payments where an overpayment has occurred. So DVA already has the legal authority to provide the bereavement payment and to recover any overpayment of income support pensions paid to veterans after their death.


The process has been in place since the 1980s, but, as I said, the legislation provision was inadvertently removed in 1996. We need to do this to make sure that this issue is resolved. We know that the passing of a loved one is particularly difficult and, when this occurs, it is entirely understandable that the need to notify the relevant government departments is not always prominent. This means that until the DVA is notified, the veteran will continue to receive payments after their death. This results in an overpayment to the partner.


I support this bill tonight, as does the Labor opposition, and as our shadow minister has outlined, in the attempt to deal with the situation while, of course, respecting and placing the wellbeing of veterans' families at the forefront of policymaking. I'm happy to place on record my support for the bill, but I'm also happy tonight to address the shadow minister's amendment, which reads:


""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes with concern that the Government has undermined veterans' access to health services"".


I want to touch on this because I know from representing members of the ADF and talking to members who have served that they are feeling short-changed by the fact that the frozen Medicare rebates have included allied health services. This is a throwback to the disastrous 2014 Abbott budget. We know there has not been any indexation of Medicare rebates since 2014 and, as a result, no corresponding increase in the DVA rebate paid to health professionals helping our veterans. I want to be very clear that this is a serious issue. This is a serious issue that means some of our veterans are not getting, in my opinion, the health care that they deserve.


A number of submissions to the Productivity Commission's inquiry into compensation and rehab for veterans have seen stakeholders critical of this very key impact. I want to read into the Hansard tonight, and reiterate my support for some of these submissions, what the Prime Ministerial Advisory Council on Veterans' Mental Health said in their submission. They said:


It would appear there is a limited, but perhaps increasing, number of medical specialists turning our veterans away once they become aware they are DVA clients. The Council understands the concern regarding accepting DVA clients stems from the fact that MBS fees have been frozen for many years.


The Department of Veterans' Affairs have conceded that there are serious issues with this freeze, with the Veterans and Veterans Counselling Service National Advisory Committee in their submission saying:


The remuneration gap between seeing veterans versus private patients from the general community or Defence members is now so significant that clinical providers are prioritising other clients over DVA referrals. In some cases, providers are refusing to accept clients with DVA white or gold cards because of the poor remuneration offered.


These concerns are confirmed and backed in by the Australian Medical Association. They announced over 18 months ago a survey of their members which found that almost 30 per cent of clinicians are no longer committed to treating veterans and are turning them away and that only 44 per cent of respondents would continue seeing veterans if the freeze continues.


As I said, this is a serious issue that I don't think the government is addressing in any way, shape or form. I don't think it is hearing the message from those people being impacted by this or from experts in the field—from the AMA or from Occupational Therapy Australia, which said:


While the Department of Veterans' Affairs … may report no decline in the total number of occupational therapists treating veterans, OTA is aware of the changing make-up of that number and the potential repercussions of this change.


The issue was also raised in the Senate inquiry into suicide by veterans and ex-service personnel by a number of submitters, including Dr Katelyn Kerr from the Australian Institute for Suicide Research and Prevention. In Dr Kerr's submission, she writes:


However, DVA fees are significantly lower, and there has been a fee freeze for psychologists since 2014, creating a disincentive for experienced and skilled clinicians to see veterans. If DVA would match the fee schedule provided by Medibank Health Solutions or that recommended by the APS, this would increase the number of psychologists willing to see veterans and would increase the delivery of gold-standard interventions which have high success rates in treating mental disorders. 


From 1 July 2017 to 23 May this year, DVA had received 8,331 applications for nonliability health care. While not all applications were for mental health treatment, we could expect the majority were seeking treatment for mental health conditions. According to the DVA's 2016-17 annual report, DVA currently services 165,071 veterans. Of course, this number is not reflective of all the veterans in Australia as DVA only track those who are current clients.


You can see from the evidence provided and from what the community is saying—I just want to put on the record tonight that I think the government has been way too slow in acting on this. That's why we're seeking tonight to put that amendment on the agenda: because our veterans deserve that. When the vote comes tonight, we have an opportunity to send a very clear message that this House notes with concern that the way that the government have been dragged kicking and screaming on the issue on frozen rebates is having a major impact on the veterans community.


I want to briefly touch on—I think of the member for Canberra and the particular work that she's done in the area alongside our defence team of the shadow minister for defence, the member for Corio, and the shadow minister for veterans' affairs—the significant announcement for the veterans community which we saw last week in Townsville. I saw some media reports about that announcement. I understand that the announcement was well received by the veterans community. If we are to be successful at the next election and if we are to be in government, Labor's vow to ADF personnel will be set in stone. In the future, if we are successful, a Shorten Labor government will put in place a formal agreement to ensure the nation's armed forces are fully supported during and after their service. It will be legislated with regular reporting to Australia on how Australia is supporting military personnel. I think that's an official promise that, hopefully, both sides of politics will deliver. I was delighted to see that the LNP in Queensland have matched that commitment.


Once again, we've seen the quality of a future Shorten Labor government, if we are successful, in making that firm commitment alongside the shadow minister for veterans affairs. It was only a short while ago that we saw the relevant portfolio elevated to cabinet, and I congratulate the Leader of the Opposition for ensuring that veterans are given that strong voice at the cabinet table. And they can have no stronger voice than the shadow minister, who, I know, has been travelling the country, meeting with veterans' groups, meeting with our Defence Force personnel, to make sure that she hears and understands, and that's why you saw good policy announced in Townsville last week with the member for Herbert, the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister.


I very much look forward to giving, if Labor were privileged to be in government, that commitment to make sure that we not only honour but, importantly, deliver on the commitments to those men and women who've served our great nation. With those few remarks, I commend the bill to the House and thank the minister and the shadow minister for the constructive way they have handled this debate tonight.

",HoR,<title>BILLS</title>,<title>Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2018</title>,BILLS,15,1
"Broad, Andrew, MP",Nats,2018-09-11,"



Mr BROAD
 (Mallee—Assistant Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister) (18:01):  I too want to talk about the Veterans’ Entitlements Amendment Bill 2018 and about the importance of standing by veterans. Having not had that privilege of serving, I do want to pay tribute to people who have served, and of course Deputy Speaker Hastie would be aware of that. The Veterans Entitlements Amendment Bill 2018 was introduced into the House of Representatives on 22 August 2018. It reinstates an inadvertently removed provision to offset pension overpayment from bereavement payments in one streamlined transaction. Essentially, we want to stand by veterans and their families in the event of a bereavement to make it easier for people. People who have served our country are people we should be proud of. We spend a lot of time talking about the 102,000 Australians who have been killed in conflict. We probably don't spend quite enough time honouring those who have served and who, as a result of their service, have gone through some difficult times upon their returning.


I'm keen to add, while talking about this bill, an idea that's been put forward in my patch around assisting veterans upon their return. I live in a rural electorate. My electorate is 36 per cent of the state of Victoria, is an agricultural electorate and was historically set up by soldier settlements. Those soldier settlements were established after the First World War and also after the Second World War to stand by and to give opportunity to people who were returning from service, people who were sometimes traumatised. In those days, they didn't know fully about things such as post-traumatic stress syndrome. It saddens me to go to the cemetery and see the graves of young men who returned and who took their lives as a result of post-traumatic stress syndrome after the First World War and Second World War. 


A Vietnam veteran came to me, a guy by the name of Ian Hastings, a grain grower, involved with farming systems. He is keen to take those who have served and see how they could be incorporated into the grain industry. One of the great things about working in the Australian grain industry is that they do get to drive big machines—harvesters, boon sprays—and use GPS technology. They are struggling to find people to work in those industries in more remote areas. And the idea has been put forward to me that we could once again, in some regards, have a soldier settlement scheme, taking people who are returning from their service, who are looking for gainful employment and incorporate them into those rural communities in rural Australia, particularly in our agriculture industry.


This would be a bipartisan position held across this parliament but I don't think we collectively are doing enough for our veterans. We are probably not standing by the people who have stood by Australia as fully as we should. When it comes to people who have served, we really should honour them in a greater sense. One of the great privileges as a member of parliament is the ability to do a military exchange. I know one of the members in the chamber here came with me at the start of last year to Afghanistan to see what our serving men and women serving were doing over there. What struck me was the calibre of the people we met.


Interestingly enough, as members of parliament we had to wear KingGee clothing. We don't get to wear uniform when we go over there. When I was sitting there in the mess hall having breakfast, one of the members of the Defence Force said to me, 'Who are you blokes?' I said, 'We're members of parliament.' And he goes, 'Oh, I thought you looked like a Jim's Mowing team.' He was very impressed that members of parliament would come over and see our serving troops. One of the questions I asked these people who were serving was how they are with their family time and what support services there are for their family. The very nature of the work and the hours, particularly with the difference in travel time, meant that those people weren't able to have contact with their families. So not only are they not as supported as they could be whilst serving; we also need to support them more fully upon their return.


The beauty of this bill is to try to address a small misdemeanour, essentially saying that, if someone has been overpaid but has also passed away, that can be rolled into one. I think it is important that we do more in this space. There are some great organisations, such as Soldier On and our traditional RSLs. I recently met with our RSL in Mildura. It was encouraging to me to see that a new generation of RSL were coming through. There was a guy there who was a young former soldier, and he was very active in the RSL and talking to our young children, particularly in our primary schools.


One of the things that I do want to raise—and something that still gripes me—is the book work and recording around veterans. I was approached by a young lady of 28 who lived in Donald, Victoria, in my electorate. Her husband, who was a similar age, had served two terms in Afghanistan. He was driving a water truck for the local council, but he needed a knee reconstruction. Unfortunately, he couldn't prove through records of the time of his service that the knee had been damaged in service. I've got to say, from the small time I spent in Afghanistan on that military exchange, walking around with the body armour on, it was pretty evident to me that would have had an impact on his knee. The knee reconstruction was going to cost $4,000. He was having difficulty, as a dad with two kids and a wife, having to climb up and down on a water truck for the council—and we wouldn't pay the $4,000.


I think that's to our shame. I think that's something where there really should have been no argument, and I would have thought that our department would put less of an onus on proof and have more of a fair-go type of attitude to that sort of situation. That's something I wanted to put on the record. I would like to see a more open attitude, I guess, towards supporting people who may have an injury as a result of their military service. To my way of thinking, that injury was a result of his military service. Deputy Speaker Hastie, you would of course be able to make more of a judgement call as to whether something like that would be a result of his military service. But, even if it wasn't, my view is that $4,000 for someone who has served our country so that they can get their leg patched up and so they can continue working is a pretty good investment, and we should have just covered it.


There are now over 30,000 soldiers who have returned from our Afghanistan engagement and the conflict in the Middle East region. That's quite a lot. We should be proud of them. Their service should be recognised on the memorials in our country towns. We march every year on Anzac Day to remember those who have served. I would like to see the names on those memorials updated to include not only those who have given their life but also those who have served. I think that's something we should encourage.


There's another thing I'm also keen to see. We have suburbs in new parts of our cities. If you look across the Wimmera Mallee you will see the memorials in the country towns, because of course in the First World War and the Second World War those towns were where the people were. But I believe we should also have new memorials, with the names of those who have served in Afghanistan, in the suburbs of cities. I think that's a challenge for our local councils in our new suburbs, that they should consider putting up memorials for those who have served in our Afghanistan conflict. It would be a great opportunity.


I commend this bill and I'm happy to have had a few moments to talk about the service of our Australian troops. I believe there is a lot of merit, particularly, in getting those country communities to welcome back and use the troops in their agricultural field. I will continue to talk about that with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. I'm pleased that we are standing by those who have given so much for our country.

Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Personnel, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Centenary of ANZAC and Deputy Leader of the House) (18:11):  In summing up I would like to thank all members who contributed to the debate on this bill, the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2018. I would like to acknowledge the continued tradition of bipartisan support for the veteran community demonstrated by the opposition. The importance of family and the support they provide to both our serving personnel and veterans cannot be overestimated. Just moments ago the shadow minister and myself were joined by the opposition leader, the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the shadow minister for foreign affairs at the Australian War Memorial, where we paid our respects to women who have served and women who have supported their loved ones who served at a very moving Last Post service conducted by Dr Brendan Nelson. It was a very fitting tribute, and it was good to see such a large crowd gathered for that event.


The bill before the House relates to how the Department of Veterans' Affairs administers bereavement payments. The government is committed to supporting veterans and their families. This bill will maintain the current practice for families when a beloved member dies. There are no changes to current entitlements for bereavement payment—they will remain exactly the same. This is a compassionate, sympathetic and unobtrusive response which avoids disturbing the family with additional interactions with the Department of Veterans' Affairs while they are grieving. When a veteran receiving a DVA income support payment dies, the surviving partner is entitled to a bereavement payment equivalent to 14 weeks of the veteran's income support payment. The bereavement payment is designed to assist the surviving partner with costs following the death of the partner and to provide a period to adjust their finances following the end of the deceased partner's payments. It is paid automatically once the family notifies DVA. Often the veteran will continue to receive payments after their death, as these payments continue until DVA has been notified. This results in an overpayment. This bill ensures the adjustment is made in a single administrative process, rather than through a number of formal debt recoveries. It avoids the need to recover debts from the deceased estate and it avoids disturbing the family during the grieving period. The bill will provide legislative certainty for past and future recoveries of pension overpayments from bereavement payment and will maintain the current discreet practice to respect the veterans' families mourning their loss.


I note the opposition's comments regarding veterans' access to health services more broadly across the nation. While I appreciate that there's been occasional commentary regarding health providers who don't accept DVA fees, I assure the House that this is not a systemwide problem. In Australia healthcare providers in private practice are free to choose how to run their business, including their opening hours, how much they'll charge and who they'll see. This of course includes whether or not to provide treatment under DVA's arrangements. As I told the House today, every year health providers across this country provide over 9.5 million medical and dental services to veterans and families. As a nation we can be rightly proud of the more than $11 billion provided by Australian taxpayers to support in the order of 290,000 veterans and their families.


While we occasionally hear anecdotal reports of issues with access or fees, the proportion of clients accessing health services who complained about these issues is very low—only 0.1 per cent in the last DVA annual report. Of course if a veteran does experience difficulties accessing services, DVA will identify alternative arrangements to ensure a veteran's care is maintained. This could include providing transport to alternative health providers or, where there is a specific clinical need, funding services above the DVA rate. DVA medical and allied health fees continue to represent the full payment to healthcare providers and are significantly higher than the fees payable under the Medicare scheme. The government is progressively reintroducing fee indexation for DVA medical and allied health services from 2017-18 and, as of 1 July this year, indexation has been reintroduced for GP attendances, bulk-billing incentives, specialist attendances and DVA's dental and allied health services. This has only been possible due to the strong economic management of the coalition government.


In conclusion, I again thank members opposite and those on this side of the chamber for their support for the Veterans' Entitlement Amendment Bill 2018. As a nation, we are rightly proud of the service provided by our men and women in uniform. It is a matter of fact, Mr Deputy Speaker Hastie—and you, as someone who has served, would know this more than others—that in the order of 80,000 to 85,000 Australians put on the uniform and serve in the permanent or reserve ADF. For those of us who haven't put on the uniform and don't serve in that capacity, as a grateful nation we are indebted to those who serve. Our task is to make sure they are supported while they are serving but also once their service ends. The transition from the Australian Defence Force to civilian life is not always easy. In your case, Deputy Speaker Hastie, it's a quite unusual path that you've chosen to take in joining us here in the House of Representatives. But I congratulate you on your own service but also for the path you've taken in transition.


As a government, we are keen to work across party political lines to ensure that the veterans and their families are well supported both now and into the future. I've had many briefings with the shadow minister and appreciated her forthright input into policy development, and I'm sure I'll get more of that forthright input in the weeks and months ahead. In that spirit of bipartisanship, I must stress that many members, from both sides of the House, come to me raising issues on specific areas of concern for veterans and, wherever possible, I will work constructively to make sure we get an outcome which is in the interests of the veterans and their families. I commend this bill.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Hastie
):  I thank the minister.



The SPEAKER:  The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this, the honourable member for Kingston has moved as an amendment that all words after 'that' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. So the immediate question before the House is that the amendment moved by the member for Kingston be agreed to.

"Drum, Damian, MP",Nats,2018-09-11,"



Mr DRUM
 (Murray) (16:45):  It's a great opportunity to be able to rise and talk to the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2018. It's very positive that in the House this afternoon the Labor Party has chosen to support this bill and support the continued assistance that we are giving to veterans. This bill is largely an accounting mechanism to enable the Department of Veterans' Affairs to best look after families where, for one reason or another, there has been an overpayment. This generally happens around the time of a death of a veteran who had been receiving a pension and the pension continues to flow for a few weeks after that death. Reconciliation needs to take place. These reconciliations have been going on for as long as military pensions have been paid out. A little reconciliation needs to take place, with a slight overpayment being fixed up by the fact that there is always a bereavement payment. 


We've identified the fact that some administrative changes made in 1995 have effectively meant that this ongoing work, this practice that we see happening each and every day, may not be quite kosher. This piece of legislation addresses that so the common practice can continue in a way that is going to be least intrusive to families when they are going through a period of grief.


So, as I said earlier, we believe that this is not going to alter the current practice. It's going to enable the current practice to take place in a manner that is fully agreeable to all those involved. This practice also happens in relation to Centrelink pensioner payments. The main reason we are bringing this bill forward is to give transparency to the ex-service organisations, who also need to know exactly what this bill is going to bring about—to maintain the status quo, to ensure that these adjustments are made in that one single administrative process. That's hopefully going to be a good outcome for people that are in this position. As I said, this inadvertent issue relates to a provision that was removed way back in 1995, and whilst the practice has continued since that time, we have to acknowledge that we have to clean this up. That's why we are doing this. 


I think it also gives us an opportunity to touch on the lot of our veterans. Everybody in the House makes sure every time they get the opportunity to say how proud we are of our veterans, and I want to add my voice to that growing number of parliamentarians. We don't understand—I'm sure we think we do, but we don't understand—exactly the sacrifice and the service that many of our military servicemen afford this country. We also need to acknowledge how tough it must be for these servicemen and women when they try and assimilate back into civilian life. Having spent a large portion of their time away from their families, moving back into the family on a full-time basis might not necessarily be as easy as everybody thinks it will be. They may be moving into civilian employment, where maybe respect for each other isn't what they've expected over the previous period of time in the armed services, in the military. Their ability needs to be given a fair amount of empathy because the work that has to take place on behalf of these servicemen and women is incredibly difficult.


I might add that these are the people who have come back in 100 per cent good shape—in fantastic shape physically and in 100 per cent shape mentally. It is still an incredibly difficult task for them to assimilate back into civilian life without the feeling that it is incredibly difficult. Sometimes we need to acknowledge that. Then, of course, there needs to be additional support given to those men and women who may be, in one way or another, seriously affected by the service that they've given in the military.


It's really a worthwhile point for us all to ponder: what more we can do. In fact, we have far too many suicides by the people who have returned from combat in our recent skirmishes, in our recent combats. For our veterans to be obviously affected by post-traumatic stress and then to struggle to find the support that they need is something that we need to give continued and growing support towards as best we possibly can. 


I'm very proud of the work that we are doing as a government to try and assist the veterans with the counselling that they need and the counselling that their families may need. When I was the veterans' affairs minister in Victoria, we were able to build accommodation facilities in the city to provide medium- to long-term accommodation and support services in a whole range of health areas. We were able to do that in conjunction with the RSL of Victoria. We were the main funders, but the RSL are still are the operators of that facility. It's located in Richmond, close to public transport and close to a lot of amenities. It's located in an area that can offer single accommodation, husband-and-wife accommodation and also accommodation for a full family. As I say, it was the RSL going back to the government and saying, 'This is the area that we think is currently being missed. It might take somebody approximately six weeks to three months to sort out the mess that they are in. They highlighted that they needed that type of support to be added to the myriad supports that are available for our veterans.


As has been spoken about this afternoon, we've got support for our Veterans' Children Education Scheme and the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act Education and Training Scheme to try to assist the children of our veterans with their education and the supports that they need as well. The supports that they need are extremely many and varied. I want to congratulate the minister for bringing this legislation forward. Hopefully, we can sort this issue out. Hopefully, we can make sure that we continue the practice of having minimal impact on these families as they go through their time of loss and grief, we can make the accounting procedures as simple as possible and we can continue to raise the need for government to be in lock-step with our veterans when they return—for all those who are in good health, all those who are struggling at various stages, all those who are struggling every day, and all those somewhere in between, because the lot of our veterans is a mixed and varied lot and they have varying degrees of capacity to live a full and wholesome life. What has to be acknowledged is the respect that the community of Australia has towards our veterans. We need to make sure that they know that they have that respect from each and every one of us.

"Snowdon, Warren, MP",ALP,2018-09-11,"



Mr SNOWDON
 (Lingiari) (16:54):  I'm pleased to be able to make a contribution to this debate on the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2018 and I want to applaud the government for the passage of this legislation. Clearly, we support the proposals within it. When veterans pass away, it is vital for surviving partners to be assisted and treated with compassion and sympathy. The bereavement payment, which is made up of 14 weeks of the partner's income support payment, is to assist the surviving partner with costs following that death.


As we know, all families need a period of time to adjust their finances in such circumstances. However, surviving partners who have access often receive an overpayment of the veteran's income payments that continue after the passing. Sadly, it is a flaw in the system. This can lead to a debt being raised and add to the grieving and anxiety of the surviving partner and their family. As a result of this legislation, when this happens, DVA will now reduce the bereavement payment by the amount the veteran's partner has received since they passed away. The intention of recouping the cost in this fashion is to minimise unnecessary interactions with DVA during such a difficult time. The amendment will streamline the administrative processes. It's a straightforward amendment with no additional cost, and we're very pleased to be able to support it, and I commend the minister, the member for Gippsland, for bringing this piece of legislation forward.


Like me, I think that the member for Gippsland would support the amendment being proposed by the shadow minister, which reads:


That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:


""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes with concern that the Government has undermined veterans' access to health services"".


I know in his heart of hearts that the member for Gippsland would support this amendment but simply won't, clearly, because it would undermine the policies which were introduced in 2014 by his government to freeze indexation on Medicare payments. The impact of that Medicare freeze has a direct correlation to veterans' access to services.


Currently—as you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, and I'm sure the minister knows—all veterans have been granted access to allied and mental health services for mental health conditions, cancer and pulmonary tuberculosis through the nonliability healthcare policy. Some veterans have additional access through white cards and gold cards for their assessed conditions. As part of accessing these services, psychologists and other clinicians are paid by the government through the Department of Veterans' Affairs with a set fee with no gap to be paid by the veteran. This fee, paid by DVA, is tied to the Medicare rebate and indexed in line with the Medicare rebate. However, as there's been no indexation on Medicare rebates since 2014, there have been no corresponding increase in DVA rebates paid to the health professionals assisting our veterans.


We heard evidence of this last week in a defence committee hearing in Adelaide which is looking at the transition of Defence Force personnel to civilian life and talking about people being veterans whilst they're in service and how they're being cared for post-service. This indexation freeze has led to a situation where, as the rebate is no longer covering the cost of medical treatment and because our veterans cannot be charged a gap payment, sadly and ashamedly, some medical and allied health professionals have had no choice but to turn DVA clients away. I heard this from the College of Psychiatrists in evidence to the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade in a hearing in Melbourne last week. It was made very clear that there are people being turned away from specialist services because of the fee. These are people who may well require important interventions for mental health issues, and now we've got to the state where medical practitioners and others who are entitled to charge under the Medicare schedule are turning veterans away or putting them at the bottom of their lists. They are not serving veterans.


I wonder if that's been in the front of mind of the Minister for Health or indeed the Prime Minister. After all, the Prime Minister would know about this. I'm sure that, as he churned through the budget papers as Treasurer, he would have seen this particular item and no doubt would have said, 'Well, this is a saving against the budget, against Medicare, something we will support.'


Well, Prime Minister, I would say to you: here's your chance to show your bona fides for the veteran community. Show your bona fides by going back to the cabinet table and talking to your now Treasurer and your health minister and, with the submission coming from the Department of Veterans' Affairs through the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, make a change to this ridiculous rule. Just get over the freeze, basically. Index the Medicare fee schedule as it should be indexed and ensure that veterans who properly need access to services can get access to services whether or not they can afford them. This is an issue which strikes at the very heart of our claimed support for veterans in this place.


A number of submissions to the Productivity Commission's inquiry into compensation and rehabilitation for veterans have seen some people very critical of the impact of what I've just referred to. The Prime Minister's own Prime Ministerial Advisory Council on Veterans' Mental Health said in their submission:


It would appear there is a limited, but perhaps increasing, number of medical specialists turning our veterans away once they become aware they are DVA clients. The Council understands the concern regarding accepting DVA clients stems from the fact that MBS fees have been frozen for many years.


Well, isn't that a shame job? You'd think, would you not, that the government would say: 'Hang on, this is not good. We're happy to wrap ourselves in the flag and stand next to veterans and say how well we support them, but once we flip the page we see that, as a result of the Medicare freeze, now DVA clients are potentially missing out on access to services.' The Veterans and Veterans Families Counselling Service National Advisory Committee said:


The remuneration gap between seeing veterans versus private patients from the general community or Defence members is now so significant that clinical providers are prioritising other clients over DVA referrals. In some cases, providers are refusing to accept clients with DVA white or gold cards because of the poor remuneration offered.


It's a bit hard to understand how they could put that position forward. Unless they're on the bones of their backside—and not too many of these health professionals are, I have to say—you'd think they'd make sure in any event that these people who require access to services would get access to services. But clearly that's not their interest, because they're driven by the fee rather than the service.


These concerns confirm those raised by the Australian Medical Association over 18 months ago, following a survey of their members which found that almost 30 per cent of clinicians are no longer committed to treating veterans and are turning them away and that only 44 per cent of respondents would continue seeing veterans if the freeze were to continue. There are a couple of issues which arise from this, one of which is a standard of care. How can we guarantee that veterans are getting the quality of service they need to address their health needs when they're being forced to go to the lender of last resort, if you like? I think there is a problem here which is being swept under the carpet and ignored.


Whilst those opposite may protest that it's not their fault, it is their fault. They made the budget decision in 2014. Remember who the Prime Minister was then? It was the architect of the shenanigans that went on here a fortnight ago. He's still in this place. Perhaps he could gee-up the Prime Minister now he's been given a job as an envoy, God forbid, and say to the Prime Minister: 'Hang on, it's probably not a good thing to continue with this. Let's address this Medicare freeze issue.' And I would hope—and I'm sure he would—that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs would be attempting to counsel the government about the impact of this freeze on the treatment of our veterans.


It's not appropriate. It's not fair and it's something we shouldn't do. But somehow or another there is a view on that side of the parliament that this is acceptable. Well, I'd like them to justify how acceptable it is and explain to us—to the Australian community, particularly the veteran community—why it is acceptable that 56 per cent of respondents to an AMA survey say they would no longer service veterans because of this Medicare freeze. You don't have to be Einstein to work out the impact of that. We see, day in day out, people coming into this place and saying how we should be committed to our veterans, both serving and non-serving—those who have passed out of uniform and are now clients of DVA. It's not good enough.


I want to say to the government: we would support you to lift this freeze and address the question in a proper manner. But I'll bet that when we come to the vote on this amendment we'll get no support from the government. If those opposite don't give us support for the amendment, it will say to us that they think it's okay that veterans are unable to access services because of cost. A right which veterans have is effectively being taken away from them because of a budget decision by this government. It's tawdry. It's wrong. It shouldn't be, but it is. The government have an opportunity to fix it, but they won't. And the people who will suffer are those veterans who have served this nation proudly in our uniform. We have an obligation to these people and their families; we all admit it here. We say it all the time. But, by maintaining this freeze, those opposite are saying they only accept that obligation as a partial obligation. They don't see it as we on this side of the House see it—as the need to make sure that veterans have access to the health services they properly require at no cost to them.

"Wilson, Tim, MP",LP,2018-09-11,"



Mr TIM WILSON
 (Goldstein) (17:10):  I rise to support the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2018 as part of this parliament's enduring responsibility to honour Australian veterans. I know that that sentiment is shared by, hopefully, everybody in this place as well as in the Senate. Any of us who have not been veterans will never appreciate the sacrifice or the preparedness to sacrifice that so many have been prepared to give to our great nation. I was reminded of this recently when I visited a veteran community in the Goldstein electorate, many of whom have previously been actively involved in the RSL. I visited Vasey RSL Care in Brighton East with Senator Jim Molan—of course a veteran himself. These champions included people like Bob Larkin, Peter Lanigan, Judy Smith, Dennis Pope, Ray Dunstan, Jordie Burgess, Jeff Walters and Roger Hyde. They have helped guide returning servicemen and women with distinction, and they have my gratitude and of course the gratitude of the Goldstein community. We will never forget your preparedness to sacrifice and to continue to honour veterans and their families.


That is, of course, what we seek to do and to enliven as part of this piece of legislation. The government has introduced a host of measures to improve the lives of veterans and their families and support them through difficult periods. This support is included in the 2018-19 budget, which allocates additional funding to dental and allied health services, improving mental health, assisting veterans in finding work and increasing access to Department of Veterans' Affairs services, as well as assisting veterans with the challenges of depression and associated mental health consequences and, tragically, the example of suicide. In 2017 there were 84 veteran suicides. I'm sure everybody here recognises that that number is simply not good enough.


So we have acted. We've delivered an additional $31 million in funding to support veterans' mental health on top of last year's increase of $58.1 million. We've provided an additional $8.3 million for improving employment opportunities for veterans, both in improving community engagement with veterans' employment and assisting veterans adjusting to civilian work. But the value and the contribution of what we are doing will never properly be measured in dollars and cents. It will only ever be fully realised in the lives lived and the circumstances avoided, to make sure that veterans can make a continuing contribution to their country and are able to stand on their own two feet, be fully accepted and embraced within our community and live full lives.


The Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2018 continues these important efforts. We are seeking to ease the bureaucratic burden and administration for bereaved families of veterans by simplifying the way the Department of Veterans' Affairs dispenses final payments. Importantly, this amendment does not change the amount paid to the veteran's family. We respect the importance of the veterans' service pension, income support supplement and social security pension. The bill reduces the administrative processes to alleviate the period of grieving for families of veterans. I would hope that no nobody would want a situation where you have a bereaved family and the biggest hurdle they face after their grief is red tape. After a veteran's passing, the Department of Veterans' Affairs entitles the surviving family to a bereavement payment, and we recognise that this payment plays an important role in supporting a grieving family in their tragedy.


However, when a veteran passes there is often a delay between their date of death and when the Department of Veterans' Affairs is notified. This means the final payment of pension is often higher than what the veteran's surviving partner is entitled to. This occurs because when the payment is issued to veterans while they are still alive, it is assumed they will be eligible for the entire period. Therefore, it is frequently the case that families owe the difference between the value of the veteran's pension that was paid and the value entitled to the veteran after considering their passing.


The current system is inefficient and unnecessarily burdensome on the families of those who have already lost a loved one. It requires they undergo a formal debt recovery method undertaken by the department. This bill seeks to simplify this process by deducting the overpaid value paid to the veteran and surviving partner over the bereavement payment entitled to the families, cutting out the unnecessary debt recovery stage.


There are 215,000 veterans receiving support from the Department of Veterans' Affairs, and our measures aim to improve their lives, every single one of them. They're Aussies, just like us, and they deserve our support. So, with the measures in this bill, particularly in times of tragedy or in times where people are grieving, veterans' families will know that everything that this government can do to minimise their pain and the burden of bureaucracy is being taken off them so they can have their thoughts and prayers where they're properly deserved.

"Gosling, Luke, MP",ALP,2018-09-11,"



Mr GOSLING
 (Solomon) (17:16):  Labor supports the Veterans’ Entitlements Amendment Bill 2018. The government, as we heard from previous speakers, has a duty to support our servicemen and women whilst in uniform and then when they leave the service and, of course, their families. We support any move to make this support more compassionate and reasonable. If there are overpayments of a bereavement payment, the recovery process should be as sympathetic and compassionate as possible and that is the intent of this bill.


I will now speak specifically in support of Labor's amendment to the bill. Our amendment is bringing attention to an area where veterans are not being treated with respect and sympathy or with compassion. What is happening is veterans are losing access to vital health services. The fact is that the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government's continued attacks on Medicare have now started to affect veterans and their families. We understand that this government do not value Medicare as we do. They have a track record of seeking to undermine it. It could be argued that some opposite actually want to destroy it, and let the market rip. 


Labor established Medicare. We built it, we maintained it and we will continue to protect it because we know how important it is. We value it. The Department of Veterans' Affairs fee schedule, known as the Repatriation Medical Fee Schedule, is linked to the Medicare Benefits Schedule and MBS rebates and, as a consequence of the ongoing Medicare freeze, as we heard from previous speakers, the DVA fee schedule has remained unchanged since 2014. 


The DVA rebate no longer covers the cost of medical treatment and, because veterans cannot be charged a gap payment, some medical and allied health professionals are refusing to treat DVA clients. This is having a serious impact. I know of medical doctors who no longer take DVA clients. I know of many veterans who have been directly affected. Today in the House, the member for Sturt reflected on today's date and the shocking attacks on the US on September 11, 2001. As the shadow defence minister did, I want to acknowledge all Australians who have served in Afghanistan. It continues to be a difficult environment in which to assist that nation to move forward. Even today, we still have members of our ADF there in uniform assisting.


I remember 15 years ago, just two years after those dreadful attacks on September 11, when I was working in security roles in Kandahar, which had been the previous headquarters of the Taliban. I was working alongside the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan and the US military. We were ensuring that the loya jirga elections for the constitutional convention, a very important step for Afghanistan moving forward, were held in a safe manner. When we talk about freedom, the work of not only members of our Defence Force but others who have served us with the Federal Police and with humanitarian organisations and done other security work has been incredibly important for helping that nation to secure freedom.


During that time we were being actively targeted by the Taliban, who had melted back into the community, including through car bomb and grenade attacks. So I understand a little bit about the effect that working in those sorts of environments can have on our people. I understand from my service, both in and out of uniform, in Timor-Leste the sorts of difficult situations that Australians have confronted, confront and will continue to confront, whether they are capacity building, ensuring security as members of ADF, or working as first responders or in other difficult roles, including responding with humanitarian relief to our brothers and sisters in times of crisis and difficult circumstances.


Over those 15 years I've seen many friends—in uniform and then out of uniform after their service—self-medicating. This has happened whilst I've also seen medical and health services withdrawn. It's difficult to reconcile this with the rhetoric of those opposite—the flag waving and the pins on the lapels, which I notice hardly any of the frontbench opposite decided to continue with, having been given that badge of patriotism. It's difficult to see them hiding behind the service of others to try to say that they've got credibility here. I acknowledge the work that the Department of Veterans' Affairs does. I acknowledge the work that veterans' affairs ministers have done. But you can't say that you're doing everything you can. You just can't, because there are veterans out there hurting. There are doctors who are no longer seeing DVA clients, and they're doing that for a reason. It's hard to see people who have served this country suffering. It's hard to see a government that's not doing what it can to alleviate that suffering by improving the opportunities that our current and former serving people have to get the care that they need. It's simple!


The Australian Medical Association says that almost 30 per cent of specialists are no longer committed to treating veterans. Only 44 per cent of specialists said that they will continue to see veterans if the freeze continues, with the remainder considering other ways to charge veterans. I'll repeat that: they are considering other ways to charge veterans. What this means is veterans are now starting to suffer from reduced access to medical services. That must be tough for those opposite who profess to want to have the best medical support for our people, or who have served themselves and profess to want their comrades in arms to have the best access to services possible. I don't just know this from my own observations over more than 15 years; I know this is the case because I listen to the veterans in my electorate, in Darwin and Palmerston. We're a strong defence city with a large veteran community.


Earlier this year I held a veterans forum in my electorate, where the shadow veterans' affairs minister, the member for Kingston, and I heard firsthand accounts of the concerns of many veterans and the difficulties they face in the transition to civilian life. The member for Kingston addressed that gathering and took note of the particular issues faced by veterans and their families in the Top End. We heard of the different levels of service for white card holders in different parts of the country. Veterans move around, Defence members move around and their families move around, but what doesn't move around, and what doesn't get lifted from them, is the cumulative effect of their service. They reflected to us those different levels of service as they've moved around the country. We were told by one veteran that, while he had received good access to services in Sydney, it was much more difficult to access counselling and psychological services when he moved to Darwin.


We heard at the forum that gold card services are increasingly being told by medical practitioners that their books are full, and they are being turned away. Clearly those opposite agree that that is unacceptable. There is a clear need to improve access for veterans to mental health services and to professionals who have an understanding of the particular concerns of ex-service men and women. We must make sure that everything is done to enable those professionals who have that experience base to assist our serving and ex-serving people.


I am acutely aware of the human cost of the effects of the Medicare freeze on veterans not only in my electorate but also across the country. I've seen it across the country. I've seen it overseas. I've seen our brothers and sisters who have served this country on the run, not able to access the support that they need when they need it. I'm the first to applaud the non-liability mental health initiative. I'm not going on some partisan rant here. We need to fix this so that the people who have served our country have the best possible service that they can have.


The Prime Ministerial Advisory Council on Veterans' Mental Health has said:


It would appear there is a limited, but perhaps increasing, number of medical specialists turning our veterans away once they become aware they are DVA clients. The Council understands the concern regarding accepting DVA clients stems from the fact that MBS fees have been frozen for many years.


I thought it helpful to put in a couple of these quotes. Those opposite, while they might not believe me, or agree with me, or think that my lived experience in seeing people who have served our country struggling and hearing their firsthand accounts about how they used to be able to see a certain health professional but then that health professional was no longer accepting DVA clients—if they don't accept that testimony—may well listen to others. The Veterans and Veterans Counselling Service National Advisory Committee has said:


The remuneration gap between seeing veterans versus private patients from the general community or Defence members is now so significant that clinical providers are prioritising other clients over DVA referrals. In some cases, providers are refusing to accept clients with DVA white or gold cards because of the poor remuneration offered.


As I said, I know doctors. I've talked to them and I've pleaded with some of them to continue to take DVA clients. It's a matter of life and death at times. It's a very important issue for our country, but, despite repeated attempts to raise this issue, the fee schedule continues to be out of step with what providers charge and it's resulting in veterans being turned away from services.


From where I stand, I think that Australians are right not to trust the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government with Medicare, and veterans can't trust the government to take care of their health needs until this issue is dealt with. I urge the government to take action on this issue and ensure veterans are not disadvantaged by their DVA healthcare cards and are able to access the services that they need. I know and other service people, such as first responders, know that those who have been in a difficult situation need the best possible health care that our country can give them. That's what they deserve. For DVA clients there is a way that the government can help, so do it.

Ms BRODTMANN
 (Canberra) (17:31):  I just want to commend that very powerful and passionate speech from my colleague, the member for Solomon, who has been an active advocate for veterans for many, many years, including before he came into politics. You can tell from the passion and the power of that speech that he really feels this. I really do want to commend him for that heartfelt speech, that powerful speech, that passionate speech, and also his commitment and constant advocacy for our veterans. I thank him so much. It was an honour to be in the chamber to hear it.


It is an honour to speak on the Veterans' Entitlement Amendment Bill 2018. It's long overdue, as many of my colleagues have said. I welcome the fact that the opposition has suggested an amendment—that, whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes with concern that the government has undermined veterans' access to health services. We heard from the member for Solomon and we heard from the member for Lingiari and we heard from so many of my colleagues, including the member for Eden-Monaro. Two out of three of those men have served our nation in the Australian Defence Force. One was a former minister for defence personnel and veterans' affairs. These are men with lots of personal experience, as well as experience learnt through conversations with veterans over decades and decades. As we heard from them, there are significant challenges facing the veterans community when it comes to health—not just physical health but also mental health.


Currently, as we know, DVA's fee schedule, known as the Repatriation Medical Fee Schedule, is linked to the Medicare Benefits Schedule and MBS rebates. As a consequence of the government's ongoing Medicare freeze, the Veterans' Affairs fee schedule has remained stagnant since 2014. This has led to the situation where the DVA rebate is no longer covering the cost of medical treatment and, because our veterans cannot be charged a gap payment, some medical and allied health professionals have had no choice but to turn DVA clients away. We've heard of the firsthand experiences that our members have had in terms of dealing with veterans who have been turned away. As the member for Solomon said, he's begged medical professionals and mental health professionals to take on these clients. He's begged them because they have been turned away.


What this means is that veterans are now starting to suffer from reduced access to medical services for their physical and mental health needs, and reduced access means veterans are less likely to see their medical specialists unless they fork out cash or their credit card, rather than using their DVA card. In other words, DVA white cards and gold cards are no longer a vet's rolled-gold access to specialist services, as specialists can't charge fees on the client's card. We're talking about access to services, such as psychologists and other allied health clinicians, being denied to these veterans because of the Medicare freeze. It is absolutely outrageous, which is why I commend my colleague the shadow minister for veterans' affairs for actually putting this amendment forward and those who have spoken about their direct experiences of what this actually means.


The undermining of veterans' access to health services by this government, by those opposite, stemming from that appalling 2014 budget, is having a significant impact on those who have proudly served our nation, who have given their all to defend our nation, to defend our national security, to help others in need. And how does this government repay them? I again commend my colleagues who have spoken on this bill and I also commend the shadow minister for veterans' affairs for moving this very, very important amendment.


In discussing the great work being done by the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, I just want to draw the House's attention to three major initiatives that she has introduced since she has taken on this portfolio. The first was announced just recently. The shadow minister announced that a Shorten Labor government, should it be elected, would put in place a formal agreement to ensure the nation's armed forces were fully supported during and after their service. We will legislate regular reporting to parliament on how Australia is supporting military personnel.


Labor, under a Shorten Labor government, should we be elected, will sign Australia's first military covenant, recognising the immense commitment our armed forces make to serve their country, to formalise our nation's commitment to look after those who have served for our nation. The covenant will be similar to the United Kingdom's Armed Forces Covenant, a principles document that promises that those who serve or have served in the armed forces and their families will be treated fairly. A Shorten Labor government, should we be elected, will work with the Australian Defence Force and Department of Veterans' Affairs and ex-service organisations to draft the relevant wording of a military covenant and associated legislation.


Labor would also, should we be elected, introduce legislation that would require future governments to report annually to parliament on how they are meeting their responsibilities to support our serving and ex-service personnel so that it doesn't slip under the radar. It is vitally important that we continue to discuss improving transparency and improving accountability to ensure that we are providing the best service for our veterans and the best service for our serving personnel so that there are no blind spots and so that those gaps are addressed.


I also want to draw attention to another initiative that my colleague announced—last year, actually, but it again highlights the fact that she has been very active in this space, and I applaud her for that. It's not just veterans that we are talking about here and it is not just current serving members, men and women, that we are talking about here; we are also talking about the families. You know, Deputy Speaker Hastie—you've served—that it is not just the serving member who does it tough, who faces a number of challenges; it is also the families who are there supporting them. When you're off serving your nation in Afghanistan, with your family at home not knowing where you are and whether you're okay, it does place an enormous strain on families back home who are trying to provide the most support possible to you. So I was delighted that my colleague, the shadow minister, also said that should a Shorten Labor government be elected we would develop a family engagement and support strategy for defence personnel and veterans to provide greater support to our military families. They play a pivotal role in supporting our current serving ADF men and women and our veterans, and it's important that we ensure that we give them the support they need to address the unique challenges of military family life. 


I want to focus on the initiative that was launched by my colleague, the member for Eden-Monaro, the shadow minister and myself in March this year. It is a comprehensive veterans package, a veterans employment policy, that we committed $121 million to, should we be elected, to provide greater support to our defence personnel as they transition to civilian life. The figures are quite staggering. You would probably be aware of them, Deputy Speaker Hastie, but best estimates cite that veterans' unemployment is currently sitting at 30 per cent. Thirty per cent of our veterans, those who have served our nation, are unemployed. And, for those who did not medically discharge, there is an estimated 11.2 per cent unemployment rate, which is more than double the national average. This is absolutely unacceptable.


That is why this employment policy is well overdue and very, very welcome. And it comes from opposition. I will very quickly run through and translate the policy. It ensures that veterans receive recognition of prior skills and experience within civilian professional organisations and institutions. It ensures that eligible businesses will be provided with a training grant of up to $5,000 in order to help veterans gain the skills and experience they need to move into a civilian job. It will establish an employment and transition service that provides greater individualised, tailored support to transitioning veterans over a longer period of time. There is a range of initiatives in this employment package. Again I commend my colleague, the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, for the extensive consultation she did in developing this strategy and for coming up with such a comprehensive policy, which addresses so many of those areas that are currently being overlooked. 


Finally, I want to focus on two events that I went to recently that commemorated and honoured the veterans who have served our nation and also those who have made the ultimate sacrifice. Just last Friday I joined the new foreign minister, the former defence minister, for the commemoration of the National Service Memorial at the National Service Memorial Day at the Australian War Memorial. Thousands of Australian men undertook national service in the 1950s, 1960s and early 1970s, and that was commemorated last Friday. My father did national service in the 1950s. A lot of Australians tend to overlook the scale of national service in this country. Between 1951 and 1959, 18-year-old men were required to register for national service, and over 220,000 underwent six months of compulsory military training in the Navy, Army or Air Force. The exact figure is actually 227,000. At the event on the national service day on Friday we had an opportunity to commemorate those, including those who made the ultimate sacrifice in their national service.


We also had the opportunity to honour the fact that one of the national servicemen, Allen May, donated his medals to the Australian War Memorial. It was a very, very special moment. Mr May was 21 when he was conscripted in 1965 to Vietnam. After arriving in Vietnam, he became a forward scout. Historians believe he fired the first shots in what became known as the Battle of Long Tan. It was a beautiful gesture to present those medals to the War Memorial. They will be a constant reminder to all of us here in Australia and to anyone who visits the Australian War Memorial of the significant contribution that our national servicemen made to our nation over all that period of time, and a constant reminder of those who, in national service, made the ultimate sacrifice. I don't know whether many Australians really understand the scale of the national servicemen who served for that very, very lengthy period of time. It was an honour to be there at that very special memorial, which is nearly 10 years old, alongside the War Memorial with national service veterans. There were some veterans from Canberra and there were some veterans who had travelled from all over the country. It was a great honour to be with them to commemorate their service and to honour their mates who didn't make it home.

"Dick, Milton, MP",ALP,2018-09-11,"



Mr DICK
 (Oxley) (17:46):  I rise to enter the debate tonight on the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2018 and also to strongly support the second reading amendment moved by the shadow minister. I just want to touch on the issue the member for Canberra—who has been a passionate and fierce advocate for Defence Force families and men and women serving in the ADF—raised in the debate tonight about national servicemen. In my electorate of Oxley there is what we call one of the headquarters for national servicemen, the Wacol Barracks. That was a significant area, used during the war and also postwar, where many young men provided great service to our nation. I actually met with the National Servicemen's Association from Queensland two weeks ago. They are on a mission to build a memorial at Wacol for those 'nashos' who lost their lives during service. There isn't a lot of recognition for those men who, through accidents and through incidents, were killed during their national service.


Tonight, in the House of Representatives, I place on record my thanks to, particularly, those great men who gave outstanding service and, in some ways, who've not been fully recognised as part of the nashos. I know, by talking to their leadership in Queensland, just how passionate and dedicated they are to honouring and remembering their comrades, those brave men, that served Australia but haven't yet been recognised. Tonight, I place on record that I will be doing what I can. They want to have a memorial erected for next year. Wacol is a wonderful community. It was the site of a couple of things: great army barracks and, later, through the fifties, sixties and seventies, a migrant processing camp, where the second-largest number of migrants were processed in Australia. That happened in the south-west suburbs of Brisbane. They are very historic suburbs, but, in some ways, they are suburbs that have great military connection to our country.


As the member for Oxley, I want to take the opportunity tonight to place on record my support for this bill. It is a minor amendment, but it is an important amendment that we will be dealing with tonight. We've heard speakers from both sides of the chamber recognising the great service to our nation of those who have served in the ADF, and service to one's country is nothing short of selfless. When a person makes this commitment, we as a nation must in turn undertake a commitment to support that individual and their family both during and after their service.


Tonight's bill amends the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 in relation to how the Department of Veterans' Affairs administers bereavement payments. We know these amendments result in no changes to current entitlements to bereavement payments, but rather insert a new section to the VEA that was omitted in amendments in 1996. We know that the section was inadvertently removed in the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment (Budget Measures 1995-96) Bill (No. 2) 1995 and provides the legislative power for DVA to reduce bereavement payments where an overpayment has occurred. So DVA already has the legal authority to provide the bereavement payment and to recover any overpayment of income support pensions paid to veterans after their death.


The process has been in place since the 1980s, but, as I said, the legislation provision was inadvertently removed in 1996. We need to do this to make sure that this issue is resolved. We know that the passing of a loved one is particularly difficult and, when this occurs, it is entirely understandable that the need to notify the relevant government departments is not always prominent. This means that until the DVA is notified, the veteran will continue to receive payments after their death. This results in an overpayment to the partner.


I support this bill tonight, as does the Labor opposition, and as our shadow minister has outlined, in the attempt to deal with the situation while, of course, respecting and placing the wellbeing of veterans' families at the forefront of policymaking. I'm happy to place on record my support for the bill, but I'm also happy tonight to address the shadow minister's amendment, which reads:


""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House notes with concern that the Government has undermined veterans' access to health services"".


I want to touch on this because I know from representing members of the ADF and talking to members who have served that they are feeling short-changed by the fact that the frozen Medicare rebates have included allied health services. This is a throwback to the disastrous 2014 Abbott budget. We know there has not been any indexation of Medicare rebates since 2014 and, as a result, no corresponding increase in the DVA rebate paid to health professionals helping our veterans. I want to be very clear that this is a serious issue. This is a serious issue that means some of our veterans are not getting, in my opinion, the health care that they deserve.


A number of submissions to the Productivity Commission's inquiry into compensation and rehab for veterans have seen stakeholders critical of this very key impact. I want to read into the Hansard tonight, and reiterate my support for some of these submissions, what the Prime Ministerial Advisory Council on Veterans' Mental Health said in their submission. They said:


It would appear there is a limited, but perhaps increasing, number of medical specialists turning our veterans away once they become aware they are DVA clients. The Council understands the concern regarding accepting DVA clients stems from the fact that MBS fees have been frozen for many years.


The Department of Veterans' Affairs have conceded that there are serious issues with this freeze, with the Veterans and Veterans Counselling Service National Advisory Committee in their submission saying:


The remuneration gap between seeing veterans versus private patients from the general community or Defence members is now so significant that clinical providers are prioritising other clients over DVA referrals. In some cases, providers are refusing to accept clients with DVA white or gold cards because of the poor remuneration offered.


These concerns are confirmed and backed in by the Australian Medical Association. They announced over 18 months ago a survey of their members which found that almost 30 per cent of clinicians are no longer committed to treating veterans and are turning them away and that only 44 per cent of respondents would continue seeing veterans if the freeze continues.


As I said, this is a serious issue that I don't think the government is addressing in any way, shape or form. I don't think it is hearing the message from those people being impacted by this or from experts in the field—from the AMA or from Occupational Therapy Australia, which said:


While the Department of Veterans' Affairs … may report no decline in the total number of occupational therapists treating veterans, OTA is aware of the changing make-up of that number and the potential repercussions of this change.


The issue was also raised in the Senate inquiry into suicide by veterans and ex-service personnel by a number of submitters, including Dr Katelyn Kerr from the Australian Institute for Suicide Research and Prevention. In Dr Kerr's submission, she writes:


However, DVA fees are significantly lower, and there has been a fee freeze for psychologists since 2014, creating a disincentive for experienced and skilled clinicians to see veterans. If DVA would match the fee schedule provided by Medibank Health Solutions or that recommended by the APS, this would increase the number of psychologists willing to see veterans and would increase the delivery of gold-standard interventions which have high success rates in treating mental disorders. 


From 1 July 2017 to 23 May this year, DVA had received 8,331 applications for nonliability health care. While not all applications were for mental health treatment, we could expect the majority were seeking treatment for mental health conditions. According to the DVA's 2016-17 annual report, DVA currently services 165,071 veterans. Of course, this number is not reflective of all the veterans in Australia as DVA only track those who are current clients.


You can see from the evidence provided and from what the community is saying—I just want to put on the record tonight that I think the government has been way too slow in acting on this. That's why we're seeking tonight to put that amendment on the agenda: because our veterans deserve that. When the vote comes tonight, we have an opportunity to send a very clear message that this House notes with concern that the way that the government have been dragged kicking and screaming on the issue on frozen rebates is having a major impact on the veterans community.


I want to briefly touch on—I think of the member for Canberra and the particular work that she's done in the area alongside our defence team of the shadow minister for defence, the member for Corio, and the shadow minister for veterans' affairs—the significant announcement for the veterans community which we saw last week in Townsville. I saw some media reports about that announcement. I understand that the announcement was well received by the veterans community. If we are to be successful at the next election and if we are to be in government, Labor's vow to ADF personnel will be set in stone. In the future, if we are successful, a Shorten Labor government will put in place a formal agreement to ensure the nation's armed forces are fully supported during and after their service. It will be legislated with regular reporting to Australia on how Australia is supporting military personnel. I think that's an official promise that, hopefully, both sides of politics will deliver. I was delighted to see that the LNP in Queensland have matched that commitment.


Once again, we've seen the quality of a future Shorten Labor government, if we are successful, in making that firm commitment alongside the shadow minister for veterans affairs. It was only a short while ago that we saw the relevant portfolio elevated to cabinet, and I congratulate the Leader of the Opposition for ensuring that veterans are given that strong voice at the cabinet table. And they can have no stronger voice than the shadow minister, who, I know, has been travelling the country, meeting with veterans' groups, meeting with our Defence Force personnel, to make sure that she hears and understands, and that's why you saw good policy announced in Townsville last week with the member for Herbert, the Leader of the Opposition and the shadow minister.


I very much look forward to giving, if Labor were privileged to be in government, that commitment to make sure that we not only honour but, importantly, deliver on the commitments to those men and women who've served our great nation. With those few remarks, I commend the bill to the House and thank the minister and the shadow minister for the constructive way they have handled this debate tonight.

"Broad, Andrew, MP",Nats,2018-09-11,"



Mr BROAD
 (Mallee—Assistant Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister) (18:01):  I too want to talk about the Veterans’ Entitlements Amendment Bill 2018 and about the importance of standing by veterans. Having not had that privilege of serving, I do want to pay tribute to people who have served, and of course Deputy Speaker Hastie would be aware of that. The Veterans Entitlements Amendment Bill 2018 was introduced into the House of Representatives on 22 August 2018. It reinstates an inadvertently removed provision to offset pension overpayment from bereavement payments in one streamlined transaction. Essentially, we want to stand by veterans and their families in the event of a bereavement to make it easier for people. People who have served our country are people we should be proud of. We spend a lot of time talking about the 102,000 Australians who have been killed in conflict. We probably don't spend quite enough time honouring those who have served and who, as a result of their service, have gone through some difficult times upon their returning.


I'm keen to add, while talking about this bill, an idea that's been put forward in my patch around assisting veterans upon their return. I live in a rural electorate. My electorate is 36 per cent of the state of Victoria, is an agricultural electorate and was historically set up by soldier settlements. Those soldier settlements were established after the First World War and also after the Second World War to stand by and to give opportunity to people who were returning from service, people who were sometimes traumatised. In those days, they didn't know fully about things such as post-traumatic stress syndrome. It saddens me to go to the cemetery and see the graves of young men who returned and who took their lives as a result of post-traumatic stress syndrome after the First World War and Second World War. 


A Vietnam veteran came to me, a guy by the name of Ian Hastings, a grain grower, involved with farming systems. He is keen to take those who have served and see how they could be incorporated into the grain industry. One of the great things about working in the Australian grain industry is that they do get to drive big machines—harvesters, boon sprays—and use GPS technology. They are struggling to find people to work in those industries in more remote areas. And the idea has been put forward to me that we could once again, in some regards, have a soldier settlement scheme, taking people who are returning from their service, who are looking for gainful employment and incorporate them into those rural communities in rural Australia, particularly in our agriculture industry.


This would be a bipartisan position held across this parliament but I don't think we collectively are doing enough for our veterans. We are probably not standing by the people who have stood by Australia as fully as we should. When it comes to people who have served, we really should honour them in a greater sense. One of the great privileges as a member of parliament is the ability to do a military exchange. I know one of the members in the chamber here came with me at the start of last year to Afghanistan to see what our serving men and women serving were doing over there. What struck me was the calibre of the people we met.


Interestingly enough, as members of parliament we had to wear KingGee clothing. We don't get to wear uniform when we go over there. When I was sitting there in the mess hall having breakfast, one of the members of the Defence Force said to me, 'Who are you blokes?' I said, 'We're members of parliament.' And he goes, 'Oh, I thought you looked like a Jim's Mowing team.' He was very impressed that members of parliament would come over and see our serving troops. One of the questions I asked these people who were serving was how they are with their family time and what support services there are for their family. The very nature of the work and the hours, particularly with the difference in travel time, meant that those people weren't able to have contact with their families. So not only are they not as supported as they could be whilst serving; we also need to support them more fully upon their return.


The beauty of this bill is to try to address a small misdemeanour, essentially saying that, if someone has been overpaid but has also passed away, that can be rolled into one. I think it is important that we do more in this space. There are some great organisations, such as Soldier On and our traditional RSLs. I recently met with our RSL in Mildura. It was encouraging to me to see that a new generation of RSL were coming through. There was a guy there who was a young former soldier, and he was very active in the RSL and talking to our young children, particularly in our primary schools.


One of the things that I do want to raise—and something that still gripes me—is the book work and recording around veterans. I was approached by a young lady of 28 who lived in Donald, Victoria, in my electorate. Her husband, who was a similar age, had served two terms in Afghanistan. He was driving a water truck for the local council, but he needed a knee reconstruction. Unfortunately, he couldn't prove through records of the time of his service that the knee had been damaged in service. I've got to say, from the small time I spent in Afghanistan on that military exchange, walking around with the body armour on, it was pretty evident to me that would have had an impact on his knee. The knee reconstruction was going to cost $4,000. He was having difficulty, as a dad with two kids and a wife, having to climb up and down on a water truck for the council—and we wouldn't pay the $4,000.


I think that's to our shame. I think that's something where there really should have been no argument, and I would have thought that our department would put less of an onus on proof and have more of a fair-go type of attitude to that sort of situation. That's something I wanted to put on the record. I would like to see a more open attitude, I guess, towards supporting people who may have an injury as a result of their military service. To my way of thinking, that injury was a result of his military service. Deputy Speaker Hastie, you would of course be able to make more of a judgement call as to whether something like that would be a result of his military service. But, even if it wasn't, my view is that $4,000 for someone who has served our country so that they can get their leg patched up and so they can continue working is a pretty good investment, and we should have just covered it.


There are now over 30,000 soldiers who have returned from our Afghanistan engagement and the conflict in the Middle East region. That's quite a lot. We should be proud of them. Their service should be recognised on the memorials in our country towns. We march every year on Anzac Day to remember those who have served. I would like to see the names on those memorials updated to include not only those who have given their life but also those who have served. I think that's something we should encourage.


There's another thing I'm also keen to see. We have suburbs in new parts of our cities. If you look across the Wimmera Mallee you will see the memorials in the country towns, because of course in the First World War and the Second World War those towns were where the people were. But I believe we should also have new memorials, with the names of those who have served in Afghanistan, in the suburbs of cities. I think that's a challenge for our local councils in our new suburbs, that they should consider putting up memorials for those who have served in our Afghanistan conflict. It would be a great opportunity.


I commend this bill and I'm happy to have had a few moments to talk about the service of our Australian troops. I believe there is a lot of merit, particularly, in getting those country communities to welcome back and use the troops in their agricultural field. I will continue to talk about that with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. I'm pleased that we are standing by those who have given so much for our country.

"Chester, Darren, MP",Nats,2018-09-11,"



Mr CHESTER
 (Gippsland—Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Minister for Defence Personnel, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Centenary of ANZAC and Deputy Leader of the House) (18:11):  In summing up I would like to thank all members who contributed to the debate on this bill, the Veterans' Entitlements Amendment Bill 2018. I would like to acknowledge the continued tradition of bipartisan support for the veteran community demonstrated by the opposition. The importance of family and the support they provide to both our serving personnel and veterans cannot be overestimated. Just moments ago the shadow minister and myself were joined by the opposition leader, the Prime Minister, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the shadow minister for foreign affairs at the Australian War Memorial, where we paid our respects to women who have served and women who have supported their loved ones who served at a very moving Last Post service conducted by Dr Brendan Nelson. It was a very fitting tribute, and it was good to see such a large crowd gathered for that event.


The bill before the House relates to how the Department of Veterans' Affairs administers bereavement payments. The government is committed to supporting veterans and their families. This bill will maintain the current practice for families when a beloved member dies. There are no changes to current entitlements for bereavement payment—they will remain exactly the same. This is a compassionate, sympathetic and unobtrusive response which avoids disturbing the family with additional interactions with the Department of Veterans' Affairs while they are grieving. When a veteran receiving a DVA income support payment dies, the surviving partner is entitled to a bereavement payment equivalent to 14 weeks of the veteran's income support payment. The bereavement payment is designed to assist the surviving partner with costs following the death of the partner and to provide a period to adjust their finances following the end of the deceased partner's payments. It is paid automatically once the family notifies DVA. Often the veteran will continue to receive payments after their death, as these payments continue until DVA has been notified. This results in an overpayment. This bill ensures the adjustment is made in a single administrative process, rather than through a number of formal debt recoveries. It avoids the need to recover debts from the deceased estate and it avoids disturbing the family during the grieving period. The bill will provide legislative certainty for past and future recoveries of pension overpayments from bereavement payment and will maintain the current discreet practice to respect the veterans' families mourning their loss.


I note the opposition's comments regarding veterans' access to health services more broadly across the nation. While I appreciate that there's been occasional commentary regarding health providers who don't accept DVA fees, I assure the House that this is not a systemwide problem. In Australia healthcare providers in private practice are free to choose how to run their business, including their opening hours, how much they'll charge and who they'll see. This of course includes whether or not to provide treatment under DVA's arrangements. As I told the House today, every year health providers across this country provide over 9.5 million medical and dental services to veterans and families. As a nation we can be rightly proud of the more than $11 billion provided by Australian taxpayers to support in the order of 290,000 veterans and their families.


While we occasionally hear anecdotal reports of issues with access or fees, the proportion of clients accessing health services who complained about these issues is very low—only 0.1 per cent in the last DVA annual report. Of course if a veteran does experience difficulties accessing services, DVA will identify alternative arrangements to ensure a veteran's care is maintained. This could include providing transport to alternative health providers or, where there is a specific clinical need, funding services above the DVA rate. DVA medical and allied health fees continue to represent the full payment to healthcare providers and are significantly higher than the fees payable under the Medicare scheme. The government is progressively reintroducing fee indexation for DVA medical and allied health services from 2017-18 and, as of 1 July this year, indexation has been reintroduced for GP attendances, bulk-billing incentives, specialist attendances and DVA's dental and allied health services. This has only been possible due to the strong economic management of the coalition government.


In conclusion, I again thank members opposite and those on this side of the chamber for their support for the Veterans' Entitlement Amendment Bill 2018. As a nation, we are rightly proud of the service provided by our men and women in uniform. It is a matter of fact, Mr Deputy Speaker Hastie—and you, as someone who has served, would know this more than others—that in the order of 80,000 to 85,000 Australians put on the uniform and serve in the permanent or reserve ADF. For those of us who haven't put on the uniform and don't serve in that capacity, as a grateful nation we are indebted to those who serve. Our task is to make sure they are supported while they are serving but also once their service ends. The transition from the Australian Defence Force to civilian life is not always easy. In your case, Deputy Speaker Hastie, it's a quite unusual path that you've chosen to take in joining us here in the House of Representatives. But I congratulate you on your own service but also for the path you've taken in transition.


As a government, we are keen to work across party political lines to ensure that the veterans and their families are well supported both now and into the future. I've had many briefings with the shadow minister and appreciated her forthright input into policy development, and I'm sure I'll get more of that forthright input in the weeks and months ahead. In that spirit of bipartisanship, I must stress that many members, from both sides of the House, come to me raising issues on specific areas of concern for veterans and, wherever possible, I will work constructively to make sure we get an outcome which is in the interests of the veterans and their families. I commend this bill.




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Hastie

The SPEAKER:  The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this, the honourable member for Kingston has moved as an amendment that all words after 'that' be omitted with a view to substituting other words. So the immediate question before the House is that the amendment moved by the member for Kingston be agreed to.

Ms CATHERINE KING
 (Ballarat) (18:29):  It is with pleasure that I rise to speak on the Tobacco Plain Packaging Amendment Bill 2018. Labor has a proud record when it comes to tobacco control. Worldwide, tobacco is the leading cause of preventable death and kills at least five million people a year. In Australia, smoking kills between 15,000 and 20,000 people every single year. The economic and social cost of smoking is estimated at $31.5 billion a year. By any measure, and despite all of the progress we have achieved over many decades, it remains a massive public health issue. It is an issue that requires political leadership and eternal vigilance.


Labor has shown consistent leadership on this issue, even when it has been politically very difficult to achieve. We've stood up to big tobacco, despite their formidable resources and significant campaign abilities. Despite their willingness to use dirty tricks to take legal action, we took them on. It was Labor that introduced and fought for the world-leading plain packaging legislation that, alongside other policies, has helped to drive smoking rates in this country to record lows. We are very proud that many other countries across the world have followed suit.


This legislation before us today makes some minor technical changes to Labor's laws, and we will, of course, support it. Put simply, the amendments expand the range of people who can be authorised to undertake plain-packaging compliance activities. There will be no objection from us on that. But we do know that, deep down, many on the other side would actually like to tear up this legislation altogether. On this, as on so many other things, they are divided. Despite the clear evidence that our legislation for plain packaging has worked and has clearly saved lives, many on the other side still think that this is 'nanny state' policy. It shows that they don't understand public health policy or evidence based health policy. But, as we know, that is what the Liberals and the Nationals so often do; they put big business before the wellbeing of the Australian people.


Let's talk about how successful not just this policy but also tobacco mitigation policies have been. We introduced plain packaging for tobacco in December 2012 to help Australians quit smoking. Under the laws, tobacco products have no branding and feature health warnings with graphic images. It works by reducing the appeal and brand identification of smoking, particularly for young people.


In 2016 the Commonwealth's post-implementation review of Labor's laws found:


… plain packaging is achieving its aim of improving public health in Australia and is expected to have substantial public health outcomes into the future.


In the three years after our laws came into effect, total tobacco consumption rates fell by 18.3 per cent. Not all of this decline was due to plain packaging, of course, but some of it definitely was. The report said:


… the 2012 packaging changes resulted in a ""statistically significant decline in smoking prevalence …


We never sought to claim that plain packaging was a silver bullet. It was always meant to be one of a suite of measures necessary to continue to drive down smoking rates. It reflected the removal of the last form of advertising for tobacco, in line with the World Health Organization's tobacco convention, to which we are a signatory.


The British Medical Journal stated:


The evidence suggests that plain packaging is severely restricting the ability of the pack to communicate and create appeal with young people and adults.


One of the world's most respected medical journals declared Labor's world-leading plain-packaging laws to be a casebook example of effective tobacco control.


A report led by the ANU last year also confirmed that plain packaging had helped many smokers to quit. It led to a decline in the way that smokers identified with their brand, resulting in a reduction in smoking and an increase in the number of smoker attempts to quit the habit. We know that the more attempts people make to quit, the more likely they are to actually quit. It led to a decline in the way smokers identify their brand. The ANU found that, during the phase-in of the reforms, calls to quit smoking helplines increased by up to 78 per cent and were above average for about 10 months after the reforms began. 


Studies have shown plain packaging has had a particular impact in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities as well. Smoking contributes to one in five Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander deaths. Public health researchers found Indigenous people were better informed about the risks of smoking as a result of the policy. Before the policy's introduction, they were significantly more likely to mistakenly think that some brands of cigarettes were less harmful than others. The World Health Organization is calling on all countries in the world to follow Australia's lead and to introduce plain packaging. The countries that have already done so include France, the United Kingdom and Ireland. Many countries will undoubtedly follow.


The Heart Foundation said that tobacco plain packaging had contributed to around 25 per cent of the total decline in the prevalence of smoking since it was introduced in 2012. That's tens of thousands of people quitting thanks to the Labor Party's efforts. Crucially, we've seen adolescent smoking rates drop to a record low. The tobacco industry tried to fight it, taking Australia all the way to the WTO to try and kill off these reforms. They failed, of course, but the fact that they tried might be the best evidence anyone needs that our policy was the right one and that our policy was, in fact, effective; otherwise, why would these companies have attempted to kill it off?


Thanks in part to Labor's groundbreaking policy work, the prevalence of daily smoking in Australia is now at just 12 per cent and continuing to decline. That is a good public health achievement. However, it has to be said that the rate of the decline has unfortunately slowed. That's because, for the last five years, we have had a government that has done nothing about tobacco control. No single measure will drive rates of smoking down forever. As one prominent public health expert noted recently, each new measure magnifies the effects of what has gone before but only if action is continually reinforced and properly resourced.


Tobacco control is one of Australia's best public health successes, but there is absolutely no room for complacency. That's because big tobacco companies are relentless. They never stop. They're always looking for new ways to hook new customers, even while they're publicly claiming that they're cleaning up their business—or even making plans to get out of smoking altogether—particularly in the guise of harm minimisation. They are morally bankrupt and cannot be believed. Here at home, they are still lobbying and using front groups. They are still using astroturfing campaigns. They are still walking the corridors of this place, taking any opportunity they can to meet with and influence members here; they do not meet with me. They're more likely than ever to use litigation to fight public health measures against governments and against other public institutions like universities. They are still buying and co-opting some so-called health experts. They're still trying to buy off journalists with expensive junkets and with hospitality. Overseas, in many less-developed and less-regulated markets, they are still advertising and selling their products with total immunity, even to primary school children. They are ruthless.


But, wherever you look, this government has zero credibility when it comes to tackling smoking related deaths. For five years, they have been absolutely missing in action. As Professor Mike Daube from Curtin University wrote recently:


For those who worked long and hard to make Australia a world leader in tobacco control, it is deeply disappointing that political complacency in recent years has both led to lack of action and allowed distractions to dominate the public and policy arenas.


He goes on:


We should have reinforced and capitalised on the early impact of plain packaging and reinforced the impacts of tax increases … but action over the past 6 years has stalled, at a time when it should have accelerated. … … …


First, crucially and inexplicably, there have been no national media campaigns since 2012. The federal government gets more than $11 billion a year in revenue from tobacco taxes. Spending $40 million on media campaigns would be less than 0.4% of this.


That is correct. For its entire time in office, this government has not bothered to launch any antitobacco campaigns, even though we know they are highly successful. We all remember the many successful campaigns, like, 'Every cigarette is doing you damage.' All of those campaigns have actually had a significant impact. There has not been one in the term of this government. We need more major, hard-hitting media campaigns, one of the most effective weapons that we have in our arsenal.


Professor Daube goes on to point out that over the last five years there has been a complete absence of new evidence-based measures to tackle smoking—nothing at all. He also talks about how there have been no curbs on tobacco industry efforts to influence public policy. He mentions lobbying and, of course, political donations. It's now been 14 years since Labor announced we would no longer take political donations from Big Tobacco. It took nearly 10 years for the Liberals to match us on that. But, shamefully, the National Party still have not done the right thing and ceased taking donations from Big Tobacco. As recently as last year, they took $15,700 from Big Tobacco companies. That is disgraceful.


The Prime Minister needs to explain why he thinks it's okay that his coalition partners can fill their coffers with money from companies that profit from putting Australians in coffins. How can he in good conscience keep a Nationals senator with responsibility for rural health while her party is happy to accept this blood money? People in rural and remote areas of Australia are twice as likely to be daily smokers as those in the cities, meaning the burden of disease falls most heavily on our rural Australians. If the Nationals really cared about the health of people in the bush they would reject these donations outright.


Malcolm Turnbull has gone from this place now, but he never explained his failure to divest from three share market funds that invest in tobacco. It was important that he did so. Again, I think it's important that we absolutely back in the work of people like Bronwyn King, a wonderful woman who I think is in the parliament at the moment. She has been doing fantastic work in getting superannuation portfolios to divest themselves of tobacco shares. She has slowly taken that work across Australia, and there are more and more super funds that are divesting themselves of tobacco shares. She has now taken that effort globally. Under her terrific leadership and the work that she has done, there will soon be very few superannuation funds left that will invest in tobacco at all. This is another example of the great work of public health people. Bronwyn is an oncologist who took the decision to leave her oncology in order to pursue that particular work.


The coalition, frankly, have done very little. While they've taken their eye off the ball, tobacco companies have been coming up with new ways to advertise and hook our children on these deadly products. Just last week we saw a series of reports about how tobacco companies are using social media influencers to advertise cigarettes, circumventing our strict anti-advertising laws. Our antismoking advertising laws threaten companies with fines of up to $126,000 if they advertise their products. But thanks to this social media loophole they can do it with virtual impunity. They're using the same marketing playbook they have always used to attract kids and teens to their products. It is insidious and something needs to be done about it. There are glamorous ads of attractive people in exotic locations sucking back on cigarettes on Instagram, a platform that reaches millions of people worldwide with virtually no regulation. They use celebrities and models and seek to associate smoking with fast cars, yachts, fancy clothes and expensive champagne. It is exactly the sort of thing previous generations of policymakers fought to outlaw and, unfortunately, in this medium it is making a comeback. Tobacco control experts have called these campaigns the greatest threat to how young people perceive tobacco products today. They say the tobacco companies are targeting young people in at least 40 countries, including here in Australia. Researchers say those campaigns generated over 25 billion views by individuals. Twenty-five billion views is a serious problem. Sadly, you can't rely on this government to do anything. Only Labor takes these issues of tobacco control seriously.


The big tobacco companies have also been trying to push new nicotine vaping and e-cigarette products onto the market. They try to claim it is some sort of public good and they are contributing to cessation. In fact, they're using every tactic they can to try and push to market more addictive products that have not been properly studied for their long-term health effects. The most authoritative report on this issue, from the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, concluded that the evidence for cessation benefits is limited and the evidence for concern about their impact is, in fact, substantial. Let's be clear: the tobacco companies see that the writing is on the wall for their industry, so they are trying to diversify in order to survive, but they don't care the slightest bit about the health or wellbeing of a single one of their customers. Big tobacco has long sought to use new alternative products in a bid to renormalise their industry, and no-one in this place should fall for it.


This job is not over. We absolutely need to do more. We need more evidence based activity and policies to maintain the momentum of the tobacco fight. The tobacco companies will not rest, so we, as a parliament, need to not rest either. The Liberals should restore Australia's global leadership on this issue. They should restore funding that they cut from important Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander smoking cessation programs. They should engage in a national advertising campaign to ensure that smoking rates fall again. They need to vigorously pursue any other forms of advertising for tobacco that have emerged since we were able to remove the last form—the actual pack—with plain packaging. They need to make sure that the National Tobacco Strategy is now not just a document that sits on a shelf, but is, in fact, reinvigorated. The Liberals should restore Australia's global leadership on this issue. If they don't, Labor certainly will. To this end, I move the second reading amendment that has been circulated in my name:


That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:


""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House:


(1) notes that progress on lowering smoking rates has stalled following the Government's cuts to tobacco control measures; and


(2) calls on the Government to re-invest in lowering smoking rates"".

"Wilson, Tim, MP",LP,2018-09-11,"



Mr TIM WILSON
 (Goldstein) (18:48):  If you are concerned about the stabilisation of tobacco cessation, you really should look at why—why it is that life-long smokers struggle to get off such an insidious product and why it is that they are addicted. You should also ask: what are the alternatives? This is where the false outrage of the member for Ballarat falls short, because, in the end, she already rules out and discounts alternatives that can help people to reduce their consumption, to engage in harm minimisation and, in the context, improve their health overall. I will remind other members of the choices that people have.


At the moment, if you are addicted to nicotine and you smoke tobacco products, your choice is to continue smoking or to give up, and, yes, there are some cessation aids, but they do not work for everyone. And yet there are harm minimisation pathways denied by those on both sides of the chamber—of which I am not one. In the end, having sat on committees inquiring into the legal access towards vaping, I cannot, in good conscience, oppose legalisation—my view has been on the public record, so this is not new—even more so after I went to the UK on a parliamentary delegation and met with officials from the National Health Service, who took a similar view to me. That's because what they saw was, amongst many of their patient groups, particularly in parts of Manchester, people who simply couldn't quit, and they saw the consequences, the harm and the damage that was done to people's health from enduring tobacco consumption.


They then looked at the alternatives and said that vaping provided a harm minimisation pathway that they could not ignore. When it was raised with them, 'Should Australia follow the same pathway,' of course they rightly said it was up to us, but they acknowledged that it was enormously beneficial to the people they were there to serve. That is my view, and it is a view I am very comfortable expressing in public because what we know, as somebody who had three out of their four grandparents die prematurely as a consequence of tobacco consumption, is that tobacco causes enormous harm. Tobacco is responsible for tremendous damage to the lives of Australians, our community and, if you want to count it up in dollars and cents, our economy as well. Of Australians aged 14 years or older, 12.8 per cent still smoke daily. Every year smoking kills or is a contributing factor to an estimated 19,000 Australian deaths. And, in addition to the morbidity and mortality, $31.5 billion is drained from the economy annually for something that provides, let's say, little benefit beyond the choices that people have.


This bill appropriately allows more flexibility to noncompliance with the tobacco plain-packaging legislation, and any improvements that allow for the adherence, respect and implementation of the rule of law as a principle, I will always support. But we also should take account of our obligation to the Australian people seriously and have effective policy measures to combat smoking rates, as I addressed at the start of my speech. With this in mind, we do have to look seriously at the efficacy of plain packaging from 2013 to 2016. Let's remember what happened: the Gillard government introduced plain packaging and contestably there was an influence on smoking rates, so they banged a massive tax on top of it to make sure the rates went down—I never disputed that increasing taxes can have an influence on reducing smoking rates. But even then, from 2013 to 2016, Australia's smoking rate fell by a dismal 0.6 per cent despite an increase in tobacco excise and the introduction of plain packaging. Expenditure on cigarettes increased in Australia while smoking rates sharply declined in the United States and in the United Kingdom.


Plain packaging has failed to reduce smoking significantly. Instead, what it has actually done, and this is the bit that the opposition never likes to pay attention to, is it has driven tobacco sales underground, because this is what the policy actually does. It takes a product with a brand and makes it generic, and then, as the tax rates increase, the consumer surplus goes up, so the cost increases, and it is a generic product.


So what happens? Criminal gangs move in. They, not just the tobacco companies, see the economic benefit and the potential to take advantage of Australians who are addicted—and some who aren't, to get them there—and to make huge profits. Those profits are then used not just to deny the taxpayer the money they need to deal with the consequences of tobacco consumption—the costs that are passed through to the health system—but also of course to fund and finance their nefarious agenda. So, rather than looking at this policy simply on the basis of its intent, perhaps we should look also at its consequences.


As branding has been lost, competition now focuses predominantly on price, boosting sales of cheaper products. KPMG has found that illicit tobacco consumption has grown from 11.5 per cent to 14 per cent in Australia since plain packaging was introduced. Illicit tobacco is immune from taxation, immune from regulation and immune from oversight—kind of like other illicit products in the marketplace. Not only is there a revenue loss for the government but it also deprives hardworking Australian small businesses of revenue, because of cheap, unbranded, illegal competition.


I think we should stand up against criminal gangs. I don't think we should fuel their business models, because of what they will do with the revenue as a consequence—and of course the human toll they put on Australians by engaging in their nefarious agenda. This revenue is then diverted to organised crime syndicates and serves to line the pockets of those undertaking illegal behaviour. Let's just say that it is putting the incentives around the wrong way. This encourages other criminal actions associated with organised crime, such as smuggling, violence and gang activity.


We must focus on assisting people who are motivated to quit smoking through education, support services, harm minimisation and—I will say, resolutely—preferably cessation. When people are allowed to exercise their free will, they are still better off choosing a healthy life. If they struggle with that, I would have thought the job of the people in this place is to provide them with the clearest and simplest pathway to do so. It's time to empower those who want to quit and to help reduce the stagnant smoking rates in this country by properly looking at not just the intent but also the consequences of the policies and the legislation we are passing through this parliament.

"Freelander, Mike, MP",ALP,2018-09-11,"



Dr FREELANDER
 (Macarthur) (18:57):  Before I start my prepared speech, I'd just like to say a few things about the efforts of the member for Goldstein—




Mr Tim Wilson:
  Stein.




Dr FREELANDER:
  Well, the pronunciation depends on where you come from, and I'm well aware of Vida Goldstein and her reputation as a wonderful woman. With respect to the member, the issue of vaporised nicotine substitutions for smoking is certainly not as clear as he would say. There is absolutely no evidence that vaporised nicotine solutions (1) reduce the harm and (2) reduce the cost and the social cost of nicotine addiction.


It's important to note that the tobacco industry continues to promote the use of so-called vaping solutions as an alternative to smoking with absolutely no research into its long-term effects. We know that nicotine is a highly addictive drug. We really don't have the evidence and the research that suggest that vaporised solutions are any solution to cigarette smoking in terms of long-term effects.


We recently had a parliamentary House of Representatives committee inquiry into this, and all the experts—including the AMA, the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, the association of respiratory physicians and the Public Health Association—say that we should not be allowing free access to vaporised nicotine solutions. So, as with many things to do with science, it's important that the government really respects the experts and acts on their advice. The member for Goldstein is not doing that and I'm unsure as to his motives for his broad lack of restraint in supporting vaporised nicotine solutions.


Worldwide there are about 1.2 billion smokers. I was one of them until about 10 years ago. Eighty per cent of smokers are men. There are, indeed, smokers in this chamber. According to the World Health Organization, smoking accounts for around six million avoidable deaths every year. About 70 per cent of those deaths are in developing countries. In Australia, about 19,000 or 20,000 people still die every year from avoidable deaths due to smoking. The cost to our community is around $30 billion. The annual cost worldwide is in the trillions of dollars. It's important to note that, worldwide, the major tobacco companies are still promoting their products and it's only when their products are restricted that they resort to promoting alternatives like vaporised nicotine solutions.


Smoking rates throughout much of the OECD are continuing to decline, but rates of smoking in less developed countries are as high as ever and there is some evidence in some countries that they may be increasing. In most developed countries like Australia, the rate of smoking amongst men is in decline and amongst women it is flat or falling slowly. From the early 1980s, Australia has progressively tightened laws covering the advertising, sale and distribution of cigarettes and tobacco. There have been numerous antismoking health campaigns, government assistance for those wanting to quit for life has increased and excise duties have been substantially increased.


I'm proud to be a member of the Labor Party, which has promoted cessation of smoking activities and support for people to try to stop smoking. Laws have been enacted to prohibit smoking in the workplace and in public places, mostly promoted by the Labor Party. Each of those reforms was resisted by vested interests, but each now seems a sensible and totally uncontentious proposition. It's the same for laws requiring the plain or standardised packaging of cigarettes. I support any bill that strengthens this.


The unambiguously good news is that smoking rates are in decline across the board. Less encouraging is the more limited impact on some demographics—principally older established smokers and those living in the poorest neighbourhoods and in regional and remote Australia. Indigenous Australians have fairly static smoking rates and unfortunately are at increased risk of the harm that smoking causes. Those with mental health issues also have smoking rates that are very static.


Fifty-seven per cent of daily smokers are now aged over 40. Fifteen years ago, the majority of smokers were between the ages of 14 and 39. Fifty years ago, about two in every five adults were smokers. Now it's one in eight. The National Drug Strategy Household Survey showed that smoking rates halved between 1991 and 2016, from 24 per cent to 12 per cent, mostly because of government initiatives. There's been significant success in the last three to five years in reducing the take-up of smoking amongst the young, and the proportion of teenagers who are current smokers declined from five per cent in 2013 to 2.1 per cent in 2016. There have been similar significant declines in the number of people exposed in the home to cigarette smoke, down from about 31 per cent in 1995 to 3.7 per cent in 2013 and down again to 2.8 per cent in 2016. 


These are significant changes. Whilst our smoking rates have only slowly declined, people exposed to smoking in the workplace and in the home has decreased significantly, which will lead to much less risk of harm for my patients, children and particularly young children. They are much less frequently exposed to environmental cigarette smoking than they were previously. This will lead to much lower rates of respiratory illness and much less long-term harm.


The messages in all these policies, for policymakers and legislators, are that change is possible, that governments have to lead, that governments must persist and that governments must persist against very strong, very financially able vested interests. Australia was the first country to enact laws to insist on the plain packaging of cigarettes. I remember this time very well. It's important to note the courage, persistence and intelligence of people like Julia Gillard and Nicola Roxon, the then health minister, who first introduced plain tobacco packaging. There was so much effort put in by those with vested interests against the Labor Party's policies for plain packaging, including from those on the other side. Yet Nicola Roxon and Julia Gillard persisted and were able to get these changes, which now seem to all of us to be completely sensible and the right thing to do.


In November 2011, the legislation was first introduced and, by December 2012, the laws had survived a High Court challenge by those with vested interests, including Big Tobacco. By 1 December 2012 plain packaging was introduced and has stayed the norm in Australia. This legislation will strengthen the ability to monitor this. Years later, it is impossible to imagine why it took us so long to get there.


The previous speaker mentioned underground smoking as a consequence of the plain tobacco packaging. There is no evidence for this whatsoever. It's a claim without basis and without evidence. There may well be underground tobacco available, but this is a financial issue that has no relation to plain tobacco packaging.


Australia's lead on mandatory plain and standardised packaging is now being emulated and followed to varying degrees in many other countries, including the United Kingdom, France, New Zealand, Norway, Hungary and Ireland. As is usual, it's Big Tobacco who are fighting this battle, and we can only hope they continue to lose. As of February this year another 16 countries plan to take action on plain tobacco packaging. The European Union has issued a directive allowing member states the option of implementing plain packaging that survived a concerted legal challenge from Big Tobacco.


I imagine that the only people left in Australia opposed to plain packaging are those with a financial stake in the tobacco industry, or, I'm ashamed to say, politicians who take money from Big Tobacco. Nicotine addiction is not a matter of choice. I like to think that even a majority of those pathologically opposed to any form of government regulation and intervention recognise that nicotine is a special case. It's a drug of addiction and it's one of the most potent. There are only two commonly available illegal drugs that are more addictive than nicotine and that's heroin and cocaine.


Nicotine is a poison and there's no such thing as a safe cigarette. Cigarettes, of course, come with other dangers from the smoke inhalation, but it's important to note that nicotine is primarily a drug of addiction and not without major side effects. One cigarette, unfortunately, can be enough to kill you. It kills indiscriminately and it kills even those who don't smoke, and we've seen increasing evidence of this, particularly in the workplace. There's no such thing as safe smoking in the way that there can perhaps be low levels of safe drinking if done in moderation and in a safe environment—the same is not true for smoking.


There is not much weight in the argument still advanced by some ultra-libertarians that smoking is legal and that we should therefore not try to control or restrict it. Lots of things are legal that we don't encourage or want to condone. Many activities, products, services and substances are regulated. There is nothing odd or peculiar in regulating things that may be misused, that may poorly understood or which are inherently dangerous. There is no question that cigarette smoking is inherently dangerous. It's just common sense that some goods and services are subject to advertising controls and point of sale restrictions. There are lots of legal drugs less lethal than nicotine that we rightly do not let people access at will or use without a doctor's prescription or accompanying health warnings. Smoking only continues to be legal because it's nigh on impossible to prohibit its use outright, while millions of Australians can't give it up, even though as many as three in 10 try to every year.


If this bill, one that makes very minor administrative changes to the law enacted by the Gillard government in 2011, is significant, it's because it marks something of a new dawn for the coalition. At long last the coalition, while in office, seems unambiguously to be saying that it is not for turning in the fight to rid our country of its leading cause of preventable death and disease. I do congratulate the health minister, particularly for his comments about the use of nicotine solutions.


What would make this an even better day would be if the Nationals and other smaller political parties joined Labor, the Greens and the Liberals in refusing to accept donations from big tobacco. The Hawke government enacted laws in the 1980s to provide public funding for election campaigns to reduce the influence of private and corporate donors. That funding is not just a taxpayer funded freebie; it's there to allow all parties and all candidates to exercise a freer hand in accepting and rejecting political donations. Labor stopped taking blood money from the tobacco industry 14 years ago. The Liberals followed 10 years after that, thank God. However, the Nationals and Senator Leyonhjelm's Liberal Democrats have in the last five years continued to accept direct donations in the tens of thousands of dollars annually from one tobacco company, Philip Morris. More shame to them. The level of indirect support they have taken is, of course, unknown.


In accepting such donations, the Nationals and the Liberal Democrats are the most conspicuous of the remaining outliers. They're steadfastly opposed to the community sentiment and the mountains of evidence and analysis on the effects of tobacco. They are small in number, but there are still probably enough of them to apply the handbrake to further much-needed work in reducing the incidence of smoking. Indeed, there are still measures that we should be enacting that will help reduce cigarette smoking rates in Australia. We should also be cognisant of the effect of smoking in the developing world and on our near neighbours, and we should not hold back from support for reducing smoking rates in those countries. As we all know, with this government, it's the minority that sets the rules, unfortunately, while the rest only ever seem to assert their authority ineffectively or when it's too late—just ask Malcolm Turnbull. That wasn't always the case. Not all governments are afraid of their own shadow.


The reforms to cigarette packaging proposed by the Rudd opposition and enacted by the Gillard government and its health minister, Nicola Roxon, were trenchantly opposed at the time for all sorts of spurious and self-serving reasons. True to form, some of the Liberals and Nationals—the usual suspects—wanted to either duck the issue or play both sides of the fence. Others just wanted to make life difficult for those supporting plain packaging, because they saw political advantage in it. The Abbott opposition finally went along with Labor's plain packaging law, but only after some principled members of the coalition threatened to cross the floor to support it.


The public was warned that mandatory plain packaging was unconstitutional. What a silly reason to bring up! It clearly wasn't, and the High Court supported that. They were told the scheme was costly and impractical, which was wrong again. There were even claims from the tobacco industry that plain packaging would lead to increased levels of smoking. What a joke! It was quite silly, and archly and narrowly political to the nth degree. I support this bill. I'm proud, as I've said, to be a member of the Labor Party, which has done all it can to reduce smoking rates in Australia and elsewhere. I commend the bill.

"Falinski, Jason, MP",LP,2018-09-11,"



Mr FALINSKI
 (Mackellar) (19:13):  Thank you to the member for Macarthur. It's always somewhat intimidating to follow him on an issue of public health. There's one thing I would take exception to or disagree on with the member of Macarthur. The previous member, the member for Goldstein—gosh, I hope I've said that properly!




Dr Freelander:
  He'll pull you up on it!




Mr FALINSKI:
  He will! I'll never hear the end of it; you're quite right. He said that plain packaging doesn't assist in unlawful or illicit trade in tobacco. While I absolutely agree with the measures we've taken, I think we also have to recognise that there are negative impacts that need to be managed. Certainly, at the very least, we need to adjust our policies, where possible, to remove the impacts. The fact is that plain packaging tobacco has made it easier for the illicit tobacco trade. The increases in the taxes on tobacco and cigarettes, which were necessary and right to do, have also opened a market for third parties or for a black market in illegal cigarettes to come into the country. There is significant evidence that that trade has increased since some of these measures have been taken. The answer is probably better monitoring and better policing of the tobacco trade, but we can't ignore the negative impacts that these changes have had.


Tobacco use is a leading cause of preventable and premature death in Australia, and this government is committed to reducing the number of deaths from smoking. Of Australians aged 14 years or older, 12.8 per cent smoke daily. Every year smoking kills approximately 19,000 Australians and costs the Australian taxpayer and the health system—the community—$31.5 billion. This government is committed to reducing the number of people addicted to and reliant on tobacco and, by extension, illegal drugs.


We know that Australians living on welfare are some of the most vulnerable in our society to this addiction. They are at more risk of abuse, drug and alcohol addiction and lower life expectancy. That is why this government is not just committed to helping people who earn a salary and buy legal drugs in the form of cigarettes. We are also committed to helping people who find themselves out of work, relying on welfare and addicted to unlawful or illicit drugs. As a government, as I have already outlined, we are committed to reducing the death rate caused by tobacco. 


However, I do have to note that some measures taken have led to an increase, as I mentioned before, in criminal activity, and the sale and importation of illegal tobacco products have sky rocketed. Since July 2016 the Australian tax office undertook 37 seizures totalling 231 tonnes of illicit tobacco, with an estimated tobacco duty forgone of $194 million. In the last financial year alone, the Australian Border Force made more than 110,000 detections of illicit tobacco, including almost 241 million cigarettes and 217 tonnes of tobacco worth more than $356 million in evaded duty.


Under the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act 2011, plain package compliance and enforcement activities are undertaken by authorised officers. Authorised officers must be persons appointed under the Public Service Act 1999 or be a member or special member of the Australian Federal Police. The person is appointed as an authorised officer in writing by the secretary of the Department of Health. This bill proposes to expand the range of persons who can be appointed as authorised officers. The bill will allow the secretary to appoint as authorised officers: Commonwealth officers not appointed or engaged under the Public Service Act; state and territory police officers; and state and territory officers and local government officials with responsibilities in relation to health matters or tobacco control, compliance and enforcement. Given the earlier numbers, it is critical that we expand the number of people involved in enforcing this law.


The bill will enable the government to respond more flexibly to noncompliance. The bill will provide the Department of Health and Ageing with access to a wider pool of officers eligible for appointment as authorised officers, providing greater flexibility to respond to any organisational or administrative changes which may occur in the future. This will also provide more opportunities for authorised officers to cooperate and respond to potential noncompliance. The bill does not change the plain packaging requirements and will not impact the obligations of tobacco manufacturers, distributors or retailers.


Consultation with each relevant state and territory agency has been undertaken. At the conclusion of the consultation, no agencies opposed the amendment. Some state and territory agencies emphasised that their support was only on the basis that their officers could only be appointed as authorised officers with a formal agreement in place. These agencies were comfortable with the amendment, due to the inclusion of a clause providing that the appointment will only be by agreement with the relevant state or territory. 


I will take a moment to plug a good friend of mine, the former English MP for Enfield North, Nick de Bois. Nick wrote a book, Confessions of a Recovering MP, which he penned after he left office and, which, I believe, is available on Amazon. In this book, he dedicated a chapter to the criminal activity related to tobacco and cigarette sales. He went undercover in his own constituency to see how rife the sale of these products was. He was so eager to go undercover, he dressed down to what he thought the attire of undercover agents must have been—old pair of jeans; tatty, worn sweater; unpolished boots; and uncombed hair. Nick didn't have to go far, as it turned out. The shop right next door to his electorate office was where they would find illicit cigarettes. It is for this reason and the stats I outlined earlier that I support this bill to enhance our enforcement agencies in relation to noncompliance. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr Giles:
  Hear, hear!




Mr Buchholz:
  We want you around for a long time!




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Rob Mitchell
):  Thanks.




Mr SNOWDON:
  We'd like you to be here, son! As other members have outlined the details of the Tobacco Plain Packaging Amendment Bill 2018, I'm not going to do that other than to say that we on this side of the House are supporting it. However, I do want to commend the contribution made by the member for Macarthur in particular, a good friend and someone whose background is as a paediatrician, a doctor, who has had a lot of experience dealing with health matters across the community. He explained in a very detailed way the impacts on the health of individuals and on our community as a result of smoking. As others have said, in 2011 tobacco use was estimated to be responsible for nine per cent of the total burden of disease. That's a significant figure. Eighty per cent of lung cancer burden and 75 per cent of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease burden was attributable to tobacco use. I don't think there'd be many people in this place who wouldn't know either directly or indirectly a person, or persons, who has suffered immense trauma and an early death as a result of tobacco. There'd be very few among us.


The initiatives taken so long ago now for plain packaging were against the protestations of the industry. I remember vividly the remarkable attempts taken by the industry to oppose the legislation championed by the then Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon. The case was taken internationally to try and say that, somehow or another, this was illegal. It wasn't, and it was the best thing we could've done. But the concern I have is that we have to actually maintain our commitment to strategies to bring down tobacco consumption rates. I'm most particularly concerned about those people who have the most prevalent use of tobacco in the community. In this case, it is principally Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander smokers.


The comparisons are huge. The 2014-15 National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Survey found 39 per cent of the combined Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population aged 15 and over were daily smokers compared with 14 per cent in the general population. The proportion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who were daily smokers aged 15 years and older was 39 per cent compared to 45 per cent in 2008 and 49 per cent in 2002. So there has been a reduction—and that's significant—and it's very important that the efforts continue. In 2002, 51 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander males aged 15 years and over were daily smokers. That daily smoking rate declined to 46 per cent in 2008 and 41 per cent in 2014-15.


They're good things, and there is other data which demonstrates that tobacco consumption is falling in Aboriginal communities, but when you compare it with the broader population the gap is not closing. It is because, as we've seen, the consumption rates amongst the general population—the non-Aboriginal population—have also fallen dramatically, but the gap has not closed.


When I contemplate this, I remember well the 2014-15 budget. In a previous government I was the minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health, and we initiated some measures around tobacco, prevention strategies, and funded them directly to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community health organisations and communities. Sadly, in their first budget after coming into government, the Abbott government, with then Prime Minister Abbott—now the envoy for God knows what—and then Treasurer, Mr Hockey, brought down a budget that cut $500 million out of expenditure for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, and $130 million of that was cut from the program for tackling Indigenous smoking, which was publicly disparaged by the then Treasurer.


Just so we understand the nature of this and the prevalence of tobacco consumption amongst Indigenous Australians: among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians between the ages of 15 and 27 male consumption is 34.4 per cent compared with 3.9 per cent for non-indigenous Australians and for women the figures are 26.5 per cent and 2.3 per cent. That demonstrates the difficulty that we are having in bringing down tobacco consumption rates amongst Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. You wouldn't think that a responsible government, or a government that purported to be responsible, and a Prime Minister who, we were told, would be a Prime Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, would oversee a budget which cut $500 million out of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander programs, $130 million of which went directly to cutting the programs for tackling Indigenous smoking.


Do you reckon that, when the member for Warringah gets on whatever he's getting on to travel around Australia as an envoy and talks to whoever he is going to be talking to—and I don't know who he is going to be talking to—he might explain to them that he was responsible for overseeing a budget cut of over $500 million, which impacted every aspect of the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians? Do you reckon that he might tell them that he himself was responsible for overseeing a cut of $130 million out of the tackling tobacco program? You can imagine what he will do—and it certainly won't be that.


But, having said that, despite the absurdities of the government, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health services around this country have been working diligently to bring down tobacco consumption rates. As the member for Macarthur pointed out, the direct health impacts are obvious to all of us and we have a responsibility to make sure that the funding is available to continue antismoking programs. I'm going to have to give up my position at this dispatch box, at least temporarily, in a very short time, but when I am back here, hopefully tomorrow or whenever else this debate is brought back on—



Government members interjecting—




Mr SNOWDON:
  You can wait in anticipation.



A government member:  We're going nowhere.




Mr SNOWDON:
  You'll be here a while. I will talk about a couple of specific programs that have been introduced by Aboriginal communities or organisations around the country which have had a dramatic and positive impact on reducing tobacco consumption in their communities.

"King, Catherine, MP",ALP,2018-09-11,"



Ms CATHERINE KING
 (Ballarat) (18:29):  It is with pleasure that I rise to speak on the Tobacco Plain Packaging Amendment Bill 2018. Labor has a proud record when it comes to tobacco control. Worldwide, tobacco is the leading cause of preventable death and kills at least five million people a year. In Australia, smoking kills between 15,000 and 20,000 people every single year. The economic and social cost of smoking is estimated at $31.5 billion a year. By any measure, and despite all of the progress we have achieved over many decades, it remains a massive public health issue. It is an issue that requires political leadership and eternal vigilance.


Labor has shown consistent leadership on this issue, even when it has been politically very difficult to achieve. We've stood up to big tobacco, despite their formidable resources and significant campaign abilities. Despite their willingness to use dirty tricks to take legal action, we took them on. It was Labor that introduced and fought for the world-leading plain packaging legislation that, alongside other policies, has helped to drive smoking rates in this country to record lows. We are very proud that many other countries across the world have followed suit.


This legislation before us today makes some minor technical changes to Labor's laws, and we will, of course, support it. Put simply, the amendments expand the range of people who can be authorised to undertake plain-packaging compliance activities. There will be no objection from us on that. But we do know that, deep down, many on the other side would actually like to tear up this legislation altogether. On this, as on so many other things, they are divided. Despite the clear evidence that our legislation for plain packaging has worked and has clearly saved lives, many on the other side still think that this is 'nanny state' policy. It shows that they don't understand public health policy or evidence based health policy. But, as we know, that is what the Liberals and the Nationals so often do; they put big business before the wellbeing of the Australian people.


Let's talk about how successful not just this policy but also tobacco mitigation policies have been. We introduced plain packaging for tobacco in December 2012 to help Australians quit smoking. Under the laws, tobacco products have no branding and feature health warnings with graphic images. It works by reducing the appeal and brand identification of smoking, particularly for young people.


In 2016 the Commonwealth's post-implementation review of Labor's laws found:


… plain packaging is achieving its aim of improving public health in Australia and is expected to have substantial public health outcomes into the future.


In the three years after our laws came into effect, total tobacco consumption rates fell by 18.3 per cent. Not all of this decline was due to plain packaging, of course, but some of it definitely was. The report said:


… the 2012 packaging changes resulted in a ""statistically significant decline in smoking prevalence …


We never sought to claim that plain packaging was a silver bullet. It was always meant to be one of a suite of measures necessary to continue to drive down smoking rates. It reflected the removal of the last form of advertising for tobacco, in line with the World Health Organization's tobacco convention, to which we are a signatory.


The British Medical Journal stated:


The evidence suggests that plain packaging is severely restricting the ability of the pack to communicate and create appeal with young people and adults.


One of the world's most respected medical journals declared Labor's world-leading plain-packaging laws to be a casebook example of effective tobacco control.


A report led by the ANU last year also confirmed that plain packaging had helped many smokers to quit. It led to a decline in the way that smokers identified with their brand, resulting in a reduction in smoking and an increase in the number of smoker attempts to quit the habit. We know that the more attempts people make to quit, the more likely they are to actually quit. It led to a decline in the way smokers identify their brand. The ANU found that, during the phase-in of the reforms, calls to quit smoking helplines increased by up to 78 per cent and were above average for about 10 months after the reforms began. 


Studies have shown plain packaging has had a particular impact in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities as well. Smoking contributes to one in five Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander deaths. Public health researchers found Indigenous people were better informed about the risks of smoking as a result of the policy. Before the policy's introduction, they were significantly more likely to mistakenly think that some brands of cigarettes were less harmful than others. The World Health Organization is calling on all countries in the world to follow Australia's lead and to introduce plain packaging. The countries that have already done so include France, the United Kingdom and Ireland. Many countries will undoubtedly follow.


The Heart Foundation said that tobacco plain packaging had contributed to around 25 per cent of the total decline in the prevalence of smoking since it was introduced in 2012. That's tens of thousands of people quitting thanks to the Labor Party's efforts. Crucially, we've seen adolescent smoking rates drop to a record low. The tobacco industry tried to fight it, taking Australia all the way to the WTO to try and kill off these reforms. They failed, of course, but the fact that they tried might be the best evidence anyone needs that our policy was the right one and that our policy was, in fact, effective; otherwise, why would these companies have attempted to kill it off?


Thanks in part to Labor's groundbreaking policy work, the prevalence of daily smoking in Australia is now at just 12 per cent and continuing to decline. That is a good public health achievement. However, it has to be said that the rate of the decline has unfortunately slowed. That's because, for the last five years, we have had a government that has done nothing about tobacco control. No single measure will drive rates of smoking down forever. As one prominent public health expert noted recently, each new measure magnifies the effects of what has gone before but only if action is continually reinforced and properly resourced.


Tobacco control is one of Australia's best public health successes, but there is absolutely no room for complacency. That's because big tobacco companies are relentless. They never stop. They're always looking for new ways to hook new customers, even while they're publicly claiming that they're cleaning up their business—or even making plans to get out of smoking altogether—particularly in the guise of harm minimisation. They are morally bankrupt and cannot be believed. Here at home, they are still lobbying and using front groups. They are still using astroturfing campaigns. They are still walking the corridors of this place, taking any opportunity they can to meet with and influence members here; they do not meet with me. They're more likely than ever to use litigation to fight public health measures against governments and against other public institutions like universities. They are still buying and co-opting some so-called health experts. They're still trying to buy off journalists with expensive junkets and with hospitality. Overseas, in many less-developed and less-regulated markets, they are still advertising and selling their products with total immunity, even to primary school children. They are ruthless.


But, wherever you look, this government has zero credibility when it comes to tackling smoking related deaths. For five years, they have been absolutely missing in action. As Professor Mike Daube from Curtin University wrote recently:


For those who worked long and hard to make Australia a world leader in tobacco control, it is deeply disappointing that political complacency in recent years has both led to lack of action and allowed distractions to dominate the public and policy arenas.


He goes on:


We should have reinforced and capitalised on the early impact of plain packaging and reinforced the impacts of tax increases … but action over the past 6 years has stalled, at a time when it should have accelerated. … … …


First, crucially and inexplicably, there have been no national media campaigns since 2012. The federal government gets more than $11 billion a year in revenue from tobacco taxes. Spending $40 million on media campaigns would be less than 0.4% of this.


That is correct. For its entire time in office, this government has not bothered to launch any antitobacco campaigns, even though we know they are highly successful. We all remember the many successful campaigns, like, 'Every cigarette is doing you damage.' All of those campaigns have actually had a significant impact. There has not been one in the term of this government. We need more major, hard-hitting media campaigns, one of the most effective weapons that we have in our arsenal.


Professor Daube goes on to point out that over the last five years there has been a complete absence of new evidence-based measures to tackle smoking—nothing at all. He also talks about how there have been no curbs on tobacco industry efforts to influence public policy. He mentions lobbying and, of course, political donations. It's now been 14 years since Labor announced we would no longer take political donations from Big Tobacco. It took nearly 10 years for the Liberals to match us on that. But, shamefully, the National Party still have not done the right thing and ceased taking donations from Big Tobacco. As recently as last year, they took $15,700 from Big Tobacco companies. That is disgraceful.


The Prime Minister needs to explain why he thinks it's okay that his coalition partners can fill their coffers with money from companies that profit from putting Australians in coffins. How can he in good conscience keep a Nationals senator with responsibility for rural health while her party is happy to accept this blood money? People in rural and remote areas of Australia are twice as likely to be daily smokers as those in the cities, meaning the burden of disease falls most heavily on our rural Australians. If the Nationals really cared about the health of people in the bush they would reject these donations outright.


Malcolm Turnbull has gone from this place now, but he never explained his failure to divest from three share market funds that invest in tobacco. It was important that he did so. Again, I think it's important that we absolutely back in the work of people like Bronwyn King, a wonderful woman who I think is in the parliament at the moment. She has been doing fantastic work in getting superannuation portfolios to divest themselves of tobacco shares. She has slowly taken that work across Australia, and there are more and more super funds that are divesting themselves of tobacco shares. She has now taken that effort globally. Under her terrific leadership and the work that she has done, there will soon be very few superannuation funds left that will invest in tobacco at all. This is another example of the great work of public health people. Bronwyn is an oncologist who took the decision to leave her oncology in order to pursue that particular work.


The coalition, frankly, have done very little. While they've taken their eye off the ball, tobacco companies have been coming up with new ways to advertise and hook our children on these deadly products. Just last week we saw a series of reports about how tobacco companies are using social media influencers to advertise cigarettes, circumventing our strict anti-advertising laws. Our antismoking advertising laws threaten companies with fines of up to $126,000 if they advertise their products. But thanks to this social media loophole they can do it with virtual impunity. They're using the same marketing playbook they have always used to attract kids and teens to their products. It is insidious and something needs to be done about it. There are glamorous ads of attractive people in exotic locations sucking back on cigarettes on Instagram, a platform that reaches millions of people worldwide with virtually no regulation. They use celebrities and models and seek to associate smoking with fast cars, yachts, fancy clothes and expensive champagne. It is exactly the sort of thing previous generations of policymakers fought to outlaw and, unfortunately, in this medium it is making a comeback. Tobacco control experts have called these campaigns the greatest threat to how young people perceive tobacco products today. They say the tobacco companies are targeting young people in at least 40 countries, including here in Australia. Researchers say those campaigns generated over 25 billion views by individuals. Twenty-five billion views is a serious problem. Sadly, you can't rely on this government to do anything. Only Labor takes these issues of tobacco control seriously.


The big tobacco companies have also been trying to push new nicotine vaping and e-cigarette products onto the market. They try to claim it is some sort of public good and they are contributing to cessation. In fact, they're using every tactic they can to try and push to market more addictive products that have not been properly studied for their long-term health effects. The most authoritative report on this issue, from the US National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, concluded that the evidence for cessation benefits is limited and the evidence for concern about their impact is, in fact, substantial. Let's be clear: the tobacco companies see that the writing is on the wall for their industry, so they are trying to diversify in order to survive, but they don't care the slightest bit about the health or wellbeing of a single one of their customers. Big tobacco has long sought to use new alternative products in a bid to renormalise their industry, and no-one in this place should fall for it.


This job is not over. We absolutely need to do more. We need more evidence based activity and policies to maintain the momentum of the tobacco fight. The tobacco companies will not rest, so we, as a parliament, need to not rest either. The Liberals should restore Australia's global leadership on this issue. They should restore funding that they cut from important Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander smoking cessation programs. They should engage in a national advertising campaign to ensure that smoking rates fall again. They need to vigorously pursue any other forms of advertising for tobacco that have emerged since we were able to remove the last form—the actual pack—with plain packaging. They need to make sure that the National Tobacco Strategy is now not just a document that sits on a shelf, but is, in fact, reinvigorated. The Liberals should restore Australia's global leadership on this issue. If they don't, Labor certainly will. To this end, I move the second reading amendment that has been circulated in my name:


That all words after ""That"" be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:


""whilst not declining to give the bill a second reading, the House:


(1) notes that progress on lowering smoking rates has stalled following the Government's cuts to tobacco control measures; and


(2) calls on the Government to re-invest in lowering smoking rates"".




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(

Mr Butler:
  I second the amendment and reserve my right to speak.



The DEPUTY SPEAKER:  The original question was that this bill be now read a second time. To this, the honourable member for Ballarat has moved as an amendment that all words after 'that' be omitted with a view to substituting other words.

Mr TIM WILSON
 (Goldstein) (18:48):  If you are concerned about the stabilisation of tobacco cessation, you really should look at why—why it is that life-long smokers struggle to get off such an insidious product and why it is that they are addicted. You should also ask: what are the alternatives? This is where the false outrage of the member for Ballarat falls short, because, in the end, she already rules out and discounts alternatives that can help people to reduce their consumption, to engage in harm minimisation and, in the context, improve their health overall. I will remind other members of the choices that people have.


At the moment, if you are addicted to nicotine and you smoke tobacco products, your choice is to continue smoking or to give up, and, yes, there are some cessation aids, but they do not work for everyone. And yet there are harm minimisation pathways denied by those on both sides of the chamber—of which I am not one. In the end, having sat on committees inquiring into the legal access towards vaping, I cannot, in good conscience, oppose legalisation—my view has been on the public record, so this is not new—even more so after I went to the UK on a parliamentary delegation and met with officials from the National Health Service, who took a similar view to me. That's because what they saw was, amongst many of their patient groups, particularly in parts of Manchester, people who simply couldn't quit, and they saw the consequences, the harm and the damage that was done to people's health from enduring tobacco consumption.


They then looked at the alternatives and said that vaping provided a harm minimisation pathway that they could not ignore. When it was raised with them, 'Should Australia follow the same pathway,' of course they rightly said it was up to us, but they acknowledged that it was enormously beneficial to the people they were there to serve. That is my view, and it is a view I am very comfortable expressing in public because what we know, as somebody who had three out of their four grandparents die prematurely as a consequence of tobacco consumption, is that tobacco causes enormous harm. Tobacco is responsible for tremendous damage to the lives of Australians, our community and, if you want to count it up in dollars and cents, our economy as well. Of Australians aged 14 years or older, 12.8 per cent still smoke daily. Every year smoking kills or is a contributing factor to an estimated 19,000 Australian deaths. And, in addition to the morbidity and mortality, $31.5 billion is drained from the economy annually for something that provides, let's say, little benefit beyond the choices that people have.


This bill appropriately allows more flexibility to noncompliance with the tobacco plain-packaging legislation, and any improvements that allow for the adherence, respect and implementation of the rule of law as a principle, I will always support. But we also should take account of our obligation to the Australian people seriously and have effective policy measures to combat smoking rates, as I addressed at the start of my speech. With this in mind, we do have to look seriously at the efficacy of plain packaging from 2013 to 2016. Let's remember what happened: the Gillard government introduced plain packaging and contestably there was an influence on smoking rates, so they banged a massive tax on top of it to make sure the rates went down—I never disputed that increasing taxes can have an influence on reducing smoking rates. But even then, from 2013 to 2016, Australia's smoking rate fell by a dismal 0.6 per cent despite an increase in tobacco excise and the introduction of plain packaging. Expenditure on cigarettes increased in Australia while smoking rates sharply declined in the United States and in the United Kingdom.


Plain packaging has failed to reduce smoking significantly. Instead, what it has actually done, and this is the bit that the opposition never likes to pay attention to, is it has driven tobacco sales underground, because this is what the policy actually does. It takes a product with a brand and makes it generic, and then, as the tax rates increase, the consumer surplus goes up, so the cost increases, and it is a generic product.


So what happens? Criminal gangs move in. They, not just the tobacco companies, see the economic benefit and the potential to take advantage of Australians who are addicted—and some who aren't, to get them there—and to make huge profits. Those profits are then used not just to deny the taxpayer the money they need to deal with the consequences of tobacco consumption—the costs that are passed through to the health system—but also of course to fund and finance their nefarious agenda. So, rather than looking at this policy simply on the basis of its intent, perhaps we should look also at its consequences.


As branding has been lost, competition now focuses predominantly on price, boosting sales of cheaper products. KPMG has found that illicit tobacco consumption has grown from 11.5 per cent to 14 per cent in Australia since plain packaging was introduced. Illicit tobacco is immune from taxation, immune from regulation and immune from oversight—kind of like other illicit products in the marketplace. Not only is there a revenue loss for the government but it also deprives hardworking Australian small businesses of revenue, because of cheap, unbranded, illegal competition.


I think we should stand up against criminal gangs. I don't think we should fuel their business models, because of what they will do with the revenue as a consequence—and of course the human toll they put on Australians by engaging in their nefarious agenda. This revenue is then diverted to organised crime syndicates and serves to line the pockets of those undertaking illegal behaviour. Let's just say that it is putting the incentives around the wrong way. This encourages other criminal actions associated with organised crime, such as smuggling, violence and gang activity.


We must focus on assisting people who are motivated to quit smoking through education, support services, harm minimisation and—I will say, resolutely—preferably cessation. When people are allowed to exercise their free will, they are still better off choosing a healthy life. If they struggle with that, I would have thought the job of the people in this place is to provide them with the clearest and simplest pathway to do so. It's time to empower those who want to quit and to help reduce the stagnant smoking rates in this country by properly looking at not just the intent but also the consequences of the policies and the legislation we are passing through this parliament.

"Freelander, Mike, MP",ALP,2018-09-11,"



Dr FREELANDER
 (Macarthur) (18:57):  Before I start my prepared speech, I'd just like to say a few things about the efforts of the member for Goldstein—




Mr Tim Wilson:
  Stein.




Dr FREELANDER:
  Well, the pronunciation depends on where you come from, and I'm well aware of Vida Goldstein and her reputation as a wonderful woman. With respect to the member, the issue of vaporised nicotine substitutions for smoking is certainly not as clear as he would say. There is absolutely no evidence that vaporised nicotine solutions (1) reduce the harm and (2) reduce the cost and the social cost of nicotine addiction.


It's important to note that the tobacco industry continues to promote the use of so-called vaping solutions as an alternative to smoking with absolutely no research into its long-term effects. We know that nicotine is a highly addictive drug. We really don't have the evidence and the research that suggest that vaporised solutions are any solution to cigarette smoking in terms of long-term effects.


We recently had a parliamentary House of Representatives committee inquiry into this, and all the experts—including the AMA, the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, the association of respiratory physicians and the Public Health Association—say that we should not be allowing free access to vaporised nicotine solutions. So, as with many things to do with science, it's important that the government really respects the experts and acts on their advice. The member for Goldstein is not doing that and I'm unsure as to his motives for his broad lack of restraint in supporting vaporised nicotine solutions.


Worldwide there are about 1.2 billion smokers. I was one of them until about 10 years ago. Eighty per cent of smokers are men. There are, indeed, smokers in this chamber. According to the World Health Organization, smoking accounts for around six million avoidable deaths every year. About 70 per cent of those deaths are in developing countries. In Australia, about 19,000 or 20,000 people still die every year from avoidable deaths due to smoking. The cost to our community is around $30 billion. The annual cost worldwide is in the trillions of dollars. It's important to note that, worldwide, the major tobacco companies are still promoting their products and it's only when their products are restricted that they resort to promoting alternatives like vaporised nicotine solutions.


Smoking rates throughout much of the OECD are continuing to decline, but rates of smoking in less developed countries are as high as ever and there is some evidence in some countries that they may be increasing. In most developed countries like Australia, the rate of smoking amongst men is in decline and amongst women it is flat or falling slowly. From the early 1980s, Australia has progressively tightened laws covering the advertising, sale and distribution of cigarettes and tobacco. There have been numerous antismoking health campaigns, government assistance for those wanting to quit for life has increased and excise duties have been substantially increased.


I'm proud to be a member of the Labor Party, which has promoted cessation of smoking activities and support for people to try to stop smoking. Laws have been enacted to prohibit smoking in the workplace and in public places, mostly promoted by the Labor Party. Each of those reforms was resisted by vested interests, but each now seems a sensible and totally uncontentious proposition. It's the same for laws requiring the plain or standardised packaging of cigarettes. I support any bill that strengthens this.


The unambiguously good news is that smoking rates are in decline across the board. Less encouraging is the more limited impact on some demographics—principally older established smokers and those living in the poorest neighbourhoods and in regional and remote Australia. Indigenous Australians have fairly static smoking rates and unfortunately are at increased risk of the harm that smoking causes. Those with mental health issues also have smoking rates that are very static.


Fifty-seven per cent of daily smokers are now aged over 40. Fifteen years ago, the majority of smokers were between the ages of 14 and 39. Fifty years ago, about two in every five adults were smokers. Now it's one in eight. The National Drug Strategy Household Survey showed that smoking rates halved between 1991 and 2016, from 24 per cent to 12 per cent, mostly because of government initiatives. There's been significant success in the last three to five years in reducing the take-up of smoking amongst the young, and the proportion of teenagers who are current smokers declined from five per cent in 2013 to 2.1 per cent in 2016. There have been similar significant declines in the number of people exposed in the home to cigarette smoke, down from about 31 per cent in 1995 to 3.7 per cent in 2013 and down again to 2.8 per cent in 2016. 


These are significant changes. Whilst our smoking rates have only slowly declined, people exposed to smoking in the workplace and in the home has decreased significantly, which will lead to much less risk of harm for my patients, children and particularly young children. They are much less frequently exposed to environmental cigarette smoking than they were previously. This will lead to much lower rates of respiratory illness and much less long-term harm.


The messages in all these policies, for policymakers and legislators, are that change is possible, that governments have to lead, that governments must persist and that governments must persist against very strong, very financially able vested interests. Australia was the first country to enact laws to insist on the plain packaging of cigarettes. I remember this time very well. It's important to note the courage, persistence and intelligence of people like Julia Gillard and Nicola Roxon, the then health minister, who first introduced plain tobacco packaging. There was so much effort put in by those with vested interests against the Labor Party's policies for plain packaging, including from those on the other side. Yet Nicola Roxon and Julia Gillard persisted and were able to get these changes, which now seem to all of us to be completely sensible and the right thing to do.


In November 2011, the legislation was first introduced and, by December 2012, the laws had survived a High Court challenge by those with vested interests, including Big Tobacco. By 1 December 2012 plain packaging was introduced and has stayed the norm in Australia. This legislation will strengthen the ability to monitor this. Years later, it is impossible to imagine why it took us so long to get there.


The previous speaker mentioned underground smoking as a consequence of the plain tobacco packaging. There is no evidence for this whatsoever. It's a claim without basis and without evidence. There may well be underground tobacco available, but this is a financial issue that has no relation to plain tobacco packaging.


Australia's lead on mandatory plain and standardised packaging is now being emulated and followed to varying degrees in many other countries, including the United Kingdom, France, New Zealand, Norway, Hungary and Ireland. As is usual, it's Big Tobacco who are fighting this battle, and we can only hope they continue to lose. As of February this year another 16 countries plan to take action on plain tobacco packaging. The European Union has issued a directive allowing member states the option of implementing plain packaging that survived a concerted legal challenge from Big Tobacco.


I imagine that the only people left in Australia opposed to plain packaging are those with a financial stake in the tobacco industry, or, I'm ashamed to say, politicians who take money from Big Tobacco. Nicotine addiction is not a matter of choice. I like to think that even a majority of those pathologically opposed to any form of government regulation and intervention recognise that nicotine is a special case. It's a drug of addiction and it's one of the most potent. There are only two commonly available illegal drugs that are more addictive than nicotine and that's heroin and cocaine.


Nicotine is a poison and there's no such thing as a safe cigarette. Cigarettes, of course, come with other dangers from the smoke inhalation, but it's important to note that nicotine is primarily a drug of addiction and not without major side effects. One cigarette, unfortunately, can be enough to kill you. It kills indiscriminately and it kills even those who don't smoke, and we've seen increasing evidence of this, particularly in the workplace. There's no such thing as safe smoking in the way that there can perhaps be low levels of safe drinking if done in moderation and in a safe environment—the same is not true for smoking.


There is not much weight in the argument still advanced by some ultra-libertarians that smoking is legal and that we should therefore not try to control or restrict it. Lots of things are legal that we don't encourage or want to condone. Many activities, products, services and substances are regulated. There is nothing odd or peculiar in regulating things that may be misused, that may poorly understood or which are inherently dangerous. There is no question that cigarette smoking is inherently dangerous. It's just common sense that some goods and services are subject to advertising controls and point of sale restrictions. There are lots of legal drugs less lethal than nicotine that we rightly do not let people access at will or use without a doctor's prescription or accompanying health warnings. Smoking only continues to be legal because it's nigh on impossible to prohibit its use outright, while millions of Australians can't give it up, even though as many as three in 10 try to every year.


If this bill, one that makes very minor administrative changes to the law enacted by the Gillard government in 2011, is significant, it's because it marks something of a new dawn for the coalition. At long last the coalition, while in office, seems unambiguously to be saying that it is not for turning in the fight to rid our country of its leading cause of preventable death and disease. I do congratulate the health minister, particularly for his comments about the use of nicotine solutions.


What would make this an even better day would be if the Nationals and other smaller political parties joined Labor, the Greens and the Liberals in refusing to accept donations from big tobacco. The Hawke government enacted laws in the 1980s to provide public funding for election campaigns to reduce the influence of private and corporate donors. That funding is not just a taxpayer funded freebie; it's there to allow all parties and all candidates to exercise a freer hand in accepting and rejecting political donations. Labor stopped taking blood money from the tobacco industry 14 years ago. The Liberals followed 10 years after that, thank God. However, the Nationals and Senator Leyonhjelm's Liberal Democrats have in the last five years continued to accept direct donations in the tens of thousands of dollars annually from one tobacco company, Philip Morris. More shame to them. The level of indirect support they have taken is, of course, unknown.


In accepting such donations, the Nationals and the Liberal Democrats are the most conspicuous of the remaining outliers. They're steadfastly opposed to the community sentiment and the mountains of evidence and analysis on the effects of tobacco. They are small in number, but there are still probably enough of them to apply the handbrake to further much-needed work in reducing the incidence of smoking. Indeed, there are still measures that we should be enacting that will help reduce cigarette smoking rates in Australia. We should also be cognisant of the effect of smoking in the developing world and on our near neighbours, and we should not hold back from support for reducing smoking rates in those countries. As we all know, with this government, it's the minority that sets the rules, unfortunately, while the rest only ever seem to assert their authority ineffectively or when it's too late—just ask Malcolm Turnbull. That wasn't always the case. Not all governments are afraid of their own shadow.


The reforms to cigarette packaging proposed by the Rudd opposition and enacted by the Gillard government and its health minister, Nicola Roxon, were trenchantly opposed at the time for all sorts of spurious and self-serving reasons. True to form, some of the Liberals and Nationals—the usual suspects—wanted to either duck the issue or play both sides of the fence. Others just wanted to make life difficult for those supporting plain packaging, because they saw political advantage in it. The Abbott opposition finally went along with Labor's plain packaging law, but only after some principled members of the coalition threatened to cross the floor to support it.


The public was warned that mandatory plain packaging was unconstitutional. What a silly reason to bring up! It clearly wasn't, and the High Court supported that. They were told the scheme was costly and impractical, which was wrong again. There were even claims from the tobacco industry that plain packaging would lead to increased levels of smoking. What a joke! It was quite silly, and archly and narrowly political to the nth degree. I support this bill. I'm proud, as I've said, to be a member of the Labor Party, which has done all it can to reduce smoking rates in Australia and elsewhere. I commend the bill.

"Falinski, Jason, MP",LP,2018-09-11,"



Mr FALINSKI
 (Mackellar) (19:13):  Thank you to the member for Macarthur. It's always somewhat intimidating to follow him on an issue of public health. There's one thing I would take exception to or disagree on with the member of Macarthur. The previous member, the member for Goldstein—gosh, I hope I've said that properly!




Dr Freelander:
  He'll pull you up on it!




Mr FALINSKI:
  He will! I'll never hear the end of it; you're quite right. He said that plain packaging doesn't assist in unlawful or illicit trade in tobacco. While I absolutely agree with the measures we've taken, I think we also have to recognise that there are negative impacts that need to be managed. Certainly, at the very least, we need to adjust our policies, where possible, to remove the impacts. The fact is that plain packaging tobacco has made it easier for the illicit tobacco trade. The increases in the taxes on tobacco and cigarettes, which were necessary and right to do, have also opened a market for third parties or for a black market in illegal cigarettes to come into the country. There is significant evidence that that trade has increased since some of these measures have been taken. The answer is probably better monitoring and better policing of the tobacco trade, but we can't ignore the negative impacts that these changes have had.


Tobacco use is a leading cause of preventable and premature death in Australia, and this government is committed to reducing the number of deaths from smoking. Of Australians aged 14 years or older, 12.8 per cent smoke daily. Every year smoking kills approximately 19,000 Australians and costs the Australian taxpayer and the health system—the community—$31.5 billion. This government is committed to reducing the number of people addicted to and reliant on tobacco and, by extension, illegal drugs.


We know that Australians living on welfare are some of the most vulnerable in our society to this addiction. They are at more risk of abuse, drug and alcohol addiction and lower life expectancy. That is why this government is not just committed to helping people who earn a salary and buy legal drugs in the form of cigarettes. We are also committed to helping people who find themselves out of work, relying on welfare and addicted to unlawful or illicit drugs. As a government, as I have already outlined, we are committed to reducing the death rate caused by tobacco. 


However, I do have to note that some measures taken have led to an increase, as I mentioned before, in criminal activity, and the sale and importation of illegal tobacco products have sky rocketed. Since July 2016 the Australian tax office undertook 37 seizures totalling 231 tonnes of illicit tobacco, with an estimated tobacco duty forgone of $194 million. In the last financial year alone, the Australian Border Force made more than 110,000 detections of illicit tobacco, including almost 241 million cigarettes and 217 tonnes of tobacco worth more than $356 million in evaded duty.


Under the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act 2011, plain package compliance and enforcement activities are undertaken by authorised officers. Authorised officers must be persons appointed under the Public Service Act 1999 or be a member or special member of the Australian Federal Police. The person is appointed as an authorised officer in writing by the secretary of the Department of Health. This bill proposes to expand the range of persons who can be appointed as authorised officers. The bill will allow the secretary to appoint as authorised officers: Commonwealth officers not appointed or engaged under the Public Service Act; state and territory police officers; and state and territory officers and local government officials with responsibilities in relation to health matters or tobacco control, compliance and enforcement. Given the earlier numbers, it is critical that we expand the number of people involved in enforcing this law.


The bill will enable the government to respond more flexibly to noncompliance. The bill will provide the Department of Health and Ageing with access to a wider pool of officers eligible for appointment as authorised officers, providing greater flexibility to respond to any organisational or administrative changes which may occur in the future. This will also provide more opportunities for authorised officers to cooperate and respond to potential noncompliance. The bill does not change the plain packaging requirements and will not impact the obligations of tobacco manufacturers, distributors or retailers.


Consultation with each relevant state and territory agency has been undertaken. At the conclusion of the consultation, no agencies opposed the amendment. Some state and territory agencies emphasised that their support was only on the basis that their officers could only be appointed as authorised officers with a formal agreement in place. These agencies were comfortable with the amendment, due to the inclusion of a clause providing that the appointment will only be by agreement with the relevant state or territory. 


I will take a moment to plug a good friend of mine, the former English MP for Enfield North, Nick de Bois. Nick wrote a book, Confessions of a Recovering MP, which he penned after he left office and, which, I believe, is available on Amazon. In this book, he dedicated a chapter to the criminal activity related to tobacco and cigarette sales. He went undercover in his own constituency to see how rife the sale of these products was. He was so eager to go undercover, he dressed down to what he thought the attire of undercover agents must have been—old pair of jeans; tatty, worn sweater; unpolished boots; and uncombed hair. Nick didn't have to go far, as it turned out. The shop right next door to his electorate office was where they would find illicit cigarettes. It is for this reason and the stats I outlined earlier that I support this bill to enhance our enforcement agencies in relation to noncompliance. I commend the bill to the House.

Mr Giles:
  Hear, hear!




Mr Buchholz:
  We want you around for a long time!




The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Rob Mitchell
):  Thanks.




Mr SNOWDON:
  We'd like you to be here, son! As other members have outlined the details of the Tobacco Plain Packaging Amendment Bill 2018, I'm not going to do that other than to say that we on this side of the House are supporting it. However, I do want to commend the contribution made by the member for Macarthur in particular, a good friend and someone whose background is as a paediatrician, a doctor, who has had a lot of experience dealing with health matters across the community. He explained in a very detailed way the impacts on the health of individuals and on our community as a result of smoking. As others have said, in 2011 tobacco use was estimated to be responsible for nine per cent of the total burden of disease. That's a significant figure. Eighty per cent of lung cancer burden and 75 per cent of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease burden was attributable to tobacco use. I don't think there'd be many people in this place who wouldn't know either directly or indirectly a person, or persons, who has suffered immense trauma and an early death as a result of tobacco. There'd be very few among us.


The initiatives taken so long ago now for plain packaging were against the protestations of the industry. I remember vividly the remarkable attempts taken by the industry to oppose the legislation championed by the then Minister for Health, Nicola Roxon. The case was taken internationally to try and say that, somehow or another, this was illegal. It wasn't, and it was the best thing we could've done. But the concern I have is that we have to actually maintain our commitment to strategies to bring down tobacco consumption rates. I'm most particularly concerned about those people who have the most prevalent use of tobacco in the community. In this case, it is principally Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander smokers.


The comparisons are huge. The 2014-15 National Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Survey found 39 per cent of the combined Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population aged 15 and over were daily smokers compared with 14 per cent in the general population. The proportion of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people who were daily smokers aged 15 years and older was 39 per cent compared to 45 per cent in 2008 and 49 per cent in 2002. So there has been a reduction—and that's significant—and it's very important that the efforts continue. In 2002, 51 per cent of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander males aged 15 years and over were daily smokers. That daily smoking rate declined to 46 per cent in 2008 and 41 per cent in 2014-15.


They're good things, and there is other data which demonstrates that tobacco consumption is falling in Aboriginal communities, but when you compare it with the broader population the gap is not closing. It is because, as we've seen, the consumption rates amongst the general population—the non-Aboriginal population—have also fallen dramatically, but the gap has not closed.


When I contemplate this, I remember well the 2014-15 budget. In a previous government I was the minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health, and we initiated some measures around tobacco, prevention strategies, and funded them directly to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community health organisations and communities. Sadly, in their first budget after coming into government, the Abbott government, with then Prime Minister Abbott—now the envoy for God knows what—and then Treasurer, Mr Hockey, brought down a budget that cut $500 million out of expenditure for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, and $130 million of that was cut from the program for tackling Indigenous smoking, which was publicly disparaged by the then Treasurer.


Just so we understand the nature of this and the prevalence of tobacco consumption amongst Indigenous Australians: among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians between the ages of 15 and 27 male consumption is 34.4 per cent compared with 3.9 per cent for non-indigenous Australians and for women the figures are 26.5 per cent and 2.3 per cent. That demonstrates the difficulty that we are having in bringing down tobacco consumption rates amongst Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. You wouldn't think that a responsible government, or a government that purported to be responsible, and a Prime Minister who, we were told, would be a Prime Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians, would oversee a budget which cut $500 million out of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander programs, $130 million of which went directly to cutting the programs for tackling Indigenous smoking.


Do you reckon that, when the member for Warringah gets on whatever he's getting on to travel around Australia as an envoy and talks to whoever he is going to be talking to—and I don't know who he is going to be talking to—he might explain to them that he was responsible for overseeing a budget cut of over $500 million, which impacted every aspect of the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Australians? Do you reckon that he might tell them that he himself was responsible for overseeing a cut of $130 million out of the tackling tobacco program? You can imagine what he will do—and it certainly won't be that.


But, having said that, despite the absurdities of the government, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander health services around this country have been working diligently to bring down tobacco consumption rates. As the member for Macarthur pointed out, the direct health impacts are obvious to all of us and we have a responsibility to make sure that the funding is available to continue antismoking programs. I'm going to have to give up my position at this dispatch box, at least temporarily, in a very short time, but when I am back here, hopefully tomorrow or whenever else this debate is brought back on—



Government members interjecting—




Mr SNOWDON:
  You can wait in anticipation.



A government member:  We're going nowhere.




Mr SNOWDON:
  You'll be here a while. I will talk about a couple of specific programs that have been introduced by Aboriginal communities or organisations around the country which have had a dramatic and positive impact on reducing tobacco consumption in their communities.

"Thistlethwaite, Matt, MP",ALP,2018-09-11,"



Mr THISTLETHWAITE
 (Kingsford Smith) (19:30):  The New South Wales Liberals are planning to build a massive international passenger cruise ship terminal on the shores of Botany Bay. I've seen some crazy proposals in my time, but this one takes the cake. A cruise ship terminal at Yarra Bay or Molineaux Point would do massive environmental damage to Botany Bay. It would completely change the communities in my electorate of Kingsford Smith and of course it would result in even more traffic congestion on the already clogged streets that suffer from inadequate public transport and freight rail links to the nearby Sydney Airport and Port Botany. So why are the New South Wales Liberals contemplating this ridiculous development?


In July, then Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull made a captain's call to rule out the federal government owned Garden Island as the location for Sydney's next international cruise ship terminal. Garden Island was the preferred option of the New South Wales Liberals, who by the way spent $57 million on a new cruise terminal at White Bay near Balmain in 2013. There was only one problem with that: they didn't do their planning. Most of the modern cruise ships can't fit under the Harbour Bridge and so can't access the terminal that the Liberals spent $57 million on in 2013, so they needed to come up with a new solution. This means that Sydney simply doesn't have the capacity to deal with the surging demand for mega cruise ships in the harbour during the peak season of summer.


Garden Island was also the preferred option of the Cruise Industry Reference Group, headed by the former leader of the New South Wales Liberals, Peter Collins, who produced a significant report outlining why Garden Island was the most logical, practical location. And it makes sense. Passengers who are visiting Sydney on cruises want to come into the idyllic and historic Sydney Harbour, get off the boat there and visit the magnificent sites around the harbour. They don't want to land at Yarra Bay where, when they get off the boat, the first thing that they're confronted with is the local crematorium and cemetery and the Port Botany container terminal. Welcome to Sydney! That's not what people want from a cruising experience to Sydney. Mr Collins was quite scathing of the former Prime Minister when he said: 'I can guarantee you Malcolm Turnbull didn't even read the report. I don't think he really engaged with this issue.' And now the current Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, is refusing to inform the public about the Liberals' latest plans. The Prime Minister, as the member for Cook, represents an electorate that's on the other side of the bay from the electorate that I represent, so you'd think he'd have an understanding of the looming disaster that a cruise ship terminal nearby represents. Yet the SouthernCourier, our local newspaper, reports today that it contacted the Prime Minister's office on 29 August and had been chasing a response for over two weeks. It was only on Friday that the Prime Minister's office bothered to respond, saying, 'We won't be making comment on this at this moment.'


This is simply not good enough. Our community can't be left in the dark with such a vital issue as the future of Botany Bay. A cruise ship terminal at Yarra Bay would completely destroy the idyllic little beach that so many in our community enjoy on a daily basis and would definitely put the Yarra Bay Sailing Club at risk. Getting cruise ships into the area would require dredging Botany Bay. Yet again that would do massive environmental damage and pose an unacceptable risk to the pygmy pipehorse and woody sea dragon, which inhabit this part of the bay and are protected species under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. Whoever cooked up this crazy proposal has never been to Yarra Bay when there's a big swell running. I've seen waves and surf get half the way up the breakwall opposite Yarra Bay in a big swell, and they would easily smash a cruise liner into that breakwall in a big surf. All of this means that this proposal is unrealistic and would be too costly for any government to implement.


On Sunday, 23 September, Michael Daley and I will be holding a community forum at the Yarra Bay Sailing Club. We're encouraging those in our community who are opposed to a cruise ship terminal at Yarra Bay to come along and voice their opposition and let the New South Wales Liberal government know that we are opposed to this cruise ship terminal in Yarra Bay. There's also a petition against this proposal on my website that I encourage people to sign. On behalf of our community, I call on the Prime Minister and the Premier of New South Wales to rule out and reject this ridiculous proposal for a cruise ship terminal at Yarra Bay.

She's excited to be president of the business association for the year 2018-19 and is looking forward to growing the destination brand for Tooradin and the coastal villages region.


At the Tooradin Business Association meeting, I was delighted to listen to presentations by Jeff Weir, Executive Director of the Dolphin Research Institute, and Dr Pat McWhirter, Chair of the Healesville to Phillip Island Nature Link. In particular, it was fascinating to learn about the local marine life in Western Port Bay, which includes the beautiful weedy sea dragon. You may or may not know that that is a creature that is prevalent in Western Port Bay. It is actually in museums in Lisbon and on buses in New York, but it's something that people in Western Port Bay in Victoria wouldn't even know existed. Yet it's one of the most beautiful creatures in the oceans on the planet.



An honourable member interjecting—




Mr BYRNE:
  The weedy sea dragon—just remember that. We're claiming it, though. It was wonderful to hear the passion and the commitment of two of these leading experts. Dr Pat McWhirter was talking about the vegetation trail from the Dandenongs leading into Western Port Bay. It's the knowledge of these two experts that we're going to need to protect the environmental integrity of the Western Port Bay region, because surrounding Western Port Bay is one of the fastest growth belts in the country. It's something like 10 kilometres away from Cranbourne East. What does that mean? Cranbourne East is the fastest-growing suburb in Australia. On one hand, you have the fastest-growing area in Australia with all of those young families coming to live and make a life for themselves. On the other hand, you have this absolutely unique marine environment. And getting the mixture right in terms of getting the development but protecting the ecosystems is going to be absolutely essential to the integrity of that Western Port Bay and the Tooradin coastal village region. Thank you, Marlene, for making me feel so welcome at this business association dinner, and I look forward to working with you in the future.

The DEPUTY SPEAKER 

(
Mr Andrews
) (17:14):  Before calling the member for Gellibrand, I add my condolences to the family and friends of the late Senator John McCain. I met John McCain on a number of occasions, particularly when I was the defence minister. He was a man who led a remarkable life of great experience and learning. He was a wonderful patriot of his country—the United States of America—and a great advocate of freedom not just for Americans but for those around the world.

Mr WATTS
 (Gellibrand) (17:15):  Mr Deputy Speaker, well said. I rise in this Chamber today to recognise the life of Senator John Sidney McCain III, particularly his role as a friend of Australia and a friend of democracy. Australia's current ambassador to the United States, Joe Hockey, appropriately described John McCain as Australia's ally-in-chief. Indeed, it's difficult to think of another American leader with stronger ties throughout history to Australia.


Famously, the McCain family's relationship with Australia began when John McCain's grandfather sailed here in 1908 with the Great White Fleet. This continued when McCain's father visited as a submarine commander in World War II and was cemented through his service in Pacific Command, PACOM, during the Second World War. John himself served alongside Australians in the Vietnam War. More recently, John's own sons have served alongside Australian troops in Afghanistan and Iraq. The McCain family will always have a special place in the heart of Australians.


The senator has not been short on eulogies in recent times, and there's no need for me to recount his storied military and political career again here. It's worth saying briefly, however, that, had he never entered politics, John McCain would have lived a life worthy of recognition and admiration. John McCain's time as a prisoner of war in Vietnam showed that he was a man with a code. His refusal of early release from captivity after months of the most base torture—of wrenching physical pain and deprivation—showed him to be a man willing to sacrifice himself in service of the personal code. The fact that McCain was offered early release ahead of his fellow prisoners, the fact that this was offered to him alone by his Vietnamese captors as a consequence of his father's military rank and position—inconsistent with John McCain's personal code of honour—made it impossible for him to accept. It's worth dwelling on that act, on that decision, though. David Foster Wallace wrote:


… try to imagine that moment between getting offered early release and turning it down. 


Try to imagine it was you. Imagine how loudly your most basic, primal self-interest would have cried out to you in that moment, and all the ways you could rationalize accepting the offer. Can you hear it? If so, would you have refused to go?


You simply can't know for sure. None of us can. It's hard even to imagine the pain and fear in that moment, much less to know how you'd react. 


But, see, we do know how this man reacted. That he chose to spend four more years there, in a dark box, alone, tapping code on the walls to the others, rather than violate a Code. 


In this regard, John McCain's legacy is unimpeachable. Grappling with John McCain's political legacy, however, is a complex thing to do. To appropriate Walt Whitman, he contained multitudes. 


I did not share his political values. Indeed, I entered politics to defeat the majority of the things that he believed in. Importantly, John McCain was an advocate of the US intervention in Iraq—the greatest foreign policy mistake of my lifetime, an intervention opposed by my political party and an intervention that we must recognise caused immeasurable human suffering and unleashed geostrategic consequences that we are far from seeing the end of a decade and a half later.


While I believe that John McCain's intentions and conduct in advocacy of this intervention were honourable, this calamitous mistake will always be a part of the legacy of all those who were involved in it. Despite this, I believe that this mistake was made in pursuit of admirable instincts that as Australians we should honour. John McCain always fought American isolationism. He believed that America had a role to play in defending the liberal international order and he argued strongly for this stance in the domestic US political debate—not an easy thing to do. For this Australians can be enormously thankful, because a United States that is engaged with the world and engaged in supporting a rules based international order is overwhelmingly in Australia's interest, and the world is a better place for it as well.


In addition to being a friend of Australia, John McCain was a friend of representative democracy at home and abroad. His willingness to work with his political opponents to implement campaign finance reform in the United States and attempt to dull the influence of money over people in the political process is a tribute to his commitment to that democratic process. Similarly, his staunch opposition to torture in all of its forms and his refusal to allow the United States to degrade itself in its practice, put democratic agency above coercive force.


In a time when our politics is being threatened by the forces of authoritarianism and nativism, John McCain was a beacon for a politics defined by the contest of ideas, the advocacy of high ideals and the give and take of political compromise. I was pleased to meet him on his latest visit to Australia—a visit that gave powerful symbolism to the fact that the relationship between Australia and the US is bigger than, broader than and stronger than any individual President. I'm confident that he will be the only US Republican to address a Labor caucus during my political career. I'm happy to say that I enjoyed his contributions.


In many ways, when viewed from Down Under, John McCain was a living embodiment of the United States: a magnificent, imperfect enterprise and a symbol that could inspire with the pursuit of lofty ideals and frustrate when those higher hopes were not realised. On his last visit to Australia, John McCain asked Australians to persevere with America through the current tests that it is enduring. He asked Australia to:


… encourage us to stay true to who we are at our best … and to remind us just how much is at stake.


John McCain himself was a living embodiment of this call. We honour him here in this place. Vale.

"Joyce, Barnaby, MP",Nats,2018-09-11,"



Mr JOYCE
 (New England) (17:21):  There are few times when you meet a great person, and I believe that one of the greatest people I've ever had the privilege to meet was Senator John McCain of Arizona. Senator John McCain was the son and the grandson of naval admirals. What epitomised his life, though, was the exemplary nature of his bravery and his capacity to stand against impertinent forces and the status quo when required and as required. Senator John McCain was no saint. He was far from it. He had, one would say in polite terms, a very colourful life in his early life. He was married twice. 


But what we all note, and what illustrates this, is the bravery he showed after being shot down over Hanoi—when he became a prisoner of war. It's been noted by previous speakers what he endured in solitary confinement for five years. He was fed a diet of a form of pumpkin soup and bread. When they found out his father was an admiral, he refused to take what was offered to him and go home, because he believed that others who were in more need had always to go first. He was hung from the roof by ropes. He was tortured. Later on in life he was one of the first people to stand up against the excesses of Guantanamo Bay and to make sure that America was not a participant in such things as waterboarding. He was always a person who could be relied upon to speak the brave part.


One also notes, and it will be noted a number of times, that when a lady accused then Presidential nominee Barack Obama of being an Arab, in front of a partisan crowd which could so easily have been moved to an animal intent, he decided instead to stand up and say the truth. These are the sort of qualities which would embellish any political career. It's one of the reasons, when I heard of the death of Senator John McCain at 82 from brain cancer, I thought that if I had an opportunity to say my part, I would definitely take that opportunity. Senator McCain went home and said, 'I'm going to die.' That was basically it. There was no grand plan or great finale. It was another statement of the bravery of this individual. 


In his previous life, the time he was shot down over Hanoi wasn't the first time he was injured. He was also part of a major accident where over 130 were killed on an aircraft carrier. His grandfather had been instrumental in the use of aircraft carriers in the Pacific during the Second World War. On this occasion, a missile was accidentally sent off. It hit a fuel drum beside his plane, and he had to roll across the thing and got terribly burnt. Later on, by reason of his torture in Hanoi, he was unable to put his hands above his head. He had to get someone else to comb his hair. Yet he never used that as a mechanism to sit down and wallow in his grief. He was always going forward.


In my conversation with Senator John McCain—and it's such an honour to be able to say 'in my conversation with Senator John McCain'—he was a person who had a real spark to what he could do. You could see he had lived an interesting and full life. He had grabbed life with both hands, in bravery, in struggle, in politics, in love and in life. When he went out with his colleagues, they said it was one of the wildest experiences in their lives as to where they would end up, because that's what he was: he was full on, as we would say. In my discussions with him, he looked at me and said, 'Did you play rugby?' which was pretty astute, because I had. I played it for about 21 years. He had a passion for rugby. It was a game that I would have thought he wouldn't know much about. It was yet another form of where there was something about him. What you saw when you were meeting someone who I believe was a global giant was a person of humility. He met people as they walked up to him. He didn't stand on a podium when he was speaking to you one on one. He spoke to you as a person. He was accepted by both sides and spoke to both sides of politics when he was here in Canberra.


Even though he had a large and colourful life, he had a deep faith, and he utilised that, I think, for the best mechanisms. His vision of the United States of America's position in the world was to be an article that promoted the rule of law, justice and right. He said America would be noted for its military strength but, more than its military strength, it would be noted for its ideals. Its ideals were the issues that he believed were vastly more pertinent in affecting global affairs than its armaments. But he realised you had to have them both.


No person is perfect in their foreign policy, but he had a strong view on where right and wrong are. He obviously had strong questions about what President Trump did, but I think he only voted against two of Trump's bills—I may need to be corrected there. But what he didn't agree with was what he believed was the loss of dignity in the presidential office that was coming about by reason of some of the more extreme statements of President Trump. He thought that that was taking away from the dignity of the presidential office. I have to stand by that. I was disgusted when President Trump disparaged his military service. I think that was a disgrace. I would hope—and of course he's not going to listen—that at some stage President Trump will apologise directly for that. Maybe he will. He tweets at two in the morning. Maybe he's listening now.


If we can borrow something from this, it is that a good politician is not a pastor or a priest but a person of full life, and Senator McCain aptly represented that. With a person of bravery, you will find their bravery permeates through many sections of their life, and Senator McCain represented that. A person who has a love of their nation has a love of their nation to the very last breath. When he was voting on issues that he believed in and being taken back to the Senate to do it, Senator McCain of Arizona represented that. A person should be accepted for both their strengths and their weaknesses and the wider encumbrance of human nature, and Senator McCain was a display of that.


I will always treasure the brief time that I had in discussion with someone I think of as a political giant. He was a person who had to live in the shadow of exceptional people, they being his father and grandfather, but you would have to say he exceeded them in the end. When he went through his military training he came, I think, 854th. He was four from the bottom. He was not noted as an exemplary student. He showed perseverance in his personal life, aspiring always to be a better person, and had an intense love of his nation. But it was a love of his nation which didn't cloud his ideals and the better angels of his nature—the better angels we should always give way to, rather than the more base implications of the human condition in any form.


I hope that Senator McCain's family, including his mother, who's 106, manage to take some solace from the giant of a life that is represented by Senator John McCain. Obviously, he was a man of Christian faith. Borrowing from the same, I wish that he remain in our prayers and that he rest in peace.

Mr MARLES
 (Corio) (17:31):  I rise this evening in praise of Senator John McCain, a friend of Australia, a political giant and a global statesman. In an era when populism was on the rise throughout the democratic world, in an era of faux conviction, John McCain stood as a beacon for those who seek to pursue politics in a thoughtful and courageous way. He was an embodiment of the idea that public service through political life is a noble profession. For all of us here across the political divide and, I think, throughout the democratic world, he stands as an inspiration.


Senator John McCain's family calling was military service. His grandfather and father were the first father and son combination in the US navy who both served as four-star admirals: John Sidney McCain and Jack McCain Jr. Both served, in one way or another, in the Pacific theatre, which, in a way, began John McCain's connection with Australia. His own military service commenced with graduation from naval college in Annapolis in 1958 and from flight school in 1960. Of course, the story of his being shot down over Hanoi in 1967 and his subsequent 5½ years in captivity in Hanoi is the stuff of legend. When he ejected from that plane he broke both legs and a shoulder. He was bayonetted in the groin by the crowd that pulled him from the lake. He was then left untreated for a week in Hoa Lo prison in Hanoi. When the fractures were ultimately treated, it was done without anaesthetic.


Soon after his capture, it became apparent to the North Vietnamese that John McCain's father was an admiral. He was offered release but, in a sense, it was on condition of him condemning his country—something he would not do. He refused that release because of the US military's code of conduct, which says that POWs should be released in the order in which they were captured. So, over 5½ years, he endured, at times, solitary confinement and torture, during which his ribs were broken, his arms were rebroken and his teeth were knocked out.


In 1974, McCain revisited South Vietnam. That visit said something about a feature of John McCain that characterised his life thereafter: generosity towards those who were his foes. As the member for New England said, he had an irresistible attachment to the better angels of human nature. When he returned in 1974, he attended a speech by an aid of President Thieu of South Vietnam, who said that the sacrifice of those who had served as prisoners of war could never be compensated, but if there was anything that could be provided by South Vietnam, or if there was anywhere or anybody that any of these former prisoners of war wanted to see or visit then South Vietnam was at their service. John McCain asked to visit one place: Con Son Island. It was the place in South Vietnam where North Vietnamese prisoners of war were held. He wanted to visit that place to see what state North Vietnamese prisoners of war were kept in. As he said, he had reluctantly become an expert in the way North Vietnam treated prisoners of war. He wanted to see the way in which this was done in South Vietnam. Indeed, after that visit, he came back noting that the conditions were not as bad as in North Vietnam, but they were far from perfect, and he made a range of recommendations in respect of that.


His political career is enormous. From 1983 through to this year, he served in the Congress, in both the House of Representatives and the Senate. In the year 2000, he sought the Republican nomination, losing, ultimately, to George W Bush, and, in 2008, he won the Republican nomination and contested that presidential election against Barack Obama. He was a fighter for everything from campaign reform through to America being an outward looking nation that took a leadership role within the world. Throughout his political career, he demonstrated a selfless, courageous dignity and a generosity for his opponent which marked him out as somebody who was special in the political domain. As has been said, during the presidential election campaign with Barack Obama, there was a woman at a rally who suggested that then candidate Obama was an Arab, and Senator McCain said, 'No, ma'am. He’s a decent family man, a citizen that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues, and that’s what this campaign is all about.' Rather than turning up the political heat, he sought to define the political contest. It's not about individual on individual; it is about a contest of ideas.


The fact that at his funeral there were eulogies from President Obama, President George W Bush and Vice President Joe Biden, who were all, at times, opponents, but ultimately people who I suspect Senator McCain would regard as colleagues, says everything about the giant that Senator McCain was. Indeed, Joe Biden described this as the McCain code: a fierce contest of ideas, but a complete respect for the sincerity with which ideas are put into the political domain. It is something from which all of us practising politics today can learn.


Senator McCain was a great friend of Australia. His grandfather served in the Pacific theatre during the Second World War, as did his father, who, as a submarine commander, spent time in Perth. His sons have also served in the military alongside Australians in both Afghanistan and Iraq. 


At the beginning of last year, when Prime Minister Turnbull had a difficult initial conversation with President Trump, it was Senator McCain who immediately came out to make clear the significance of the Australian relationship to America. He said:


Australia fought alongside us in wars, including losing over 500 brave Australians in the Vietnam War, which some of us remember. This, in my view, was an unnecessary and, frankly, harmful open dispute over an issue which is not nearly as important as United States/Australian cooperation, working together, including training of our Marines in Australia and other areas of military cooperation and intelligence.


As the member for New England noted, President Trump described Senator McCain in these terms:


He's not a war hero. He was a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured.


This was an appalling statement to make about an American who was unquestionably a hero. But, despite that, there was a generosity from Senator McCain even in respect of President Trump. He visited Australia in May of 2017. Like the member for New England, I had the enormous honour of meeting McCain on that visit. In the United States Studies Centre in Sydney, he said this:


You will not agree with all of the president's decisions. Neither will I. But I am fully committed to doing whatever I can to help my country and my president succeed in the world. And I would beseech all of you to join me and help me.


This was generosity of spirit indeed.


Within two months of visiting Australia, Senator McCain was diagnosed with brain cancer. His death is a loss to all of us. I think that, for all of us who seek to serve in this place and to represent people in democratic societies, Senator John McCain, in his life, stands as the personification of dignity and the personification of what it is to provide service to our communities in a generous way, a way which puts them at the centre of our thoughts and a way which does not indulge populism, the darker angels of our nature or a contest which isn't real. John McCain is absolutely a hero, and John McCain is an inspiration to us all.

"Falinski, Jason, MP",LP,2018-09-11,"



Mr FALINSKI
 (Mackellar) (17:41):  It is with great sadness that I rise to acknowledge the passing of the late United States Senator John McCain. On this day 17 years ago, 11 September 2001, Australians woke up to the news of a terrible tragedy that had been thrust on our friends in America. Three thousand innocent people lost their lives in coordinated terrorist attacks across the United States. It is poignant that on this day we recognise a friend of Australia in Senator John McCain. Senator McCain led a life dedicated to service. Whether we look at his early military career, his experience in the Vietnam War or his extensive contributions to political life, it is plain to see that John McCain was a man who always put service to others first. The Prime Minister has already remarked that it is unusual for this House to express condolences for foreign politicians who are not heads of state. But it is right and proper to make an exception for Senator John McCain, a man who defined an era of the modern Republican Party, a defender of truth and a staunch friend and ally of Australia.


There have been many tributes to Senator McCain in the past weeks, flowing from right across the political spectrum. Various eulogies have remembered him as a war hero, a statesman and an American icon. But, importantly, there has been a universal recognition that John McCain was a man of integrity with strong principles. Former President George W Bush remarked:


John was, above all, a man with a code. He lived by a set of public virtues that brought strength and purpose to his life and to his country.


It was this code which informed so much of Senator McCain's political outlook, his courage, his love of freedom and, most of all, his recognition that some principles and beliefs are so fundamentally important that they transcend politics and party lines. Senator McCain's determination to always put the interests of the nation first earned him a reputation as a political maverick, but it also manifested itself in his commitment to bipartisanship and in his great ability to reach across the political divide, uniting those from different backgrounds and ideologies in pursuit of common cause.


This sense of duty and service to the nation runs deep in the McCain family, with four generations of McCains having served in the armed forces. Senator McCain's grandfather, John S McCain Sr, was an admiral in the United States Navy who was involved in several assignments during the Pacific campaign of World War II which were critical to the defence of Australia, including the Guadalcanal campaign. Senator McCain's father, John S McCain Jr, was a submarine captain active in the Pacific campaign of World War II. Later he was promoted to admiral, becoming Commander-in-Chief, Pacific Command, during the Vietnam War. Since then, three of Senator McCain's own children, Jack, James and Douglas, have served in the armed forces, with Jack and James undertaking tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan alongside Australian soldiers.


Senator McCain's own service in the Vietnam War would prove to be a defining moment in his life and a test of his character. During a bombing mission in 1967 McCain's A-4E Skyhawk was shot down over Hanoi, and during ejection from the aircraft he suffered fractures in both of his arms and one of his legs. McCain was subsequently captured by North Vietnamese forces and would receive the most marginal of medical care over the next 5½ years of his life as a prisoner of war, two of which he spent in solitary confinement. In fact, far from receiving medical treatment, McCain was repeatedly interrogated and tortured by his captors, who were seeking to extract information or a confession to be used for anti-US propaganda purposes. The injuries he sustained during this time would leave him with a permanent limp and impaired mobility in his arms. Even in the face of such extreme adversity, John McCain's courage, strength and determination did not waiver, and he again proved himself a man of principle. Upon discovering he was the son of a United States Navy admiral, the Vietnamese hoped to score a propaganda victory by offering McCain early release, but in keeping with the code of the United States fighting forces McCain refused the offer on the condition that he would only accept it if every man captured before him was released as well.


Through his unique family history, Senator McCain knew better than most the important role of the United States in the Asia-Pacific region, and he was a vocal and passionate supporter of the Australia-United States alliance. It was a position he maintained throughout his 35-year political career. He was a proud champion of our bilateral defence relationship, most recently in his role as chair of the powerful US Senate armed services committee. Just last year, Senator McCain was in Sydney to address the United States Studies Centre. In his remarks he reflected on the shared sacrifices of American and Australian soldiers over a century and emphasised the shared values of Australia and the United States. In his own words:


… America's greatest strength comes from the values of our society, values we share with Australia—our commitment to truth over falsehood, fairness over injustice, freedom over oppression, and the immortal spirit of humankind.


These remarks were typical of John McCain's brand of politics, one characterised by a vision of America carried onwards and upwards by the strength of its principles. This idealism is a far cry from the hyperpartisan atmosphere that we find in Washington today.


If we reflect on John McCain's life in politics, we can see that he never shied away from doing what he believed to be right in service of these principles. Entering politics as a congressman, representing Arizona's 1st congressional district in 1982, McCain served on the US House of Representatives committee on interior affairs and the foreign affairs committee while taking an active interest in foreign policy of the Reagan administration. Even in the early stages of his career McCain demonstrated that he was not afraid to speak his mind, when he criticised President Reagan for his delay in pulling troops out of Lebanon. In 1987 McCain made the move to the Senate, succeeding Barry Goldwater as a senator for Arizona, a position he would be re-elected to six times. During his Senate career, McCain would serve on the Senate Select Committee on POW/MIA Affairs, which was chaired by Democrat and fellow Vietnam War veteran John Kerry. During his time on this committee, McCain and his fellow committee members investigated the fate of US service personnel listed as missing in action during the Vietnam War. They handed down a unanimous report concluding that there was no compelling evidence suggesting any Americans were left still alive and in captivity. This, coupled with a 1994 Senate resolution co-sponsored by McCain and Kerry calling for an end to the existing trade embargo against Vietnam, helped lay the groundwork for President Clinton to normalise diplomatic relationships with Vietnam in 1995. This was a move that Senator McCain was strongly supportive of. He stuck to his principles in spite of vilification by many POWs and activists and of his own experiences as a prisoner of war.


This is just one example of Senator McCain's decency and magnanimity. As a the Republican presidential nominee in 2008, Senator McCain famously defended his rival, Barack Obama, against a voter's assertion that Senator Obama was untrustworthy, because of her belief that he was an Arab. John McCain's response was:


No ma'am, he's a decent family man, a citizen that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues …


Politics has changed a lot in the decade since Senator McCain ran against Barack Obama in 2008. Sometimes it seems as if the politics of John McCain are the product of a bygone era. As elected representatives we must honour his legacy by remembering that our No. 1 duty is to serve our communities. Even in his final years, when his health was ailing, John McCain was still steadfast in speaking out for what he believed to be right.

Mr KHALIL
 (Wills) (17:51):  I'm also pleased to add my condolences for the late John Sidney McCain III, who passed away on 27 August at the age of 81. John McCain served his country, the United States of America, for 60 years, six decades, in various forms of public service—a remarkable record. As we've heard from previous speakers, he was undoubtedly a man of immense courage and conviction. It's probably true to say that this courage and conviction was forged in his experience as a naval aviator in the US Navy and in particular the events of 26 October 1967. We've heard much about their significance in the weeks since his passing. As other speakers, including the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition, have described, it was on this day that McCain was flying a bombing mission over North Vietnam in his A-4E Skyhawk and was shot down by missile over Hanoi. He fractured both arms and a leg when he ejected from the aircraft, and he nearly drowned after he parachuted into Truc Bach Lake. He was pulled ashore and was beaten and bayonetted by North Vietnamese forces before being transported to Hanoi's main prison, Hoa Lo Prison, nicknamed 'the Hanoi Hilton', where he was to spend two excruciatingly painful years in solitary confinement. He refused a North Vietnamese offer to release him, which was largely, as we've heard, for propaganda purposes, given his father was an admiral. He then remained a POW until 1973.


We often ask what drives a person to carry on in those dark moments that he would have faced. By his own admission sometimes he was unable to carry on, but he has said publicly many times—and we heard during the eulogies at his funeral from many of his friends, family and colleagues—that what kept him going through those darkest moments was his faith in his country, his faith in his fellow servicemen and servicewomen and his faith in God. It's difficult to understand or even imagine the pain he would have gone through during those dark years.


Within a decade of his release he'd been elected to the US House of Representatives. Some might comment that he has gone from that terrible experience into politics, which is also a very difficult experience, as we know, but probably a walk in the park for John McCain, given the resilience that he'd built up from what he had been through and how his courage was forged in those years. He gained a reputation as a foreign policy hawk, yes, but also as someone who was willing to go it alone to be a maverick. He became a six-time senator in Arizona, as we've heard, a position he held until his passing. He was also a presidential candidate in 2008 and, more importantly, a statesman—which is very rare in today's politics. He was also a great friend of our nation—truly one of the greatest champions of the Australia-US alliance of the past 70 years. 


I mentioned his tilt at the presidency in 2008. Of course, history records that Senator McCain did not succeed in his attempt to become President of the United States. He was beaten by the Democratic candidate, Barack Obama. But it was actually President Obama, who was once a fierce political opponent of Senator McCain, who put it so eloquently when he eulogised at the memorial service, saying:


John McCain and I were members of different generations, came from completely different backgrounds, and competed at the highest level of politics. But we shared, for all our differences, a fidelity to something higher—the ideals for which generations of Americans and immigrants alike have fought, marched, and sacrificed. We saw our political battles, even, as a privilege, something noble, an opportunity to serve as stewards of those high ideals at home, and to advance them around the world. We saw this country as a place where anything is possible—and citizenship as our patriotic obligation to ensure it forever remains that way.


We've heard from previous speakers about the character of John McCain in those difficult moments, as we would know, in politics, in the middle of a campaign, no less than a presidential campaign. We've heard this story time and time again. A voter at a town hall meeting said she couldn't trust Obama because he was an Arab. Well, there's nothing wrong with being an Arab. And John McCain knows that and throughout his career always fought on the side of individuals regardless of their race, their ethnicity or their gender. Whether they were an Arab, a Muslim or an Asian, it didn't matter to John McCain; he treated people based on their character. In relation to Barack Obama, he said to that lady, as we've heard, 'No, ma'am, he's a decent family man, a citizen that I just happen to have disagreements with on fundamental issues, and that's what this campaign is all about.' In fact, I think that's what politics should be all about—that example that he set for us, that we judge each other based on the content of our character, on what we do and what we say, and on our actions, rather than the parts of us that might form our identity based on the colour of our skin, our gender or our religion or our faith. These things are important, but they are not to judge each other by. These are things that we have and we cherish, as John McCain cherished. But he judged and treated others based on their character and the content of that character. 


He believed deeply in American power as a force for good in the world. He believed the US had unique responsibilities to lead in the world, both through action and by example. So he supported strong alliances, a robust military and the promotion of democracy and human rights in places around the world where they were lacking. Where there were freedom fighters, he was there. He was supportive. On that basis, the US-Australia alliance was particularly significant in his mind. In remarks he made to the US Senate Committee on Armed Services, he described Australia as:


… one of America’s oldest friends and staunchest allies. We are united by ties of family and friendship, mutual interests and common values, and shared sacrifice in wartime.


That has a personal resonance for me because my wife is American and we met in Iraq in the middle of a war. So I understand those bonds that have been forged between Australia and the US very much at a personal level. 


John McCain had a deep and enduring affection for our country, for Australia. It was inspired by his father—a submarine commander based out of Perth during World War II. Of his father, he said in April last year:


I can't tell you the times he would tell me about what an incredible experience it was for him and the hospitality of the Australian people and the great affection and respect back then he had for the Australian military. 


That was said on what was to be his last visit to Australia. I note, too, that he visited our parliament during that visit. I and many of my colleagues here had the opportunity and the honour to meet with him on several occasions. He actually addressed the Labor Party caucus, which was a fantastic experience. A number of MPs on both sides of politics got to sit down with Senator McCain to have a really robust discussion about our place in the world and our alliance, and the challenges that we face in the Indo-Pacific. It was a real joy to have that conversation with someone with such great experience. Then and at other times, he said of our alliance, 'This alliance between our countries is more important than ever, because we have fought and sacrificed side by side for a long time, and it is a unique relationship in that respect.' Cameron Stewart, who writes for The Australian, last week described John McCain as Australia's closest friend in Washington. That's probably true. We haven't had a better friend than John McCain in the US. Indeed, he was one of our closest friends, if not the closest friend that we've had. So we will miss him. Vale John McCain. May he rest in peace.

Mr BUCHHOLZ
 (Wright—Assistant Minister for Roads and Transport) (18:00):  Firstly, I'd like to acknowledge the House for allowing these condolence speeches. It is not normal practice for this House to take condolences on someone other than an Australian or a head of state. So I'd like to acknowledge the Leader of the House and the Manager of Opposition Business for leaving way for Senator John McCain to be acknowledged in this Chamber.


I had the good fortune of meeting John in 2008 when I signed up with the LNP in Queensland to attend the Art of Political Campaigning tour in Washington. Basically, conservative governments or politicians from all around the globe landed in Washington under the auspices of the Art of Political Campaigning. There were some amazing speakers. While we were there, we were given the opportunity to go and lick stamps and just get an idea of how big the campaign machine is in the Americas. They spend a lot of money. Jingo, they spend a lot of money! McCain—John—made a point of coming through and spending some time with us. With all of his achievements that members of this House have acknowledged—and I don't intend to laboriously repeat all of those amazing feats of heroism—he was a humble man. There were five of us in the delegation from Australia, and we had some type of baggage or insignia on us that indicated that we were from Australia. He said, 'Have you guys come all the way to help?' We said, 'Yes, we have, because we believe in the cause.' He said, 'Well, you're patriots for conservatism,' and we said: 'There are elections all the time here in America, but we don't come to all of them. There are only some we come to, and we believe in you.'


Members of this House have role models or political heroes—not war heroes but political heroes. I'm just fortunate, that McCain—John—is one of my political heroes. He was humble, and you know what? He also had a very good memory. When he returned to Australia, as the previous speaker said, he addressed the Labor caucus and also addressed our party room. The member for Canning, Andrew Hastie from Western Australia, who's also a previous serving military person, got up and asked some question with a military background. McCain rose to the occasion and answered it, and he said to the member for Canning—and I'm sure I won't be betraying any confidences about what gets said in the party room—'God, if I looked as good as you, I might have gone further politically,' offering the honourable member for Canning a compliment on his chiselled jaw and that. So he also demonstrated an incredible wit and capacity. When he addressed our room, you knew that you were in the presence of someone who could command a room through the prism of oratory. He had a commanding presence. He commanded through integrity, dignity and just a sense of realism. As Australians, we can smell bullshit coming a mile away, and John McCain was one of those guys that resonated.


I sometimes feel embarrassed when offering words of affirmation to those that have passed from this earth. Why didn't I have the courage to offer these words of encouragement and affirmation to these amazing people when they were alive so that they would find the enthusiasm to continue to do what they do? Maybe, as a result of today, I'll become a little bit more creative in that space and put pen to paper, or, when I have the opportunity to come across those that I admire, I will offer my thoughts probably a bit more readily than I do.


McCain left behind a family, as was said earlier on. I'm not going to just run through the correspondence that all members have already alluded to. But for a child to lose their father and for a wife to lose their husband is painful. It is painful. His mum is still alive. She's 106 or something.



An honourable member interjecting—




Mr BUCHHOLZ:
  She has passed away, has she?



An honourable member interjecting—




Mr BUCHHOLZ:
  Yes, I believe she is still alive. In the English language, when a child loses a parent they become an orphan and when a wife loses her husband she becomes a widow, but there's no word for when a parent loses a child, because it is not supposed to happen. It's against nature. My heart goes to John's mum; his first wife, Carol; his wife, Cindy; and his kids—Doug, who is now 58; Andy, who is 56; Sidney, who is 51; Meghan; Jack; Jim; and Bridget. Each of the kids were touched on in speeches before.


I commend and associate myself with the comments from this room that have honoured and offered affirmation to Senator John McCain. I think all of us will be stronger politicians, better able to make contributions to our country and patriots if we take a little bit of John McCain and weave it into who we are. I thank the House. I offer my condolences. Rest in peace, John.

"Gosling, Luke, MP",ALP,2018-09-11,"



Mr GOSLING
 (Solomon) (18:06):  John McCain was a patriot, a distinguished military officer and a great friend of Australia. I was privileged to meet him when he visited Australia last year. He spoke of his long friendship with Australia. As we have heard from previous speakers, his father served here as a submarine commander in World War II. I think John McCain was the embodiment of Australia's friendship and alliance with the United States. I saw that closeness that we have with the United States in southern Afghanistan and in Timor-Leste. I now see it in Darwin and Palmerston, which are in the electorate I represent and which are very proud to be hosting US service personnel.


Our great wartime Prime Minister John Curtin said: 


Without any inhibitions of any kind, I make it quite clear that Australia looks to America, free of any pangs as to our traditional links or kinship with the United Kingdom.


That statement changed the course of Australian history and it changed the course of American history. We faced very serious challenges together in World War II. We saw in my electorate in Darwin the loss of US sailors, US soldiers and US airmen. We now face vastly different geopolitical challenges. However, in Darwin we are acutely aware of this shared identity and we commemorate it every year.


John McCain understood the great military and economic significance of Darwin being close to the great trading routes of the world, particularly during this incredible time with the rise of China, India and Indonesia. John McCain knew this and he understood that our ADF presence in Darwin and the Top End was incredibly important and was very significant. I told him how pleased and honoured we were to be hosting US marines in Darwin, and he thought that was great.


Recently, in my electorate, I spoke to a group of defence industry representatives, a mixture of Australian and American businesspeople, including a gentleman who had been working as a United States contractor for many, many decades. During my presentation, I passed on to the people of the United States my condolences on the passing of John McCain. And when this American gentleman got up to speak, he thanked me for passing on those condolences and he shared a memory that he had of the former senator. He talked about being in a plane flying across the United States. He went down to the toilets at the back of the plane, and he was surprised to see John McCain there chatting with a couple of blokes, a couple of ordinary Americans. He said, 'Senator, what are you doing down here?' And McCain said, 'I'm just talking to these fine American patriots.' And he says they were just ordinary blokes.


Other speakers have alluded to McCain's presence when he spoke to both caucuses. It was real; it was palpable. He was a man of presence, but that short story from an American colleague in Darwin just a couple of weeks ago really opened up another insight into the man, John McCain, in that he believed in people. And he didn't stand up on a soapbox and think he was better than anyone else. He was just proud to serve. Our Labor leader, Bill Shorten, said yesterday that John McCain was an example to us here in Australia, and I think that's very true. John McCain was a friend of Australia because he saw us as an important ally but also because he believed that we share a moral responsibility to advance the cause of freedom around the world.


John McCain's was a courageous life, an honourable life, a life well lived. He's an example of service. Sometimes people ask me, 'Why politics?' Particularly when I catch up with people that I served with in the military, they say, 'Gos, why politics?' And I say, honestly, that I see politics as an extension of service to our country. I think John McCain was a great example of that. Like the previous speaker, I won't go into the details of his service life, but, as someone whose father served in Vietnam and lost mates and whose father's father served in the Second World War and lost mates, his story resonates with me. I think it's been an important initiative to allow this condolence motion.


I want to end with Barack Obama's words from his eulogy to John McCain, because, as many members probably understand and appreciate, there's an old saying that you never really know someone well until you've had a blue with them. That's when you really get to know someone—the real person. And you could say that about politics. When we enter into these political contests every 2½ or three years or what have you, you really get to know those opposite. We get to know each other. Former President Barack Obama—who, having gone through a presidential election race against John McCain, I think knew the man perhaps better than most—said:


What better way to honor John McCain's life of service than, as best we can, follow his example?


To prove that the willingness to get in the arena and fight for this country is not reserved for the few, it is open to all of us, that in fact it's demanded of all of us, as citizens of this great republic?


That's perhaps how we honor him best—by recognizing that there are some things bigger than party, or ambition, or money, or fame or power. That there are some things that are worth risking everything for. Principles that are eternal. Truths that are abiding.


At his best, John showed us what that means. For that, we are all deeply in his debt.


May God bless John McCain, and may God bless this country he served so well.

Mr TIM WILSON
 (Goldstein) (18:15):  It's my privilege to be able to rise and speak to honour the life of service of Senator John McCain, the true heir to the conscience of a conservative. Many will be able to easily recount his biography and time of service in the defence forces and in politics. Today I simply offer my own short personal reflections. I have always thought it was a great tragedy that in 2000 he was not the Republican candidate to be President of the United States. His reputation preceded him. His legacy and honour of service to his country was something that most candidates for political office could only dream of not just because of its capacity to add to electoral success but because it showed a window into his character. He understood that when much is given, much is expected. Much was expected of him. I believe the world has always been worse off because of the scurrilous rumours and dirty campaigning which derailed his bid for that office, so much so that in 2000—

"Neumann, Shayne, MP",ALP,2018-09-11,"



Mr NEUMANN
 (Blair) (18:30):  This government is divided, unstable and illegitimate. They seem very much focused on fighting amongst themselves, and they're a chaos and a rabble, but they seem to agree on one thing and one thing only—sorry, besides attacks on trade unions who represent workers in the workplace. They seem absolutely committed to cuts to education, to health and to penalty rates, and they seem to be focused on making sure that working-class and middle-class people don't get access to the kind of services they need. In the last couple of weeks, the Prime Minister, the third one in the last five years, has undertaken a valiant attempt to hide from the previous five years. Paul Bongiorno, a respected journalist, describes it as follows:


The new man at the helm is counting on voter amnesia. He insists ""the curtain has come down on that Muppet Show"".


It's an extraordinary attempt by this government to just put aside the previous budgets of the then Treasurer, the former member for North Sydney—smoking, joking Joe, as he was on that occasion—and the cuts, as a result of the Commission of Audit, to education, to health, to social security and to a whole range of areas. It's those things which I'm most aggrieved by with this government. We've seen surgeries delayed, we've seen nurse and doctor numbers decline, and we've seen emergency departments under increasing pressure with increasing delays as a result of the $160 million in cuts to public hospitals in my home state of Queensland from 2017 to 2020. That's equivalent to 240,000 emergency department visits, 44,000 cataract extractions, 6,150 knee replacements and 26,500 births.


It has impact locally in my electorate, and that's why I'm so aggrieved. Locally, in my electorate, I want to commend the Ipswich and West Moreton health and hospital services for the work they do. I was recently at the awards night at the North Ipswich railway museum to see the great work that doctors, nurses and other people, including the Queensland Police Service, undertake in the delivery of essential services. The relationship and coordination of essential services like the Queensland Police Service and the health and hospital services are to be commended. But it's quite clear that this government, the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government, has cut $4.71 million from local public hospitals in my area, including $4.53 million from the Ipswich Hospital. This is the most critical hospital. In the same way the Toowoomba base hospital is really important in the Darling Downs region, the Ipswich general hospital is really critical to people who live in the West Moreton region. There has been a cut of $80,000 to the Esk Hospital, an important hospital up in the Somerset region. In the north, $100,000 has been cut from the Kilcoy Hospital. Every dollar cut from public hospitals is a dollar cut from sick and vulnerable patients. In these country communities in my electorate, people rely on these public hospitals to provide health care and to make sure people get the services they need. Access, as Labor always says, to good health services should not be determined by your credit card but by your Medicare card.


I was pleased recently to catch up with my good friend and mentor Bill Hayden, the former opposition leader, on Sunday. I was pleased to see him in good health and have some of his friends and colleagues commend him, because we would not have had Medicare in this country without Bill Hayden. He was the one who brought in Medibank during the Whitlam Labor government. It is really crucial that that sort of universal healthcare be maintained, and this government doesn't seem to be as committed as it ought to be.


Locally in my electorate there's another issue which is irritating people enormously, and that's aged care. The release of the latest data on home care packages from this government revealed 108,000 older Australians are languishing in the waiting list for home care. I experience this regularly as constituents come and see me or I visit some of them in their homes. That number includes about 88,000 older Australians with high needs, many of them living with dementia, who are being looked after by churches, charities, family members and friends. I was really cross with the current government because they delayed the release of the data in relation to this matter for a long time. We had to wait for it to be released.


The government can find billions of dollars in tax cuts for big banks, yet the budget that was handed down for aged care, which has an impact nationally as well as locally in my electorate, was exposed as a cruel hoax for older Australians. The waiting list grew by almost 4,000 older Australians in three months, but there were only 3,500 new home care packages a year committed to in the budget. Where are these coming from? They came from residential aged care. In my electorate people can wait for many months for an ACAT assessment. They then have to wait many months to get the level of package that they need. These are people who've worked their entire lives and want to settle into retirement, and they need a decent level of care and a decent standard of living. They need a little assistance. That might be Commonwealth Home Support Program assistance, sometimes Meals on Wheels, or home care—help with day-to-day tasks such as cleaning, cooking and laundry, or personal care such as dressing, grooming and showering. All those things are more difficult the older we get. These people deserve dignity in their retirement and they're simply not getting it from this government.


This government really needs to have a look at the funding shortfall in the number of aged-care packages. There are people in my electorate, older people in Ipswich and the Somerset and Karana Downs regions, who are assessed as needing a level 4 package and contact My Aged Care only to be told that no funding is available for their appropriate level of home care package. They're told they'll go on the waiting list and wait another year or two. That is why the government needs to spend more money and put more resources into this area. Waiting for assistance to wash yourself daily, clean your home and cook your meals, or waiting for assistance to install safety aids that could help save your life and certainly would improve your lifestyle, is simply unacceptable. We need policies in this country to create an age-friendly nation and to deal with the growing challenges of dementia. We need to treble our aged-care workforce. But this government seems to be putting it on the never-never.


On top of that, locally I'm seeing a huge increase in the waiting times for people to receive a pension, particularly the age pension. The median processing time for age pension payments has increased from 36 days to 49 days in the past year. In my experience, it's much longer in my electorate. I've come across people in Kilcoy who've told me that they have been waiting up to six months. We've had people in Ipswich who've been waiting four or five. In one case we dealt with in my office it was seven months—seven months! These are retirees living off their savings and the charity of their friends and family while they wait for their pension to come through.


Providing income support is a very complex task, we know. It requires knowledge and experience. That's why Centrelink needs permanent full-time staff with familiarity and experience to manage applications and payments, to recognise when something is taking a long time to process and make the necessary decisions to expedite a person's claim. In this year's budget this government axed 1,180 jobs from Centrelink, which has contributed to the blowout in age pension processing times. The then Treasurer, now Prime Minister, announced a further cut of 1,280 jobs from Centrelink. And 1,250 jobs have been outsourced to labour hire. The Prime Minister will continue the Centrelink job cuts that he started as Treasurer. Piece by piece, Public Service jobs will be taken from experienced personnel and given to the highest bidder. Morale at Centrelink is at an all-time low.


We've also seen huge blowouts in the number of people whose phone calls go unanswered. In the last year, up to 55 million phone calls have not been answered. While delivering the budget in 2017, the Treasurer, now Prime Minister, said:


We must choose to guarantee the essential services that Australians rely on.


You know what? We're still waiting for that. All of this was done, by the way, to attend to the so-called debt and deficit disaster. Net debt for this year, 2018-19, is double what it was when the Liberals came to power: $175 billion compared to $350 billion. Under the Liberals, gross debt has crashed through more than half a trillion dollars for the first time in our country's history and remains well above this level for the next decade: $533.9 billion as of 7 September 2018 and $280 billion in September 2013. Both of these kinds of debts will grow quicker per month under the Liberals than under us when we had a global financial crisis to deal with. So much for the government delivering a budget surplus in the first year and every year thereafter. We're still waiting for this. This is simply not good enough. The government must govern better.
