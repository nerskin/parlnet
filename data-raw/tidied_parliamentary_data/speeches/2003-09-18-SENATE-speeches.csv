That the Senate take note of the report.
Recruitment and training in the Australian Public Service might sound at first like a rather prosaic topic. It does not usually excite many people. But, as the committee's report shows, these are major issues facing the Commonwealth Public Service that have wider implications for Australia's economy and work force. I am pleased to say that this is a unanimous report.
The Australian Public Service is not only a key source of advice and support to government but also a major employer in the Australian work force. Some of the challenges the APS is facing—such as an ageing work force, increased competition for the `best and the brightest' and lower retention rates for young people—are common to other sectors of the economy. The committee believes that the APS should be a leader for other areas of the work force in developing policies and practices to address these issues. 
How the APS is managing the recruitment and training challenges it faces was the main purpose of this inquiry. In addition to the challenges noted already, the APS is contending with the erosion of the concept of a `career service' and the attendant potential loss of corporate knowledge; increased staff mobility, where employees expect to spend less time in individual agencies and in the APS generally; lower recruitment and retention rates, particularly for young people, graduates and Indigenous Australians; growing demands from the work force generally for more flexible work arrangements; and, as a consequence of its ageing staff profile, the loss of a significant proportion of its work force in the next few years.
The APS has undergone major reform in recent times. Some of these changes, such as a shift towards more qualified recruits and specialised job classifications, reflect broader trends in the Australian work force and economy over at least the last two decades. Another key change to the APS, namely the move away from a centralised system of recruitment and training to a devolved environment, is of more recent origin and stems from a major overhaul of legislation with the Public Service Act 1999. The impacts of devolution on the way the `new APS' is managing recruitment and training challenges are a recurring theme throughout the committee's report. The committee acknowledges that devolution over the last decade has led to greater flexibility and improved efficiencies in many areas of the APS. However, the committee also found that with devolution has come fragmentation, which has impaired the effectiveness of the recruitment and training strategies and practices of some agencies. In particular, it has weakened the capacity of some agencies to compete in the job market and also ensure their employees receive adequate ongoing training.
I wish to highlight one impact of this fragmentation that emerged in the response of government agencies to the committee's inquiry. The committee is extremely disappointed that two key agencies, the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations and the Department of Education, Science and Training, did not even bother to make submissions to the inquiry. These two departments have a key role in promoting employment and training in the Australian work force. In the committee's view, it is inexcusable that they should not participate in a parliamentary inquiry of this nature. In contrast, other agencies, including some not covered by the Public Service Act, were extremely helpful and provided important insights. The committee appreciates their assistance and the assistance of all of those who made submissions and appeared in our public hearings.
The committee's report addresses the numerous complex issues that arose during what was a reasonably lengthy inquiry. The committee has made a large number of recommendations in relation to recruitment, training and, of particular concern to all members of the committee, the role of the Australian Public Service Commission in the new, devolved Public Service environment. I want to highlight some of the committee's key findings and recommendations.
The committee believes many recruitment issues have been identified and understood but is less confident that the APS as a whole is responding adequately to some challenges. Employees, particularly young employees, are not being mentored adequately. A range of recruitment practices generally, and management of non-ongoing employment in particular, are not sufficiently understood. The committee also sees staff retention and separation issues as an ongoing challenge that agencies will need to monitor and manage for some time to come. These are particularly acute in relation to three special categories of employee: young people, graduates and Indigenous Australians. 
The inquiry has revealed that there has been a strong decline over a decade in the presence of young people in the APS. The committee was also concerned to find that most resignations from the Australian Public Service are by young people. The committee believes that the APS should be promoted as a first port of call for employment for young people. Strategies to improve the APS's ability to attract young people include enhancing publicity in schools regarding careers in the Australian Public Service, eliminating any structural bias against youth in the selection test and establishing broad principles for youth employment plans with APS agencies. The committee also recommends that the government recommit the Commonwealth to significantly increasing the number of trainees employed in the Australian Public Service, a commitment that was made originally by the former Keating government.
With the shift towards a more specialised and skilled APS, the recruitment and retention of graduates has become increasingly important. Graduates will assume even more importance as the service grapples with the implications of the expected separation of large numbers of older APS employees over the next five years. The need for the Australian Public Service to market itself to graduates as an employer of choice is therefore clear.
However, the committee heard a range of criticisms from non-APS organisations on the lack of cohesion in approaches to graduate recruitment; poor information dissemination, particularly to universities; and the complexity of the application process for graduates. The APS Commission has also observed that some agencies are not addressing graduate recruitment and retention systematically or with a long-term focus. The committee believes these problems are examples of the fragmentation that has come with the devolution of recruitment practices in the APS.
While the employment of Indigenous Australians is steady, there is a deeper problem of higher separation rates for Indigenous employees compared to non-Indigenous employees. Retention strategies are therefore critical for consolidating and strengthening the presence of Indigenous Australians in the APS. The committee recommends that the APS Commission have a dedicated budget to assist Indigenous people to gain employment in the APS and that Indigenous employees be provided with ongoing intensive support for career development and to improve retention rates. There is also a need to improve communication strategies and awareness raising with Indigenous people and their organisations about employment in the APS.
In terms of APS training strategies and practices, the committee noted that there have been many positive developments, such as the considerable effort agencies have invested in linking training priorities to corporate and business objectives, the development of accredited and articulated training programs, and the way some agencies have capitalised on the flexibility available to them under devolution to tailor training activities to their particular business and operational needs. However, there have also been a number of side effects from devolution about which the committee is concerned. At a broad level, the expansion in training programs has been to some extent uncoordinated and has led to duplication and higher than necessary costs. Assessing the extent of this sort of fragmentation proved difficult, however, because of the lack of detailed information on training expenditure and outcomes across the APS. 
The committee is particularly critical of the fact that the limited data available on APS training hampered its ability to both explore trends in training expenditure and assess the value for money of current approaches. The Australian National Audit Office, in its report Management of learning and development in the Australian Public Service, estimated that in 2000-01 expenditure on learning and development amounted to $160 million. That is a huge amount of money and systems should exist to assess how effectively it is being spent. In view of the short time available, I seek leave to incorporate the remainder of my speech in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
Compounding these data problems is the limited extent to which agencies evaluate their training activities. Most agencies are unable to draw a link between training results and business outcomes or performance. Few can quantify the value for money that their training budgets are producing.
The committee has made a number of recommendations to address these problems, some of which build on proposals made by bodies such as the ANAO, the Management Advisory committee and the APS Commission. In the devolved environment, the committee considers that these bodies with a service-wide perspective have complementary roles in encouraging and promoting more effective strategies and approaches to recruitment and training across the APS.
In particular, the committee envisages a greater, more assertive role for the APS Commission on recruitment and training matters. As a general observation, the committee has concluded that under devolution the pendulum has swung too far in favour of agency autonomy and that this needs to be addressed by giving the APS Commission enhanced powers and responsibilities to ensure greater coordination of `whole of service' issues.
The committee recommends that the APS Commission have a greater role in APS recruitment and the establishment of benchmarking of recruitment practices. It considers that additional resources should be provided to fulfil an enhanced role for the APS Commission in guiding APS recruitment strategies and practices.
There are also particular areas of training in which the APS Commission clearly should have a major role. It should increase its efforts in coordinating and facilitating delivery of centralised training programs in core-skill areas such as administrative law, record keeping, financial management and freedom of information.
To remedy some of the information problems the committee encountered during the inquiry, the committee has recommended that the APS Commission present detailed reports annually, as part of the State of Service report, outlining the progress made by each department and agency in achieving their objectives in recruitment and training. The committee considers that more systematic reporting will enable the APS Commission to identify and assist agencies to address current and emerging challenges in both areas. 
More consistent reporting across the APS, built on stronger data collection and analysis, will also improve transparency in these areas and enable the Parliament itself to monitor the expenditure, activities and progress of agencies in recruitment and training.

I would also like to thank all those who assisted the committee with its deliberations, including the committee secretariat, namely Alistair Sands, Ian Holland, Matt Keele, Di Warhurst and two former staff, Catherine Rostron and Natasha Cross.

That the House of Representatives be requested to make the following amendments:

Statement by the Clerk of the Senate pursuant to the order of the Senate of 26 June 2000—
Amendments (1) and (4)
The Senate treats amendments which would result in increased payments under a standing appropriation as requests.
If it is correct, as stated by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel, that amendments (1) and (4) will result in increased expenditure out of a standing appropriation, it is therefore in accordance with the precedents of the Senate that these amendments be moved as requests.
Amendment (6)
This amendment provides for the indexation of certain income thresholds. The Senate has not treated amendments which merely index taxes, payments under an appropriation, or factors which determine such payments, as requests, because indexation does not necessarily result in an increase in those taxes or payments.
Under the precedents of the Senate, therefore, amendment (6) should be moved as an amendment.
Amendments (3), (5), (11), (12) and (13)
These amendments are cross-references consequential on amendment (6), which therefore also should be moved as amendments.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-09-18,"—The Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer gave us some cameos yesterday. I ask the minister: were the outcome figures she gave us in today's dollar values?
—They are nominal values.
—So they are not in today's dollar values. Does the minister have the projections of the cameo outcomes available in today's dollar values?
—I will check.
—While the minister is checking, yesterday she gave us some projected outcomes for low-income earners, should they have $1,000 to put into super which would be matched by the government's $1,000 on top of SG contributions, and I will come to that issue later. She gave us a projected outcome—to give one example—for a person on an income of $25,000 who gets the government's $1,000, puts their own $1,000 in on top of the compulsory nine per cent SG and has a 30-year working life: the outcome over 30 years is $442,000 and the outcome over 40 years is $956,000.
Those figures sound impressive on the face of it: $442,000 over 30 years of working life and $956,000 over 40 years of working life, but this is in the dollar value of 30 or 40 years time and not in today's dollar values. Any realistic forecasting should bring the figures back to today's dollar values so that people understand what the inflationary impact is over the projection period. Let me give an example: as I said $442,000 sounds like a lot of money, but if you use the minister's inflation figure of 2.5 per cent over the 30-year period, a car that, say, costs $30,000 today will cost in the vicinity of $300,000 in 30 years time. That gives you a realistic assessment of the true value of these projections in today's dollar terms, which is why I have asked for the projected value in today's dollar terms not in nominal dollar terms in 30 or 40 years time. 
Frankly, if a financial planner gave a projection on the basis the minister has done and did not then inform a consumer that it was in the dollar values of 30 or 40 years time but gave a value in today's dollar values, they would be misleading the consumer. The minister has done that. She has misled the Senate and the Australian public by not providing both sets of figures. I ask her to provide the value of these projections in today's dollar values.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2003-09-18,"—I have said I will check to see whether they are available, but I said yesterday that these projections were in nominal values. There is certainly nothing misleading about that, Senator Sherry, and I think you are overcooking the egg a bit on this.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-09-18,"—I would submit that, if anyone was given a projection that showed that they were going to get $400,000 in 40 years time and you did not explain that that $400,000 was in the value of the purchasing power of $400,000 in 40 years time, that is misleading. In order to ensure people understand the true value of $400,000 in 30 years time, you need to explain to them that inflation will have a very significant impact compounded over 30 years. I would suggest, Minister, that the figures you have given are misleading, they are not balanced and any financial planner who gave figures in this way would find themselves in significant trouble—and rightly so. The Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer has not given us the figures in real current values. That is misleading. I would ask the minister to present the figures. I do not think we are going to have them in time for the conclusion of this debate, but they should be calculated.
—I have them now.
—Excellent. I will sit down and you can give them to us.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2003-09-18,"—What I want to do, apart from providing these figures, is to put on the record that the amendments that we currently have before us relate to the extended co-contribution measure and simply reinforce the extent to which this government and the Democrats have moved to be able to accommodate the needs of low-income people and to extend the co-contribution accordingly. The amendments provide for an extended co-contribution scheme for people who are qualifying low-income earners and who have made eligible superannuation contributions.
People earning up to the upper income threshold of $40,000 now qualify for a co-contribution. Previously, the amount was $32,500. People earning up to the lower income threshold of $27,500 will now qualify for the maximum matching co-contribution of up to $1,000. Previously, that figure was $20,000. The maximum co-contribution for people will be tapered at 8c for every dollar of income exceeding $27,500, eventually phasing out at $40,000, a taper range of $12,500. Previously, that was between $20,000 and $32,500, so it has been extended significantly. There is a significantly greater incentive in the current bills than the current rebate it is replacing. It will be a direct injection into the retirement savings of qualifying low-income earners. The current rebate is a maximum of only $100, phasing out at between $27,000 and $31,000. This gives the Senate a very clear picture of the extent to which this purports to be and is a very generous improvement on the low-income rebate. As a result of negotiation with the Democrats, it is of significant benefit to low-income earners. 
Senator Sherry has asked for the figures based on discounted value, or today's values, in respect of the cameos that I provided to the committee in nominal dollars last night, and I can do that. It still represents a significant figure, and I can provide these figures in the following way. In respect of person No. 1 and a 30-year working life, the figure in lieu of $389,769 would be $185,819; and in respect of a 40-year working life, the figure in lieu of $838,785 would be $312,389. In respect of person No. 2 and a 30-year working life, the figure in lieu of $442,695 would be $211,051; and in respect of a 40-year working life, the figure in lieu of $956,101 would be $356,081. In respect of person No. 3 and a 30-year working life, the figure in lieu of $450,920 would be $214,973; and in respect of a 40-year working life, the figure in lieu of $981,500 would be $365,541. Not only am I not misleading the Senate, Senator Sherry; I am providing figures as they are appropriate to be provided and on time for this debate.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-09-18,"—Thank you. I want to make some comments about these figures. I note the minister has provided the figures after I asked for them; she did not provide them yesterday when she gave the most optimistic projections of the outcomes.
—You really hate this, don't you; you really hate that people are going to get a good deal here.
 (Senator Bolkus)—Minister, please do not be provoked.
—I will not be provoked. The interjection will be on the record. There is one other area that needs clarification. The figures you gave yesterday, Minister, included the nine per cent superannuation guarantee contribution, and I would not want the committee to get the wrong impression. It is my understanding, firstly, that the figure you gave yesterday of $389,760—and you have now given today's real value of $185,000—includes the compulsory nine per cent SG contribution, that it is not exclusively the $1,000 co-contribution. Secondly, Minister—and you only need to give us the figure for the one cameo; if you have the figures for the other cameos you can give them to us—in the example I have just referred to of a projected outcome of $389,760, you have given us a figure of $185,000. Yesterday, you gave us a figure of the value of the $1,000 co-contribution at $89,000.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-09-18,"—Thank you. While the minister is obtaining that information, I want to make another point about the projections the minister provided for us yesterday and today. They are not projections of the benefit, assuming low-income earners can find $1,000. They are not projections of the $1,000 plus the $1,000 if you can find the money. They include the nine per cent superannuation guarantee contributions. I want to point out to the committee that on these cameos approximately $8 out of $10 of superannuation saving, the superannuation accumulation of these low-income earning Australians—it varies slightly from individual to individual—results from the compulsory nine per cent superannuation guarantee. For the record, the now government opposed the compulsory nine per cent superannuation guarantee. They opposed Australian workers receiving superannuation in this country through the compulsory nine per cent superannuation guarantee. 
Taking the most optimistic figures the minister gave us yesterday, could the minister inform the committee how many Australians will be millionaires, in both the nominal value figures she gave us yesterday and in today's values, as a result of the $1,000 co-contribution package which we are considering? How many are projected to become millionaires on that basis?",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2003-09-18,"—That is a hypothetical question. None of the projections I have put before the committee entitles one to draw the conclusion that, out of the cameos I have presented, that result would follow. I am not going to project here how many there will be, if any, or how many may be as a result of this arrangement. You have to make so many assumptions to get to that point, including the age at which somebody starts, what they are earning, how they acquired that sort of money and what other money they would be putting with their super savings. On these cameos I am not making that claim.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-09-18,"—I think you are very wise, Minister, because on the cameos you have given us in both nominal and real value terms it is very hard to see how anyone could become a millionaire. I think it is impossible to see how anyone can become a millionaire as a result of the government's co-contribution—the $1,000 and the $1,000. As I say, I think you are very wise not to have claimed that. I want to draw to the attention of the committee, as I drew to the attention of Senator Coonan in question time in the Senate, the claims by the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator Ian Campbell, who said last week when we were debating the placement of these measures on the Notice Paper for debate:
What happens to that person who is on $27,000 a year who starts saving and getting a hand from the government is that, by the end of their working life, when they are 65, they could have over $1 million in superannuation savings ...
We had an example of a Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer—the longest serving parliamentary secretary in the history of the Australian Parliament—
—And a very good one.
—After 7½ years you would expect a little better from a parliamentary secretary. You would not expect that a Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer would make such outrageous and misleading claims. Even Senator Cherry is laughing because my office conferred with his office to try to find out how you can get to $1 million.
—Okay. Even you, Senator Cherry, would not be claiming that the value of this low-income earner's co-contribution is $1 million either in nominal terms or in today's dollar value terms. It is not $1 million. I notice that Senator Cherry did not make anywhere near that sort of ludicrous claim in his press release about this matter. The point I make is that we had a supposedly responsible government senator who is Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, and has been a parliamentary secretary for 7½ years, a man of considerable seniority, coming into the Senate and claiming that this measure will result in millionaires, that that will be the outcome. That is grossly misleading to both the Senate and the Australian people. That claim of the $1 million outcome was carried on the wire service, and it was reported in a number of newspapers—how to become a millionaire. Who wants to be a millionaire? Senator Campbell's claim has been carried publicly and it is a misleading claim. Not even the minister claims millionaire outcomes. 
The other point about Senator Campbell is that Senator Campbell's responsibilities as the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer include the Financial Services Reform Act, which is the act that deals with accurate disclosure of financial projections. The parliamentary secretary responsible for developing an act to ensure accurate disclosure of financial projections comes into the Senate and makes this millionaire claim. Who wants to be a millionaire? by Senator Ian Campbell. I have referred to him as `Eddie' Ian Campbell because I think that comparison is accurate. There is as much chance of a low-income Australian becoming a millionaire as of Australians winning Who wants to be a millionaire? There is very little chance, in other words, of average low-income Australians—4½ million of them—becoming millionaires as a result of this measure.
—You do not promote the aspirational society?
—I promote realistic aspirations; I do not mislead people, and it is grossly misleading to claim that low-income earning Australians will become millionaires as a result of this measure. The Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, Senator Ian Campbell, should have come in and corrected the record. He has given a very seriously misleading claim—in fact, it is an absurd and wild claim that is just inaccurate—but he has not come in and corrected the parliamentary record. His claim in support of this measure was carried on the wire service and in at least a couple of newspapers, from the clips that I have seen. He should have corrected the record and he has failed to do so.
On this matter, Senator Chapman, in taking note of this millionaire claim in the debate in the Senate, defended Senator Campbell and said:
The data has been prepared not by Senator Campbell or by the government—
and the minister has admitted that she has not had anything to do with this millionaire claim—
but by the Financial Planning Association.
This worries me even more. I have not spoken to the Financial Planning Association, but I do intend to contact them to check the accuracy of Senator Chapman's claim. If the Financial Planning Association have been claiming projections of millionaire status as a result of this measure that is quite inaccurate and misleading and I will be taking up that issue with the association. It disturbs me that we could have the Financial Planning Association and the financial planners who are members of that association going out and `informing' the Australian public that the outcome of this measure to low-income earning Australians will be that they will become millionaires, either in nominal terms or in today's dollar value terms. We will be seeking some verification from the Financial Planning Association about this advice that they apparently gave to Senator Campbell. I certainly would have expected Senator Campbell, who is a person of experience in this area, as I indicated, to be a little sceptical about the claims made and to have checked the claims made by the Financial Planning Association. 
This is not the first time the government has made very misleading, even absurd, claims and hyped up the arguments in support of its superannuation measures. On this measure we had the projection by the Prime Minister before the last election that there would be 470,000 children's superannuation accounts—this was part of the package that included the low-income earners co-contribution. The Prime Minister projected before the last election that 470,000 children's superannuation accounts would be opened. This was headlined in the election period as part of the package. We are not on broadcast and there are few members in the gallery, but do you know how many of these 470,000 children's superannuation accounts have been opened 14 months after the Prime Minister made this commitment? There are approximately 500. There is a big difference between 470,000 and 500.
When these measures were released in the government's election package, the government claimed that it would be collecting $325 million in tax revenue from temporary residents who leave the country. Of the $325 million Mr Howard said he would collect in tax, which helps pay for what we are considering here, only about $15 million has so far been collected. The problem is that a substantial number of the temporary residents are backpackers. They have left the country and the government cannot find them to collect the tax. It is another wild claim made by none other than the Prime Minister. I draw those examples of other absurd and misleading claims to the attention of the Senate.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2003-09-18,"—Senator Sherry is correct in referring to the fact that Senator Campbell was talking about Financial Planning Association figures; Senator Campbell was not talking about the figures from the department that I have provided. Obviously, all cameos can use variable assumptions and get different outcomes. I understand from looking at the Financial Planning Association's figures that the stated figures would be in nominal dollars and that they were probably not exclusive of superannuation guarantee contributions.
I have sought during this debate to provide considered projections—they could even be conservative—based on information that I have been given by my department. They are, I think, the best and most accurate projections available that I can assist the Senate with during this debate. There is obviously a variety of views about these figures: Senator Cherry had some slightly different figures and others have come up with figures—there have been all sorts of claims in the press and otherwise—so it is a matter of how you do it. The figures I am presenting are official figures that have been prepared for the purposes of this debate by Treasury, and I think the Australian public is entitled to rely on those and entitled to look in the Hansard and see what has been put on the record.
I do not know that there is much to be gained by taking issue with Senator Sherry. Obviously I do not agree that anyone has been misled in relation to child accounts. We have had a number of exchanges in relation to child accounts and I must say it is a puzzling thing that Senator Sherry can be so dogmatic about the number of child accounts there are when the data is simply not yet available because it has not been going long enough. In the circumstances where there are so many funds, where you would have to make some personal contact to find out at this stage, it is not really going to assist to have that kind of debate. Maybe we can have it at some later stage when, instead of guesses, we can have some accurate information. 
The other matter I will mention is in relation to the so-called `backpackers tax'—that is, returning superannuation to Australian residents who are departing Australia permanently. The issue there is that the collections are not linked to this measure. It is misrepresenting the position to suggest that somehow or other there is some hypothecated connection between the collections on the return of superannuation to backpackers and the passage and payment of the co-contribution measure. They are separate matters. These matters are provided for in the budget and are updated in the budget.
I have asked my advisers to complete the cameos in relation to real values. The percentage increase remains the same for the benefits. I will provide those for the record. The dollar improvements are as follows: for person 1, for 30 years it is $42,697 and for 40 years it is $68,235; for person 2, for 30 years it is $40,236 and for 40 years it is $63,398; and for person 3, for 30 years it is $16,464 and for 40 years it is $24,330.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-09-18,"—Thank you for that update of the figures. I want to make a couple of final points on the figures. I think the projections given by the minister and Senator Cherry are reasonably accurate on the actuarial advice we have had and I think it is reasonably accurate to provide figures in both nominal and real value terms. But the central point I would make is that it depends on the capacity of low-income earners—those earning less than $27,500—to find $1,000 out of their yearly expenditure in order to get the government's co-contribution of $1,000. That is the great difficulty for most low-income earning Australians who earn $27,500 or less. As I said yesterday, I have raised these issues with people back in my home state and in the area where I live, in Devonport, and occasionally they raise them with me. When you say to people, `If you put in $1,000 you will get $1,000,' initially there is some enthusiasm and then people say, `We have to find $1,000.' They might be on an income of $20,000 or $30,000 or they might be unemployed. There is a very substantial proportion of the population where I live earning an income of $27,500 or below. When you are paying off the mortgage or paying rent and paying increased health and education costs and other increased costs for your family and your kids, it is very difficult to find $1,000 out of your existing household budget if you are on an income of less than $27,500.
We know from the minister's figures that approximately one in nine or one in 10 Australians at the low-income level will be able to find $1,000 or less to put into super to get the co-contribution. We have contrasted that with the measure we considered yesterday, where high-income earners—those earning more than approximately $94,000 or $95,000—as part of this package get a guaranteed tax cut. The contrast is that one in nine or one in 10 low-income earners who we know can find up to $1,000 will benefit but all high-income earners get a benefit because they are guaranteed a tax cut—an exclusive tax cut for high-income earners.
If we look at Senator Campbell's claim and if we read it in a reasonable way, it relates to the value of the outcome of this package—the $1,000 and $1,000 co-contribution. It does not include SG contributions; he did not make that claim. The amount of $42,697 is a long way short of $1 million—massively short. It is on that basis I would argue that Senator Campbell's claims were inaccurate and misleading. If the Financial Planning Association, who are the people who are supposed to be advising people—they are the gatekeepers, in many cases, of our superannuation system—are passing around these million-dollar projection figures which are inaccurate and misleading, then I think they will have something to answer for. That is an issue I will take up with them. By the way, Senator Campbell is the assistant minister who is supposed to take up these issues with the financial planners and make sure they give accurate projections and figures. 
The only other point I would make on the cameos, Minister, is that it would have been useful to have provided them in writing before we got to the debate on the bill. We could have avoided a fair amount of time in having to go through them. I do not mind going through them in this way.
—You could have asked me.
—I actually did say to Senator Campbell in the debate last Wednesday that I would be seeking figures in this area. However, I thank the minister for providing those figures. They usefully provide realistic assessment of the outcomes, notwithstanding of course that to get to those outcomes low-income earners have to find up to $1,000 out of their household daily budgets in order to achieve the projected outcome.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2003-09-18,"—I will speak very briefly, because I think the debate has been fairly far reaching and is getting repetitive. What I want to say in conclusion, before these amendments are put, is that people do not have to find $1,000. They can find whatever they can to assist them to save. The cameos are there to provide some accurate guidance about what can happen if you are able to find $1,000, but I think it is important to make the point in case—and we are not on broadcast—anyone ever looks at this. People do not have to find a full $1,000 to benefit from the co-contribution. It is misleading to talk about having to find $1,000 as though if you find less than $1,000 you do not get any benefit. That is very misleading, particularly for those people on low incomes or under the $27,500 threshold. I would be very distressed if I thought anyone out there thought they would be disqualified from participating in the co-contribution because they could not find $20 a week or whatever it would be to get to the maximum figure. I want to disabuse anyone who has that view.
As to the take-up—and Senator Cherry made a contribution about this and about anticipated take-ups—I reiterate that in my department we probably err on the side of being very conservative and that is a good thing; I am not saying that that is not something we should do from the point of view of the government and Treasury. But Senator Cherry points out—and I think he is dead right—that we are looking at what sort of behavioural change the co-contribution is likely to have when it is enacted and people know about it. The take-up rate is based on the take-up rate relating to the rebate, which was the most obvious figure available. That was very low, because it was not as attractive, so we have to assume that it is likely to be higher than the estimate I am giving. I am not overstating that. I am simply saying that it is subject to behavioural change, and the projections are probably on the low side.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-09-18,"—The minister has just claimed that there is a reasonable assumption that the figures will be higher. If that is the case, the cost is going to blow out. This issue of cost is important, because the government and this minister continually attempt to mislead the Australian people and criticise our costings and our revenue raising measures. They constantly ask how we are going to pay for our election promises, yet here we have a minister conceding that the cost of this measure will increase and blow out. She is claiming it as a virtue. If the Labor Party did that we would be hammered from pillar to post by the Assistant Treasurer and the Treasurer for undercosting an election promise. 
The other issue about the costings, the matter I raised about the departing non-residents and collecting tax from them, is important because of the significant shortfall in revenue that is being collected compared with the $325 million that was projected. When the government went to the election, Mr Howard got up and promoted this `grand' superannuation policy, part of which were the two measures we are considering—in fact, they were central to it, together with children's superannuation accounts. Of course, there was the not unreasonable issue of how you pay for your promises. The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, said, `We're going to collect $325 million in tax from these departing temporary residents, including backpackers.' That was a dodgy, bodgie figure. If the Labor Party went out and made a political promise and said, `We're going to collect $325 million from these former temporary residents in tax,' and the money did not eventuate, then the government—including the Assistant Treasurer—would, rightly, be hopping into us and saying, `You've made an incorrect claim; you can't pay for election promises.' Yet we had the Prime Minister making claims prior to the last election that the main funding measure, almost the only funding measure, of their election package on superannuation would come from this taxation measure on departing residents that would raise $325 million to help pay for all this. As for the $325 million, Treasury are struggling to find the departing temporary residents in order to collect the tax revenue. So whilst it is not a measure hypothecated to pay for the particular measures we are debating here today it is directly linked, because the Prime Minister established that direct link prior to the last election.
If the Labor Party had come out—I am glad that we did not—and said that we were going to collect $325 million in tax revenue from people who came to visit Australia and then had left, the government would have jumped straight on it. There is a major problem: Treasury cannot find these people. Well over a million people have left the country and Treasury cannot find a forwarding address. You have got to find a forwarding address to contact the people to collect the $325 million in tax. If the Labor Party had made this claim, I am sure the government would have jumped straight on it and made dodgy and bodgie claims about the revenue to be raised from the tax. I submit to the Senate: if you expect to raise a tax from people who have left the country and you do not know where those people are, it is a bit difficult to collect a tax from them. That is the problem that Treasury are having. They are trying to find a million people who have left the country, and I think they have got 100,000 forwarding addresses out of the million-odd people that they want to find to collect tax from. So it is going to be very difficult to find anywhere near the $325 million.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2003-09-18,"—I think Senator Sherry has displayed a deeply flawed understanding of the government's funding of superannuation reforms. There is no funding shortfall in the co-contribution surcharge package. It has been very carefully worked out. There is certainly no specific budget link between the temporary residence measure and the co-contribution surcharge measure, as I have earlier explained.
Estimates for superannuation revenue, as indeed with all revenue estimates, are updated at budget time and I can inform the Senate that the government's budget for 2003-04 is for a surplus. I can understand how Senator Sherry might want to revisit these issues but there is no funding shortfall and there is no specific link between the temporary residence measure and the co-contribution surcharge measure. We are currently considering the great benefits that the co-contribution measure will extend to a greater number of Australians than the previous tax rebate. The projections that have been provided are based on extending the taper rates and extending the number of people who are eligible—that is all costed. The government's budget is well and truly in surplus and the revenue estimates will be updated.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-09-18,"—That is not the point that I was making. We know that almost the only revenue measure in the election promises to assist in the funding of the proposals we are debating today is the tax on temporary residents who have departed Australia, which was projected to raise $325 million. That was in the funding for this package. 
—It doesn't have anything to do with it.
—I will put it to you quite simply, Minister. It does have everything to do with it because it is contained in your own election promises. I do not have the copy here but I have got the list. Almost the only funding measure at election time to substantially fund the measures we are considering here was a tax on temporary departing residents that was projected to raise $325 million. Quite simply, I put to the minister: does the minister stand by the forecast of $325 million to be collected from former temporary residents, as outlined in the Liberal Party election promises prior to the last election? Does she stand by that figure?",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech

	(b)	for the 2007-08 income year—$27,500 multiplied by the index-ation factor for that income year; or
	(c)	for a later income year—the amount of the lower income threshold for the previous income year multiplied by the indexation factor for that later income year.
	(3)	The higher income threshold for an income year is:
	(a)	for an income year before the 2007-08 income year—$40,000; or
	(b)	for a later income year—the sum of:
	(i)	the lower income threshold for that later income year; and
	(ii)	$12,500.
	(4)	If the lower income threshold for an income year is an amount of dollars and cents:

The amendment also provides further detail in clause 54 about the subject matter that would be covered by the reporting, including details about the recipients, the co-contribution measure and the extent of the benefit received. How this would actually be presented and compiled is information that will need to be prescribed in the regulations. Obviously, there needs to be some consultation about how that could be gathered and presented in the regulations in an appropriate way.

It seems to the Labor Party that the major benefit to low-income earners—a substantial proportion of the people who make up to $1,000 in contributions and receive up to $1,000 in matching government contributions—whose income is less than $27,500 is that a substantial proportion of those people are going to have partners who are on higher incomes. Of the number of people on a joint income, with an individual earning, say, $27,500 and their partner earning an income of the equivalent or less, those who would be able to find $1,000 would not be significant in terms of the proportion of people at that income level. In other words, you can have a higher income earner giving $1,000 to a lower income earning partner and indirectly at least the higher income earning partner will also be a beneficiary because they have a lower income earning partner. 
The Labor Party is interested to know and obtain data on just who does benefit from this measure. The Labor Party does not believe that the proposed amendment and the regulations we will receive are comprehensive enough in the detail that should be provided to parliament about who benefits from this measure. Therefore, we have our own amendment in respect of this matter. I have indicated why we have our own amendment—that is, we think the report to parliament about who will benefit should be more detailed. The matter has been raised by Senator Cherry so I speak on it now. I do not intend to speak on the matter again when we get to the opposition amendments.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-09-18,"—While we are talking about information, I will take the opportunity to ask the minister if she would like to complete her remarks from last night. I did ask about the parliamentary superannuation amendment bill that Mr Peter Andren, the Independent member for Calare, has brought forward in the House of Representatives in which there is this extraordinarily generous 69 per cent top-up for members of parliament at the taxpayers' expense, which puts in the shade the benefits that low-income earners might get under the government-Democrat legislation we have here. I ask the minister what the government's view is on that legislation, which would allow MPs to opt for the same superannuation arrangement that applies or is available to other members who are employed in the public arena, and whether the government will be supporting that legislation which has been amended somewhat by Mr Andren since it first came in two years ago.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2003-09-18,"—Before I respond to Senator Brown, who reminds me that I said last night I would deal with his request, I feel I should put a couple of remarks on the record from the government's point of view. This approach to the regulations has been taken to allow the Australian Taxation Office to determine the best approach to both data collection and reporting. It was something the government agreed to do as part of the agreement with the Democrats. We are certainly committed to providing that information and making it as meaningful as we can. Obviously, the regulations are still being developed. They will cover co-contribution payments, recipients of the co-contribution payment in the various income ranges and spouses of recipients of the co-contribution payment by income ranges, and those income ranges are yet to be determined. So some development has to await the drafting of regulations. It is important that we get this information right. There must be appropriate consultations so that the information is as comprehensive and meaningful as we can reasonably get it. 
In relation to Senator Brown's inquiry about Mr Andren's bill, that aspect of superannuation falls within Senator Minchin's responsibilities. With cross-portfolio responsibilities, obviously I would need to confer with Senator Minchin because I do not currently have any information about where Mr Andren's bill might be on the legislative program in the House of Representatives. So I am not in a position to say what view the government has on that bill. Certainly I do not know whether it is going to be debated or quite where it is up to. It is not my portfolio. That is why I have not got any information about it, Senator Brown. ",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-09-18,"—I would be very pleased if Senator Coonan would speak with Senator Minchin about the bill because it is germane to the matters we are talking about. We are trying to establish some fairness in superannuation for disadvantaged members of the Australian community. If there is one thing that is unfair in the superannuation field, it is the top-ups that MPs get from the public purse—69 per cent compared to the eight per cent put in by other employers. The view of superannuation taken by the government ought to be seen across the board. We cannot have a blind spot with regard to the generous—some would say extravagant—provisions for members of parliament. After all, we vote for them and we can unseat them, as well.  
I know the minister had time overnight to find out about this. I point out to her that, in effect, it is in the government's hands. The Independent members in the other place do not have the numbers to bring this onto the Notice Paper. So the challenge to the government is to bring on Mr Andren's legislation. I would be very happy to host it here in the Senate. I point out to members of parliament who might be fearful that they will be brought back to the level of superannuation top-up that every other member of the Australian community understands that Senator Andren's legislation—quite generously, I suppose—allows members to opt out, do the decent thing and have their superannuation come under the same terms and conditions, and with the same top-ups, as other members of the public might expect. 
There is something amiss in the philosophy of a government that says, on the one hand, `We are bringing in measures here to give a $1,000 complementary payment to people who earn less than $27,000—who might be able to find $1,000 but who, if they cannot, do not get the co-contribution—when, on the other hand, members of parliament are getting many thousands of dollars each year through the provisions of their own superannuation legislation without having to find $1,000, without having to find a red cent. It is unjust. It is not enough to say that the minister does not know where Mr Andren's bill is on the legislative timetable for the House of Representatives. I can tell her where it is—it is being blocked by the government because the government has the numbers and has total say. That means it is being blocked by the executive of the Howard government. I hope that the minister, having heard the debate in here—and, indeed, the Labor Party—will move to lift that blockade on Senator Andren's legislation, and allow it to be debated and voted on, just as this legislation is being debated and voted on. We must not allow a deliberated blind spot to occur with regard to legislation because it is in our interests not to have it debated. That is bad law, and it is a bad outcome for the parliament.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Watson, Sen John",LP,2003-09-18,"—I have been listening to this debate in my room with a great deal of interest, having sat on the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, which looked into this issue. The government responded positively to one of the recommendations. Senator Brown, you have spoken with a great deal of passion, and so has Mr Andren in the other place. I issue a challenge to you today, Senator Brown. You know that, when you retire from this place, you can commute 50 per cent of your pension to a lump sum. I challenge you to issue a declaration today nominating a charity, or charities, of your choice to receive this 50 per cent of the pension commuted to a lump sum. You speak knowing that you are not going to be denied that benefit. If you wished to show your bona fides, you could do it in no better way than to issue a declaration—and put it in your declaration of interests—that, when you retire, 50 per cent of your pension commuted to a lump sum will go to a nominated charity of your choice. I issue that challenge to you today.
If you take up that challenge, your status will be enhanced quite considerably. Put it in your declaration of interests that, whether you are here for another five, 10 or 20 years, that will still be there. You can put in a caveat to deal with the effect of the legislation being changed in the meantime, but at the moment, to show your genuineness in terms of the passion with which you have spoken today, I issue that challenge. I issued it also to Mr Andren. He did not accept it. I think that needs to be put on the public record. Thank you.

"Brown, Sen Bob",AG,2003-09-18,"—Senator Watson tempts me to respond, and I will. It is usual to say, `You do something that is going to get the monkey off our back'—in this case, that is going to get rid of the requirement that there would be under Mr Andren's legislation for all of us to make just that decision. I think that Senator Watson will be retiring from this place quite a bit earlier than I will be and might set the example that he has now proposed. He says someone's status will be enhanced. Go to it, Senator Watson.
I am here to back this legislation, which puts the challenge to all of us—not to exculpate MPs from facing up to the reality of the unfair legislation we have before us by simply saying, `I'll move out of it and leave everybody else to take the winnings which are undeserved.' That brings to mind the extraordinary ethical statement by Mr Ted Mack, who some time ago did just what Senator Watson suggested—although he did not do it with 50 per cent; I think it was 100 per cent.
Senator Watson, you have this opportunity to enhance your status. You have taken an alternative option there. I gather from what you say that you are moving all you can behind the scenes to ensure—and you have more say in this than I do—that Mr Andren's legislation does get up for debate. Bring it in and let us have a full-on debate about it. I will manage my own affairs the way I wish to. You have come up with a decision about how you are going to do it. My aim is to get this legislation in here and to get a fair debate on it—just as we are debating the legislation today.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-09-18,"—There is just one other issue I forgot to ask the minister about in respect of the cameo. She gave us the assumptions—an earnings rate of four, inflation of 2.5. What was the assumption on fees, charges and commissions?",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2003-09-18,"—What I said in my remarks last night was that earnings by the fund have been assumed before fees and taxes are deducted at seven per cent. Obviously, we do not have information on fees and charges.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-09-18,"—I just make the point that, given the significant impact that fees, charges and commissions can have on final superannuation accumulations over however many years, it is not unreasonable to have an assumption about the costs for management, administration, financial planning and other things involved in the provision of the superannuation policy. They do impact on the bottom line very significantly. A one per cent fee charge commission reduces the final outcome by 10 per cent over 35 years. If you do not have the figures, you do not have the figures, but—
—We might have something.
—If you can get something, that would be good. While I am on this issue, does this legislation allow a commission to be charged against the co-contribution by an individual if they find $1,000—or up to $1,000—to put into super? 
—I am just getting something.
—While you are thinking about that—
—I am just getting some information.
—Senator Watson is going to help me. That will be excellent.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Watson, Sen John",LP,2003-09-18,"—As I said, in terms of a low-risk environment, this has to be one of the best returns available to people. It certainly aims to focus on the sector of the community that needs additional resources put into superannuation. As we all know, the earlier people put money into superannuation to get at least a 40-year time frame of compounding, the greater the benefit will be. Our system has matured a lot over the years. It still has a way to go, but it is regarded as one of the soundest in the world, with a three-pillar policy. I think that the take-up rate will be much greater than anybody in this place expects. I can imagine, for example, situations where, while low-income earners may not themselves have a capacity to put that $1,000 in, relatives may see such an opportunity and even donate money to be put in. The money might not necessarily come from people's own savings, but with people who are interested in the welfare of their children or grandchildren I think we will find that an extraordinary amount will find its way into these co-contribution accounts. That has to be good for savings in this country. I am just a bit worried that we are trying to lessen the impact of the huge benefits that this will bring to a very deserving group.
Those who have spoken to me anecdotally have said that people will be prepared to put money aside. It may not be $1,000; it may be a sum less than that. But there is a lot of interest out there, and I think this debate is generating increased interest, from the number of phone calls that I am getting. People are really thrilled about it. They want to know whether it is operating now. If the way people have spoken translates to numbers, there will be huge benefits.
This will be legislation in a very short time. The legislation will operate from 1 July. It is a great opportunity for people to gather resources to put into superannuation. They will come not only from savings, I believe, but from people who are genuinely interested in assisting the welfare of a lot of low-income earners to ensure that their retirement is going to be a lot better than it would otherwise be. I congratulate the government and I wish the legislation a speedy passage.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-09-18,"—The other question I was going to ask is: if an individual contributes up to $1,000 and part of that goes in commission to a financial planner—and maybe I am just a touch suspicious when I see that—
—Why would you want to?
—Senator Watson jests, `Why would you want to?' The fact is that a lot of people, when they receive advice from a financial planner, because we do not have the clear disclosure of fees, charges and commissions yet—it has been promised but we still do not have it—do not understand the impact of a commission applying to superannuation contributions. What I am interested to know is, if a person wants to put some money into superannuation under this measure, will it be permissible for a commission to be deducted from that money? Will that be lawful?",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2003-09-18,"—My understanding—and I am just checking this information—is that a co-contribution, and indeed whatever somebody puts into super, would be treated no differently from other personal contributions. The original contribution, therefore, would be treated no differently from any other undeducted contribution. Whether or not that attracts a commission depends on somebody's individual arrangements, obviously. 
Whilst I can appreciate the point that I think Senator Sherry is trying to make, I am not really sure that you can require the government to interfere in personal contractual arrangements of this kind. The Financial Services Reform Act 2001 requires now as a matter of law that commissions be disclosed. There is still some development going on of easy to understand forms of disclosure so that people can, as best as possible, compare like with like. Obviously that is an extremely difficult thing to reduce to a very simple statement because there are so many variables, but I think the basic principle is that these contributions are treated no differently from other undeducted personal contributions.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-09-18,"—I thought that would be the case. In other words, a person can have a commission deducted against contributions up to $1,000 under the measure we are debating. The minister uses the phrase all the time that `governments should not interfere in personal contractual obligations'. I am not going to debate the issue today. I simply make the point that the Labor Party believes that it is not interference but consumer protection to regulate fees, charges and commissions in some areas. We do not have that. We do not have, for example, the banning of massive exit fees over and above the admin costs and we do not have the banning of commissions on compulsory nine per cent superannuation guarantee products. I would argue from the Labor Party point of view that there is, at least in some areas of fees, charges and commissions, an important issue of consumer protection, not interference, where government needs to regulate very toughly some of the behaviour that goes on.
The minister has confirmed that it is possible for a commission to be charged on a contribution up to $1,000.
—Chair, I rise on a point of order. I really do not see how this is relevant to the amendments under discussion at the moment.
 (Senator Brandis)—There is no point of order. I think it is relevant.
—I do not want to be too suspicious of the Financial Planning Association. I do not know whether Senator Watson has seen the claims made by Senator Chapman that the $1 million figure was advice from the Financial Planning Association. We have to check this out. This $1 million is the benefit of this low-income earners co-contribution. I would really worry if we had financial planners saying that you get $1 million from the government co-contribution. If they were saying it, perhaps they are saying it because they are going to get a commission. Some of them—not all of them—are going to get a slice, or a commission, out of the $1,000. The minister was going to give me the assumption on the fees, charges and commissions—admin costs et cetera—on the cameos.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2003-09-18,"—I have some information in response to question on the fees and charges that have been assumed in the analysis and the cameos that I have detailed to the Senate. That is $200 indexed by the CPI annually. The number used by Senator Campbell, $1 million, can be obtained by a person earning $32,000 in a 40-year working life. In real terms that is $375,000. 
Further, in response to Senator Sherry, I realise that the debate about this matter has roved around the world and we have touched on everything that might conceivably be relevant and indeed that probably verges on the irrelevant. We can go on ad infinitum. Obviously there is not much point in us having a long debate about exit fees. We can do that but obviously the government does not agree that it is appropriate to ban exit fees. There are many reasons but one of the reasons is that funds will still incur the same costs and they would simply have to compensate by increasing other fees and reducing services to members. It would be entirely counterproductive. The focus on exit fees fails to realise that the forces of competition will very quickly sort out exit fees. In a proper environment of portability and choice, why would anybody invest with any fund that had unreasonable exit fees?
As we all know, with some of the older products, particularly the old life products, it was a condition of investment that there would be heavy fees on withdrawal. Circumstances vary enormously and you certainly cannot retrospectively interfere in contractual arrangements, sometimes of very long standing. There are many arguments—and hopefully they will occur on another day—about exit fees, but I would not want it to stand on the record that this government countenances the banning of exit fees, because it is entirely counterproductive and I think it will simply create more problems than it is likely to solve.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-09-18,—I understand the government's position on that issue. I have one final question. When the government pays the co-contribution or the matching payment—whatever the figure is—would it be permissible for a commission to be debited against that payment in some form?,SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-09-18,"—Let us take the example of a $500 co-contribution. The government is paying that and it goes to the fund. Will it then be possible, if there is a commission applying, for that to be applied to the government's co-contribution amount within the fund?",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Watson, Sen John",LP,2003-09-18,"—This matter of co-contribution is so straightforward and so simple that I doubt any financial planner in Australia worth their salt would have the temerity to charge. The benefit is so significant—it is virtually a dollar for dollar benefit—and the procedure is so simple that people would be wasting their money paying for a service that is not necessary. 
Senator Sherry, it grieves me somewhat that you have such an unfortunate slant towards all financial planners. You are really casting aspersions on a profession which has many honourable members who do the right thing. For the sake of the record I would like to say that I think the profession has moved a long way in the last decade. In fact, it has moved a long way in the last couple of years. It is moving now towards being a true profession. In the past, it is true, it has had a tail, but I would not like to let it pass that the financial planning profession is going to take advantage of this measure. 
As I said, ordinary people know when they are going to get a benefit. In a sense it is a little bit like shopping. There is an intuition within most people that I think, Senator Sherry, you do not appreciate. People know when they are going to get something worth while and they know when there is a disadvantage. I think you are unnecessarily nitpicking, because it would be outrageous if a financial planner so drew up a plan as to get a commission on a Commonwealth benefit. In fact, under FSR rules that will be introduced next year I would imagine that financial planners would be in for disciplinary action should they go down that track. I think that is where the matter is best left, rather than expecting government intervention at this stage. ",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2003-09-18,"—I have been listening with interest to some aspects of the debate and I was particularly interested in some comments that Senator Watson made with regard to financial planners, in this instance with respect to superannuation products. History does not serve financial planners well.
—We are not talking about history.
—Senator Watson says that we are not talking about history, but history often provides us with a very valuable insight into how people act and how we may best choose to put in place regulations that ensure integrity in a particular system for the future and that compliance exists.
As I was saying, history has not been kind to financial planners—and rightly so—because they have, on any number of occasions, sought to exploit weaknesses in the regulatory system to maximise benefits for themselves. There are, as Senator Watson has said, many decent financial planners but, as in any game, if there are weaknesses in the system there will be those who will exploit the weaknesses and it will lead those who may well have wanted to adopt what might be called a decent approach to ultimately apply the same practice because they see the financial benefits that others are gaining. There are plenty of examples. I do not necessarily have to draw Senator Watson's attention to other areas where financial planners have (a) exploited investors and (b) exploited Commonwealth tax revenue very significantly and in very recent times. 
It is my view that that continues to happen, even today. That is why any regulation that is put in place, whether in respect of superannuation or other matters—and I have been concerned that the government is still not addressing some of the issues in some other areas of financial services product—is very important. Superannuation regulation is even more so because it goes to the heart of what is important to people, particularly low-income earners, for their long-term future.
I hope that the government will give serious consideration to the issue of exit fees. It is worth noting that there has been a practice in the past, and it may well still exist, where a person has invested in a superannuation product and the service provider of the product—the financial planner or superannuation company—chooses to offer to the superannuation investor a different mix of financial investments. That practice creates a new start date for the person in respect of exit fees. It is something that financial planners, as they are now called, have used quite mercilessly to ensure that superannuants stay within a particular company's superannuation scheme. 
I listened to the minister's comments about the market sorting out exit fees in the not too distant future. It has been the case that the market has had an opportunity to sort out exit fees for a long time but it would not seem to have proven to be very useful, particularly for people involved in superannuation. We are talking about the issue of portability. It would be invaluable to superannuants, especially those involved in casual employment where they have lower amounts of superannuation paid into various funds, if they were able to take those funds and consolidate them into a single fund without losing a significant amount of their investment money to exit fees. 
There ought to be a capping of exit fees and it ought to be by regulation. The market should still be allowed to play a role, because if they want to go below the cap then they can do that. It was suggested to me, during the course of the inquiry I chaired into the mass marketed investment schemes—obviously not involving superannuation but other investments—that it was a question of choice. Yes, it is, but at the end of the day a lot of people, particularly low-income earners, do not have the capacity or the knowledge to make that choice. That is why we ought to have better regulation in this area. That is why exit fees are important and at some point regulation will have to be applied to ensure fairness and equity for people investing in superannuation.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Watson, Sen John",LP,2003-09-18,"—There is a real problem in moving down the route proposed by Senator Murphy because in other areas where a cap is applied the market tends to move upwards not necessarily to the top but towards that cap. There are some people, generally the higher income earners, who require, as part of their superannuation planning, a sophisticated cocktail of superannuation type products to meet their needs. If such people move out within a short time, they are going to incur an administration cost plus a cost of exiting the particular investments because of that particular cocktail which is not the usual method. Are you going to put a cap on superannuation for those particular things, as you would, say, for an industry fund where the level of service is minimal? In a sense, costs are associated in superannuation with the degree of service.
Our committee has been requesting that superannuation funds enhance their level of service at the same time as keeping costs down because some of the costs, we believe, are quite outrageous. We have put in methods whereby costs should be calculated differently in terms of equity and fairness to ensure that members get the maximum advantage from their service. We have to be very careful, it sounds very plausible, but if you put caps on these sorts of things, you will have a withdrawal from the market which we do not want. We had a debate recently about the extra regulation associated with the operation of Christmas club accounts offered by banks which are used a lot by low-income earners, who put in money on a regular basis and draw it out for Christmas, to meet their family needs at that time. As a result of the enhanced regulations, that facility will be withdrawn by banks over time.
If we follow your practice, Senator Murphy, of capping some of these fees and introducing additional regulations in terms of the sorts of administrative fees that are charged on a global basis, you will find that there will be some sorts of products which will be withdrawn from the market. With superannuation we do not want a one size fits all approach. We want something that is fair and reasonable where costs are kept to a minimum and there is absolute transparency because transparency is a detergent inasmuch as it tends to wash out the nasties. We want maximum transparency but I think you have to be very careful, Senator Murphy, before advocating that we go down the path of a single exit fee that is to apply across the spectrum of superannuation products.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Murphy, Sen Shayne",IND,2003-09-18,"—In respect of the comments made by Senator Watson, there are a lot of financial products and, yes, of course there are costs associated with going into them and with exiting them. Time frames are often set for the term of an investment—when you are expected to go into the investment and when you may exit that investment with no exit fee. I accept in respect of superannuation products that, yes, of course there is a term, but what you do not want is a situation where you get lumbered on the exit with commissions and a whole manner of other costs. That is what you do not want. That is why you can have a position where, if you are talking about transparency, you can talk up-front to the consumer about the term of the investment, regardless of whether or not it is a portfolio mix in superannuation, of which there are many. 
I accept the argument that, yes, of course people would want to choose variations of the blend of portfolio that they may have, particularly those people with more money. But in respect of that alone, those with more money are often more astute. This is not about those who have the capacity to understand, those who have the money to make the investments and those who make clear choices. I am talking about those people who get propositions put to them without transparency. Speaking from personal experience, long before I came to this place I had a personal superannuation scheme. I was then offered a new portfolio mix. I was not told that there was a new start date, yet when I sought to roll that superannuation fund into another superannuation fund more than 50 per cent of the money was to be consumed by exit fees due to commissions et cetera.
That is what I am talking about. You can certainly be imaginative when you put in place investment opportunities—and they come in any number of forms—but you have to advise the person who is going to invest the money about whether it is a time frame of 12 months, two years or three years. I am not advocating that you put your money in today and withdraw it tomorrow. Of course you would have products being withdrawn from the market. I did not say that. What I was suggesting is that you have transparency to the extent that people are told that, if they put their money into this portfolio mix, this will be the term of the investment; otherwise, there will be exit fees. That is just logical. You should then say what those exit fees will be.
It is very easy to charge a lot of exit fees. As you know, Senator Watson, in respect of forestry investments some companies are charging $10,000 per hectare and others are charging $4,000 per hectare. They are the same trees and the same ground. Why? Because one company is making a lot more money by charging the consumer significantly more in management fees. Does the system stop that? No. That is why I say that, with regard to the great bulk of people in this country who are going to have superannuation, it is important to give them some form of protection. The system does not act in other areas, not even now, but it ought to in respect of those people with superannuation because it is such an important area of life savings for so many people. That is why I say that the government has to give serious consideration to how it deals with exit fees in the longer term.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Cherry, Sen John",AD,2003-09-18,"—In returning to the amendments we were discussing, I want to note the response from the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer to my question about reports and to thank her for her commitment that there will be consultation with interested parties on those regulations before they are released. I would note for the record that the Democrats are very keen to see the information gathered by income groups, income brackets, and matched against spouse incomes. There has been a lot of speculation in this debate as to how many spouses of low-income earners and how many spouses of high-income earners will receive the co-contribution.
That is an important issue, but I am not too worried about it. There has been a lot of debate in this place over a very long period of time about the extent to which superannuation discriminates against women, particularly when they are in and out of the work force. The whole notion of allowing women when they return to the work force in a part-time position to actually accelerate their superannuation, regardless of what their husband is earning, is something that I think has been understated in this debate. There has been a lot of talk about the equity of whether this measure will be picked up only by spouses of high-income earners. I think what is more likely is that it is going to be picked up by spouses of a whole range of income earners. As I said in my opening comments, I would expect women who are returning to the work force to be one of the key categories of people picking up this particular measure. It is important to collect that information. I suspect the figures will disprove the concerns raised by ACOSS and by other people in this debate that this measure will mostly go to spouses of high-income earners, and I look forward to seeing those figures reported to the parliament in due course.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2003-09-18,"—I have two brief matters to raise. Getting back to Senator Sherry's question about whether the co-contribution would be subject to a commission, I have sought clarification. The example was that, if $500 were contributed to a fund, what would happen in the case of a commission? As I anticipated, there really is no way that you can effectively quarantine or ring-fence any contribution. Obviously, whatever arrangements are set up by the fund apply. I think that deals with that point.
There is one other matter that I want to make sure is on the record, lest anybody be under any misapprehension about something I said earlier, and it is that the co-contribution payment costings and take-up that we have talked about are based on the contribution data from the surcharge reporting system, which does provide more superior data than the rebate data. The co-contribution behavioural take-up data has built in regard for research that was undertaken by IFSA, the Investment and Financial Services Association. Otherwise, all the estimates are Treasury's. I just wanted to make sure the record was clear on that.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-09-18,"—On that point the minister has clarified, she has explained that the projections are based on more optimistic scenarios than she was initially claiming. I want to come back to the commission. It is now clear that if a person puts $500 into a fund it is their own money and a commission could apply. I have just been looking at paragraph 1.35 in the explanatory memorandum. The minister has not answered my question about the government contribution. Let us say that the matching government contribution is $500. The explanatory memorandum says:
The Commissioner may determine to pay the Government co-contribution to the trustee of a complying superannuation fund for crediting to an account of the person within that fund.
That is fine. It is sensible. If the government passes the money over to the fund and if there is a commission arrangement, is it possible for the commission to be deducted from the government contribution by the fund?",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2003-09-18,"—My advisers will correct me if I characterise this incorrectly, but my understanding is that what will apply to money paid on behalf of an individual will be the arrangements set up in the fund, and they apply to all contributions. That is my understanding. If I am wrong about that I will be corrected.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-09-18,"—I do not know whether Senator Cherry has even considered this issue. My understanding is that when the government pays, let us say, $500 to match the contribution and there is an allowance or provision in respect of the fund then a commission can be taken out of the government contribution. That could happen. It is not prohibited. It seems to me to be interesting that the government understandably is not applying the contributions tax to the government contribution—it is not going to take 15 per cent out of the $500, let us say—but it will be possible for a commission to be taken out of the government's guaranteed matching contribution. That seems to me to be very strange indeed. Why would a government permit a deduction, a commission, out of its payment into the fund to match the low-income earner employee's contribution? It is very odd in principle that that would be permitted.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2003-09-18,"—People will obviously have regard to fees and charges on accounts where their money is, and choice and portability would aptly provide for situations where people face unreasonable fees and charges. That has been the whole point of the government's package, which includes the bills currently before the Senate and will in future include portability and choice. People can then have a choice. If you are in a fund that is charging unreasonable fees or making charges you think are inappropriate and you wish to move your money, you will be able to do so. The government has the recipe and prescription ready on its legislative agenda to deal with precisely the difficulty, if indeed there is one, that Senator Sherry has identified.
As I have said, we could, not only in respect of these bills, go through the whole of the government's better superannuation package. In many respects these measures are interrelated. They all provide the opportunity for Australians to have better retirement incomes and outcomes. The whole issue of fees and charges is something that will be taken care of in a choice and portability environment. As I understand the recent Senate report on portability, there is really no issue with the fact that you should not have excessive fees and charges across a lot of little accounts. There is no doubt that if people can actually make these choices you will find very quickly that the competitive pressures will make funds comply. This is not something that is causing the government great concern. Obviously, with these matters you have to put the principles in place and you have to always be vigilant and always monitor what goes on. There is no doubt that this present legislation is set up to provide benefits to people so that they will get the benefit of not only their voluntary contributions but also the co-contribution. We would certainly like to get to a position where they can move their money and choose where to put it if they find that fees and charges are unreasonable.",SENATE,<title>SUPERANNUATION (GOVERNMENT CO-CONTRIBUTION FOR LOW INCOME EARNERS) (CONSEQUENTIAL AMENDMENTS) BILL 2003</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,17,1,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-09-18,"—That will be a debate for another day. I was interested in the terminology that the minister just used. She referred to a `package' and said that in many respects these measures are all interrelated. I agree with her. There is one exception she attempts to exclude from the package and the interrelationship, and that is the issue I referred to earlier which is the government's failure to collect the $325 million from the temporary departing residents. That was part of the package.
I find it quite extraordinary that the government is going to pay a matching co-contribution, let us say of $500—and the government has said it is not going to tax it; it seems logical to me that you do not apply the contributions tax—but it will be possible, and it will happen, at least in some cases, that a commission can be deducted against the government's contribution. I find that quite extraordinary and I do not see why it should be permitted.

	(e)	any other information prescribed in the regulations.
	(3)	Information provided under paragraphs (2)(b) and (c) must be presented as follows:

(1)	Clause 15, page 10 (after line 16), after paragraph (1)(d), insert:
	(da)	where the person does not have a legal personal representative, a dependent of the person; or

	(da)	where the person does not have a legal personal representative, a dependent of the person; or
(4)	Clause 56, page 45 (lines 1 and 2), omit the definition of dependant, substitute:
dependant in relation to a person includes the spouse, de facto partner and any child of the person or of the person's spouse or de facto partner.
de facto partner, in relation to a person means a person who, whether or not of the same sex as the person, lives with the person on a genuine domestic basis as a partner of the person.
These amendments are to bring this amending legislation into line with forthcoming amendments which would remove discrimination against same-sex couples and other people in living arrangements from the statutes. It is important that we be clear that this amending legislation does not discriminate. Therefore, amendment (4) omits the definition of `dependant' and substitutes for it a new definition of `dependant' and `de facto partner'. Amendments (1) to (3) are self-explanatory.

It is coming from the three parties on this side of house. It does reflect the view abroad in the Australian community in 2003 that there should not be discrimination in matters like superannuation—indeed, in any matter at all—against people because of their sexuality or, in this case, because they have a co-dependent relationship which does not come within the narrow limits of the previous definition of marriage.
It is a challenge for the government in the coming couple of weeks to consider whether it will catch up with Australia in 2003 or whether it wants to reside, as the Prime Minister seems to want to, in the 1950s. This is socially fair legislation, it is equitable, it reflects what the states have already done, it reflects what similar countries elsewhere around the world have done, it is in keeping with the Australian people themselves and it gets rid of a very clear penalty provision against those people who have same-sex relationships. When those people come to pass on their superannuation to their partners, there is a big tax imposition in certain circumstances which will be obviated by this. Whatever, there should not be discrimination under the law, and this is part of the process.

This measure represents one step forward after they had taken about 20 steps backwards. Labor does not agree with an exclusive tax cut for high-income earners. I have made that point time and time again. If there is to be a tax cut on superannuation then it should apply to all superannuation fund members and not be exclusively confined to high-income earners. That is not a fair approach.

The National Residue Survey (Customs) Levy Amendment Bill 2002 amends the National Residue Survey (Customs) Levy Act 1998 to restate the operative and maximum rates of national residue survey customs levy on apples and pears from a per box rate to a per kilogram rate. This move is at the request of the Australian Apple and Pear Growers Association to make the calculation of the levies easier, and it has Labor's support. 
The National Residue Survey (Customs) Levy Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2003 amends the National Residue Survey (Customs) Levy Act 1998 to raise the maximum levy rate allowable on honey for the purpose of the act from the present rate of 0.3 of a cent per kilogram to 0.6 of a cent per kilogram. Labor notes the government's advice that there is `no plan to increase the operative rate of levy at the moment and any request to do so would only be at the behest of industry and subject to separate approval'.
The National Residue Survey (Excise) Levy Amendment Bill 2002 amends the National Residue Survey (Excise) Levy Act 1998 and also has Labor's support. It restates the operative and maximum rates of national residue survey excise levy on apples and pears and accords with industry's request.

Has the minister now checked the Canberra Times of 23 August, where the Minister for Employment Services, Mr Brough, claimed that 60,000 unemployed people were about to be suspended from benefits due to their inactivity in the Job Network? As the minister has also had 24 hours to check on the written advice she received from Centrelink, can she confirm that Centrelink provided her with the figure of around 3,000 facing suspension, not 60,000?

"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2003-09-18,"—Senator, I give you great credit for asking this question again. You have given me the opportunity, yet again, to give you the answer.
—You didn't answer yesterday; you said you didn't know. 
—In relation to what Mr Brough said the other day or in August, that is right; I had not seen that. But let me answer you this way—
—We are trying to understand the 60,000 figure.
—Senator Collins, if your party is ever successful—
—Minister, I remind you to ignore the interjections.
—If the Labor Party is ever successful in getting back into government, Senator Collins may or may not have an opportunity to answer questions. It is true that Minister Brough or, rather, the Department of Employment and Workplace Relations were concerned about the follow-up with respect to 60,000 job seekers, who at one point had not attended an interview. And it is true that we were asked to follow up on those. I encourage you to understand that Job Network and employment is a moving feast in the sense that the figures on any one day will be different from the next day and so on. At one point in time, we would have suspended 3,000 people. The only significance of that is that it is a point somewhere between zero and about 11,000, which is the number we have now suspended. There is no significance to this 3,000 figure. I just cannot understand what you think you are onto there. So I cannot help you.
In relation to any bucket of people who have not attended an interview at any one time, when you review them you will find a number of categories, such as people who have subsequently rebooked to have a first interview. That is important because one of the big changes in this new system is that, rather than looking to immediately suspend or breach people, what we are actually trying to do is re-engage people with the network—to get them to go to the appointment to get them the help they need to get a job. In other words, our view of the welfare system is not one where it just about money and whether you have attended something; it is all about trying to re-engage you. That is why it is relevant to say that there may be people who have not attended an interview but, if they rebook for a subsequent interview, of course you would not be moving to suspend them.
You will find people in other categories, such as people who have already attended an interview, people who are exempt from doing so, and people who are undertaking other approved activities. Mr Brough was right to say that DEWR had concerns about 60,000 in the follow-up. As I said, in relation to the follow-up, any particular bucket of people you look at at any particular time will contain people in those categories that I have referred to.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Employment: Job Network</title>,Questions Without Notice,19,1,answer
"Vanstone, Sen Amanda",LP,2003-09-18,"—I am sorry, Senator George Campbell, you just still do not understand. What I have indicated to you is that, at this point in time, we would have suspended 11,000-odd people—that is my latest advice. The only significance of the 3,000 figure that you raised that other day is that at some point when we started suspending people we would have hit the 3,000 number and then moved on from that. What I am telling you is that, as at today's date, 11,000 people have been suspended. You seem to be confusing that with another entirely different figure which is 60,000 people we were asked to look at. You are confusing those two. There is a world of difference between asking us to look at the 60,000 figure and the actual number of suspensions we have made to today's date.

On the first day of hearings, 11 officers were charged in relation to the incident. Major General Sriyanto was not among those charged.

"Stephens, Sen Ursula",ALP,2003-09-18,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Health and Ageing (Senator Patterson) to questions without notice asked today.
This afternoon I would like to reflect on the answers given to the Senate by Senator Patterson about the very important issue of the future of the health system of Australia and, in particular, her responses to the questions about Medicare, bulk-billing and the shortages of doctors in rural and regional Australia.
This afternoon we saw an extraordinary performance from someone who has learnt the art of doublespeak. When we hear from the Prime Minister and he says, `Never, never,' of course he means: `Whenever I can.' When he says, `We absolutely guarantee,' he means: `Don't hold your breath.' When he says, `I don't believe we're facing a crisis,' as he recently did on radio 2GB, he means: `I always said I was going to get rid of Medicare, and this is it.' And when he rules it out, he is definitely ruling it in. So when he praised the minister's performance the other day we know he means to get rid of her. He certainly ordered the word `bulk-billing' to be deleted from the government's vocabulary. He campaigned on a slogan `For all of us'—and we know that Medicare is intended for some of us. He told us that changes were to protect bulk-billing and make health care more accessible, but he really means that bulk-billing will collapse and Australian families will struggle to access basic health care. 
The facts are there for everyone to see. There is no disputing the figures from the minister's own department: bulk-billing rates have declined by more than 12 per cent under this government, whereas bulk-billing rates rose every year under Labor. They have plummeted by the 10 million GP services each year that were bulk-billed under a Labor government but that are now being paid for up front by ordinary Australians. I travel all over New South Wales and I hear the same stories. There are fewer and fewer doctors offering bulk-billing, and the average copayment charged for a visit to a non bulk-billing GP is now more than $13. There are many practices where that copayment is $20 or $25 and I have heard of one case where it is $40. After-hours consultation costs are horrendous. In some cases, such as the one I mentioned today in question time, we have heard that people are being charged more than $100. How do you think a distressed parent with a child having an asthma attack in the middle of the night or with a raging fever responds to the notion that a doctor will not come unless they can pay an up-front fee like that?
What we have before us in the government's A Fairer Medicare package is a recipe for an entrenched two-tiered system where, as is always the case with this government, families in the middle get squeezed. Families and those not entitled to a health concession card or pharmaceutical benefits assistance will pay and pay. We have had evidence to the Medicare inquiry where people have told us that they have had to make the most diabolical choices: do I go to the doctor or feed the kids; do I pay the doctor, knowing I cannot afford the medication; do I hang on for a few days and see if I am going to feel better; do you think this pain in my chest might go away? This is not what Australians want from a health system. Senator Patterson has admitted that. `It is not the package that I originally would have wanted,' she said.
Under the Howard government's so-called Fairer Medicare package, bulk-billing will be available to concession card holders—no-one else. How could that be described as fair, either for the paying patients who have to have money in their pockets before they can visit a GP or for the concession card holders who can easily find themselves moving to the end of the queue—and we have heard examples of this happening in Victoria—and only being fitted in when the paying patients have been attended to? The government's package means that only those who can afford to pay up front can afford to get sick. Those who struggle to get by, ordinary decent working Australians who pay their Medicare levy and their taxes, will feel like second-class citizens if this legislation is passed. Shouldn't people have access to the best medical care we can afford when they need it? Under Senator Patterson's plan they will need to keep their wallets well stocked just in case of an emergency. Health care costs have increased by 7.2 per cent in the last 12 months according to the ABS, faster than any other CPI group, yet the senator insists that that is not going to happen. We know that it is and it will, and that is something Labor will not tolerate.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Medicare: Reform</title>,Questions Without Notice,21,1,speech
"McGauran, Sen Julian",NP,2003-09-18,"—In rising to challenge the previous speaker, Senator Stephens, I know that the Labor Party seek to focus on health as something they think they can dent the government on as we enter an election year. But, in truth, the government welcomes any discussion with regard to the health area because we are in the very good position of having runs on the board. We have shown our hand, our reforms. When we entered government in 1996 we introduced in that year's budget the 30 per cent health rebate and we have introduced many other reforms since then, right up to this day, as Senator Patterson has properly outlined. 
But we are yet to see the Labor Party's policy on health, even on the most fundamental question of policy on which they attack the government day by day: are the Labor Party or are they not going to abolish the 30 per cent tax rebate which amounts to $750 million directly in the pockets of Australian families? Until they can come into this chamber and answer even that one single policy question, what shred of credibility have they got in the health debate? So we welcome any discussion on health. As I said, one of the first reforms this government introduced, against the opposition's will—they voted against it—was the 30 per cent rebate.
We came into government with a Medicare system under duress, with private health insurance collapsing to a dangerous point—and, if my memory serves me well, former minister for health Senator Richardson even benchmarked the crisis point for private health: it would be reached if it fell below 35 per cent. Private health uptake fell well below 35 per cent—I think it fell to below 31 per cent—so the government had to, as a necessity, introduce reforms to reverse that trend. That trend has now been reversed. I challenge the opposition and the next speaker to tell us what they are going to do with the 30 per cent rebate. I have heard interjections with regard to this; they are mixed and muddled. But I think, in reality, they are going to abolish that 30 per cent rebate. They should put that on the table if we are going to have an honest debate.
The government have also introduced other reforms to reverse that trend. To take the pressure off the Medicare system we have introduced Lifetime Health Cover. The government have also introduced many other incentives to get people back into the private health system so as to preserve Medicare. We are the best friends of Medicare. This line that the opposition trots out that we seek to undermine or even abolish Medicare is absolute rubbish. Every reform the government have introduced has been to preserve Medicare, to prop up Medicare, to take the pressure off the public health system and the hospital system.
Senator Stephens—and, no doubt, speakers following will do this—dragged across the red herring of bulk-billing. This is somewhat of a red herring, at least within the city metropolitan areas, because well over 80 per cent of pensioners over 65 years of age and low-income people receive bulk-billing. Yes, there is a problem in the country areas, but that is directly related to a shortage of doctors. The government have introduced incentives through the A Fairer Medicare policy to address that, but that is not going to happen overnight. It is very much a cultural problem to get doctors back into the rural and country areas, into the bush—a term I like, which I know many of my country constituents do not, but I cannot help it; it is such an Australian term. It is very much a long-term policy.

"Mackay, Sen Sue",ALP,2003-09-18,"—Early this week in the chamber Senator Barnett took issue at some work that Michelle O'Byrne has been doing in her electorate of Bass in my home state of Tasmania. I notice that Senator Barnett is not in the chamber contributing to this debate—he is in fact the deputy chair of the Senate Select Committee on Medicare—but I did see him giving some instructions to Senator Colbeck before he left, and I am sure Senator Colbeck appreciates the instructions he got. Michelle O'Byrne said that John Howard wants to destroy Medicare, and Senator Barnett said that that was nonsense. Let us have a look at what John Howard has said for himself about Medicare. John Howard has threatened to `pull Medicare right apart' and to `get rid of bulk-billing'. He has described bulk-billing as `an absolute rort'. That is not us saying that. It is the Prime Minister of Australia saying that. 
—Mr Deputy President, I raise a point of order. Are we to believe the direct quotes of the speaker? Those quotes have not been dated. She said that they are attributed to the Prime Minister, John Howard. I would ask her to put a date on those quotes, and she knows very well that, whatever the truth of those comments, they have been repudiated.
—There is no point of order. That is a debating point, but I will pass it back to Senator Mackay.
—I will provide the sources to Senator McGauran; in fact, I will table them later on today if he would like. Actually, I was quite surprised to hear Senator Barnett on Monday speaking about bulk-billing, because I thought, as does Senator Stephens, that bulk-billing was now a proscribed set of words and that John Howard had ordered them to be deleted from the government's lexicon. I hope Senator Barnett does not face disciplinary action from his leader over this—but, then again, John Howard is not all that strong in enforcing his own rules, is he? It seems that the government, in particular John Howard, has belatedly realised that the people of Australia do want Medicare.
—Order! You should be referring to the Prime Minister as Mr Howard or Prime Minister Howard.
—Thank you, Mr Deputy President. They want a system that provides access to health care for everyone irrespective and regardless of their ability to pay. That is what the people want. So now we have Mr John Howard and Senator Barnett trying to convince the Australian people that they do want Medicare and that they even want the B word—bulk-billing. Honestly, they do—John Howard has said they do. They want it so much that they have introduced a package that has been described by practically everyone who has looked at it as a complete failure which will do nothing to restore bulk-billing rates and will only result in a less equitable system.
Senator Barnett is good at bandying figures around. He is certainly not bad at doing the numbers—we see that at the moment in Tasmania—carefully selected to conceal the truth. However, I am not sure he always gets them right. He said on Monday that, in the six years to 1996, under Labor the gap charge rose at a higher rate than for the six years from 1996 under Mr John Howard. I have had a look at the Medicare figures and it seems that from 1989-90 to financial year 1995-96 the charge went from $6 to $8.32, a rise of 39 per cent. We have an average gap now of $13.24, a rise of 59 per cent since this government came into office. I say to Senator Colbeck, since Senator Barnett is not here, that in my maths book 59 is a much bigger figure than 39. Let me tell you where I got the figures from. They are the June 2003 figures from the Department of Health and Ageing's Medicare statistics and also sourced from the HIC.
As well as getting his sums wrong—but we do concede he is not bad at doing the numbers—there are a few other figures that Senator Barnett missed out. He forgot to tell the chamber that Tasmania has the second lowest bulk-billing rate in Australia and that the bulk-billing rate of GPs in Tasmania since Labor left office in 1996 has fallen from 66.2 per cent to 54.9 per cent. That is a 17 per cent drop. 
What are the people of Bass, who Senator Barnett seems so keen to shield from this information, saying about their access to health care? If Senator Barnett had read the submissions to the Medicare inquiry, of which he is the deputy chair, he would know what they are saying. I do not have time now to quote from them but I would be happy to provide that information to Senator Julian McGauran if he wants. The Liberal package to save Medicare is a failure because ideologically Mr John Howard has already indicated he is opposed to bulk-billing.
Labor is not opposed to it. Labor believes in Medicare. Labor has a package that will save Medicare. So I say to Senator Barnett, putative government minister in the Senate, in concluding my remarks, that we do not really care whether it is Senator Abetz or Senator Barnett who is No. 1 on the Senate ticket. We are quite happy with either of those. We would like to make them de facto members of the Labor Party campaign committee in Tasmania. But, whatever the government does, we would request that you do not promote Senator Colbeck, because he actually does not do a bad job.
—The kiss of death!",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Medicare: Reform</title>,Questions Without Notice,21,1,speech
"Colbeck, Sen Richard",LP,2003-09-18,"—That is exactly right, Senator McGauran, the kiss of death. There is no pressure at all—thank you, Senator Mackay. Senator Mackay speaks as though there were no problems at all with the health system when Labor left office—that it was A-okay. She was just talking about figures that were dropping. She obviously did not mention the private health insurance figures which were plummeting under Labor—in fact they were in free fall—and finished at an unsustainable 30.1 per cent when Labor left office. The figures have now climbed to 43.4 per cent, and that has taken enormous pressure off the public health system, through the use of private health and the private health system, and made much more finance available for the operation of the public health system.
Mind you, having the states strip beds out of the public hospital system at an alarming rate is having a very negative impact, and a very concerning impact, on the accessibility of the public health system. Waiting lists all around the country are rising due to accessibility issues. This is one of the things the Howard government is looking to see: a health system that provides access. Labor was all about stripping away the private health system.
Senator Stephens quoted from people in her area looking to access the health system. I will put on the record some quotes about how people feel about the 30 per cent health rebate. Senator McGauran mentioned the fact that that particular element of the health system is under threat from Labor. Labor have not said that they will keep it. In fact I think it is quite realistic to suggest that Labor will get rid of the 30 per cent health rebate and, I would have to say, that would be much to their detriment. This is what some people think about the private health rebate. One person from Queensland has said:
I am a single mortgagee on a low income. I have already stopped payment on my personal income protection after 10 years due to the fact that I could not afford it together with my private health cover. I will not give up my private health cover after witnessing what happened in particular to my father at a public hospital.
Another person has said: 
Please do not abolish the 30 per cent rebate. I feel strongly that it is an incentive for us to continue to have medical insurance instead of relying on the already overcrowded and long waiting lists in public hospitals for treatment and other medical attention.
It is quite clear that people value the private health system and the Howard government's 30 per cent rebate that supports it. Another person said:
We are aged pensioners that are battling to find the premium for private health cover as it is now. If we had to pay 30 per cent more we would have to join the queue at public hospitals. If we developed something serious we would probably die before we were seen by any kind of specialist due to future governments wanting a health system to be more overcrowded than it already is, with years waiting for treatment.
There is absolutely no doubt that the private health rebate is something that is very much valued by the Australian community, and Labor should be prepared to say quite openly and quite freely whether or not they are going to get rid of it. They have been totally silent on that and it is quite reasonable in respect of that silence to consider that they will get rid of the 30 per cent private health rebate. If they do, you will see the participation rate plummet to the levels that they were when Labor were last in office and this will make the private health system completely unsustainable.
Today Senator Patterson mentioned several things that the government had put into place to assist the health system. One of the things that I have seen particularly in Tasmania in my area on the north-west coast is the Rural Clinical School, which has been designed to encourage doctors to train in rural and regional areas. It is highly valued not only by the trainees that are there but also by the communities. It is placing training professionals into regional areas—(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Medicare: Reform</title>,Questions Without Notice,21,1,speech
"Denman, Sen Kay",ALP,2003-09-18,"—I rise to take note of the answers given by Senator Patterson. In 1995 Mr Howard told Australians:
We absolutely guarantee the retention of Medicare. We guarantee the retention of bulk-billing.
Yet now in 2003 the Howard government's proposal for A Fairer Medicare seeks to undermine the entire Medicare system. Prime Minister Howard's plan does nothing to halt the falling rates of bulk-billing, particularly in rural and regional areas such as the north-west coast of Tasmania where both Senator Colbeck and I live. It does nothing to encourage GPs into rural areas. It does nothing to address the critical shortage of nurses in these areas. On the north-west coast we have a very high unemployment rate and a high proportion of working poor, most of whom are one-income families. People on the north-west coast are severely disadvantaged by the breakdown of the Medicare system under the Howard government and the demise of bulk-billing in particular. 
Since the Howard government came to office in 1996, Tasmania's bulk-billing rate has decreased by 17 per cent to 54.9 per cent. Almost half of Tasmanian GPs do not bulk-bill. The two-tier system proposed by Mr Howard means that any family earning over $32,000 a year will not have access to a health care card. The Prime Minister's plan means that these working poor will increasingly be forced to weigh up whether to go to the doctor or to put food on the table.
Very recently I had a phone call one evening at home from a woman who had been to the doctor that day with her husband and three children. They were from a single-income family. They all had the same viral infection and, because they had to pay up front fees to the doctor, they could not afford the medication. So she phoned me to see whether there was anything that we could help her do about that. 
As it stands, these Tasmanians cannot afford GPs because of the lack of bulk-billing and a rise in the cost of a visit to a GP. That means worse health outcomes as people put off visiting the doctor. In some cases it means higher costs as people wait until the condition is serious enough to take them to a hospital emergency room, putting further pressure on the public system—and our public system on the coast is very stretched because of this. This is compounded by the GP shortage in Tasmania due to some GPs retiring because of the medical indemnity crisis.
The doctor-patient ratio in Tasmania is now over 1,000 patients per doctor, which means doctors are overworked and patients cannot get access to the treatment they need. Labor believes that all Australians should have access to health care when they need it, regardless of their ability to pay. How does Labor plan to fix the damage the Howard government has done to Medicare and defend bulk-billing rates from more attacks? We have announced a $1.9 billion package to reverse the collapse in bulk-billing by lifting the patient rebate rate for bulk-billing for all Australians, no matter where they live or how much they earn. 
Doctors in rural and regional areas will receive an additional $22,500 each year for bulk-billing 70 per cent or more of their patients. We will provide GPs in the areas that need them, particularly in rural and remote areas, and more nurses to assist GPs in their work. Labor will deliver a $5 increase in the rebate for bulk-billed consultations. Australians know that Medicare is the best health care system in the world. They will not be fooled by the government's pretended commitment to Medicare. Labor built Medicare; Labor believes in Medicare and only Labor has a plan to save Medicare.
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE: TAKE NOTE OF ANSWERS</title>,<title>Medicare: Reform</title>,Questions Without Notice,21,1,speech
"Ridgeway, Sen Aden",AD,2003-09-18,"—I move:
That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:
The requirement for the Australian Government to act to ensure that it is meeting its obligations to Indigenous children under the Convention of the Rights of the Child, given that the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child is holding a general discussion on the rights of Indigenous children on 19 September 2003, and the Committee has identified Indigenous children as a group which most suffers from discrimination and which is confronted by various forms of violence both in the home and in society at large. 
This is a particularly important moment, given that the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child will be holding their global discussions tomorrow about Indigenous children all over the world. I think it is timely that we deal with these issues, particularly in the context of what we are doing here in Australia—that is, reflecting upon some of the circumstances of young Indigenous children in this country as they relate to questions of them suffering discrimination and the various forms of violence they are confronted with as well as the requirement of the Australian government to act to ensure that it is meeting its obligations under the Convention on the Rights of the Child. This being the case, we do need to ask ourselves and the government whether Australia is indeed meeting its obligations in relation to that convention.
As I have mentioned on a number of other occasions, Australia's Indigenous population contrasts significantly with the rest of the population. Of the 410,000 Indigenous Australians, it is important to keep in mind that about two-thirds are under the age of 25 and about 40 per cent of those are under the age of 15. So we have a very young population and I think that exposes young people to a range of circumstances that need to be dealt with somehow. That fact alone means that every effort must now be made to ensure that, over the decades to come, the inequalities between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people do not widen any further; otherwise, further generations of Indigenous Australians are likely to face a severe lack of life opportunities as adults. I think that, if nothing else, the statistics are obvious in making a call for the government to respond appropriately in looking at the circumstances of young Indigenous children.
The UN Committee on the Rights of the Child has identified Indigenous children as a group that suffers from discrimination in relation to most rights enshrined in the convention and regularly calls on states to fulfil their right to enjoy their own culture. According to article 30 of the convention, an Indigenous child:
... shall not be denied the right, in community with other members of his or her group, to enjoy his or her own culture, to profess and practise his or her own religion, or to use his or her own language.
The other significant parts of the convention relate to non-discrimination; the best interests of the child; the right to life, survival, and development; and respect for the views of the child. The convention obliges parties, including Australia, to prevent discrimination against Indigenous children, to recognise cultural specificity of Indigenous children and requires states to provide them with special protection in order that they are able to exercise their rights and enjoy their own culture, language and religion.
Generally, these issues amount to equality. The term `equality' means a situation where Indigenous people enjoy all of the rights and privileges that the rest of the population currently enjoys. Improving the human rights of Indigenous children is not merely about formal equality; it is about outcomes and can only be measured by the end product—that is, whether Indigenous people do actually enjoy all of the rights and privileges that are enjoyed by the rest of the population. The simple answer at the moment is no. If we are going to turn the situation around, one of the things that the government must do is take a leadership role and be accountable for addressing the human rights concerns surrounding Indigenous children.
It is true to say that Indigenous people, across every measurement of socioeconomic status—wellbeing, age, geographical circumstances and gender—are severely and disproportionately disadvantaged when compared to the rest of the population. This disadvantage is a human rights issue. Much of it is historically derived through institutional as well as overt discrimination. Whilst I do not want to go to the raft of depressing statistics concerning Indigenous Australians, there are a number of the features of Indigenous life which have a profound effect on the livelihood and the human rights of Indigenous children. Take living standards alone. A survey in 2001 revealed 56 Indigenous communities where water testing had failed. There were nearly 1,000 communities that were not connected to the state grid electricity and another 1,000 communities with septic or other non-town sewerage systems. These issues, as well as the high infant mortality rate and low birth weight, create further health problems for Indigenous children. 
Education is another item on the governments `practical reconciliation' agenda. Not only are the participation rates for Indigenous children far lower than the rest of the population at all levels of education; but in the Northern Territory alone it has been estimated that around 5,000 Indigenous children do not have access to secondary education, with the closest schools being at least two hours away. I think that is appalling. If those 5,000 children were here in Canberra, or in any of the states on the Eastern seaboard, the situation would be seen as a crisis and would not have been allowed to occur. 
In relation to child protection, Indigenous children are overrepresented in the children's care and protection systems across Australia, at over three times the non-Indigenous rate. Indigenous children are placed under care and protection orders and in out-of-home care at six times the non-Indigenous rate. As Indigenous children get older, before they become adults, they may encounter the juvenile justice system. Indigenous juveniles now make up 43 per cent of all juveniles in detention, despite comprising less than four per cent of the total juvenile population. This is an overrepresentation and is 20 times the non-Indigenous rate. 
At present there are many strategies aimed at trying to overcome these problems, but we have to ask whether they are addressing or ignoring the human rights of Indigenous children. For example, in Western Australia the Premier recently announced that a curfew would be imposed on children who were not home by 10 p.m.—children found in the streets after this time would be detained. This move followed a high speed car chase involving Indigenous youth and a stolen car. Tragically, a 12-year-old boy was killed. This strategy is not targeted specifically at Indigenous children, but in Northbridge, where the curfew is in place, it is likely to affect a higher proportion of Indigenous children. It is a reactionary, quick fix solution to what is a very complex problem. While on the surface these types of strategies have widespread appeal in terms of cheap law and order politics, any government that was serious about trying to address these issues would focus on the causes rather than the symptoms. Other notable policy and human rights failures include mandatory sentencing laws, drinking bans in Indigenous communities and, most notably, policies etched into the government's practical reconciliation framework. 
The various strategies that do not respect the human rights of Indigenous people focus instead on individual responsibility and are based on the view that, because the many legal or visible barriers to equality are no longer in place, this equates to equality itself. While I agree that individuals should take responsibility for their actions and that parents should take responsibility for their children, the government needs to realise that, as well as being individuals, children are also members of families, and families are members of communities. An emphasis needs to be placed on strengthening these families and communities and taking a proactive approach that promotes and respects Indigenous human rights. As well as taking a proactive approach, the need for a holistic approach has been advocated, at least in the last 30 years, and particularly since this government came to power. So in negotiation with the aspirations of Indigenous people and in conjunction with governments at all levels, this government has to make a more concerted effort to progress strategies to build a better future for Indigenous children.  
The government cannot shy away from the types of problems I have talked about and must step forward and show strong leadership on these matters. It is not enough to say that funding is being increased if there is no commitment to be accountable for where it is going. I would say, however, that leadership will require smarter funding because it is not always necessarily a question of more resources and making sure that targets are set and goals are being achieved. This issue is being dealt with through the COAG process in the context of looking at national benchmarks and standards. I have some concerns about that as a result of evidence put forward in an inquiry being conducted by the Senate. The process of looking at benchmarks and standards is not about creating the incentive of setting goals to be achieved, but about evaluations after the fact. We will always have a hit-and-miss approach in trying to respond to what is a crisis within Indigenous communities, especially for children. 
Further spending on bandaid solutions to complex problems is doomed to fail. That is the message the government needs to hear. Unless the government hears these calls, the situation for Indigenous children, both current and future, will be fraught with further difficulties and relations between Indigenous and non-Indigenous are likely to deteriorate.

"Collins, Sen Jacinta",ALP,2003-09-18,"—I am very pleased that Senator Ridgeway has turned our minds to the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Childhood violence has received a lot of press coverage recently. Tragic deaths and violence to children are occurring with, on some occasions, several children involved. To take a step back, it was the Keating Labor government that signed the convention in January 1991. Labor has always, and will always, put the needs of working people and of the less advantaged at the forefront of the political agenda. Indigenous children are one of the most disadvantaged groups in our community. Senator Ridgeway referred to some of the statistics. I also note that we have seen over and over again the data in reports and the press consistently repeating that there is a massive overrepresentation of our Indigenous community in the juvenile justice system. This must continue to concern us. 
Today's UNICEF report highlighted that poverty and stress, drug and alcohol abuse and poor levels of education were major triggers for child abuse and neglect and that biological parents were the abusers in 80 per cent of cases. In Indigenous communities, the poor levels of education are a significant contributing factor to all levels of abuse, including child abuse. The poor level of education in Indigenous communities was evidenced in the report to the Senate in March 2000 of the inquiry that I chaired into the effectiveness of education and training programs for Indigenous Australians. This report, back in 2000, demonstrated the appalling levels of education in these important communities. But the more concerning issue was that, whilst there had been some progress in relation to, for instance, year 12 retention rates and school participation rates amongst 16- and 17-year-olds, further progress appears to have slowed or stalled in more recent years. This is one area where, because of the significant differences and discrimination between Indigenous communities and the broader Australian community, we need to continue to make significant advances. We cannot afford to stall progress in these areas. 
This is where we come to Senator Ridgeway's point about leadership. A report released on 3 September by Families Australia highlights the point very well. It presents a case for Commonwealth investment and national leadership in the prevention of child abuse and neglect. In his discussion, Senator Ridgeway also referred to the problems with care and protection orders and the report that the rate of Indigenous children on orders was 5.9 times higher than the rate for other Australian children. There were 4,263 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children in Australia on care and protection orders in June 2002. Any number is too many, but this number needs to be dealt with.
It is helpful, though, to refer back to the convention and its focus on our commitment to each child. The convention stresses `each child' and that we should be providing for their development to their fullest potential. Article 30 specifically highlights attention to be paid to persons of indigenous origin. I thank Senator Ridgeway for bringing our attention back to those issues today.
This morning, I reinforced—and I repeat it now—the fact that Labor are committed to the establishment of a national commission for children and young people to protect the rights of our children. This is relevant here. We agree with Families Australia that we need concerted national leadership in this area. It is not always a question of funding but rather a question of how that funding is distributed, the strategy behind it and the commitment behind it.
Labor are pleased to support this important matter of urgency, especially given that Australia signed the agreement so long ago. The United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child has hit the spot. Indigenous children are a group who suffer from discrimination and are confronted by various forms of violence, both in the home and in society at large. Australia needs to clean up its act in this area. We need national leadership. I hope the Howard government will listen.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Indigenous Affairs: Children</title>,Matters of Urgency,22,1,speech
"Johnston, Sen David",LP,2003-09-18,"—In rising to speak to Senator Ridgeway's motion, I commend the honourable senator for presenting this matter to the Senate. It is a matter of great importance and of urgency. In the brief time that I have available to me, I propose firstly to set out the tenor and meaning of the convention insofar as it is applicable to Indigenous children in Australia and then to set out what has been, and continues to be, done by way of government response.
I agree with Senator Collins that, given the long and troubled history of the rights of Indigenous children in our great country, there can never be a point when we say the job has been done. The Convention on the Rights of the Child applies to all children equally. The convention does, however, recognise indigenous children as specific rights holders as set out in articles 17, 29 and 30. These articles identify the rights of indigenous children with respect to such matters as culture, religion, language, education and information.
The committee overseeing the convention has a special focus upon the various forms of violence and abuse which confront indigenous children right around the world, both in their homes and in their communities. In Australia there are numerous issues confronting Aboriginal children which are often endemic and peculiar to the communities in which they live. My personal experience tells me that the main problems arise and relate to the following subject headings: domestic violence between parents, between siblings and between families; substance abuse such as petrol and solvent sniffing, drug abuse and alcohol abuse; and predominantly health issues such as diabetes, glaucoma and obesity on the one hand for some suburban dwelling children, or malnutrition for children in the more remote communities around our country. According to the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, approximately 3,000 Indigenous children are found to have been abused or neglected each year, with Aboriginal children six times more likely to be removed from their families by welfare authorities for neglect or abuse than non-Indigenous children. That is a very sorry, sad and appalling statistic. 
I pause to bring to the Senate my first-hand experience of the product of petrol sniffing, particularly in the central desert regions of Western Australia. This is not a subject that many people know about, and I am sad to say it is not a subject that many people really want to know about. When I first commenced work in Kalgoorlie in 1979, I instantly became aware of the problem when five Aboriginal boys died from drinking duplicating fluid at a settlement some long distance east of Laverton in Western Australia. I have seen the end result of chronic, endemic petrol sniffing and the addictive and destructive practice that it is. Unfortunately, it irreversibly rendered the practitioners of this very sorry, sad and damaging pastime permanently brain damaged, as you would expect with the long-term ingestion of lead that is contained in most petrol, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s in Australia. These children are to be seen in the hospitals, courtrooms and community facilities around Western Australia, particularly, as I say, in the central reserve.  
There is no quick fix solution to this problem. However, I am pleased to say that education within the communities has created a level of understanding which has enabled tribal and semitribal Aboriginal people to enact by-laws and educational programs for children—and when I say children I mean very young children, as young as two and three years of age. I have actually seen them sipping petrol as they walk around their communities. It is a most tragic, sad and sorry situation.
I drew the Senate's attention to the Gordon report from Western Australia, which is a significant signpost, a landmark decision that put forward some 197 recommendations, conclusions and findings. The state government of Western Australia has begun to respond to it, but I must say, without wishing to bring politics into it, that the response has been very slow. The inertia has been great. We are a year down the track and I must confess to not being able to see many things happening which have been recommended through the very good work of Sue Gordon and her landmark report.
What has the Howard government done with regard to these various issues? The last budget allocated $2.7 billion to Aboriginal affairs, with a specific emphasis on young Indigenous Australians. That amount is one-third more, in real terms, than what was delivered in 1996. The total cost of new initiatives for this financial year is $110 million, payable over four years. This expenditure will yield 1,000 new CDEP employment places in remote communities. Of course, that is where the problem really lies. A package that provided assistance to universities and other higher education institutions in targeting services to Indigenous youth, called Backing Australia's Future, was announced by the Minister for Education, Science and Training, Dr Nelson. It provided $10 million to the Indigenous Support Fund and inaugurated a scholarship scheme to financially assist Indigenous students to undertake higher and other types of education in their formative years. 
More importantly, a longitudinal study has been funded. This study will track 4,000 Aboriginal children living in remote locations around Australia over the coming nine years, with the object of being able to benchmark where the problems lie and how we should begin to tackle them so we can more accurately target policies and programs with an expectation of more significant outcomes. I believe that study will be a significant first step in moving towards making good, sound, hands-on, roll up the sleeves policy decisions that will yield tangible results in terms of addressing Aboriginal domestic violence and child abuse.
Minister Ruddock announced that $6 million will be provided for a flexible funding pool to support COAG governments in a whole of government approach to assist 10 Indigenous communities in the central reserve regions of Australia. The government has allocated a further $19.7 million each year, commencing this year, to the Primary Health Care Access Program to improve individual health care systems in Aboriginal communities throughout Australia. That, of course, is a very significant amount of money and will go a significant way towards assisting the health and wellbeing of young people. 
—That is just this year. I am talking about the most recent initiatives. These initiatives have been going on since 1996. For Senator Crossin, who was not here, I said we have increased the funding to $2.7 billion this year, which is one-third in real terms more than we spent in 1996.
In June this year, the minister launched a practical resource kit designed to help Indigenous families and communities deal with family violence and child abuse, entitled Through young black eyes. This resource kit gives Aboriginal communities and governing councils within those communities good and practical tools for working towards preventing child abuse before it starts and showing people how to respond correctly when it does occur. Last month Senator Ruddock launched ATSIC's family violence strategy, which is a strong and determined partnership between government and ATSIC to show leadership in this battle. The strategy includes a well thought out and feasible long-term plan to arrest family violence. The plan is entitled the Family Violence Action Plan.
I must confess that it is crucial that Aboriginal people undertake these strategies themselves. It is not adequate to simply prescribe for them the way things should be. It must be hands-on from their point of view and the understanding must flow with it if we are going to be successful. Senator Crossin seems to have a number of simplistic solutions and wants to turn this into a political football. I am very saddened by that because I think this issue is well and truly beyond any political carping and point scoring.
In closing, the Prime Minister has undertaken directly, in a hands-on way, to approach this issue and to understand it. I am very happy to say that I am very confident that the government is on the right track in addressing what is a long-term, difficult problem. We are initiating a whole host of programs and accurately targeted, focused expenditures which, I am very pleased to say, I believe will yield a much better outcome than what has been achieved over the last 20 or 25 years.

"Crossin, Sen Trish",ALP,2003-09-18,"—I want to place on record recognition of Senator Ridgeway for bringing this before the Senate this afternoon. It is, I think, sometimes an issue that is within the conscience of most people in this country—that is, the plight of Indigenous people. But sometimes it does not get the due recognition and the spotlight that it deserves, as we can see particularly if we have a close look at what is happening with Indigenous children and Indigenous youth around this country. It is correct that the United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child decided at its 31st session to devote its 2003 day of general discussion to the rights of Indigenous children. That is, in fact, due to happen tomorrow. 
While the Convention on the Rights of the Child applies to all children equally, it is the first international human rights treaty to specifically identify Indigenous children as a group of rights holders. In 1993 the General Assembly proclaimed 1995 to 2004 as the International Decade of the World's Indigenous People. Tomorrow, as I understand it, there will be a number of matters up for discussion by the Committee on the Rights of the Child at the United Nations. One of those matters is going to concern the various forms of violence that Indigenous children may confront both in the home and in society at large.
Let us look at what is happening with Indigenous families and, in particular, Indigenous children. In 2001, the Australian Bureau of Statistics reported in the Health and welfare of Australia's Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children were more likely to be the subject of abuse, neglect or harm than any other Australian children. In 2000-01, in all jurisdictions except Tasmania, the rate for Indigenous children was substantially higher than the rate for other children. In Victoria, for instance, the rate for Indigenous children who were the subject of substantiations was nine times higher than the rate for other children. In Western Australia, it was 7.6 times higher and in South Australia 7.3 times higher. Indigenous children are severely overrepresented among children who are on care and protection orders or in out-of-home care. For example, in June 2002 the numbers showed that Indigenous children were 5.9 times more likely than other children to be on care and protection orders and 6.1 times more likely than other children to be in out-of-home care. In Victoria, Indigenous children were more than 10 times more likely to be on care and protection orders.
The rate of death from family violence in Indigenous communities was 10.8 times higher than that for the non-Indigenous population. Aboriginal women in remote communities were 45 times more likely to be the victims of abuse than other women. No doubt this impacts severely on the images in the minds of young Indigenous children, particularly when their mothers are involved. We know that family violence accounts for a staggering 63 per cent of all Indigenous homicides in Australia, compared to 33 per cent of non-Indigenous homicides over the same decade.
Our Prime Minister has recently discovered the plight of Indigenous people in this country and has decided to do something about the situation regarding domestic violence in Indigenous communities. He has only recently allocated $20 million to that. And this year an extra 1,000 CDEP places were to be used specifically to address Indigenous violence. Apart from that, in the seven years that this government has been in power, only $6 million has been committed, through the Partnerships Against Domestic Violence initiative, to addressing family violence in Indigenous communities. We know that not all of those funds have been spent. As far as we can ascertain, the Howard government since 1996 has spent only $6 million on addressing violence in Indigenous communities. This works out to a total of $14.63 per Indigenous person that has been spent since this government has been in office. On an annual basis, that works out at just $2.44 per Indigenous person. 
Do not let me stand here and put up with Senator Johnston telling us how wonderful this government has been about addressing the plight of Indigenous families and, in particular, Indigenous children in this country. Let us talk, for example, about the Primary Health Care Access Program that Senator Johnston was boasting about just a few minutes ago. We know that this program has been on the books for the last four years, but we also know that not one Indigenous person in this country has got even a panadol out of it. They have not even had access to panadol—let alone has this government shown any sign of leadership and strength in moving this agenda along. This government is more interested in ensuring that its money goes into having lots of white people sitting around and deciding what is going to happen with Indigenous health in this country.
—They might be the best qualified, Senator Crossin!
—For four years, Senator Ferris, you have sat around the table with state and territory governments trying to decide who is going to share the power in this and exactly what is going to happen with this money. Indigenous communities are saying, `Set up health boards, give us the money and let's just get going with this.' To this day, not one Indigenous person has got a panadol out of the billions of dollars that you have put into the Primary Health Care Access Program. In fact, that money was supposed to see an increase in funds per capita, per region. It works fine in Central Australia, where you have fewer than 2,000 people per region. This government has decided that the extra funding for health is going to be in that program but that it is going to limit it to only 2,000 people per region. That works well in Central Australia because there are in fact 2,000 people per region. The country has been carved up into 21 zones.
But the government says, `Whoops! Sorry. There is a bit of a problem in the Darwin region because there are 9,000 people there.' Is this government so committed to addressing Indigenous health for Indigenous people that it is going to make the bucket of money larger? No. When it comes to the Darwin region, the equivalent amount of money that is allocated to 2,000 Indigenous people in Central Australia is going to be squashed and shared amongst the 9,000 Indigenous clients. This is not about addressing the needs of Indigenous people. This is about continuing to use scant resources.
We know that Indigenous infants, for example, are twice as likely to be born underweight. We know that Indigenous children are at twice the risk of the national average of dying within 12 months of life. We are one of the most developed nations in the world. We have a high standard of living. Why is it, then, that in my electorate I continually see communities that are struggling with Third World conditions? That is because we have a government with no leadership, no outlook and no positive forward thinking when it comes to Indigenous people. This government talks about practical reconciliation. Senator Ridgeway and I have been involved in a committee that is looking at the progress towards reconciliation. This government uses the term `practical reconciliation' to mean raising the benchmark for Indigenous people to the common standard we all enjoy. Putting additional resources into assisting Indigenous people to get to the standard that you and I enjoy is not practical reconciliation; it is just ensuring those people have the standard and quality of life that you and I both enjoy. 
This government is about ensuring that bureaucrats do not look beyond the boundaries, that there are still constraints placed on the bureaucracy. For example, let us take communities that have road funding. This government allocates funds for highways and the local government allocates funds for communities, and we continually hear about the squabble over who is going to pay for the road in between. That has gone on for more than 20 years in the Territory, as far as I am concerned. Once in a while someone needs to step outside the square, accept there is a problem, decide to put the funds towards it and fix it up. There is not strong and decisive leadership coming from this government. We know that two per cent of the population is Indigenous, so why does only two per cent of the health budget go towards them? If we were going to look at making life better for Indigenous children, we would ensure that was not the case.

"Ferris, Sen Jeannie",LP,2003-09-18,"—There are two tragedies in this issue: the first is the tragedy of these children and the second is the tragedy of bone-pointing about whose fault it is. It is not the fault of this government or that government or ATSIC. The fact of the matter is there is not a person in this country who does not care about the tragedy of Indigenous children and what happens to them. Today Senator Ridgeway very eloquently outlined the tragedy of these children. There is not a person in this country who does not care about what happens to these children or how it is that these happy little children turn into tragic unemployed and unemployable adults who are not able to read, write, get a job or live a life where they have a reasonable expectation of health and happiness. 
Everybody in their own way can tell a tragic story of the children in remote communities. I have driven to Darwin and have been to remote communities. I have gone out with the night patrols: the grandmothers and the Indigenous police workers who have been intervening—quite successfully, I might say—in family violence. I will never forget the sight on Mindil Beach in Darwin at midnight one night, when I went out with an Indigenous night patrol and we found beside a fire a tiny Aboriginal baby deserted by its parents, lying in the sand centimetres from a burning fire, alone, lying in the wind and wrapped in some rags. We took that child to a centre where Indigenous health workers cared for it.
I have sat with grandmothers in Indigenous communities. I have heard the stories of these elderly women who, at their age, can quite rightly expect to know that their grandchildren are going to be well looked after. They have seven, eight or nine grandchildren in their care because the parents are not able for one reason or another—sadly, usually substance abuse related—to care for those children. But for God's sake, let us not point the bone at this state government or that state government for being at fault.
I remember when ATSIC had to be dragged, kicking and screaming disgracefully, to put some money into substance abuse and family violence programs—and that was not very long ago. It was during the period when Senator John Herron was the minister for Aboriginal affairs—not very long ago. ATSIC put a paltry amount of money into a family violence program. It was such a small amount of money.
The drug rehabilitation house that I work with in a voluntary capacity in Adelaide has programs for Indigenous substance abusers. We all know the issue. We all know the problem. But there is a wider issue here—not just the issue of funding. There is a greater question to be asked. As President of the Bennelong Society, three weeks ago in Canberra we had a conference which considered the question in relation to Indigenous communities: has the time come for us to in some way set programs in place to decide whether perhaps there are times when children need to leave those communities to get the health, the welfare and the education services that are available in the cities and the regional centres? 
Just three weeks ago, one of the speakers—the Hon. Dr Gary Johns, a former Labor minister in this place—posed the question: are there issues related to those small, remote Indigenous communities that cannot be answered by simply providing more services, by trying to provide health, education and welfare services to 15 or 20 children who are very remote from areas where better services could be provided? Former Aboriginal affairs minister Peter Howson has written extensively on this issue. Former Indigenous community worker Chris Marshall talked about the problems of remote communities where he had been a worker. Gary Johns has touched on this issue in articles that he has recently published and in a speech which he gave internationally.
We unanimously raised the question: when do remote Indigenous communities become unviable for the children? Is there a point at which those 15, 20 or 25 children need to leave those communities? When do the basic services fall to such a level that those small communities can no longer function? For how much longer can we justify Aboriginal children growing up in those communities where the opportunities are so limited? Peter Howson eloquently said in his speech to the Bennelong conference that Aboriginal children have to be given choice. Education is the key to this choice. How do we deliver education to a remote community with little or no services? Former policies have removed this choice. It has been so difficult for some of those children to get access to education. The Australian government has put millions of dollars into these programs but, as Senator Ridgeway said today, money is not the only issue. 
I have been to Cape York and have seen the programs up there. One of the things that I will never forget is funding that was given to young children in a remote community for football jumpers and an Indigenous footballer who went up there, took the time to put together a footy team and bought a football so those children could enjoy a sense of purpose and a sense of fun. That did not require much money; it required the commitment of those people and it required access to that community by someone who was prepared to spend the time.
Previous speakers here today have outlined the amount of money that this government has spent, that the previous government spent and that ATSIC is spending. It is not just about the money. It is about the priorities. It is about helping the grandparents. It is about helping those children learn. It is about their health, welfare and access to the services that the rest of us have. I am sure there is not a person here who does not care about Indigenous children and is not as heartbroken as I am when I go to a remote community and see children sitting just outside of the camp sniffing petrol with rags wrapped around their wrists. You have an overwhelming sense of powerlessness about how to deal with that. This government is tackling that. We are trying; we are working with the communities. There is no point in playing politics on this. It is an issue for all Australians.",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Indigenous Affairs: Children</title>,Matters of Urgency,22,1,speech
"Moore, Sen Claire",ALP,2003-09-18,"—Thank you, Senator Ridgeway, for giving us the opportunity to focus our minds on this really important issue. Too often these issues are lost in the overall debate and caught in large and very voluminous reports. Most people in this place have been blessed by receiving reports which have key chapters on what the government is doing on Indigenous issues. Recently, I was part of the Senate Community Affairs References Committee inquiry into poverty and financial hardship. That committee travelled across Australia, talking with people from all backgrounds and from all parts of our community in Australia about the issue of poverty. We received, naturally, a detailed response from ATSIC, the body formed by a previous government to look at the political and social sides of Aboriginal governance in this country. They introduced their submission to us with the following statement: 
Tackling Indigenous poverty is a fundamental issue facing all Australians, Indigenous and non-Indigenous, if the nation is to meet its obligations to ensure fair and equitable social, economic and cultural living standards for its citizens. No matter what facet of Indigenous disadvantage is considered, whether it is health, housing, educational attainment, alcohol and substance abuse, social dysfunction, over-representation in the criminal justice system, or unemployment, poverty lies at the heart of the issue.
We have heard in this debate about, and we have seen in reports, the statistical evidence. Those statistics are very important, and we have heard many quoted today. During the hearings of the poverty committee we were told to handle those stats with great caution because there are always questions about how stats can be used, how relevant they are and what they actually mean. Senator Ferris was able to point out in this debate what the statistics actually mean. In the way that Senator Ridgeway has phrased his motion, the focus here is on Indigenous children. The statistics we are talking about today are kids—kids who are facing a lifetime over which they must be in control and over which we must be not directional but supportive.
The core aspects of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child—and there are many articles and many pages in that convention—are respect and life. Those are the arguments. Those are the issues for children. When you actually meet with Aboriginal children and Aboriginal families, what they are asking for is respect and life. How we actually work with the communities to attain that is the challenge. It is a challenge for all elements of government—local, state and federal—and we must be accountable for what we are doing to support that activity.
As we have said, and as ATSIC said in its submission to the Senate committee, the core issues are access and choice. Over the past three years, particularly in the past 12 months, there have been numerous public statements about the issue of violence in Aboriginal communities. I want to read a quote. It is quite lengthy, but I use it often because it sums up to me quite visually the kinds of confrontations we have when we are talking about Aboriginal communities. This quote was used by Professor Mick Dodson in his paper Violence, Dysfunction, Aboriginality. It is a quote from Peter Sutton, who describes a scene of devastation at a remote locality in our country:
The cemetery there reminds me of the Australian war graves cemetery at Villers-Bretonneaux in France, white crosses, many of them fresh, stretch away seemingly for hundreds of metres. In my time with this community eight people known to me have died at their own hands, two of them women, six of them men. Five of these were young men. From the same community in the same period thirteen people known to me have been victims of homicide, eight of them women, seven of them men, and twelve others have committed homicide, nine of them men and three of them women. Most of these again were young people, and most of the homicides occurred in the home settlement of both assailant and victim. As far as I knew there was only one homicide and one suicide in this community between 1960 and 1985. 
That sums up a community that does not have respect and does not have life. In fact, it sums up a community that does not have hope.
We have heard in debate today about volumes of money that have been poured into communities under various plans. Certainly, the government is accountable for looking at funded programs to various communities, but unless you compare those funding programs with that visual image of a community without hope and without life we are not moving forward. The object of our debate must be the future—moving forward. When we are making our response as a government to the UN about what we have achieved under the Convention on the Rights of the Child, we must be able to link our lists of statistics, our lists of programs and our competitive political standards to the vision of a child who is looking at the community that I described. Until we can do that, until we can take the name of the report through the eyes of a child, we are not getting our message across.
In the evidence we received in the Senate committee inquiry into poverty we heard about issues of health in the various communities. The higher ratios of health risk at all levels in the communities and the various programs that have been put in place to change that have been well documented, but the end result, the statistic that remains clear in the health debate, is that things have not got better; the data have not improved. Those faces that Senator Ferris described are still looking at us and they are still facing a future where their health options are not as well resourced as those of other people. That does not meet our obligations to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.
We heard from Senator Crossin about the issue of education, which is another core element of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. The data is not improving. There are key programs designed to encourage Aboriginal and Islander children into classrooms, to stay at school, to develop their opportunities and to take up tertiary education. The figures are not getting better, but the faces are still looking at us. They say to us that we cannot respond to the UN positively when they are not receiving the benefits of the programs that have been put in place.
No child can have options for the future if they are not secure and safe in their environment. The image that I described earlier of a community where there are homicides and domestic violence does not build strong, secure families. It does not give hope to the children who live there. That is their home. Talking about removing children takes us back to a previous century, and I am surprised that I heard that in today's discussion. Nonetheless, we need to be sure that we give practical options to people so that those faces that Senator Ferris referred to can look at us and see that we are sharing, that we are responding and that we understand.
When the government reports formally to the UN, we know what will be in it. Senator Ridgeway has read many of these. There are pages of program documentation and graphs that show what has happened. I think there should be pages of stories and photographs that show the people about whom we are talking, because until we can convince the communities that these programs are successful it does not matter whether or not we can provide data to the UN. Sometimes I think we feel that we have accepted our obligations and done the job if we can give a response with data and statistics. That is not doing the job. Until we can work with the communities, be accepted by them and show the respect that I spoke about earlier in this brief speech, we have not done the job and we should not be claiming that we have done the job. This debate is not a competition. It does not matter who wins the `competition' of providing program funding or who has given more. This debate will be considered to have been successful only when the people about whom we are talking say, `Yes, I think the job has been done and I am part of the success.' I want to quote Nelson Mandela, because I always like to. He said: 
There can be no keener revelation of a society's soul than the way it treats its children.
That sums up how we must respond to the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. Can we honestly say we have met that challenge?",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF URGENCY</title>,<title>Indigenous Affairs: Children</title>,Matters of Urgency,22,1,speech
"Payne, Sen Marise",LP,2003-09-18,"—There are only a few short moments left to me to make a contribution in this matter of urgency on the rights of Indigenous children this afternoon, and I welcome the opportunity to do that. I am interested in the motion that Senator Ridgeway moved this afternoon, particularly pertaining to the vulnerability of Indigenous children to discrimination and violence in the home and in society at large that I imagine it would be more than accurate to say they confront on a daily basis.
There are a number of aspects of the federal government's contribution in this area that I wish to highlight. I also want to say that government, in and of its nature, is a very clumsy machine. Because of the role that it has to fulfil, particularly at the federal level, it is not a particularly refined tool. As a result, I think we are most effective when we work well at all three levels of government and with the communities we seek to support and to help. A number of the initiatives that have been taken, starting with the resolution in the COAG process more than two years ago now, show how effective we can be when we coordinate in that manner. I agree with Senator Moore that we need to see results on the board, and hopefully those results will be visible in a very short period of time.
As part of the Senate's inquiry into reconciliation—I think also a motion of Senator Ridgeway's—the Legal and Constitutional References Committee has taken considerable evidence but not yet reported. On many occasions I have found it to be of great practical interest to hear from people who work in Indigenous communities with children, and their evidence about what actually works, and on initiatives that you can identify with and translate more broadly, is very relevant to this motion before us this afternoon. For example, sisters gave evidence to the inquiry—it is on the Hansard—about the system they run at a primary school in the far north of Western Australia near Kununurra. It is an initiative and stimulus based system that actually works to assist the children to want to come to school. So truancy has already been dealt with, to some degree at least, and to a greater degree than it would have been otherwise, by very practical initiatives taken in that small school. I have not yet completed forming my views as a result of that inquiry, but it makes me think that you can take small and effective examples and, hopefully, see them writ large across towns and communities in this country so we can address the horrific issues that Senator Ridgeway's motion raises.
On the issue of Indigenous family violence and child abuse, it is very important to put on the record the leadership of recent times, most particularly the Prime Minister's convening in July this year of a meeting of Indigenous leaders to discuss the issue of violence and abuse in Indigenous communities and, most particularly, to address the tragic consequences of the abuse of women and children. That meeting also looked at issues of alcohol and drug abuse. It is a small but very important step to have people around the table who can tell government—the clumsy tool of government—what works at the grassroots community level and what does not. Where programs do not work, we should not pursue them for the sake of pursuing them. We should acknowledge that we have confronted a barrier or a problem, work out whether it can be refined and move on. If it cannot, we should take another decision. The trials that are happening in 10 local communities on a number of levels through ATSIC's and COAG's leadership are also very important initiatives in this area and give us that local feedback that otherwise we do not get. It is a shame that the states and territories chose to leave the most recent COAG meeting before this issue could be discussed.

"Coonan, Sen Helen",LP,2003-09-18,"—I present the government's response to the report of the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee entitled Airspace 2000 and related issues, and I seek leave to incorporate the document in Hansard.
Leave granted.
The document read as follows—
Recommendation 1
The Committee recommends that Airservices Australia ensure that there is an extensive and rigorous consultation process with all sectors of the aviation industry on the provisions of the Lower Level Airspace Plan.
The Government accepts the thrust of this recommendation and agrees that a proper communication process must be conducted with all interested parties before airspace reform is implemented.
The Government would like to draw attention to some significant developments in relation to airspace reform since the Committee tabled its report.
The Special Aviation Reform Group (ARG) was established by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services, the Hon John Anderson MP, in February 2002 to consider the most appropriate model for airspace reform in Australia. The current members of the ARG are the Secretary of the Department of Transport and Regional Services, Mr Ken Matthews (ARG Chairman), Chairman of CASA, Mr Ted Anson, Mr Dick Smith, the Chairman of Airservices Australia, Mr John Forsyth and the Chief of the Royal Australian Air Force, Air Marshal Angus Houston. Mr Anson and Mr Forsyth are serving in their individual capacities.
The ARG was asked to examine two proposals for reforming Australia's low level airspace viz. the Airspace Working Group's Low Level Airspace Reform Plan (LAMP), and the National Airspace System (NAS) Australia.
In coming to its recommendations, the ARG considered matters such as:
	cost effectiveness; 
	degree of industry support and comments of the industry stakeholders on the merits of LAMP and NAS;
	ability to implement within a reasonable timeframe;
	degree of harmonisation with ICAO airspace classifications; and 
	degree of harmonisation with international best practice. 
On 13 May 2002, the Government agreed to adopt the National Airspace System (NAS) Australia as the model for reform of Australian airspace.
An Implementation Group (IG) has been established to implement the NAS model. The IG is undertaking an extensive communication and education programme with all affected parties.
Implementation of the first stage of the NAS model was completed on 20 March 2003. It is expected that the NAS will be fully implemented by end- 2004.
Recommendation 2
The Committee recommends that Airservices Australia establish clear guidelines how CAGRO services interrelate and operate in conjunction with surrounding air traffic service sectors. 
The Government does not accept this recommendation.
The establishment of guidelines is not required as CAGRO services do not interrelate, or operate in conjunction with, surrounding air traffic service sectors.
Recommendation 3
The Committee recommends that Airservices Australia seek formal legal advice on whether CAGRO services constitute an ATC service within the provisions of the Civil Aviation Act 1988.
The Government does not accept this recommendation.
CASA has obtained external legal advice, which supports the view that these services could not be held to be an ATC service. 
Recommendation 4
The Committee recommends that the Minister for Transport and Regional Services appoint an independent consultant to assess any impact that the application of competition policy may have had on the delivery of aviation services to rural and regional communities. In particular, the Committee recommends that the independent consultant assess how the net community benefit test has been applied by Airservices Australia.
The Government does not accept this recommendation.
There are currently no Airservices' functions that have been opened up to competition by the Government. Airservices remains a legislated monopoly for its core function- the provision of ATS. However for a number of Airservices' other functions, there is no legislated monopoly, for example in areas such as ATC training and maintenance services. 
It would be incorrect to assume that matters such as Location Specific Pricing (LSP), the provision of CAGRO services or the introduction of additional providers for ATC training are results of the implementation of National Competition Policy (NCP). 
The point needs to be made that NCP does not require that Airservices contract or compulsorily tender out its services. 
Australia's NCP was agreed on between the States/Territories and Commonwealth Governments with the aim of promoting and maintaining competitive forces that increase economic efficiency and community welfare, while recognising other social goals. NCP is not solely concerned with the introduction of competition. Rather, the various Australian Governments adopted a set of principles to facilitate and encourage national competition. 
The Government would also take the opportunity to correct the incorrect suggestion that the new safety regulatory framework for the provision of ATC and ARFF services has been established to facilitate the application of competition policy. The Government became aware of the absence of a legislated safety regulatory framework to govern the provision of services provided by Airservices and asked CASA to develop regulations to address this gap. It should also be noted that the development of this framework is consistent with our international obligations pursuant to the Convention on International Civil Aviation 1944.
Having made the point that the matters considered by the Committee, which resulted in this recommendation, are not a result of NCP, the Government wants to dispel any remaining confusion by commenting on the following matters considered by the Committee in Chapter Three of its report titled `Competition Policy'. 
Air Traffic Control (ATC) Services
The Committee's position was that privatisation of ATC services would represent the transfer from one monopoly provider to another monopoly provider of the income stream. The Government must point out that contestability has not been introduced for the provision of ATC services, and therefore there has been no impact at any Australian airport served by Airservices.
Certified Air Ground Radio Operator (CAGRO) Services
The Government notes the position of the Community and Public Sector Union (CPSU) that CAGRO services constitute an Air Traffic Control (ATC) service. However, legal advice obtained by this portfolio is that a CAGRO service is not an ATC service. 
The Government's position is that the introduction of CAGRO services at Yulara and Broome enhance safety. The Government has been advised that as the CAGRO service is provided during periods when the nature of traffic is such as not to require an ATC tower service, safety is enhanced by the provision of a CAGRO service. 
The introduction of CAGRO services is completely unrelated to NCP. Airservices' core product at airports is the provision of a tower control service. Airservices has never provided CAGRO services and currently has no plans to provide them. The airports themselves arranged for independent, suitably qualified persons to provide these services.
In short, the introduction of CAGRO services does not in any way represent a scaling-back of service provision by Airservices. Rather, it is an enhancement to air safety during hours or at places where an ATC service is not provided at regional and GA airports.
Air Traffic Control Training
The Committee quoted the Minister's statement that the UK-based SERCO may provide an international ATC training centre in Australia. To date, SERCO has not progressed this proposal and it is not clear that SERCO will be doing so in the foreseeable future.
The Government agrees that Airservices' Melbourne-based training college is a world leader in its field. The Committee should note that following the notice of disallowance issued against the new safety regulatory framework by the Opposition last year, regulatory amendments were made to address the Opposition's concerns. In relation to providers of air traffic control training services, an independent provider of these services can only be approved by CASA if it is to provide the service in cooperation with, or by arrangement with Airservices. 
Contestability of Maintenance Services
In 1999 Airservices Australia decided to market test a number of internally provided support services. This decision was not made because of NCP.
Market testing provides a means of assessing the relative merits of the current way of doing things versus the alternatives. It does not automatically mean that the service being market tested will automatically be outsourced. The aim was to compare the relative merits of in-house bids with external bids in order to achieve the best result for Airservices.
The most significant proposals concerned the National Airways System support services. Following Airservices invitation to potential providers to register interest in responding to a request for proposal, the Community and Public Sector Union (CPSU) mounted a strong campaign through the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC) and with staff to stop the process. 
After many months of consultation and management deliberations and in light of the events of September 11 and the Ansett collapse, management decided to proceed with an alternative market testing package. This includes an external review of internal value for money, international benchmarking and a review of internal information transfer on the costs of services. Ultimately, however, decisions will be made based on safety, value and the technical merit of the alternatives.
The Committee reported CPSU advice about the lack of any CASA regime for regulating contestability of Airservices Australia's maintenance services. The Government has interpreted this advice as referring to the lack of a safety framework governing the provision of aeronautical telecommunications and radionavigation services. In response, the Government advises that on 26 June 2002, the Governor-General in Council made a new regulation viz. Part 171 of the Civil Aviation Safety Regulations 1998—Aeronautical telecommunication service and radionavigation service providers. Part 171 commenced on 1 May 2003 and will address the gap identified by the CPSU. 
The Committee should note that following the notice of disallowance issued against the new safety regulatory framework by the Opposition last year, regulatory amendments were made to address the Opposition's concerns. In relation to aeronautical telecommunication service and radionavigation service providers, an independent provider can only be approved by CASA if it is to provide the service in cooperation with or by arrangement with Airservices Australia.
Competition Policy and the provision of services to GA and Regional airports
The Government fully agrees with the Committee's observation there are `essential community benefits from ensuring that proper ATC services are maintained at GA and regional airports.' However, the Government disagrees with the Committee's position that cross-subsidisation is the most cost-effective way of doing this. 
The Government's approach to retaining these benefits is to firstly cap prices at these airports, and secondly to directly subsidise Airservices for losses arising from the capped charges. On 22 May 2001, the Government announced that it would continue to subsidise the provision of Terminal Navigation (Tower) services at 14 regional and GA airports. This subsidy, which was introduced in 1998, was scheduled to expire in June 2001. The Government decided to extend the subsidy for a further two years in recognition of the additional cost burden faced by operators at these 14 airports and the potential effect on regional communities of the Location Specific Pricing policy. The Government announced that that the subsidy has been extended until June 2004 as part of the 2003/04 budget package. 
The detail of this mechanism is explained in the Government's response to Recommendations 5 and 6. 
Competition Policy and air safety
The Government's position is that CASA is responsible for ensuring that aircraft operations are conducted in a safe manner. CASA cannot compromise safety standards, even if complying with them imposes costs that a particular operator may deem high. The Government has every confidence in the performance of CASA in carrying out its responsibilities.
The Government takes the opportunity to address the specific suggestion raised in this chapter that safety was compromised in relation to the granting of a category remission for BAE 146-200 aircraft.
The ARFF category for each airport is determined by CASA, which has adopted the relevant ICAO standards. The determination of ARFF category for a particular airport is based on aircraft length and width. However, movements also have a bearing on the category rating.
The standard starts at the highest category of aircraft determined by length and width. Before the category is set the first 700 movements for the busiest consecutive three months of the year are assessed to identify the number of the highest category aircraft movements at the airport. Should movements of a lower category aircraft be identified in this exercise the ARFF category can be lowered by a maximum of one category from the highest category aircraft movement.
In the case of the BAE 146-200 aircraft (which is a category 6 aircraft since it is around 60 centimetres above the upper limit of category 5 aircraft) CASA gave a dispensation to treat these aircraft movements as category 5 at Mackay and Rockhampton. 
On 26 June 2002, the Governor-General in Council made a new regulation viz. Sub Part 139H (Aerodrome Rescue and Fire Fighting Services) of the Civil Aviation Safety Regulations 1998, which commenced on 1 May 2003. There is now no provision for the one category remission approach. That is, the ARFF category will be set with regard to the highest category aircraft using the airport.
In conclusion, competition policy has not had any impact on the delivery of aviation services by Airservices to rural and regional communities. The only regulated service that is currently open to competition is the provision of ARFF services at Commonwealth leased airports. Pursuant to amendments sought by the Opposition to Sub Part 139H of the Civil Aviation Safety Regulations 1998, ARFF providers who may be approved by CASA are limited to current providers, persons acting on behalf of or under an arrangement with Airservices Australia, or persons providing ARFFS under an arrangement approved by the Minister under s. 216 of the Airports Act 1996. 
As discussed previously, the new regulation, Sub Part 139H of the Civil Aviation Safety Regulations 1998 commenced on 1 May 2003. 
Recommendations 5 and 6
The Committee recommends that the Government consider funding ARFF and TN services at GA and regional airports through some degree of cross-subsidisation where a demonstrable community benefit can be shown.
The Government does not accept these recommendations.
The Government is particularly sensitive to access and equity issues in regional Australia, and is determined to find ways to alleviate any disadvantages which may exist. The Government was fully aware that Terminal Navigation (TN) and Aerodrome Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) services at several regional and General Aviation (GA) airports would not be affordable to the vast majority of users, if fully commercial rates were charged. 
To address this position, the Government introduced capped TN charges, in recognition of the burden that Location Specific Pricing (LSP) would impose at these regional and LSP airports. Currently, this is charged at $7.42 per tonne Maximum Takeoff Weight (MTOW).
This rate is not commercially sustainable for Airservices, which provides TN services at these locations. The Government has therefore been compensating Airservices directly through a subsidy. The subsidy is funded by a fuel levy of 0.26 cents per litre of aviation turbine and aviation gasoline fuels. 
The Government's position is that a direct subsidy is more transparent and is more likely to deliver efficiencies over the long-term than cross-subsidising the provision of these services at regional and GA airports.
The Government does not subsidise the provision of ARFF services at any location. However, ARFF charges are only payable by aircraft with a Maximum Takeoff Weight (MTOW) greater than 2.5 tonnes. ARFF services are provided at only four of the fourteen `LSP subsidy' airports. Since the vast majority of GA users at these four airports operate aircraft with an MTOW less than 2.5 tonnes, they do not have to pay ARFF charges.
The Government's position is therefore that the impact of LSP for the provision of ARFF services at regional and GA airports is relatively marginal.
Recommendation 7
The Committee recommends that Airservices Australia conduct a detailed costing of services at GA and regional airports, again with the view to possible cross subsidisation of costs where a demonstrable community benefit can be shown.
The Government does not accept this recommendation.
The Government advises that Airservices already conducts a detailed costing of services to General Aviation (GA) and regional airports, in order to determine the Location Specific Pricing (LSP).
Airservices introduced LSP for its Aviation Rescue and Fire Fighting (ARFF) service in 1997 and for its Terminal Navigation (TN) service in 1998. Since the introduction of LSP, Airservices has been calculating prices for TN and ARFF services with regard to the costs incurred in providing those services and the level of aircraft activity at each location. The pricing process therefore, naturally focuses on detailed costings on a location by location basis.
These costings are commercially sensitive and any disclosure of Airservices' detailed costings may undermine its position in any future competitive market.
On 22 May 2001, the Government announced it would continue to subsidise the provision of control tower services at 14 Regional and General Aviation airports until 2002-2003. The Government has paid a subsidy for this purpose since the introduction of LSP (1998/99) , and has ensured that charges have been capped at these airports. The subsidy has been further extended until 
June 2004 as part of the 2003/04 budget.
Airservices provides these services at a price (including Government subsidy) that is less than full cost recovery.
Response to Dissent by Sen. Winston Crane and Sen. Jeannie Ferris
The Government fully agrees with the thrust of the dissenting note written by Senators Crane and Ferris, except for their support of Recommendation 4.
The Government's response to this recommendation is contained in the main response to the recommendations of the Committee.

Since the introduction of LSP, Airservices has been calculating prices for TN and ARFF services with regard to the costs incurred in providing those services and the level of aircraft activity at each location. The pricing process therefore, naturally focuses on detailed costings on a location by location basis.
These costings are commercially sensitive and any disclosure of Airservices' detailed costings may undermine its position in any future competitive market.
On 22 May 2001, the Government announced it would continue to subsidise the provision of control tower services at 14 Regional and General Aviation airports until 2002-2003. The Government has paid a subsidy for this purpose since the introduction of LSP (1998/99) , and has ensured that charges have been capped at these airports. The subsidy has been further extended until 
June 2004 as part of the 2003/04 budget.
Airservices provides these services at a price (including Government subsidy) that is less than full cost recovery.
Response to Dissent by Sen. Winston Crane and Sen. Jeannie Ferris
The Government fully agrees with the thrust of the dissenting note written by Senators Crane and Ferris, except for their support of Recommendation 4.
The Government's response to this recommendation is contained in the main response to the recommendations of the Committee.

"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,2003-09-18,"—I note that this report by the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation on the draft Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Amendment Regulations and the draft Retirement Savings Accounts Amendment Regulations has already been before the chamber for debate. I just want to make a few comments. I notice my colleague Senator Ray is here. It is worthy to note that the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation has been wound up, having been in existence for a long period of time, in some instances to the dismay of a number of people and in other instances to the joy of a number of people.
—Hear, hear!
—I take Senator Ray's interjection to my last statement. Having said that, I thought it was important to note that this was the final report of the committee. In my view, the committee over a period of time has been fairly effective. I say that with a little bit of bias, as I was a member of the committee from late 1999 to early 2002. The amount of work that was considered by the committee over that period was substantial indeed. The committee chair, Senator Watson, invariably tackled the issues head on and was very fair in the way he approached many of the issues—sometimes, I believe, at odds with the policy and wishes of the government on issues that were before the committee. And, of course, from our side, Senator Nick Sherry ably assisted the committee in its deliberations. My experience on the committee showed me that those two were, by far and away, the most knowledgeable people in this chamber on the issue of superannuation.
I just want to make a couple of brief comments about the report. The issue of superannuation has been before the chamber this week through the legislation the government put forward on the surcharge reduction and the co-contribution. Whilst I am not going to comment on either of those pieces of legislation, I just want to note that at one stage during the debate one excited government member got up and started to blame the industry funds of being union funds. That was a leftover from the early 1980s. That was the sort of rhetoric around at that time. The industry cold war—and cold war is quite right, Senator Marshall—was unfortunate indeed. 
I have had particular involvement with a very large industry fund indeed, REST, which looks after people in the retail and fast food areas. It was certainly not a union fund. The genesis of the fund came more from the retailers' side of the industry—that is, from the employers' side—rather than from the union side. But the union and the retailers were able to meet together and bring about one of the most vibrant and best industry funds in Australia. It could under no circumstances be described as a union fund. I think that is the experience with all of the superannuation funds. They are certainly not union funds: they are not dominated by the unions. It is unfortunate that that sort of narrow rhetoric still prevails today.
A couple of other misconceptions still hang around as well: some people consider that the money that is paid under the SG is in effect the employer's money. Whilst it may well be the employer who pays the money, in conformity with federal legislation, once having been paid it is the employee's money—it is no longer the employer's money. It is certainly not money which belongs to any superannuation company and it is certainly not money that belongs to any financial adviser or the like; hence the value of industry funds over those which are run by private insurance companies and the banks through RSAs. The industry funds of course have very much at heart the welfare and wellbeing of the employees of the industry whose money needs to be invested wisely such that those people can have some chance of security and dignity in retirement. 
I turn to the draft report on the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Amendment Regulations 2003, and the draft report on the Retirement Savings Accounts Amendment Regulations 2003. There was an agreed report, with the exception of some additional comments by Labor senators. I think the comments in the report are worthy of note to this chamber because they go to the issues of portability and choice. At 13.5 of the committee's report, it states:
Labor has stated clearly that it will support a safe choice regime that contains strong protections and safeguards to protect consumers.
That is very important, given that I said in my lead-in that superannuation is about people's security in retirement. It is about giving them dignity in retirement. Even with the current SG of nine per cent and the initiatives that the government are proposing with respect to co-contributions, none of those will go far enough to give people a total independence of the age pension or some form of social security, even if they have made a full contribution over a working life of 30 to 40 years. So the statement made by Labor senators in the committee's report is important indeed. It goes on:
Consequently, it expects the same protections and safeguards to be in place before it will accept a portability regime that leaves the consumer open to exploitation by the more aggressive elements of the financial services industry.
That is very important. In England, the experience was that, where an open regime came about, the superannuation resources of a number of people were plundered—and I think that is the only word that can be reasonably used—and there were no proper constraints and proper protection in place to overcome the possible exploitation by these aggressive elements in the financial services industry. As I said, the money is clearly the employee's money. It is not a superannuation company's money. It is not a financial adviser's money. It is no-one else's money other than the employee's. Those people who sit on the board of funds such as REST are trustees of that money and they have the onerous obligation of investing that money wisely to provide the retirement that people can expect after a long and hard working life. 
The report went on to list a number of other matters that needed consideration if one were to introduce the issue of portability: consolidation of multiple accounts and costs of funds, education and disclosure, fees, charges and commissions and death and disability insurance. These matters were outlined in greater detail further on in the report, and I would commend the additional comments in the report made by Labor senators to the Senate.

"Watson, Sen John",LP,2003-09-18,"—This is the final report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. I thank all my colleagues who, over the years, have been part of that very important committee, particularly the long-serving deputy chair of the committee, Senator Sherry, who in 1991 or 1992 was the first chair of the committee. I also take this opportunity of thanking Senator Hogg for his remarks. The final report of the committee, which is being debated tonight, is about portability. The concept was to change the regulation to extend access to portability of superannuation in Australia. For those listening to the broadcast, perhaps it is important to get the terminology right. Portability is quite distinct from choice. Choice refers to the ability of employees to choose the fund into which their employer directs future superannuation contributions, whereas portability of superannuation refers to the ability of members of superannuation funds to roll over or transfer existing superannuation benefits from one regulated super fund, approved deposit fund or retirement savings account to another.  
Having established that, we are confronted in Australia with over nine million people in the work force who have well over 20 million accounts. The committee unanimously agreed to the principle of portability—that is, for individuals to be able to consolidate their superannuation accounts. It does make sense because having multiple accounts does attract fees and charges. The committee were of the view that it is best dealt with in two stages and that, in fact, portability can stand alone. We believed it was important to give individuals the ability to consolidate inactive superannuation accounts into either an inactive account or their active account. The committee believed that, providing this was accompanied by a targeted education campaign—after all, the government has set aside money for education in terms of choice, and this is almost ancillary to choice—we would achieve a reduction in the number of superannuation accounts in Australia, and that was a desirable method.
We ran into some difficulty with the proposal to extend the concept of portability to an active account, because we believed that was very close to choice, if not choice, and, as such, it would be better dealt with by legislation than by regulations. We implore the Senate to follow the pathway that the Senate committee has shown, by providing either amended or new regulations, because consolidating their accounts will benefit millions of people in Australia.
Why did we go down the pathway that we did? We felt that where a person's death benefit is significantly greater than the member's account balance some concerns were raised, and this was a matter that we believed had to be dealt with by legislation. The committee were also concerned that portability out of an active account at the moment could actually lead to an increase in superannuation account numbers in Australia, due to the need to maintain multiple accounts. But I think the government is starting to develop a framework now, whereby it is almost time for the Senate, if we get it right, to proceed—not only with portability, which I think can stand on its own, and I would like to see some regulations for that. We have given the pathway; we have a unanimous report from the Democrats, Labor and the coalition government as to how it can be done. Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President Lightfoot, for your role on the committee. I have appreciated the support that you have given over the year.
There is the possibility, in terms of the revised regulations which were tabled during the committee's sittings, that the number of superannuation accounts in Australia may increase as a result of that measure. I am of the view, however, that overall, if we go down this path of portability, we will get a great reduction. There has been a lot of focus and attention, and we have moved a long way in the past five years or so since these issues became important.
I think this is a great report. There are issues there and guidelines as to how it can be achieved. With the goodwill from the Democrats and the Labor Party—because, in principle, we all agree with the concept of portability—we have provided a pathway of how it can be achieved. I look forward to some regulations coming in, in the not too distant future, to enable a lot of that consolidation of the 25 or 26 million accounts, I think it is—isn't it, Senator Sherry? 
—Twenty-five.
—There is something of that order to be reduced. That will make a big difference in reducing fees and charges and thereby have the potential, over a period of 30 or 40 years, to substantially increase the amount of savings available for the people.
It has been an interesting time. I think we have had some great achievements over the years. If I can digress a little, I think of the role we have had in the solicitors mortgage funds in Australia, where we have made life a lot happier for a lot of mortgagees. We have set a framework in introducing ASIC to look at all the solicitors mortgage funds right across the country. I think that was a great achievement. The investigations we have had into some of the Queensland problems have resulted in two regulators taking action, and there are a number of people now facing court over their activities. The whole thing is starting to come together pretty nicely.
We have had a lot of problems in trying to push along APRA over the years. We are hoping, under the new leader at APRA, that matters will improve. I must use this opportunity to express my sorrow at the impending resignation of Mr David Knott, the head of ASIC, with whom we have had a lot of dealings. We have found him to be a fine man, one of the great regulators in Australia, and he is indeed going to be hard to replace. I am at a loss as to why he left so suddenly. I think it is unfortunate. He has made a great contribution and I think if he had been head of APRA, earlier, we would not have encountered nearly so many of the problems that happened in the last few years. I take this opportunity to wish David Knott well in his future career, and I wish the new CEO, Dr Laker, all the very best in the big job that he has before him in leading APRA in a challenging world.

"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-09-18,"—That is a sentiment I share. I wish to speak on the same report. I think the last report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation is an excellent report. Before I go to the issues dealt with by that committee, I do want to place on record, as Senator Watson and my colleague Senator Hogg have done, that this select committee has been in existence since 1990, when I first entered the parliament. In fact, I was the first chair of the committee for its first three years, and Senator Watson was the deputy chair. When I ceased to be chair and left the committee, Senator Watson became the chair. The committee's life has been approximately 12 years with, I think, a 2½-year break.
I want to put on record my thanks to Senator Watson, in particular, as chair and all the other members of the committee over the years for their very hard work. Senator Watson has a very thorough and detailed knowledge of the issues that the committee had to consider, and I thought he did an excellent job in bringing together the differing views of committee members. We did not always agree, but generally we were able to reach unanimous conclusions based on the evaluation of the evidence put before the committee. 
I want to acknowledge former senator Sue West and former senator Bruce Childs from the Labor side, who were also on the committee for its first three years. One other member of the committee was Senator Kernot, who was not of course a Labor senator at that time but subsequently joined the Labor Party. It is interesting to note that this committee made the name of Senator Kernot, I think, because it was the committee that had to determine the future of the then Labor government's proposed compulsory nine per cent superannuation guarantee legislation. Senator Kernot, I think it is fair to say, captured significant media attention with her performance on the committee.
I want to acknowledge the work of Senator Buckland and Senator Wong, who were on the committee. Prior to that, there were two other Labor senators who are still in the Senate who also served on the committee, my colleagues Senator Hogg and Senator Chris Evans. I also want to acknowledge the work of the staff of the committee over many years. Senators cannot do their jobs adequately without the support of effective staff. We were very fortunate with the secretarial and research staff that we had over those years.
I do want to refer to a very unfortunate comment about the committee that was made on Tuesday by Senator Coonan in the debate on the superannuation co-contribution surcharge tax package. During that debate I referred to the committee lapsing after some 12 years and to the barbecue that would take place to commemorate the final report of the committee. When I said this, Senator Coonan said, `Driving a stake through its heart!' I was a bit taken aback by this comment, to which I said, `The committee or Senator Watson?' Senator Coonan responded, `I don't think it will be dead until you cut off its head and stick an apple in its mouth.' I think they are a particularly unfortunate couple of comments. I think even Senator Chapman, who was chairing the Senate while it was in committee, was somewhat taken aback. Senator Chapman is also a member of the select committee, and I think he was a bit taken aback by the unnecessarily vehement comments by Senator Coonan towards the committee. I think that is an indication that the committee and its reports over the years kept the minister on her toes and contested the minister's view of the world.
—And the former minister who knew nothing about it.
—Yes. Moving to the issues in this last report, the report dealt with what were initially draft regulations on so-called portability. I say `draft regulations' because we had an unfortunate episode which again, I think, reflects Senator Coonan's view of the world. When the committee sat down in Sydney to have its first day of hearings on the draft regulations, without the committee being informed we discovered through the witnesses that the minister had gone ahead and gazetted the final regulations. So the committee is meeting to consider the draft regulations, waiting to hear evidence, having gathered submissions, and—bang!—the minister had gazetted the regulations without even waiting for the committee report. I think that was a contemptuous approach by the minister, and I have never seen such a display of contempt and arrogance towards the processes of the Senate in my 12 years in this place.
At the present time in Australia we have some 25 million superannuation accounts for nine million fund members. We have an average of 2½ to three accounts per superannuation fund member; some individuals have more than that—three, four or five accounts. What is interesting is that portability does exist. The person leaves a job or leaves a fund, and they do not transfer their money. They have portability—they can transfer money from inactive accounts into their last active account, but they do not do it. Portability exists, so it was incorrect for the minister to claim that these regulations were introducing portability. We already have portability—the problem is that Australians do not exercise portability. In most cases they do not gather together their lost superannuation accounts. We need to ask ourselves why they do not do that. 
Firstly, most Australians do not know they can actually consolidate their lost superannuation accounts. Secondly, a lot of Australians cannot find them. Thirdly, they have to fill in forms and contact the fund. There is significant red tape to go through to consolidate your superannuation accounts. This inertia means that millions of Australians do not pool together or roll over their superannuation moneys, and that is at the heart of the problem. So the so-called portability regulations the minister tabled simply do not overcome that problem. Of course, in some cases—and I have to acknowledge that it is a small minority of cases—there are exit fees which are barriers. The committee gathered evidence of what I would certainly consider excessive exit fees, well above what would be considered a reasonable administrative cost and, in some cases, of thousands of dollars. On an account with a $5,000 balance, the exit fee might have been $4,500—a massive exit fee which acts as a barrier. But that is in a minority of cases.
So the claims made by the minister were simply incorrect and inaccurate. The committee unanimously found that the portability out of active superannuation accounts could lead to an increase in superannuation members in Australia due to the need for multiple accounts, because what the minister and the government had proposed in these regulations was also so-called portability out of active accounts. If you did that you had to leave $5,000 in your initial accounts. That would have led to more accounts, not less—a not unreasonable conclusion. The committee unanimously made, I believe, quite correct observations about the need for the regulations to be withdrawn and amended. That was not going to happen—the minister told the Australian Democrats that that would not happen—so they were, consequently, disallowed in the Senate today, and I think that that is a good thing.
The Labor Party has argued for automatic consolidation of superannuation accounts where they are lost; the banning of exit fees other than to cover basic administration costs; clear, simple, comparable and enforceable disclosure of fees, charges and commissions; and the banning of commissions on compulsory superannuation guarantee nine per cent super contributions. Labor believes that these are effective safeguards in a portability choice regime. (Time expired)

I take this opportunity to wish David Knott well in his future career, and I wish the new CEO, Dr Laker, all the very best in the big job that he has before him in leading APRA in a challenging world.
 (Senator Lightfoot)—Thank you, Senator Watson, and congratulations on the tabling of your final report on superannuation.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,33,2,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-09-18,"—That is a sentiment I share. I wish to speak on the same report. I think the last report of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation is an excellent report. Before I go to the issues dealt with by that committee, I do want to place on record, as Senator Watson and my colleague Senator Hogg have done, that this select committee has been in existence since 1990, when I first entered the parliament. In fact, I was the first chair of the committee for its first three years, and Senator Watson was the deputy chair. When I ceased to be chair and left the committee, Senator Watson became the chair. The committee's life has been approximately 12 years with, I think, a 2½-year break.
I want to put on record my thanks to Senator Watson, in particular, as chair and all the other members of the committee over the years for their very hard work. Senator Watson has a very thorough and detailed knowledge of the issues that the committee had to consider, and I thought he did an excellent job in bringing together the differing views of committee members. We did not always agree, but generally we were able to reach unanimous conclusions based on the evaluation of the evidence put before the committee. 
I want to acknowledge former senator Sue West and former senator Bruce Childs from the Labor side, who were also on the committee for its first three years. One other member of the committee was Senator Kernot, who was not of course a Labor senator at that time but subsequently joined the Labor Party. It is interesting to note that this committee made the name of Senator Kernot, I think, because it was the committee that had to determine the future of the then Labor government's proposed compulsory nine per cent superannuation guarantee legislation. Senator Kernot, I think it is fair to say, captured significant media attention with her performance on the committee.
I want to acknowledge the work of Senator Buckland and Senator Wong, who were on the committee. Prior to that, there were two other Labor senators who are still in the Senate who also served on the committee, my colleagues Senator Hogg and Senator Chris Evans. I also want to acknowledge the work of the staff of the committee over many years. Senators cannot do their jobs adequately without the support of effective staff. We were very fortunate with the secretarial and research staff that we had over those years.
I do want to refer to a very unfortunate comment about the committee that was made on Tuesday by Senator Coonan in the debate on the superannuation co-contribution surcharge tax package. During that debate I referred to the committee lapsing after some 12 years and to the barbecue that would take place to commemorate the final report of the committee. When I said this, Senator Coonan said, `Driving a stake through its heart!' I was a bit taken aback by this comment, to which I said, `The committee or Senator Watson?' Senator Coonan responded, `I don't think it will be dead until you cut off its head and stick an apple in its mouth.' I think they are a particularly unfortunate couple of comments. I think even Senator Chapman, who was chairing the Senate while it was in committee, was somewhat taken aback. Senator Chapman is also a member of the select committee, and I think he was a bit taken aback by the unnecessarily vehement comments by Senator Coonan towards the committee. I think that is an indication that the committee and its reports over the years kept the minister on her toes and contested the minister's view of the world.
—And the former minister who knew nothing about it.
—Yes. Moving to the issues in this last report, the report dealt with what were initially draft regulations on so-called portability. I say `draft regulations' because we had an unfortunate episode which again, I think, reflects Senator Coonan's view of the world. When the committee sat down in Sydney to have its first day of hearings on the draft regulations, without the committee being informed we discovered through the witnesses that the minister had gone ahead and gazetted the final regulations. So the committee is meeting to consider the draft regulations, waiting to hear evidence, having gathered submissions, and—bang!—the minister had gazetted the regulations without even waiting for the committee report. I think that was a contemptuous approach by the minister, and I have never seen such a display of contempt and arrogance towards the processes of the Senate in my 12 years in this place.
At the present time in Australia we have some 25 million superannuation accounts for nine million fund members. We have an average of 2½ to three accounts per superannuation fund member; some individuals have more than that—three, four or five accounts. What is interesting is that portability does exist. The person leaves a job or leaves a fund, and they do not transfer their money. They have portability—they can transfer money from inactive accounts into their last active account, but they do not do it. Portability exists, so it was incorrect for the minister to claim that these regulations were introducing portability. We already have portability—the problem is that Australians do not exercise portability. In most cases they do not gather together their lost superannuation accounts. We need to ask ourselves why they do not do that. 
Firstly, most Australians do not know they can actually consolidate their lost superannuation accounts. Secondly, a lot of Australians cannot find them. Thirdly, they have to fill in forms and contact the fund. There is significant red tape to go through to consolidate your superannuation accounts. This inertia means that millions of Australians do not pool together or roll over their superannuation moneys, and that is at the heart of the problem. So the so-called portability regulations the minister tabled simply do not overcome that problem. Of course, in some cases—and I have to acknowledge that it is a small minority of cases—there are exit fees which are barriers. The committee gathered evidence of what I would certainly consider excessive exit fees, well above what would be considered a reasonable administrative cost and, in some cases, of thousands of dollars. On an account with a $5,000 balance, the exit fee might have been $4,500—a massive exit fee which acts as a barrier. But that is in a minority of cases.
So the claims made by the minister were simply incorrect and inaccurate. The committee unanimously found that the portability out of active superannuation accounts could lead to an increase in superannuation members in Australia due to the need for multiple accounts, because what the minister and the government had proposed in these regulations was also so-called portability out of active accounts. If you did that you had to leave $5,000 in your initial accounts. That would have led to more accounts, not less—a not unreasonable conclusion. The committee unanimously made, I believe, quite correct observations about the need for the regulations to be withdrawn and amended. That was not going to happen—the minister told the Australian Democrats that that would not happen—so they were, consequently, disallowed in the Senate today, and I think that that is a good thing.
The Labor Party has argued for automatic consolidation of superannuation accounts where they are lost; the banning of exit fees other than to cover basic administration costs; clear, simple, comparable and enforceable disclosure of fees, charges and commissions; and the banning of commissions on compulsory superannuation guarantee nine per cent super contributions. Labor believes that these are effective safeguards in a portability choice regime. (Time expired)
Question agreed to.",SENATE,<title>COMMITTEES</title>,<title>Report</title>,Committees,33,2,speech
"Sherry, Sen Nick",ALP,2003-09-18,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
Once again, this is an important report carried out by the Australian National Audit Office into the prudential regulator of superannuation funds in this country—that is, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, known by the acronym APRA. In my view, nothing could be more important than maximising the security and safety of superannuation savings—retirement income—in this country. Basically, the ANAO report identified four major problems with respect to the work of the prudential regulatory authority. It identified that performance information on funds needed to be included in the APRA annual report. It said that there should be risk assessments of all funds and approved trustees. It said that there needed to be a timely allocation of risk rating and approval of supervisory action plans and, finally, that there needed to be a consistent supervisory approach. I am pleased to say that the Prudential Regulation Authority has accepted those recommendations and will implement them. 
APRA was created approximately four or five years ago. Initially, it was an amalgam of a number of other regulatory authorities—the old Insurance and Superannuation Commission was one of them—that had responsibility for regulating superannuation. It was very clear to the Labor Party, and to me and to Senator Conroy—we have taken a particular interest in this area over the years—that initially APRA had significant structural, staffing and funding problems. There were many occasions at Senate estimates where, when questioning representatives from APRA, it was clear to us that APRA as a regulatory body was not functioning as efficiently and as effectively as it should have been. That was also clear from the complaints we were receiving.
Over that first two or three years, my colleague Senator Conroy and I raised matters with respect to what we believed was the poor regulation of superannuation and insurance in this country. There were issues of staffing: APRA lost some 40 per cent of the previous staff of the old ISC. In some cases, there were issues in relation to finding new staff who had adequate experience and knowledge—for example, in the area of actuarial assessments, which is very important in calculating liabilities of insurance companies and superannuation funds. My colleague Senator Conroy and I consistently raised hundreds of questions with APRA about these issues.
We were regularly criticised by the Treasurer, Mr Costello; the previous Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp; Senator Ian Campbell; and Mr Hockey in the other place, who would regularly recite the line: `APRA is the world's best regulator.' I do not know how many times we heard this line. We heard it ad nauseam over those two or three years while they continually rejected the issues and problems that Senator Conroy and I had identified with respect to the operation of APRA. As history has shown, there were significant problems with the regulatory body APRA. There were two particular cases: the HIH insurance collapse, and the superannuation theft and fraud case—known as Commercial Nominees—that occurred approximately two to 2½ years ago.
When we look at the reports into the collapse of HIH—I do not have them with me—it is clear that a significant level of criticism and adverse findings were laid at the feet of APRA, the prudential regulatory authority. Following on from the royal commission into the collapse of HIH Insurance, the government agreed to adopt, I think, most of the recommendations that went to the improvement in regulation of insurance in this country, including a set of recommendations that went to improving the prudential regulatory authority and its performance. Additional moneys were allocated to the budget of APRA in order for it to employ additional and more-qualified staff. The report of the Audit Office, which has just completed its examination of APRA, has identified—and I went through this earlier—a further five areas that APRA needs to make improvement in in respect of its regulatory supervision.
That is fine. I just wish that the concerns in respect of APRA—not just those expressed by Senator Conroy and I, but those expressed by other critics—about the difficulties, the struggles and the problems it was having performing its regulatory function had been heeded a little earlier. I wish that greater notice had been taken a little earlier. The problems that occurred with the HIH Insurance collapse and Commercial Nominees may have been detected somewhat earlier. I do not think that APRA would have prevented the theft of superannuation funds from Commercial Nominees or stopped the collapse of HIH but I think they probably would have identified the difficulties some months, if not years, earlier. 
The Labor Party believes that whilst the improvements that the Auditor-General has identified—which have been accepted by APRA—are appropriate, there needs to be further additional funding allocated to APRA, and I have not seen a statement from the government on an allocation of additional funding. I certainly hope to see it in the supplementary estimates or in the budget next year. The Labor Party does not believe that just beefing up APRA—its regulatory powers of inspection and supervision, and moneys—in itself is sufficient to protect Australians' superannuation. Superannuation is compulsory in Australia. It is long term; it is for retirement. I have argued on behalf of the Labor Party that when theft and fraud occurs—as occurred in the Commercial Nominees case—the victims of theft and fraud in a retirement income fund, which is what superannuation is, should be fully compensated, not partly compensated, as the minister, Senator Coonan, has delivered. There should be full compensation in the event of theft and fraud of superannuation funds.
Labor has argued that full compensation should be extended where a business failure or bankruptcy occurs and there are outstanding superannuation moneys. That is part of our employee entitlements protection policy, which has already been announced. I have also argued for the broadening of the grounds for such compensation. It should not simply be confined to theft and fraud but where the trustees have allowed a serious breach of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act that should also be compensatable. Finally, I have argued that we need to extend the compensation in the event of theft and fraud to certain pension and annuity products: post retirement products. The irony is that we have some compensation for superannuation up to the point of retirement but we do not have the same level, albeit inadequate, for post retirement superannuation, pension and annuity products. It would seem to me that the improvement in compensation provisions is even more urgent, more important and more critical at that stage of a person's life once they have reached retirement. Nothing would be worse than if you were in retirement and your money was stolen and it had been in the form of a private pension or annuity and you could not get compensation. That would be quite catastrophic and it should be compensatable if the worst ever happened.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2003-09-18,"—I present the 115th report of the Committee of Privileges, entitled Persons Referred to in the Senate (Board members of Electronic Frontiers Australia Inc.).
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion relating to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the report be adopted.
This report is the 43rd in a series of reports recommending that a right of reply be afforded to persons who claim to have been adversely affected by being referred to, either by name or in such a way as to be readily identified, in the Senate. 
On 17 September 2003, the President received a letter from Ms Irene Graham, Executive Director, Electronic Frontiers Australia Inc. on behalf of the board members of Electronic Frontiers Inc. relating to remarks made by Senator the Hon. Richard Alston and Senator Brian Harradine during a debate in the Senate on 9 September 2003. The President referred the letter to the committee as a submission under privilege resolution 5. The committee considered the submission on 18 September 2003 and recommends that it be incorporated in Hansard.
The committee reminds the Senate that in matters of this nature it does not judge the truth or otherwise of statements made by honourable senators or persons. Rather, it ensures that these persons' submissions, and ultimately the responses it recommends, accord with the criteria set out in privilege resolution 5. I commend the report to the Senate.
Question agreed to.
The response read as follows—

The Hon. Paul Calvert 
President of the Senate 
Parliament House 
CANBERRA ACT 2600 
Dear Mr President 
We, the individuals listed below, seek redress under the resolution of the Senate of 25 February 1988 concerning the protection of persons referred to in the Senate (Privilege Resolution 5). We are readily identifiable as the persons referred to by Senator Harradine and Senator Alston during the debate on the Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 on 9 September 2003 (Hansard pages 14049-14061 inclusive), that is, the members of the Board of Electronic Frontiers Australia Incorporated (EFA): 
Chair Mr Greg Taylor, B.Sc, B.Econ, Dip.Inf.Proc., Grad.Cert.Law 
Vice Chair Mr Danny Yee, BSc (Hons) 
Secretary Mr Nick Ellsmore, B.Com (ISM), CISSP, MAIC 
Treasurer Mr Dale Clapperton, J.P. (Qual.) 
Ordinary Members Dr Roger Clarke, BCom (Hons I), MComm (Hons), PhD, FACS 
Mr Kimberley Heitman, B.Juris Llb, AACS, MAICD 
Mr Andrew Pam 
Mr Craig Small, BE (Hons), GradDip Management, MBA, MIEEE 
Executive Director Ms Irene Graham 
Senator Brian Harradine stated that we are “the spokespeople of the porn industry”. Senator Richard Alston, Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, stated that we want to access and then peddle sites involving child pornography; that we are the “ultimate doctrinaire libertarians”; that we support “unrestricted access to offensive material in all its manifestations”; that we “do not believe in trying to find a sensible way of dealing with offensive material on the Internet” and implied that we are dishonest and not a word we say should be believed.
All these allegations are unsubstantiated and false. The Senators' remarks impugn our individual good characters, reputations, honesty and integrity, and those of the thousands of members and supporters of the organisation we represent. In addition, the Senators' remarks are factually incorrect. We hereby seek the opportunity to set the record straight. 
The following facts are pertinent. 
1. Senator Brian Harradine stated: 
“Electronic Frontiers Australia are the spokespeople of the porn industry”. (p.14052)
Senator Harradine's statement is factually incorrect. EFA does not speak for the porn industry and never has done so. 
Evidently some commentators inadvertently or otherwise confuse Electronic Frontiers Australia Inc. (“EFA”) with the adult goods and services industry association, which recently changed its name from The Eros Foundation to The Eros Association Inc. Electronic Frontiers Australia is and always has been a completely separate organisation from The Eros Foundation/Association. The two organisations have quite different aims, objectives and policies. Further, EFA policy on censorship is not the same as that of The Eros Association, for example the two organisations had different positions in relation to the “NVE” Bill in 2000. 
Electronic Frontiers Australia Inc. is a non-profit national organisation representing Internet users concerned with on-line freedoms and rights. EFA was formed in January 1994 and incorporated under the South Australian Associations Incorporation Act in May 1994. EFA members come from all parts of Australia and from diverse backgrounds. They are people concerned about matters such as censorship, privacy and intellectual property.
EFA's major objectives are to protect and promote the civil liberties of users and operators of computer based communications systems; to advocate the amendment of laws and regulations in Australia and elsewhere (both current and proposed) which restrict free speech and to educate the community at large about the social, political and civil liberties issues involved in the use of computer based communications systems. 
EFA is independent of government and commerce, is not a subsidiary or affiliate of any other organisation, and is funded by membership subscriptions and donations from individuals and organisations with an altruistic interest in promoting civil liberties.
EFA policy formulation, decision making and oversight of organisational activities are the responsibility of the EFA Board of Management. Board members are elected by the members-at-large each year and act in a voluntary capacity; they are not remunerated for time spent on EFA activities. The Executive Director is a non-voting member of the Board appointed by and reporting to the Board. Board members are subject to compliance with a Board Code of Conduct approved by the members-at-large which ensures, in addition to the provisions of the S.A. Associations Incorporations Act, that in the event of any Board member having a conflict of interest in relation to any matter under consideration by the EFA Board, that they are not entitled to vote in relation to that matter. 
2. Senator Alston stated:
“Senator Lundy said:
`The idea that FOI could allow people to access and then peddle sites [- for example, that could relate to child pornography-] is completely absurd.' I do not why it is completely absurd. That is precisely what this EFA outfit wanted to do. ... They wanted access to the sites that have been subject to take-down orders. Why would you want to see all that material? They want the URLs and the content.” (p.14056)
Senator Alston's claim is factually incorrect. EFA's FOI application did not request copies of content of any description whatsoever, nor did EFA want URLs relating to content involving child pornography. EFA has previously addressed such false claims in the Frequently Asked Questions [1] page on our web site which includes the following:
`Was EFA seeking information identifying content containing child pornography?
No. While many of the ABA's arguments against full release of the 129 documents appear to imply that the documents refer to child pornography, EFA believes that some 117 of the documents do not contain information about such material. If the ABA had only claimed exemptions for documents that credibly seemed likely to refer to such material, EFA would not have appealed the ABA's decision.
EFA expects that the ABA would refer content involving child pornography to police. According to a speech by Mr Gareth Grainger (then Deputy Chair of the ABA) on 10 March 2000 [2], at that time only “four (4) of the complaints investigated have involved material that has...been referred to the police for investigation”. However, information the ABA and AAT exempted from disclosure concerns many more than 4 complaints received by the ABA before the end of February 2000.' 
Furthermore, EFA informed the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (“AAT”) during the hearing in July 2001 that we considered the Australian Broadcasting Authority (“ABA”) should be required to point out to the AAT which documents concerned material involving child pornography and that information should be exempt from disclosure. (A relevant extract from the AAT hearing transcript is available in EFA's media release of 13 June 2002 [3].) The information deemed by the ABA and the AAT to be exempt from disclosure included information relating to content the ABA had determined was not prohibited content and also to material that is legally available to adults in cinemas, videos and offline publications.
3. Senator Alston stated: 
“Organisations such as the EFA are the ultimate doctrinaire libertarians. They do not believe in any form of censorship. They do not believe in trying to find a sensible way of dealing with offensive material on the Internet.” (p.14056)
and 
“You are in favour of giving them the URLs and the pornographic content. ... You were in favour of the EFA. You clearly, therefore, are on the side of unrestricted access to offensive material in all its manifestations.” (p.14061) 
Senator Alston's statements concerning our views are factually incorrect. EFA's position on censorship is not that of “doctrinaire libertarians” and we do not support “unrestricted access to offensive material in all its manifestations”. 
EFA does not support availability of, nor access to, material depicting child sexual abuse and accordingly we have never opposed laws prohibiting production, publication, distribution and knowing possession of such material. We also do not oppose laws prohibiting publication of various other types of material, one example of which is material directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action that is likely to incite or produce such action. 
We have consistently made our views known to Senator Alston's department (and parliamentary committees) since at least as long ago as 1997 in EFA's response to the proposed Principles for a Regulatory Framework for On-line Services in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 issued by the (then) Department of Communications and the Arts. As stated therein “The precise definition of [content that is universally condemned] in a new Internet-Illegal guideline statement would be the appropriate response by an Australian government intent on making a effective contribution to dealing with criminal content. Obviously, the narrowest definitions of illegal content are most likely to be successfully prohibited—a wide definition that includes material routinely available in other countries and protected as free speech in the United States would be pointless and unenforceable. ... EFA submits that the only material that can be plausibly prohibited is that which is prosecuted in the USA and in all major countries—specifically authentic child abuse images and text which is criminal under laws of general application (for example death threats or terrorist conspiracy).”
Senators Alston and Harradine should by now be well aware that our principle objection to the Commonwealth Internet censorship regime arises from the fact that it makes a broad range of material that is legal offline in Australia, illegal online.
Senator Alston's statement that we “do not believe in trying to find a sensible way of dealing with offensive material on the Internet” is also factually incorrect. EFA has been contributing suggestions and comments to the numerous government and parliamentary committee inquiries into ways of dealing with “offensive” material, and protecting children online, since EFA's formation in 1994. There is no universally agreed definition of what is “offensive”, globally or even within Australia, and EFA's position in regard to such contentious material has been and remains in accord with the long established principles in Australian offline censorship law that: 
	“adults should be able to read, hear and see what they want”; 
	“minors should be protected from material likely to harm or disturb them”;  “everyone should be protected from exposure to unsolicited material that they find offensive”. 
The Commonwealth Internet censorship regime does not achieve any of those objectives. Hence, EFA opposes the regime.  
4. Senator Alston stated: 
“I would not believe a word the EFA said, even if they said, `We're just going to keep it to ourselves for “research purposes” `, but they have not said that. They just wanted access to it, ... and then make it available to all the world. Of course, what would you do? You would simply load it onto an offshore web site and you would stand there thumbing your nose at the authorities and saying, `There, there, we've put it beyond your reach.' “ (p.14056) 
Senator Alston provided no justification for his implication that not a word EFA says should be believed. Furthermore, it appears apparent from other remarks made by Senator Alston that he has been misinformed regarding EFA's views and what EFA has and has not said in the past.
Allegations that EFA intended to publish URLs of prohibited content, if released under FOI, apparently originate from a newspaper article in 2000. As EFA informed the AAT when the ABA's Counsel quoted the newspaper article during the AAT hearing, that article contained incorrect information misrepresenting EFA's intentions. Moreover, EFA did not seek copies of prohibited content under FOI and hence clearly had no intention or wish to receive material that could, theoretically, be loaded onto any site. Furthermore, EFA does not and would not publish information in breach of Commonwealth and/or State/Territory laws. 
5. Senator Alston stated: 
“...all we ever get is this ridicule about the global village idiot which, as I recall, was a term used by someone who wandered out here from the American Civil Liberties Union as a guest, I think, of Electronic Frontiers ... It was just the usual sort of abuse as you are going to the airport”. (p.14055) 
The President of the ACLU did not visit Australia as a guest of EFA and EFA had no involvement whatsoever in her visit. The ACLU President was in Australia as a guest of the University of Melbourne to speak at a seminar on `Censorship Versus Free Speech on the Internet' which was 
organised by the University's Centre for Media, Communication and Information Technology Law, according to the information in UniNEWS Vol 8 No 30, 30 August 1999 [4] and The Law Report, Transcript, ABC Radio, 9 November 1999 [5]. 
6. Finally, remarks by Senator Richard Alston appear to imply that EFA is, or is associated with, “the Lions Foundation” (p.14052). We have no association with any such organisation, nor with the “Lion club” or the “Lion forum” which were also mentioned by Senator Alston (p.14055). We had not even heard of such organisation/s prior to reading Senator Alston's remarks. 
We tender the above in good faith and request that our response be incorporated in the parliamentary record.

"Ray, Sen Robert",ALP,2003-09-18,"—I present the 115th report of the Committee of Privileges, entitled Persons Referred to in the Senate (Board members of Electronic Frontiers Australia Inc.).
Ordered that the report be printed.
—I seek leave to move a motion relating to the report.
Leave granted.
—I move:
That the report be adopted.
This report is the 43rd in a series of reports recommending that a right of reply be afforded to persons who claim to have been adversely affected by being referred to, either by name or in such a way as to be readily identified, in the Senate. 
On 17 September 2003, the President received a letter from Ms Irene Graham, Executive Director, Electronic Frontiers Australia Inc. on behalf of the board members of Electronic Frontiers Inc. relating to remarks made by Senator the Hon. Richard Alston and Senator Brian Harradine during a debate in the Senate on 9 September 2003. The President referred the letter to the committee as a submission under privilege resolution 5. The committee considered the submission on 18 September 2003 and recommends that it be incorporated in Hansard.
The committee reminds the Senate that in matters of this nature it does not judge the truth or otherwise of statements made by honourable senators or persons. Rather, it ensures that these persons' submissions, and ultimately the responses it recommends, accord with the criteria set out in privilege resolution 5. I commend the report to the Senate.
Question agreed to.
The response read as follows—

The Hon. Paul Calvert 
President of the Senate

CANBERRA ACT 2600 
Dear Mr President 
We, the individuals listed below, seek redress under the resolution of the Senate of 25 February 1988 concerning the protection of persons referred to in the Senate (Privilege Resolution 5). We are readily identifiable as the persons referred to by Senator Harradine and Senator Alston during the debate on the Communications Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 on 9 September 2003 (Hansard pages 14049-14061 inclusive), that is, the members of the Board of Electronic Frontiers Australia Incorporated (EFA): 
Chair Mr Greg Taylor, B.Sc, B.Econ, Dip.Inf.Proc., Grad.Cert.Law 
Vice Chair Mr Danny Yee, BSc (Hons) 
Secretary Mr Nick Ellsmore, B.Com (ISM), CISSP, MAIC

Mr Kimberley Heitman, B.Juris Llb, AACS, MAICD 
Mr Andrew Pam 
Mr Craig Small, BE (Hons), GradDip Management, MBA, MIEEE 
Executive Director Ms Irene Graham 
Senator Brian Harradine stated that we are “the spokespeople of the porn industry”. Senator Richard Alston, Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, stated that we want to access and then peddle sites involving child pornography; that we are the “ultimate doctrinaire libertarians”; that we support “unrestricted access to offensive material in all its manifestations”; that we “do not believe in trying to find a sensible way of dealing with offensive material on the Internet” and implied that we are dishonest and not a word we say should be believed.
All these allegations are unsubstantiated and false. The Senators' remarks impugn our individual good characters, reputations, honesty and integrity, and those of the thousands of members and supporters of the organisation we represent. In addition, the Senators' remarks are factually incorrect. We hereby seek the opportunity to set the record straight. 
The following facts are pertinent. 
1. Senator Brian Harradine stated: 
“Electronic Frontiers Australia are the spokespeople of the porn industry”. (p.14052)
Senator Harradine's statement is factually incorrect. EFA does not speak for the porn industry and never has done so. 
Evidently some commentators inadvertently or otherwise confuse Electronic Frontiers Australia Inc. (“EFA”) with the adult goods and services industry association, which recently changed its name from The Eros Foundation to The Eros Association Inc. Electronic Frontiers Australia is and always has been a completely separate organisation from The Eros Foundation/Association. The two organisations have quite different aims, objectives and policies. Further, EFA policy on censorship is not the same as that of The Eros Association, for example the two organisations had different positions in relation to the “NVE” Bill in 2000. 
Electronic Frontiers Australia Inc. is a non-profit national organisation representing Internet users concerned with on-line freedoms and rights. EFA was formed in January 1994 and incorporated under the South Australian Associations Incorporation Act in May 1994. EFA members come from all parts of Australia and from diverse backgrounds. They are people concerned about matters such as censorship, privacy and intellectual property.
EFA's major objectives are to protect and promote the civil liberties of users and operators of computer based communications systems; to advocate the amendment of laws and regulations in Australia and elsewhere (both current and proposed) which restrict free speech and to educate the community at large about the social, political and civil liberties issues involved in the use of computer based communications systems. 
EFA is independent of government and commerce, is not a subsidiary or affiliate of any other organisation, and is funded by membership subscriptions and donations from individuals and organisations with an altruistic interest in promoting civil liberties.
EFA policy formulation, decision making and oversight of organisational activities are the responsibility of the EFA Board of Management. Board members are elected by the members-at-large each year and act in a voluntary capacity; they are not remunerated for time spent on EFA activities. The Executive Director is a non-voting member of the Board appointed by and reporting to the Board. Board members are subject to compliance with a Board Code of Conduct approved by the members-at-large which ensures, in addition to the provisions of the S.A. Associations Incorporations Act, that in the event of any Board member having a conflict of interest in relation to any matter under consideration by the EFA Board, that they are not entitled to vote in relation to that matter. 
2. Senator Alston stated:
“Senator Lundy said:
`The idea that FOI could allow people to access and then peddle sites [- for example, that could relate to child pornography-] is completely absurd.' I do not why it is completely absurd. That is precisely what this EFA outfit wanted to do. ... They wanted access to the sites that have been subject to take-down orders. Why would you want to see all that material? They want the URLs and the content.” (p.14056)
Senator Alston's claim is factually incorrect. EFA's FOI application did not request copies of content of any description whatsoever, nor did EFA want URLs relating to content involving child pornography. EFA has previously addressed such false claims in the Frequently Asked Questions [1] page on our web site which includes the following:
`Was EFA seeking information identifying content containing child pornography?
No. While many of the ABA's arguments against full release of the 129 documents appear to imply that the documents refer to child pornography, EFA believes that some 117 of the documents do not contain information about such material. If the ABA had only claimed exemptions for documents that credibly seemed likely to refer to such material, EFA would not have appealed the ABA's decision.
EFA expects that the ABA would refer content involving child pornography to police. According to a speech by Mr Gareth Grainger (then Deputy Chair of the ABA) on 10 March 2000 [2], at that time only “four (4) of the complaints investigated have involved material that has...been referred to the police for investigation”. However, information the ABA and AAT exempted from disclosure concerns many more than 4 complaints received by the ABA before the end of February 2000.' 
Furthermore, EFA informed the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (“AAT”) during the hearing in July 2001 that we considered the Australian Broadcasting Authority (“ABA”) should be required to point out to the AAT which documents concerned material involving child pornography and that information should be exempt from disclosure. (A relevant extract from the AAT hearing transcript is available in EFA's media release of 13 June 2002 [3].) The information deemed by the ABA and the AAT to be exempt from disclosure included information relating to content the ABA had determined was not prohibited content and also to material that is legally available to adults in cinemas, videos and offline publications.
3. Senator Alston stated: 
“Organisations such as the EFA are the ultimate doctrinaire libertarians. They do not believe in any form of censorship. They do not believe in trying to find a sensible way of dealing with offensive material on the Internet.” (p.14056)
and 
“You are in favour of giving them the URLs and the pornographic content. ... You were in favour of the EFA. You clearly, therefore, are on the side of unrestricted access to offensive material in all its manifestations.” (p.14061) 
Senator Alston's statements concerning our views are factually incorrect. EFA's position on censorship is not that of “doctrinaire libertarians” and we do not support “unrestricted access to offensive material in all its manifestations”. 
EFA does not support availability of, nor access to, material depicting child sexual abuse and accordingly we have never opposed laws prohibiting production, publication, distribution and knowing possession of such material. We also do not oppose laws prohibiting publication of various other types of material, one example of which is material directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action that is likely to incite or produce such action. 
We have consistently made our views known to Senator Alston's department (and parliamentary committees) since at least as long ago as 1997 in EFA's response to the proposed Principles for a Regulatory Framework for On-line Services in the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 issued by the (then) Department of Communications and the Arts. As stated therein “The precise definition of [content that is universally condemned] in a new Internet-Illegal guideline statement would be the appropriate response by an Australian government intent on making a effective contribution to dealing with criminal content. Obviously, the narrowest definitions of illegal content are most likely to be successfully prohibited—a wide definition that includes material routinely available in other countries and protected as free speech in the United States would be pointless and unenforceable. ... EFA submits that the only material that can be plausibly prohibited is that which is prosecuted in the USA and in all major countries—specifically authentic child abuse images and text which is criminal under laws of general application (for example death threats or terrorist conspiracy).”
Senators Alston and Harradine should by now be well aware that our principle objection to the Commonwealth Internet censorship regime arises from the fact that it makes a broad range of material that is legal offline in Australia, illegal online.
Senator Alston's statement that we “do not believe in trying to find a sensible way of dealing with offensive material on the Internet” is also factually incorrect. EFA has been contributing suggestions and comments to the numerous government and parliamentary committee inquiries into ways of dealing with “offensive” material, and protecting children online, since EFA's formation in 1994. There is no universally agreed definition of what is “offensive”, globally or even within Australia, and EFA's position in regard to such contentious material has been and remains in accord with the long established principles in Australian offline censorship law that: 
	“adults should be able to read, hear and see what they want”; 
	“minors should be protected from material likely to harm or disturb them”;  “everyone should be protected from exposure to unsolicited material that they find offensive”. 
The Commonwealth Internet censorship regime does not achieve any of those objectives. Hence, EFA opposes the regime.  
4. Senator Alston stated: 
“I would not believe a word the EFA said, even if they said, `We're just going to keep it to ourselves for “research purposes” `, but they have not said that. They just wanted access to it, ... and then make it available to all the world. Of course, what would you do? You would simply load it onto an offshore web site and you would stand there thumbing your nose at the authorities and saying, `There, there, we've put it beyond your reach.' “ (p.14056) 
Senator Alston provided no justification for his implication that not a word EFA says should be believed. Furthermore, it appears apparent from other remarks made by Senator Alston that he has been misinformed regarding EFA's views and what EFA has and has not said in the past.
Allegations that EFA intended to publish URLs of prohibited content, if released under FOI, apparently originate from a newspaper article in 2000. As EFA informed the AAT when the ABA's Counsel quoted the newspaper article during the AAT hearing, that article contained incorrect information misrepresenting EFA's intentions. Moreover, EFA did not seek copies of prohibited content under FOI and hence clearly had no intention or wish to receive material that could, theoretically, be loaded onto any site. Furthermore, EFA does not and would not publish information in breach of Commonwealth and/or State/Territory laws. 
5. Senator Alston stated: 
“...all we ever get is this ridicule about the global village idiot which, as I recall, was a term used by someone who wandered out here from the American Civil Liberties Union as a guest, I think, of Electronic Frontiers ... It was just the usual sort of abuse as you are going to the airport”. (p.14055) 
The President of the ACLU did not visit Australia as a guest of EFA and EFA had no involvement whatsoever in her visit. The ACLU President was in Australia as a guest of the University of Melbourne to speak at a seminar on `Censorship Versus Free Speech on the Internet' which was 
organised by the University's Centre for Media, Communication and Information Technology Law, according to the information in UniNEWS Vol 8 No 30, 30 August 1999 [4] and The Law Report, Transcript, ABC Radio, 9 November 1999 [5]. 
6. Finally, remarks by Senator Richard Alston appear to imply that EFA is, or is associated with, “the Lions Foundation” (p.14052). We have no association with any such organisation, nor with the “Lion club” or the “Lion forum” which were also mentioned by Senator Alston (p.14055). We had not even heard of such organisation/s prior to reading Senator Alston's remarks. 
We tender the above in good faith and request that our response be incorporated in the parliamentary record.

"Tchen, Sen Tsebin",LP,2003-09-18,"—Tonight I rise to speak about a person who—if we were to believe those who hold themselves our moral guardians and whose main occupation is to write hateful letters to editors—would have to be arguably the most hated person in Australian public life. However, as it is true that a person's quality should be judged from the quality of his enemies, Philip Ruddock, the longest serving member of this parliament and an outstanding Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs in the history of this country, a country that was built and continues to be built by migrants, can rest assured that he well deserves the honorific of `the Honourable'.
Philip Ruddock has been elected and re-elected by the people of his electorate 13 times since 1972. Next Monday he celebrates the 30th anniversary of his election. This is an occasion the joy of which we all share and, appropriately, Sydney's migrant community—the largest migrant community in Australia—will host a 1,000-guest public dinner in his honour. Unfortunately, we cannot all be there, so I must pay my tribute to him in advance.
A person of deep and thoughtful commitment to the ideals of social justice, and possessing a powerful intellect, during his distinguished—and happily continuing—parliamentary career, Philip Ruddock has demonstrated interests and expertise in many social policy fields including Indigenous affairs and social security, in which he has held portfolio responsibilities as a minister or a shadow minister. His interests are not limited to these fields, however. As a demonstration of his capacity for hard work and the energy and focus he brings to his work, when he gave his first speech in the House of Representatives chamber back in 1973, instead of reflecting on his personal history and aspirations as most new members and senators would have done, Philip Ruddock addressed the House on the estimates of the Department of Urban and Regional Development—one of the many Whitlam Labor government's failed brave new world dreams—and on the environment and the future of Sydney airport, two issues on which the Labor Party, 30 years later, are still trying to find their way. 
Notwithstanding his encyclopaedic range of interests, Philip Ruddock has always displayed a strong commitment to address the complex humanitarian challenges facing the international community. Even prior to becoming the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock's personal interests compelled him to visit many countries to learn first-hand of the appalling conditions in which refugees around the world were forced to live. Throughout the 1980s, when he was shadow minister, he visited refugee camps in Pakistan, Malaysia, Austria and Hong Kong. One trip was as part of a parliamentary delegation, but most were initiated by his own desire, during his holidays, to gain a genuine understanding of the plight of refugees world wide.
The misery he witnessed then and in subsequent visits had a profound effect on him. As the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Philip Ruddock embarked on an ambitious reform agenda which has seen Australia nominated by the OECD as an immigration country par excellence, and included in this is a humanitarian program recognised as one of the most generous in the world. On Philip Ruddock's watch, Australia's refugee programs have been responsive to changing world protection needs. Not only are we one of the very few countries in the world with a working humanitarian resettlement program, we are the only country that has shifted the focus of our international resettlement activity to Africa, where the plight of refugees is the greatest. In the first five years of the Howard government, on Philip Ruddock's watch, between 1996 and 2001, according to the census, Australia's East African population—that is, the people from Eritrea, Ethiopia, Kenya, Somalia and the Sudan—increased by 54.9 per cent, including an increase of 102 per cent from the Sudan. During the same period, people from the West Asian conflict zones—that is, Afghanistan, Iran, Iraq, Kuwait and Pakistan—increased by 50.4 per cent. That included more than 10,000 people from Iraq who settled in Australia. At the same time, more than 10,000 Bosnian Muslims came to Australia. These figures are irrefutable. 
These outstanding results were achieved before the difficult challenge posed by international people smugglers became a threat to Australia's security. That is an issue that we have overcome as a result of Philip Ruddock's steadfastness. As a result of his success in combating unauthorised arrivals, balance has been restored to Australia's humanitarian program so that visas go to those deemed by the UNHCR to be the most vulnerable and in the most desperate circumstances. This year, Australia granted its highest number of offshore refugee and humanitarian visas for five years. In fact, 93 per cent of the total number of humanitarian visas were granted to people applying overseas.
History will bring clarity to the importance of Philip Ruddock's contribution to the stability of Australia's multicultural, diversely productive and cohesive society. But I am pleased to note that the majority of thinking Australians have already endorsed his work. If the test of social justice is whether the idea will remain true if the positions of the protagonists are reversed—if justice applies to everybody regardless; if the test of compassion is whether the idea remains true if the magnitude of the subject multiplies—whether it is the first boat or the 200th boat; if the test of humanity is whether the ideas remain true despite distance—whether the refugees are unauthorised arrivals on your doorstep or 10,000 miles away in a refugee camp; if the test of wisdom is whether the idea remains true over time—whether it is true today or true in 20 years time, then Philip Ruddock has passed all four tests. I am proud to serve in the same parliament as him, and I hope—although it is probably unlikely—that he will have another 30 years of service to Australia.
Before I finish, let me say that last Thursday night I gave an adjournment speech in which I sought to incorporate the list of participants in the National Youth Roundtable 2003. However, due to an oversight, I did not show it to the Opposition Whip prior to my speech and Senator Campbell, perhaps not being familiar with the National Youth Roundtable, challenged me. During the confusion, although he gave leave afterwards, the Hansard record showed that I attempted to table rather than incorporate the document. I now seek leave to incorporate the document in my adjournment speech of last Thursday.
