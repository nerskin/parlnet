"Murray, Sen Andrew",AD,1999-03-24,"—We are debating the A New Tax System (Fringe Benefits Reporting) Bill 1998  and the A New Tax System (Medicare Levy Surcharge—Fringe Benefits) Bill 1998. These two bills are the first of the over 17 bills that we expect to get with the ANTS package. Like Labor, we have agreed that these can be brought on early because of their content and because of their early starting 
 date and in many senses they can be isolated from the rest of the ANTS package. As Senator Lees has indicated, we will support these bills being dealt with early, and we will support them overall, but with amendments.
On the question of amendments, I want to make some remarks about the government's amendments before us, some 15 of them. The government have described these as technical amendments and many may be so properly described, but the fact is that they are amendments. I think that draws attention, again, to the process the Senate has undertaken with the ANTS package. The government's approach consistently has been that they have a mandate, that those bills have been passed after 20 hours of debate in the House of Representatives, and that those bills should be passed by the Senate without delay. The Senate's response has been that the complexity and the nature of these bills requires proper review. That review explicitly means that there will be amendments as a consequence.
In Western democracies the very best governments do in fact put out bills in advance for consultation. That is a sign of a mature government. Indeed, the previous government and this government have at times done that. Amongst examples are the bills to rewrite the tax act in plain English and to review the corporate law. Recently, the republic bills have been put out for consultation and comment. That, frankly, is the mature way in which to deal with complex legislation. What the government has done by adopting the stance it has on these bills is to paint itself as immature. It is absolutely impossible for a government composed chiefly of lawyers without much business experience, and for a Treasury without much business experience, to get every aspect of those bills right, even from the government's perspective.
There are always unintended and unforeseen consequences arising from complex legislation such as this, and I will predict that even on the government side there will be a deluge of amendments attached to the remaining bills to be considered later in this half-year term. I think we need a lot more statements about consultation and flexibility and a lot fewer about mandates and the bills being perfect, 
 because they cannot be perfect, not from anybody's perspective. The early sycophancy which business has expressed over these bills is starting to give way to the reality of a critical assessment and a request for amendments to meet practical and unforeseen difficulties arising from the bills as presented to us. That is as it should be.
I would urge the government to start to adopt a different kind of language, a more flexible and more mature language, in dealing with the remainder of the bills that come up because every time you present a sheet of 15 amendments—or the deluge that I anticipate will come later on—people are going to point at you and say, `Look, you said this was perfect. You said this should be passed immediately. You said that these bills were best practice and best assessed as they were originally,' and that cannot ever be so. Members of the government as well as non-government members have to recognise that the consequence of Senate review will be in fact to improve the bills and to make them more practical and better to operate in the world that taxpayers have to deal with.
These two bills attack salary packaging using fringe benefits to avoid means tests within the tax and social security systems. The Democrats welcome that. As Senator Lees has pointed out, this has become necessary because of the use of salary packaging, particularly by high income earners, to try to avoid the high income earners superannuation tax surcharge. If ever there was an exercise that resulted in unnecessary pain, it was the introduction of that particular act in such a way as to avoid the matter being originally referred to as a `tax', which as a result has inflicted millions of dollars of expense on the funds who have had to manage it. When that consequence is assessed, it becomes rather hollow for the government to claim that other amendments that the Senate might seek to make to bills could cost the community money, because the government does not hesitate to cost the community money when there is a political issue at hand.
I want to talk briefly about superannuation and salary packaging before returning to 
 fringe benefits generally and specifically in relation to these bills. The inclusion of superannuation benefits on group certificates has long been a policy sought by the Democrats. Once superannuation is included on group certificates, not only will people who receive those group certificates be able to value more the benefit of the superannuation they receive—and consider it as part of their overall package—but we can then start addressing the serious anomalies in the tax treatment of superannuation. The anomalies arise because of the flat 15 per cent tax on employer contributions. That, like all flat taxes, gives a larger benefit to high income earners than to low income earners.
For someone on the top marginal tax rates the super tax provides a 33 cents in the dollar tax break. For someone on the lowest tax rates it provides a tax break of just six cents in the dollar. As a result, a study by the Democrats in 1994 found that a third of the $3.9 billion of tax concessions flowed through to the top 10 per cent of taxpayers while the bottom 20 per cent of taxpayers received less than 10 per cent of the concessions. Then the superannuation high income earners tax surcharge was introduced, putting an extra 15 per cent on super contributions above $85,000. That was a blunt, partial attack on the problem but at least it was some movement away from a flat tax on super towards a more progressive tax rate.
But the government, to use a colloquialism, stuffed it up. Instead of accepting the unanimous recommendations from the ACTU, the ASFA—which is a superannuation body—and most employer groups, all calling for the surcharge to be imposed on individuals by including superannuation on group certificates, the government imposed it on the funds. That meant that the funds have had to spend tens of millions of dollars in administration costs and compliance costs trying to get tax file numbers off members to tell the tax office which individuals need to pay the surcharge, then the ATO checks their income and tells the particular fund in turn how much to collect. It has been an administrative nightmare and a huge and unnecessary cost impost on funds. That has pushed grumpy 
 high income earners into salary packaging to avoid it, hence the need for this bill.
A far fairer way of dealing with the taxation of superannuation contributions, in our submission, would be to include contributions on group certificates and then tax employees at their marginal rate less the same flat rebate. That would ensure the same rebate for high or low income earners and provide a degree of progressivity for superannuation while still providing a healthy rebate as an incentive to put superannuation away. If the government is to be congratulated, firstly, on balancing the books and, secondly, on attempting to tackle much needed tax reform, the third bow, if you like, in Treasury policy should surely be to advance national savings. I would hope that superannuation and the issues attached to it will get increasing attention from government.
I particularly support the inclusion of superannuation in the definition of assessable income for the determination of the high income earners tax surcharge. When we are talking about taxation of superannuation, why include fringe benefits but exclude superannuation from the determination of income? Targeting fringe benefits but not superannuation is switching on a different traffic light for salary packages after maximum tax advantage. This government, quite properly, has asked the Ralph committee to attend to principles of taxation to try to establish some common and consistent ways in which we should address these issues. Here is an issue on which we think the government is making the right decision: put fringe benefits where it belongs, on a group certificate, as part of the overall salary package. Why not superannuation as well? It is a major part of tax packaging.
I hope that the Senate, in moving to close the loophole on fringe benefits in respect of the superannuation surcharge, also does so for superannuation. In our amendments which are to be circulated later today we have chosen not to include superannuation in the means test for HECS repayments. We have excluded HECS repayments because the HECS repayment schedule starts at such an appalling low level that any further impost would be to 
 add to the gross unfairness of the repayment schedule.
The changes to the HECS repayment schedule, also discussed by Senator Lees, provide a nice symmetry, an additional improvement to the bill. The bill should be absolutely about increasing the taxes paid by high income earners. That should be used to reduce taxes on the low paid. The issue of acute community anger about substantial numbers of Australians paying far too much tax and substantial numbers of Australians paying far too little tax is palpable. There is a common belief, an instinct, that those who are able to structure their affairs through companies and trusts and those who earn high gross income are getting away with paying too little tax; in other words, they are not paying their fair share.
The HECS repayment—the tax on graduates, the tax on education—is a regressive impost which sees a large proportion of young workers under 25, on less than average weekly earnings, with average tax rates well above those of multimillionaires. Why is that sensible? Why is that something we should be doing? To us, it seems a profoundly wrong and misdirected policy. It is an issue we will revisit later in this tax debate and, I am sure, in the tax debates to come. For the moment, of the 1999-2000 income year, we propose interim relief to at least take out of the tax net those who are regarded by the tax and social security systems as low income earners.
I said I would return to fringe benefits tax. One further fringe benefits tax change which I think needs to be addressed, if we are to put salary packaging to bed as a tax avoidance measure, is the removal of the concessional treatment of company cars. In 1996-97 the tax office estimated that this concession cost over $740 million. Why are we subsidising private car usage to the tune of $740 million?
The Ralph business review has also acknowledged this as an issue that should be addressed, but I do not think the business tax review is necessarily the place for it to be dealt with, although it is quite proper for them to examine it as part of overall business interest. The FBT on cars is a salary packaging issue, a fringe benefit, and should be 
 dealt with as part of the income tax reforms. It should not be offered up to pay for other business tax benefits. It should be dealt with to clean up and make more principled the way in which we deal with the income that individuals receive, whether in salary, in fringe benefits or in superannuation.
Abolishing the concession, according to the tax office, would give us over $740 million. That could be used to address other things that the government has quite properly targeted in ANTS such as poverty traps, such as the 70 per cent taper on unemployment benefits. That would in turn provide a big benefit to business by increasing the supply of labour and taking the pressure off wages because the real income of low paid workers would go up without an impost on the companies concerned. It would provide benefits to low income earners by allowing them to keep more of their income and it would add to the progressiveness of the tax system by reducing the tax concession on company cars that tends to accrue more to high income earners than to low income earners.
Another issue that has to be attended to in this matter of the taxation levels for individuals and how salary is to be addressed is the issue that the ACTU properly raised—it should be on the agenda for all of us—that is, bracket creep and the need for the threshold level to be at least parallel to the indexation that presently applies, so that you do not keep raising the taxation of individuals while holding the absolute threshold level down. That bracket creep issue, if addressed by the government, would do a great deal for their reputation among ordinary income earners.
The other issue I raise briefly concerns the level of taxation. The government, Ralph and business cannot even begin to start discussing lowering tax rates, for instance to 30 per cent, until the community at large is satisfied that trusts, companies and high wealth individuals are paying their fair share: the community won't have a bar of it. I am sure the Senate will not have a bar of it either. We must pay attention to those issues before we can move to a climate in which we can talk about an overall reduction of top rates. I also believe, 
 as Senator Lees mentioned, that we have to pay attention to a minimal tax rate.
The effective tax rates of some major companies in this country are in single figures. They do not pay anywhere near a 36 per cent rate on their overall taxable profits. In this exercise that the government has rightly commenced, I say to the government: clean up the income tax area first and satisfy the community that you are doing the right thing by them in terms of fairness and equity. Then, as a community, they will be willing to look at the other issues that business is clamouring for.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS REPORTING) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Hogg, Sen John",ALP,1999-03-24,"—I thank Senator Margetts for allowing me to speak before her in the speaking order. The two bills before the Senate are part of a wide-ranging package being introduced by the government. They stand out as being rather ironic in themselves because the thrust of the package that the government will introduce is to shift the tax burden from the rich to the poor. Yet before us are two bills which seek to address anomalies—that is, to make those people who are now seeking to avoid the payment of tax pay their due taxation. The two bills, whilst a minor step to rake in some additional taxation and to catch those people who have been able to salary sacrifice and salary repackage to avoid the payment of taxation, will now be caught by the changes to the fringe benefits laws.
The two bills before us raise a question of equity. Equity is very important. Those people with the greatest capacity to pay should pay the most taxation. Having listened to many of the speakers that have participated in this debate so far, one would not be wrong in forming the view that the people who have benefited previously have been the high salary earners who have been able to repackage their remuneration arrangements. There is a regulation impact statement summarised in the Bills Digest. I quote from item 1.164 because it sums up what has been happening:
Employees who are currently subject to government surcharges, income-related obligations or who qualify for certain rebates, may have an increased liability as a result of this measure. Some employees may be subject to government surcharges and/or income-related obligations for the 
 first time as a result of this measure, for example, where employees were avoiding such obligations by receiving remuneration in the form of fringe benefits rather than salary.
The Bills Digest  goes on to say:
Salary sacrifice arrangements with a view to tax minimisation will be less attractive in consequence of the proposed changes which are considered in the following paragraphs.
In that sense, the two bills before us are welcomed. Obviously they will overcome a loophole that has been absolutely gaping and through which many have driven, to their own advantage, their salary repackaging. This is a good move indeed but, when one looks at it as part of the overall package, one must have a quite cynical view that we are seeing the shift of the tax burden from the rich to the poor in a whole raft of bills. Yet the legislation before us, in some minimal way, seeks to redress the problems that have been created by the salary sacrificing that has taken place in recent years. This has been brought about in particular by the superannuation surcharge, or tax—as my colleagues have been at pains to explore.
The opportunity for salary sacrificing has not been made available, nor was available, to low income earners. It has not been available to those who may well be on some fixed income. To see people rejigging their salary packages to avoid their proper share of taxation breeds nothing more than contempt and envy. This measure, in some small way, will go to removing the cynicism that exists in the public at large. People will now be caught by the provisions of the two bills before the parliament. Some small measure of tax justice will be achieved because those who have availed themselves of salary sacrificing and salary repackaging will no longer see that as being an attractive proposition.
Of course, the legislation does not address the issues of trusts and those who are able to hide in the corporate sector. Nonetheless, it does begin going down the path of addressing some injustice. It is rather unfortunate that this is part of a raft of bills the thrust of which will be to shift the burden of taxation from the rich to the poor. For those people who may have had a dim view of the 
 practices of those high income learners, the highest salary earners, to avoid the payment of taxation, the measures in both these bills are undoubtedly welcomed. I commend the bills to the Senate.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS REPORTING) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-03-24,"—This series of bills is aimed at minimising tax avoidance opportunities. In part, it responds to the widespread concerns amongst the community. PAYE taxpayers feel that they are the only ones paying their fair share of tax in Australia. I should add that PAYE taxpayers who cannot necessarily afford expensive tax accountants and lawyers perhaps pay more than others. They feel as if they do not have the ability to work the tax system, negotiate the most effective salary package and minimise their income tax as much as high income tax earners are able to do. The average worker does not have the money to pay the financial consultants, accountants and lawyers to devise elaborate schemes to evade the Australian Taxation Office or work out elaborate salary packages with their employer. The average taxpayer cannot take advantage of the many tax effective products that are flagrantly and aggressively marketed.
This feeling that the benefits in our society are bestowed on a privileged few is borne out by recent studies that show the gap between rich and poor. The gap continues to extend. That is emphasised in a recent press release by ACOSS providing tax figures which show a divided Australia. This was released as recently as 17 March. The press release said that the figures lend weight to data that shows inequality is on the rise in Australia with the top 20 per cent of households receiving 50 per cent of private income and the bottom 20 per cent receiving only five per cent. I think the issue for many people is that they also see that some of the industries which get the most benefits from the taxpayers' dollar—I know this is the case in Western Australia—are often the ones that pay the least royalties tax and so on. People can see this. They do not have the figures in front of them all the time, but they can see that it is happening.
These bills take a small step towards addressing concerns relating to tax avoidance 
 at the big end of town. They mandate that employers must include the grossed up value of taxable fringe benefits totalling over $1,000 on group certificates. Previously, employers were only required to calculate fringe benefits tax on the combined amount of fringe benefits for all employees. These fringe benefits will not be subject to personal taxation; they will be included as income when calculating liability for the super surcharge, the Medicare levy surcharge, HECS repayments, child support and a raft of means tested social security entitlements such as family allowance and child-care assistance—and rightly so, in the opinion of the Greens (WA).
The Greens are highly supportive of the reportable fringe benefits scheme as it will certainly help to improve the integrity of the tax system and the social security system. Certainly it is the view of tax experts that this new system will have the desired effect of minimising the rorts that can be obtained via salary packaging. It addresses the use of salary packaging to avoid super surcharge and levies and to assess rebates to which employees would not otherwise be entitled on the basis of their total remuneration. The main group of individuals affected by this measure are those on salaries between $50,000 and $75,000 who have a company car or other popular type of fringe benefit. While they are on the top tax rate and may pay the Medicare levy surcharge, they avoid the super surcharge that is phased in when the adjusted taxable income is $75,856 with a maximum 15 per cent surcharge kicking in above $92,111.
For employers, this measure will undoubtedly increase compliance costs. There will be many things that require monitoring that are not currently monitored by employers. While some things will be relatively easy to track, some other elements such as the private use of pool cars, sales staff vehicles, employee use of corporate boxes at sporting events and office Christmas parties may be harder to monitor to allocate the value of the fringe benefit. Employees will also have increased compliance costs as they will have to ensure that employers have correctly reported their fringe benefits.
The Australian Taxation Office compliance costs will also be on the up as they will have to match reportable fringe benefits and group certificates issued by employers with the fringe benefits tax returns of employers. Forms and computer programs will need alteration and training will have to be provided. In addition, it is likely that there will be a number of appeals against assessments of various surcharges and levies by employees. The government has indicated that, in the future, the reportable fringe benefits amounts will be used in determining a person's entitlement to government benefits, so there will also be a spill-over effect on the administration of the Department of Family and Community Services.
As with all policy measures, it is necessary to weigh up the costs and benefits. While the increased compliance costs are clearly not insignificant, the Greens believe this negative is largely offset by a number of factors. First, there are monetary gains in the reduction of revenue leakage and, secondly, a reduction in tax minimisation opportunities will increase confidence in the integrity of the tax system as a whole as the tax system will be viewed as more fair and equitable.
The Greens are, however, concerned about the limited consultation that has been undertaken on this measure. Significant concerns have been expressed by representatives of the accounting profession, industry bodies, charitable institutions and the taxation profession. Primarily, these concerns relate to the short amount of time for employers to implement the new system by the commencement date of 30 April 1999—that is, this financial year. Indeed, a number of lobby groups have urged the government to delay the FBT changes proposed in the two connected bills until April 2000. Although employers will have to record fringe benefits information from April this year, of course, they will not have to actually report fringe benefits on group certificates until April 2000. It seems that the commonsense approach would be that the next financial year would be a much more sensible approach for the start-up. The compliance costs issue was also raised and it is noted that these concerns have been 
 addressed in part by excluding car parking benefits and benefits that constitute meal entertainment from this measure.
One of the major concerns that the Greens have with this bill is that those institutions and employers that are currently FBT exempt will be required to report fringe benefits on group certificates. This includes public benevolent institutions such as charities. Around 23,000 public benevolent institutions and live-in residential care workers are exempt from FBT at present—and that comes from section 57A or section 58 of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986. This is a significant number.
The major concern that the Greens have is compliance costs for these organisations and individuals. These organisations will have a proportionately higher increase in compliance costs than small, medium or large businesses. This is because previously PBIs have not had to report at all and thus would not have had a complex reporting system in place to comply with FBT liabilities. While they would have records for their own internal management structure, it would be unnecessary to go into immense detail. In addition, FBT liable employers are required to keep records for five years and explain all transactions and other acts engaged in by the employer or any other person which are relevant to ascertaining the employer's liability under this act.
Whilst it is acknowledged that there have been some problems in the community sector in relation to salary packaging, in the main salary packaging is used by PBIs to give them a competitive advantage in the labour market and to allow them to offer their employees some semblance of reasonable salary, enabling them to attract a high standard of employees. Here we have the irony. The broader issue is the increase in compliance costs for the community sector that is associated with the rest of the ANTS package. There was overwhelming evidence throughout the GST committee process on the impact of the GST on compliance costs for the community sector. This is one of the problems about putting this in a piecemeal fashion rather than debating it all at once. We 
 have raised similar concerns in the past in relation to the Ralph committee.
Many in the community sector will be tax collectors for the government under their ANTS package. Many will have to set up a range of systems where they will have to deal with complex definitions of what amounts to a charitable activity and what does not. There are the same arguments that the government and many food and grocery retailers are using to say that food should not be GST free. Why are we listening to it in relation to some sectors—and that is fair enough—but not to others? The grocers say that any use of definitions makes the compliance costs skyrocket. Yet we know that there will be a whole range of definitions in what is GST free and what is not for charitable institutions and other nonprofit organisations. This is a huge concern for many of these institutions and one that the government should take seriously. Why do they close their ears to the community and open them only to business on these issues?
What concerns me is that the government have targeted the community and not-for-profit sectors, environment groups and so on as able to bear these costs. It seems it is a very effective way of making life difficult for the community sector. We know that on a number of occasions there have been changes to legislation which effectively say, `Government—bad, community—bad and private—good.' This is the kind of Orwellian mantra that the government seem to be operating on: somehow or other the community sector is not as good as the private sector. They seem to think, `If we can just penalise the community sector enough, we will give that nice private sector the advantages they need in order to do what they do most effectively, that is, make money and profit.' There is something wrong in that logic and I think many people in the community have worked it out.
What are the priorities of this government? The taxation changes are very indicative of where their priorities lie. The government are very concerned about compliance costs for small business—for instance, the car parking issue that we just dealt with in Taxation Laws Amendment Bill No. 2 and setting up the 
 Small Business Deregulation Tax Force. This is certainly a legitimate concern and, indeed, the Greens (WA) have been highly concerned about small business and the compliance costs associated with small business, especially considering that small business is one of the strongest drivers of employment in Australia today. Often, when large corporations get benefits in terms of competitive advantage on trade issues, it is the Greens who have been standing up for small business and the impacts on it.
The point is that the government are exceptionally sympathetic to the concerns of business, and especially large business. They have used the red tape argument with force on numerous occasions in relation to decreasing corporate governance provisions; for instance, with the Managed Investments Bill there was less transparency and fewer checks and balances for investors—the mums and dads of Australia.
When the community sector wants to use the red tape argument, the government do not blink an eyelid. Extra compliance costs put an exceptional burden on this sector, which is often based on voluntary assistance. This sector is often the least equipped to deal with compliance costs. As I said, it is partly staffed by volunteers, it is scrimping for money and time, and it has lost a significant amount of government funding over the last term of the coalition. It is also a sector which often has to collect the problems the government have created. When the government create social problems, the community sector is left, often, to pick up the pieces.
Similarly, we have seen the complexity of administration in relation to social security as the government have attempted to crack down on welfare cheats. In addition, we see the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, Senator Minchin, publicly going in to bat for the resources industry, when they have got a whiff that their accelerated depreciation provision may be in jeopardy. But what do we see from the minister, or from the Minister for the Environment and Heritage or from the Minister for Health and Aged Care? Hello, are you there? Are these people also in cabinet fighting for the people they are meant 
 to be representing and for the issues and values they are meant to be representing?
The Greens welcome the government's initiative to counter tax avoidance. This bill attempts to tackle the salary packaging aspect that has been exploited in the past; however, we have a major concern about the government's general apathy in tackling some of the biggest issues in tax avoidance in Australia.
The issues in relation to the free trade agenda are some of the biggest we have faced in our history. One of the biggest challenges that faces Australia and the world is the ability of transnational companies, their contractors and their skilled employees to massively avoid tax. This is done by exploiting differences between national tax regimes and by using tax havens to hide their true financial position from the tax office. Electronic funds transfer is facilitating this massive leak from national tax revenues elsewhere. A government with a real commitment to cracking down on tax avoidance will be talking about the tough decisions that need to be taken to curb this kind of revenue leakage.
Let us look at the free trade agenda linkage. The government are trumpeting the fact that Australia is leading the world in bringing down tariff and non-tariff barriers. They have unilaterally reduced these rates, often to the detriment of many Australian industries and communities, and yet they shy away from being international leaders in progressive policy areas such as the Tobin tax, other international regulations of capital flows or strong stances on human rights, on the basis that Australia is just a middle power.
For the benefit of those who do not know, a Tobin tax is looking at a tax on international speculative transactions—things like currency transactions that are happening on an immense scale. Even our own banks admit that they are doing much more business on the international market than they are doing on the domestic market. But what is the actual tax benefit that is coming to the countries whose citizens are involved in these transactions? Very little. The reason is that they are not controlled by any tax regime. Australia should be in there leading on this issue. 
The government is exceptionally reticent to deal with these issues; indeed, the government is actively interested in making it easier for transnationals to enter Australia and receive concessional treatment. Of course, Australia was there with the rest of the countries willing to sign the Multilateral Agreement on Investment, where corporations have been thwarted, just for the moment, in their race to the bottom. But the MAI moves forums and they are still negotiating in other forums for some sort of `in-principle' decision for countries to sign up voluntarily.
We do support the principle of the bill, but we will be particularly watching the government's treatment of the community sector in the upcoming tax debate. It is simply not good enough that you single out a sector of the Australian economy, such an important sector of the Australian community—that is, the not-for-profit sector, the community sector—that holds together many of the aspects of the community that are being singularly attacked by this government. It is simply not good enough for the government to use tax to attack these sectors and that it is not listening to their legitimate concerns in terms of compliance costs.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS REPORTING) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Kemp, Sen Rod",LP,1999-03-24,"—I would like to thank all the participants in the debate on these new tax measures. These are important bills and it is appropriate that the debate be taken seriously, and that has happened. As highlighted in this debate, these bills are the first of the bills of the government's tax reform package to be brought before this chamber.
The fringe benefits tax provisions are being amended to make the system fairer for all taxpayers. From the 1999-2000 income year, group certificates will show the full value of fringe benefits received when taxable value exceeds $1,000. These benefits will be taken into account when liability for surcharges and eligibility for assistance are being determined.
I would like to foreshadow that the amendments already circulated to honourable senators will be moved by the government, and these amendments will result in a significant reduction in compliance costs for employers. I would also like to foreshadow that the 
 government will not be supporting the amendments moved by the Democrats or the Greens. These amendments, we understand, focus on such issues as the superannuation surcharge, HECS, and compliance costs for charities. There should be, in our view, no concern about these bills applying to the 1999-2000 financial year. The policy underlying the bills was announced in the ANTS document in August last year. The legislation was introduced in December 1998, giving time for preparation for the measures. The government also moved to pass the bills prior to the commencement of the FBT year to allow certainty, and acknowledges the support of the Senate in allowing this to occur.
A number of issues were raised in the debate, particularly by the speakers for the Democrats and the Greens. These will be debated at length during the committee stage of the bill. As I said, I thank all honourable senators for their contribution.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
Bills read second time.
Motion (by Senator Kemp) agreed to:
That consideration of these bills in the Committee of the Whole be made an order of the day for a later hour of the day.",SENATE,<title>A NEW TAX SYSTEM (FRINGE BENEFITS REPORTING) BILL 1998</title>,<title>Second Reading</title>,Bills,2,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-03-24,"—I do want to speak in general terms and perhaps allow those who are participating in the debate to gather their thoughts and their papers and perhaps even enter the chamber. I think I can probably win this debate at the moment, because I am not sure that Senator Kemp knows an awful lot about it and, despite my own inadequacies, I might just be able to sneak through on this 
 one! I did want to point out that, as I understand it, the running schedule that we have may not include some amendments that Senator Harradine had foreshadowed he might move, and so I am not sure of the status of those. It would be useful to clarify, when Senator Harradine is available, whether those amendments are being proposed; and, if they could be added to the running schedule in the correct place, that would certainly be helpful. I have just been handed an amended running schedule, but it seems to be dated at an earlier time than the one I already had, so I am not sure if that is helpful.
—I believe it is not yet up to date, Senator Evans, if you would like to keep—
—I just noted that the one that is being circulated is actually even older than the one I have in my hand, so I did not know if that was going to be helpful.
—The one I am working off is today's 9.28 a.m. one.
—I had a 9.47 a.m. version already. I am not sure whether they are different, but I will check that in a minute. As I say, there is the issue of whether Senator Harradine is proposing amendments; if so, they obviously need to be included in the running sheet, as a preliminary matter.
—Senator Harradine's amendments have arrived and have just been circulated.
—Right. I have a copy now of Senator Harradine's amendments, but obviously we need to look at where they fit in on the running sheet. The other thing I was going to suggest, Madam Chair, is that the debate would be facilitated by the Democrats' first amendment, regarding the issue of the removal of the minister's power to approve premium increases, being moved first. As I understand it, the Democrats' position is, if you like, the stronger critique of the government's position, and I think the debate would be enhanced if in fact the Democrat amendment were moved first and the Labor Party amendment moved subsequently.
If the Democrat amendment is carried, then the Labor Party amendment will lapse. It is our intention to vote for the Democrat amendment and so, for the purposes of an orderly debate, we ought to actually deal with the Democrat amendment first. As I say, if that is carried, then one or two of the Labor amendments actually become redundant, and it would allow us to have one debate rather than three or four debates that way. So I would suggest to the chair that, rather than have me move the first opposition amendment, the Democrat amendment regarding the regime for ministerial approval of premiums should be moved first, and that we should use that as the vehicle for the debate on that issue and then move to the votes. That way, we would not have to have the debate more than once.
—Senator Evans, for my edification can you advise me which Democrat amendment you are referring to when you say that it should be moved first?
—It is the one to clause 2, and it is about halfway down the first page.
—No. 3, is it?
—It is the fourth amendment on the running sheet, clause 2, Democrats 1 and 2, sheet 1286. I think that is the relevant amendment. Someone should correct me, if that is not right.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-03-24,"—The suggestion that has been made by Senator Evans is eminently sensible. The amendments that I am proposing have in fact been sent to all parties, and they are actually on the desks at the present moment. Why they are not on the running sheet, I do not know, but I believe that that is being attended to right now.
—They had only just arrived in the chamber, and were only circulated just prior to your arrival in the chamber.
—Yes, but they were sent prior to that to the representatives of the various parties who are going to speak in this debate. I reiterate that the proposal put by Senator Evans, if satisfactory to Senator Lees, would be a desirable way to go.
—Senator Lees, have you been following this, and are you ready to speak?",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1999-03-24,"—In fact, what I should be doing is actually moving my last amendment, amendment No. 5, because amendments Nos 1 and 2 are subject to that passing, and they fall if it does not pass.
—We are in the hands of the committee. What do you wish to do, Senator Lees?
—Perhaps I could help the committee by moving my amendment No. 5, which would basically mean that the minister will remain responsible for any increases in premiums.
—You are moving that schedule 3, page 19, line 2 to page 23, line 29 be opposed. The question is that schedule 3 stand as printed. Are you going to speak to that, Senator Lees?
—I did cover it in my speech, but I will go over it very briefly. With the amount of public funds—some $1.6 billion per year—going into private health insurance, either the current minister or whoever it may be in the future cannot walk away from having direct input into the actual cost of private health insurance. I do not think it can be handed over, either in part or in full, to the industry itself. The debate would be completely different if we did not have such a large amount of public money now going into this insurance product. It is an insurance industry that does need to be closely monitored and, in particular, the very price sensitive nature of its policies is the minister's responsibility.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-03-24,"—I wish to indicate, on behalf of the Labor opposition, that we will be supporting this amendment. We have grave concerns about the government's proposal that ministerial approval of health insurance premium increases be deregulated. We have a series of amendments which seek to protect the public interest on the issue of premium increases proposed, but we think that the 
 Democrats proposal is stronger and better. If that can find support in the Senate chamber, then we are happy to see that occur.
If that did not occur, then we would seek to move our amendments, which at least try to provide some control over the government's deregulation and find a middle ground. But the principal issue, which is outlined in the Democrats amendment, is the one that we support—that the minister continue to have the ability to approve or not approve increases in private health insurance premiums.
One can argue about how successful this has been over time. I think it is fair to say that it may not have been the most successful measure in controlling the premiums and the direction of policy adopted by private health insurance organisations. Senator Lees makes the point quite rightly, and I tried to emphasise this in my speech during the second reading debate, that we have just invested a huge amount of public funds in this industry—$1.7 billion of Australian taxpayers' funds. We have effectively bought a 30 per cent share of the private health insurance industry. We have taken a 30 per cent option in private health insurance. This is not the time for us to say, having made that massive investment, that we want to remove the Commonwealth's ability to monitor and effectively control movements in prices and the premiums charged.
It is ludicrous to suggest that, on the one hand, you want to make a massive investment in an industry and, on the other hand, you wish to downgrade your effective influence on and control over that industry. It is vital at this point that we resist the government's attempt to walk away from political responsibility for premium increases in the private health insurance industry. It may well be that there are better public policy options available in terms of providing effective public influence over what occurs in the pricing of private health insurance, but clearly this is not the time to be walking away from the Commonwealth's involvement in this process. It is clearly not the time for us to be loosening our influence on an industry in which we have made such a massive investment.
The opposition will be supporting the Democrats amendment. If that is defeated, we would obviously seek to move our amendments, which are aimed at ensuring at least some effective government control in the short term and resisting the push to full deregulation, as proposed by the government in its third phase. At this time the Democrats proposition is a much better one and that ought to be supported by the Senate.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-03-24,"—There is no doubt whatsoever that the government have used what they believe to be the connection between the cost of private health insurance and the availability of the public health system throughout this inquiry. They said the reason that they were putting so much public money into the 30 per cent rebate was that this would have an immediate impact on reducing the pressures on the public health system. That was the reason that public money was going into this rebate through the tax system. They said that they were robbing Peter to pay Paul because this was going to be good for the public health system.
It makes no sense, and the government is left with no credibility whatsoever, if they then remove themselves from any oversight of the costs of private health insurance after having put so much public funding into reducing the premiums—temporarily it would seem. It has been argued that there is nothing to stop increases in the future, which will erode all or almost all of the 30 per cent. Indeed we know that many people did not get the full benefit of the 30 per cent.
We know that the government is using public funding, so this issue is one of public funding. We have just put public funding into this sector, so there is no way you can say that this is just a private matter and that this is just the private sector dealing with private issues. It is not; it is dealing with an issue that the government have said is intricately linked—whether they are to be believed or not is up to judgment now—to the pressures on the public health system.
Many people have argued that this was a tenuous connection, but the government argued this. If they are then saying that they 
 no longer need to look at what the cost of private health insurance will be or that they no longer need to have a direct influence over that, that is a bizarre statement. Quite frankly, it would be totally irresponsible in terms of accountability if the government turned their backs so quickly on this sector. It is simply not good enough. From the Greens (WA) point of view this is one of the most vital issues in relation to this particular legislative package. We will certainly be supporting the Democrats in removing this particular element of the bill.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1999-03-24,"—The long-term view of the government is that the only people who should decide the premiums that may be charged by a health fund are the managers and board of directors of that fund. These people, as is the case with all business activities, would be either rewarded or chastened for their decision. Ultimately, health fund members will decide whether the health insurance product is worth buying.
The government is acutely aware of the extremely difficult circumstances that health funds find themselves in at the moment. In addition, the government has not forgotten the behaviour of the health funds after the introduction of the private health insurance incentive scheme. The 30 per cent private health insurance rebate is designed to assist in the stabilisation of health fund premiums insofar as increased membership levels take financial pressure off the funds.
However, until that premium stability arrives, the government will, either through the department or through the Private Health Insurance Administrative Council, continue to closely scrutinise the premium rule changes made by health funds. Only at that time will the health insurance industry be able to escape the premium rule change scrutiny. The ACCC will continue to have a role in ensuring that premium increases are appropriate.
The transfer of these functions to the Private Health Insurance Administrative Council will make its role more consistent with other government regulatory prudential organisations and regulatory bodies in general 
 insurance. These changes in no way limit the government's primary responsibility as a policy maker. Therefore we will not be agreeing with the amendment of the Democrats on this particular matter.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-03-24,"—The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission actually have their hands tied in some respects in relation to the oversight of something like a health insurance body. The reason they have their hands tied is that they are dealing with the current Trade Practices Act. The current Trade Practices Act is limited as to whether or not something illegal is being done in order to collude to increase prices. This is very difficult to prove, as the minister may well know. In the issue of public interest it becomes an issue of competitiveness. It is defined in its own terms.
Saying that the ACCC now becomes our protection for the already large amounts of public money that are being put into this sector is not good enough. I am really keen now to see what Senator Harradine's response is to this because it is a vital issue of accountability in relation to the spending of very, very large amounts of money on the private health sector. I am really keen to see where the Senate will be going on this issue.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-03-24,"—Of course I am supporting Senator Lees's amendments for the simple reason that those amendments will ensure that the government remains accountable for administration of health insurance premiums. I think accountability of government in this area of major public policy is essential. I really cannot see the logic in the government's schedule 3. It just does not work out, to my way of thinking, in any event. Too much, I believe, is left to industries at the present moment. There is not enough government accountability in many areas. I will be dealing with some of those areas in other measures. I will certainly be supporting Senator Lees's amendment.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-03-24,"—I ask a point of clarification on Democrats amendment No. 3. The Greens (WA) reading of the situation is that the section of the bill which the amendment deals with relates to removing waiting periods for people having health insurance. Amendment (3) reads:
"", provided that any action under this subsection that results in the extension of a waiting period applicable to a contributor or his or her dependent for an ailment, illness or condition . . . is prescribed in accordance with subsection (3)"".
The section relates to removing the waiting period, and the Democrats are asking that it not impact on the waiting period. I am wondering whether that is making as little sense to other people as it does to me. I am happy for the matter to be clarified.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1999-03-24,"—That is why the two amendments need to be taken together. Basically, we are saying that the minister must take into account the actual impact of extending waiting periods on specific groups of people. It cannot just be done because a fund asks for it to be done. The minister has to look for some evidence that relevant illnesses and conditions are being subjected to the `hit and run' problems, which is the reason that the minister is saying that we need this in the first place.
We propose that amendment No. 3 be inserted at schedule 1, item 6, page 9 so that the regulations for the purpose of this subsection in respect of an ailment, illness or condition must not be made unless the minister has taken into account the following matters—and 
 then you read through what has to be taken into account. This means that a fund cannot say, `Right, we want a waiting period on a particular procedure because it's a very expensive procedure.' There actually must be some evidence that there really is a `hit and run' problem; that the funds are suffering; that it is not reasonable.
We have also asked that the impact on the public health system be looked at so that the funds cannot use waiting periods to push people back into the public health system just because it is an expensive procedure. There must be genuine reasons for these waiting periods to be put in place.
—Is it the wish of the committee that leave be granted to move amendments (3) and (4) together? There being no objection, it is so ordered.

"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1999-03-24,"—Generally the government agrees with these 
 particular amendments; however, we do believe that Democrat amendment (4) needs a further amendment to add a subclause (d) at the end which would give the minister the ability to take into account other matters that are important in this issue.

"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-03-24,"—In my speech in the second reading debate I pointed out a matter of rather serious concern to a number of people and it relates to a number of individuals, particularly the elderly and the chronically ill, who purchase health insurance as an assurance that their access to essential care and treatment will not be hampered. I want to be convinced that the legislation does not place barriers to this access, but I fear that it could indeed place barriers to that access by not clarifying the nature and scope of cover in areas of palliative care, rehabilitation and psychiatric care.
I ask Senator Tambling, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health and Aged Care: what assurances are in place to ensure that the self-employed, self-funded retirees 
 and the unemployed are not disadvantaged or charged relatively higher premiums so that other members can receive discounted premiums? That is not related to the amendment I am about to move, but before we get to that amendment I want to have that question clarified. Schedule 1 does allow registered organisations—the health funds—to offer discounted premiums to contributors based on administrative savings. I believe that this could apply in respect of a package, an arrangement made between a large conglomerate or organisation and a health fund. If, for example, a very large company was able to make administrative savings the health fund could make an arrangement with the company which provided for the subscriptions to be less.
I want to find out from the government how this is likely to affect the self-funded retirees. I have been going through the length and breadth of Australia on the ANTS package and the taxation measures, and this whole question of self-funded retirees has raised its head. The question of compensation for them under that particular package has arisen, and it is disconcerting. I sometimes feel that self-funded retirees are becoming a forgotten race. My view is that that is totally unfair. Here is a group of people who have decided, for one reason or another, to retire before the normal age of retirement and they have taken action to ensure that their circumstances are such that they will not be a burden on the taxpayer. Yet under that particular measure—I know it is just a passing thing—these people will not get any compensation, yet they are doing a lot for employment in this country. One of the problems of unemployment is that there are more people seeking paid work than there are jobs available. Instead of giving a bonus for people to stay at work longer after 65, you ought to be giving a bonus to the people who decide to retire. Those are very often the self-funded retirees.
I want to know, in respect of these particular people and the health of these people, what assurances are in place to ensure that the self-employed, self-funded retirees and indeed the unemployed are not disadvantaged or charged relatively higher premiums so that 
 other members of the fund can receive discounted premiums.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1999-03-24,"—The issues raised by Senator Harradine's amendments are important. His amendments seek to ensure that older people and people with chronic illnesses are not restricted in their access to private health insurance. It is also important in this context to note, from the submission of the Australian Consumers Association to the Senate committee:
The consumer association supports the general intent of the bill which will increase the flexibility in what health funds can cover in their policies and allow loyalty bonuses based only on the length of membership, not number of claims, which reaffirms the government's commitment to community rating.
This issue is very important because in the bill itself community rating is reinforced by the bill. Community rating means that a health fund cannot discriminate against a person on the basis of age, sex, sexuality, illness, frequency of service usage and the level of benefits paid. However, it is possible to uphold community rating whilst also taking advantage of the efficiencies offered by new technology.
Under this legislation, a health fund is only able to offer a discount where they can demonstrate that the discount has arisen from the management savings they have made. The aim of the exercise is to encourage more efficiently managed funds without harming community rating. Our legislation meets that objective. I do not believe that the Australian public views the offering of a modest discount as being a threat to community rating. The point should also be made that groups other than employee groups can take advantage of the administrative savings. The examples that have been given to me are the CWA, pensioner groups, Rotary or bowling clubs.
Senator Harradine's amendments are appropriate in policy terms. However, they do not distinguish between people with pre-existing ailments and those with conditions that arise after a person has joined a health fund. Current policy and intended future policy is that people with pre-existing ailments are 
 required to wait for 12 months before benefits are paid in respect of their pre-existing condition. Consequently we would recommend that the amendment be supported with an additional amendment at the end of the proposed paragraph (ja), by inserting the words `except where the psychiatric care, palliative care or rehabilitation is in respect of a pre-existing ailment, illness or condition, as defined in paragraph (kc)'.
I understand that those words have been discussed between government advisers and Senator Harradine's office. They would address a number of these issues. The intent is to ensure that people with psychiatric conditions, palliative care requirements or rehabilitation requirements can obtain access to private health insurance without putting at risk the financial position of funds by requiring them to cover such people where psychiatric care, palliative care or rehabilitation requirements arise because of a person's pre-existing ailment—that is, where a person joins a health fund knowing that they need to have immediate access to psychiatric care, palliative care or rehabilitation. I would hope that these comments address the concerns of Senator Harradine. I propose to move that amendment to Senator Harradine's amendment.

—Is that in the form suggested by the parliamentary secretary?
—No, I am moving it as it is at the present moment and then I will go to that other matter. I move:
(1)	 Schedule 1, item 9, page 9 (line 21), after ""subparagraph (ka)(i)"", insert ""or paragraph (ja)"".
(2)	 Schedule 1, page 10 (after line 7), after item 9, insert:
9A  After paragraph (j) of Schedule 1
	 Insert:
	 (ja)	 where the rules of the organization provide for a waiting period with respect to contributors for benefits in accordance with an applicable benefits arrangement of the organization and the benefits are in relation to psychiatric care, palliative care or rehabilitation, that waiting period will not exceed 2 months.
In effect, I am suggesting that you insert a new paragraph (ja). As indicated in my speech in the second reading debate, I am proposing those particular amendments to really ensure that changes to the health insurance legislation do not alter the existing waiting period for people seeking psychiatric care, palliative care or rehabilitation.
I have mentioned on a number of occasions that health insurance for many elderly, chronically ill and vulnerable people is purchased to assure them of timely access to essential care, and I do not want to see any government amendments to the legislation that will put in place barriers to that access. In its present form and as things presently stand, there is potential for health funds to limit access to palliative care, psychiatric care and rehabilitation. It is the responsibility of the parliament and indeed of the government to guarantee that the weakest in our community are not disadvantaged any further.
I am moving those particular amendments in their current form. What the government has proposed is an addendum which, I now see, says `except where the psychiatric care, 
 palliative care and rehabilitation is in respect of a pre-existing ailment, illness or condition as defined in paragraph (kc)'. I too would like to hear a further explanation by the minister of that. It may well be that the government may wish to move an amendment to my proposition.
I think that the government does have a point in respect of other areas, but this says `except where the psychiatric care, palliative care and rehabilitation is in respect of a pre-existing ailment, illness or condition as defined. . . '. I suppose being in the parliament—in the Senate—for a huge number of years might lead one to develop a condition which at a particular stage could manifest itself in a way that requires psychiatric care. It does really come down to the point that Senator Margetts makes: what if the condition is not diagnosed prior to membership of the fund? I would be happy to hear an elaboration of the definition which is in paragraph (kc).",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1999-03-24,"—It is important to look carefully at the amendment that I am proposing to Senator Harradine's amendment because the government amendment will maintain the status quo, which is most important to preserve in this issue. We are concerned that, whilst we support the tenor of Senator Harradine's amendment, as it stands it could in fact militate against assisting the very people that Senator Harradine is addressing.
When Senator Margetts raised the issue, I did not have handy at the time the clause to which I think we should be referring. The government's foreshadowed amendment refers to paragraph (kc) of the act. Let me read that paragraph. It says:
For the purposes of paragraph (k), a pre-existing ailment is an ailment, illness or condition the signs or symptoms of which, in the opinion of a medical practitioner appointed by the organisation, existed at any time during the 6 months preceding the day on which the contributor began contributions to the organisation for:
(i) benefits in accordance with the applicable benefits arrangement referred to in that paragraph; or    

(ii) if applicable, benefits in accordance with the previous benefits arrangement referred to in paragraph (ka).
We could probably go around in a circle here between all these various subparagraphs. I appreciate it is often a lawyer's nightmare to do the tracking, but I think we are of the same mind in seeking to assist the people to whom Senator Harradine has rightly drawn our attention who are in the situation of requiring psychiatric care, palliative care or rehabilitation. I believe we are trying to finetune the amendment in such a way as to assist those particular people, yet, at the same time, recognise that we ought not impose on the health funds financial impositions that could almost, in effect, send them broke.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-03-24,"—I am not sure that the minister's explanation has made me feel more at ease. I am concerned that paragraph (kc) will require that individuals become their own diagnosticians: if they have signs or symptoms of an ailment, somehow or other, even before they know enough about it, they are supposed to know that they have an ailment which requires treatment. One of the issues that springs to mind is breast lumps. In many situations there are women who have breast lumps due to a variety of causes. For some women over the age of 35 this can mean that they are aware of the fact that they have had a breast lump in the past or have a series of breast lumps which are benign. If it could be proven that a lump was obvious, or could have been obvious in the past, and was not one of those other benign lumps which they had, what then becomes the use of that definition?
The issue of mental illness is one that, in many cases, may be obvious to other people but is not necessarily obvious to the person who requires treatment. Sometimes people need to put a level of careful pressure on a person to seek treatment. It may be obvious to a professional or to other people that a person needs to seek help but it may not in any way be obvious or evident to the person who is suffering from that mental illness or other kind of illness. I think we have a problem in inserting paragraph (kc) because, in the end, it will put pressure on people 
 somehow or other to be their own diagnosticians.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-03-24,"—I indicate on behalf of the opposition that it was our intention to vote for Senator Harradine's amendments. It is still our intention to vote for his amendments. I am yet to be convinced by the government's argument and that is because I am not quite sure that I understand it. We need to be much clearer about what the government thinks it is achieving by this amendment.
I would have thought that Senator Harradine's amendments went to the question of waiting periods and that what is intended by that is quite clear. It seems the government amendment goes to the question of pre-existing conditions. I would have thought the current rules relating to pre-existing conditions would continue to be applied and not be affected by Senator Harradine's amendments. I may be completely wrong on this, but I do not get the point of the government's amendment. I have concerns about what it might mean. I suspect the government is going to need to do a bit better in explaining it if they hope to have it carried. Certainly, my current inclination is that I do not know what it means. I am not sure what the effect will be and on present indications, therefore, I would vote against it and press on with Senator Harradine's amendments. I think he has made the case quite clearly for them and we are prepared to support them.
As I say, I am not ruling out supporting the government amendment but I do remain to be convinced what the argument actually is and why the current pre-existing conditions rules would not continue to apply. As for the handwritten government amendment, I think it is going to require a clearer explanation for the opposition to be able to support it.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1999-03-24,"—It is very important to recognise that what we are seeking to do is maintain the status quo in respect of these issues. The pre-existing ailment clause has been in the act for a long time and is important in its 
 contribution. Senator Harradine's amendments, unamended by what we are proposing, would have the effect, I am advised, that they could trigger a situation where they would override that status quo for the people affected and could discriminate against them. Therefore, it would be important to have the amendment that we are proposing.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-03-24,"—Psychiatric care, palliative care and rehabilitation are very poorly funded in the public sector and access is very poor. These are areas of great importance and continuing importance to a lot of people. If we are going to be regarded as a caring society, we need to make sure that more resources are put into psychiatric and palliative care and rehabilitation. I have considered the parliamentary secretary's statements and he is right that this will go beyond the status quo. Originally I was not of that intention, but I think: why not go beyond the status quo in respect of these matters so that we do not have the situation where, as indicated by Senator Margetts, something was not diagnosed? Clearly, in some of these areas, we do have problems in that regard.
What I cannot understand is how the parliamentary secretary can say that some of these people will be discriminated against by what I am proposing. How is that? I certainly cannot see it, on the face of it, otherwise I would not have moved the amendments. The amendments, I would have thought, were fairly clear. As indicated by Senator Evans, it does go to the question of waiting periods. In some circumstances, the effect of the waiting periods on sufferers requiring this type of care is quite dramatic. I ask the parliamentary secretary directly what he meant when he suggested to the chamber that my amendments, unamended by what the government is proposing, will in some way discriminate against or disadvantage the people we are hoping to advance by these amendments.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1999-03-24,"—Senator Harradine is focusing very clearly on the group which he has identified as having particular and special needs. This also needs 
 to be considered in the context of other members of the funds and the effects the proposal would have on them, particularly with regard to the consequential flow-on that would necessarily have to be borne by the fund generally as well as the particular members of the fund. The fact that increased premiums for insurance would be inevitable, and could be substantial, does need to tax our attention very carefully. There is the debate between the issue of the pre-existing ailment and how that affects the other members of the fund and their conditions and also the effect that Senator Harradine's amendments, unamended, would have on the economic impact of all members of funds. It would have the effect of increasing premiums very substantially.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-03-24,"—That says something, doesn't it, about the way we look at psychiatric care, palliative care and rehabilitation. It is clear to me, and I think to everybody, that those areas of care are poorly funded. I must have misunderstood the parliamentary secretary. I thought he said that in some way these people would be discriminated against. They will not be, other than what the parliamentary secretary said about the general effect of such an amendment on premiums.
I have heard these things bandied about over the years in a number of areas. They say, `Oh, there'll be discrimination; there'll be disadvantage,' et cetera. We have just heard a broad statement by the parliamentary secretary that the amendment would require a substantial increase in fees. Where are the facts on that? Where are the facts on the care of people with psychiatric problems? Where are the facts on the costs of palliative care and rehabilitation? Have those been considered, as against the importance of attending to these problems in a timely fashion? As I indicated earlier, more and more people are needing palliative care and rehabilitation and, unfortunately, more people are needing psychiatric care.
I am quite deliberate in what I am proposing. I heard what Senator Evans said. Obviously it is a matter which he will have to consider further, as will the Democrats and Senator Margetts. Frankly, I can say that my 
 amendments go slightly beyond the status quo, but I would not have moved the amendments had I not been concerned about the wording of the schedule, which seemed to me to give an opening to the funds. I do not think we should give them a break on this.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1999-03-24,—The Democrats will be supporting Senator Harradine's original amendments. I have trouble with what the government is trying to do. We will be supporting Senator Harradine.,SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1999-03-24,"—We have taken note of the comments that have been raised and we have drawn on the comments that Senator Evans made in that regard. I have not formally moved or foreshadowed an amendment because of the way in which Senator Harradine introduced his amendments. I would like to set to one side what I have previously foreshadowed. I believe we would be able to have a better form of words if I were to add, by way of amendment to Senator Harradine's amendments, the words `subject to the pre-existing ailment rule in paragraph (kc),'. I believe that is more specific and acceptable. It recognises that this important matter does impinge on the important operations of the funds yet at the same time achieves the objectives of the groups for which Senator Harradine is rightly seeking to get special assistance. I therefore move:
At the end of paragraph (ja), add ""subject to the pre-existing ailment rule in paragraph (kc)"".",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-03-24,"—I do not think anything necessarily has occurred to change my position. My inclination is still to support Senator Harradine's amendment. I think that if there is a serious argument about an unintended consequence which the government wants to make, then perhaps Senator Harradine might agree to defer this to a later hour because we seem to be going around in circles without clarifying it. We would be concerned if there was an unintended consequence, but at the moment, if it comes to a vote, I think I would just vote for Senator Harradine's amendment.
I am not convinced by the government, but I understand that this has been legitimately put by the government. I do not know what Senator Harradine's view is, but it might be easier to adjourn this particular debate to a later hour and be clear what it is we are voting on. In the absence of that, I would be inclined to stick with my original position. I always take the view in these cases that the parliament ought not act in ignorance and, if there is a legitimate case that we might be creating a unintended consequence, then perhaps drawing back and thinking about that might be a worth while thing to do.
My instructions are, and my inclination is, just to support Senator Harradine's amendment at the moment. But, in terms of efficient legislation and proper functioning of the Senate, it might be useful to step back to make sure we understand what we are doing on this particular clause, deal with the rest of the bill and either deal with that at the end or come back later today or tomorrow to nut out this particular issue. At this stage, if we are pressing on I will be voting for Senator Harradine's amendment. I am still not clear what the government's case is.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1999-03-24,"—I am surprised that the Labor Party has not responded to that particular amendment that I put forward which I thought would have been acceptable. It is important to note that the intent of the amendment is to preserve the status quo.
Senator Harradine's amendment, as it is currently circulated in his name, will have the effect of increasing premiums and health contributions in this area. I think it is important to note that, if Senator Chris Evans, Senator Lees and Senator Harradine are of a mind to proceed in that area, they will be forcing up health insurance premiums.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-03-24,"—I would have thought Senator Chris Evans's suggestion was a responsible response to the government's amendment to my amendment. I do not know what our colleagues around the chamber feel. My feeling, subject to what they might say, is to seek 
 leave to have the clause deferred until a later hour of this day. But I would hope that the government has got a bit more to say about the matter than it has thus far. This threat of higher premiums et cetera can be pulled out of the hat at any time of the day just to frighten people off. I think there has been too much of that in this whole insurance industry debate. The insurance industry has a very substantial influence on health policy in this country; one might tend to say that it has got too much of an influence on the health policy of this country. Depending on what the Labor Party, the Democrats and the Greens might say, I would be happy to suggest its deferral. But, as I say, the government will need to come back with some solid figures.
—Could you move that way, Senator Harradine?
—I move:
That further consideration of the amendments be postponed.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-03-24,"—I indicate that I am inclined to support Senator Harradine's motion. I briefly was inclined not to press ahead after Senator Tambling's outburst. Those of us trying to bring a conciliatory approach to this issue to assist the government get out of the tangle it has got into feel that, if Senator Tambling wants to start issuing threats across the chamber, then he is going to end up with a very messy bill. I think he ought to take a look at himself before he starts that sort of behaviour. We are trying to assist the government. We currently are dealing with two handwritten notes from the government.
—This is a deferral motion. Therefore, there is no debate, Senator.
—Sorry.
—The question is that Senator Harradine's motion to defer this matter be agreed to.
Question resolved in the affirmative.
—We will now move to opposition amendments Nos 3 and 4.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-03-24,"—by leave—I move opposition amendments Nos 3 and 4:
(3)	 Schedule 1, item 20, page 13 (line 9), omit ""The Minister"", substitute ""Subject to subsection (4A), the Minister"".
(4)	 Schedule 1, item 20, page 13 (after line 10), after subsection (4), insert:
(4A)	 Guidelines made under subsection (4) must include a requirement for an approved procedures facility to be subject to accreditation and quality assurance procedures that are at least equivalent to the minimum accreditation and quality assurance procedures that apply to a day hospital facility or day procedure centre under State or Territory laws.
Opposition amendments Nos 3 and 4 effectively seek to establish a regime for minimum standards for office based surgery. A major element of this bill is to make provision for office based surgery and to provide for the funding arrangements for those procedures.
These amendments seek to ensure that the proposed approved facilities are required to meet at least the level of accreditation and quality assurance procedures that apply to day surgeries under state or territory law. This is intended to avoid the prospect that approved facilities could operate in a substandard fashion or enjoy an unfair economic advantage over day surgeries through neglect of standards which potentially could impact on patient safety.
The wording only requires that the minister include in the proposed guidelines a provision that the minimum standards for accreditation and quality assurance are not reduced. We are in fact setting the benchmark. There is no legal obligation on the minister if the state fails to enforce such standards, and it is not even required that every state has written standards in place, provided that the level of control over new approved facilities is not less than what applies to day surgeries. This ensures the government's favourite position of a level playing field and also ensures that new facilities do not enjoy an artificial commercial advantage over existing hospitals and day surgeries simply because they do not have to achieve the same levels of cleanliness and peer group oversight. There are, I think, very 
 good reasons, from a point of view of both competition and patient safety, why we ought to have a benchmark for these approved facilities in terms of the quality to be maintained in them.
I note that Senator Harradine also has amendments in this regard, and I also note that there is some suggestion on the running sheet that our amendments conflict with Senator Harradine's. I put the case that there is nothing contradictory in the two approaches. I think they go to the same concern. I am not sure what Senator Harradine's attitude is to our amendments, but essentially we have a view that we are going to vote for ours and for his, because it seems to me that our amendment seeks to set the minimum benchmark, which is that the standards be the same at the very least as those for the day surgeries, and that is an important platform to erect under the new arrangements for approved facilities.
As I understand Senator Harradine's amendments, they go to the question of quality protocols. We talk about quality assurance procedures and he talks about quality protocols, and it is a perfectly appropriate thing. He talks about annual utilisation reviews to be conducted by the Commonwealth. Again, we have no problem with that, although there is the question about whether the Commonwealth intends moving into that sort of role. As I understand it, it is traditionally a sort of inspection role done by the state system.
Anyway, I think our amendments and Senator Harradine's go to the same issue of ensuring that we have a minimum quality established, that public safety is ensured and that existing day surgeries do not face unfair competition as a result of our not ensuring that appropriate standards are met. So I would urge the Senate to support our amendments, but I just wanted to draw senators' attention to the fact that the note on the running sheet implies they are contradictory with Senator Harradine's amendments. I am not sure that they are, but other people may have other views.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1999-03-24,"—Firstly, we will be supporting these amend 
 ments. I think they are very important. I do not think anyone can argue against quality assurance procedures, and I do agree with Senator Evans that Senator Harradine's amendments are not in conflict. In Senator Harradine's amendments, clause (4A)(a) talks about the establishment of quality protocols. Senator Evans's amendments say that these protocols should be in line with what is currently applicable for day hospital facilities or day procedure centres under state or territory laws. So they are actually agreeing with Senator Harradine's clause (4A)(a) and taking it a step further by giving some details.
I ask the minister: I know we are not onto Senator Harradine's amendments yet, but I think we should be looking at both sets of amendments. With regard to annual utilisation reviews, is that a fairly simple process of simply looking at Medicare provider numbers as related to a particular facility? I understand that is something quite simple and the department should not have any problem with it.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1999-03-24,"—I appreciate the comments that Senator Evans has made, drawing attention to the overlap in the amendments proposed by the opposition and those proposed by Senator Harradine. The government is more inclined to support the amendments from Senator Harradine, as we believe that they more succinctly and correctly address the issues. The implementation phase of this bill has always envisaged wide consultation to ensure quality health and safety outcomes.
The Department of Health and Aged Care is currently undertaking discussions with state and territory governments on licensing issues, and the department has already had discussions with the Australian Day Surgery Council, who have agreed to assist the department in developing quality standards for approved procedures facilities. The government has been talking to Senator Harradine's office in this regard, and we think that, to address the issues just raised by Senator Lees, it will probably be more appropriate if we amend Senator Harradine's proposed amendment with suggested additional wording. I will 
 propose at a later stage that we add a clause (4A) reading:
Guidelines made under subsection (4) must include a requirement for an approved procedures facility to—
(a)	 comply with the relevant quality protocols; and
(b)	 provide annual utilisation data requested by the Commonwealth.
If that addition to Senator Harradine's amendments were agreeable to him, we would certainly be inclined to support them.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-03-24,"—I am getting a bit worried if the department of health is agreeing with an amendment that I am putting. I was about to rise after Senator Evans and indicate to him that I actually feel that the wording of the Labor Party's amendment is more direct and acceptable. As Senator Lees mentions, it is specific; it points to state legislation. As such I think it is far tighter than my amendment, which of course is trying to do pretty much the same thing.
—It still needs paragraph (b).
—Yes, thank you, Senator Lees. I cannot but agree with what Senator Lees says. We do need paragraph (b) of mine, because I really do not think the opposition's amendment goes far enough to satisfy proper scrutiny of the effect and benefit of those changes. My amendment seeks to do that. It requires that an annual utilisation review be conducted by the Commonwealth. As Senator Lees says, when that was drafted, it certainly did not appear to us to be overly onerous. It is an annual utilisation review. It means better transparency. If it is acceptable to Senator Evans, I will defer to his amendment, and suggest and request that he include my paragraph (b) in his current amendment. It simply says:
. . . annual utilisation reviews to be conducted by the Commonwealth.
I do not know how he or Senator Lees or Senator Margetts feels about that.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-03-24,"—I indicate—as I indicated earlier—that I have no difficulty with Senator Harradine's amendments. I think there was a 
 question of duplication and that having the two together might have left a bit of muddled thinking. So I think what he proposed is probably a better total outcome. If that is the general view in the Senate, we would be pleased to add to our amendment (4) the sentence about annual utilisation reviews being conducted by the Commonwealth that was included in Senator Harradine's amendments. That probably makes the most cohesive outcome of the joint intent, provided that is acceptable to the chamber. I take your guidance as to how we do that procedurally. I thank Senator Harradine for his contribution and take your guidance, Mr Temporary Chairman. If I need to do that by moving it as an amendment to my amendment, I will do so. I seek leave to include that sentence as an addition to our amendment (4).
Leave granted.
—I therefore move amendment (4), as amended:
(4)	 Schedule 1, item 20, page 13 (after line 10), after subsection (4), insert:
(4A)	 Guidelines made under subsection (4) must include a requirement for an approved procedures facility to be subject to accreditation and quality assurance procedures that:
	 (a) 	 are at least equivalent to the minimum accreditation and quality assurance procedures that apply to a day hospital facility or day procedure centre under State or Territory laws; and
	 (b)	 include annual utilisation reviews to be conducted by the Commonwealth.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1999-03-24,"—There are a number of issues on this clause that I think may need to be deferred and addressed, because the matter could get further complicated by the particular issues of where we are cutting and pasting here between the various areas. For example, in the amendments proposed by the Labor Party, under (4A) there is the statement:
. . . to the minimum accreditation and quality assurance procedures that apply to a day hospital facility or day procedure centre under State or Territory laws. 

There is, as we know, a considerable degree of inconsistency at the moment between state and territory laws. This could therefore further exacerbate the problem. We are keen to get a consistency and a uniformity in this area that I think the amendments being proposed in this regard by the opposition will further complicate. Similarly, I know that Senator Evans just picked up a suggested phrase from Senator Harradine to add to the Labor Party's proposed clause (4A). I would propose that the words I had indicated earlier would be more appropriately added to Senator Harradine's more acceptable amendment to us, which added the words:
Guidelines made under section (4) must include a requirement for an approved procedures facility to
(a) comply with relevant quality protocols, and
(b) provide annual utilisation data requested by the Commonwealth.
We would maintain that that would be more appropriately added to the opposition amendment than the words picked up by taking and borrowing from Senator Harradine's amendment.
I also pose the question to Senator Harradine as to whether, subject to the outcome of the opposition amendments, he would be intending to continue with the amendments he had previously placed before us or whether he is intending to withdraw them. I think it is important to know.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1999-03-24,"—Is Senator Tambling suggesting that the accreditation and quality control procedures in some states, in their day hospital facilities or their day procedure facilities, are not adequate? If that is the case, surely that is an issue that the minister should be actively dealing with at the moment. With due respect to Senator Harradine—and I do not want to suggest, in any way, that when he drew up the amendment he even thought of it—if we just leave a general quality protocol out there, we could end up with the lowest common denominator.
I think we have to have some faith in what the state and territories are doing and slot this new facility option in. If we then have questions, we should take it very seriously, because it would obviously mean that their day 
 surgery facilities are not up to standard and that their procedure facilities generally need to be checked and, if necessary, standardised across the country.
I have major problems with us simply moving an amendment here today that just talks about quality protocols, with no ability for us to say what they are, whether they are the lowest or indeed the best. I think it is too vague for us to let through this place.
—Senator Lees, I think at this stage we have the situation where Senator Harradine thinks that the opposition's amendments are better than his, but the government thinks that Senator Harradine's are better than theirs. Perhaps we should take a bit of one and a bit of the other and mix it all up and make it something else. I do not know where we are at the moment. We seem to have all of these different changes coming. Perhaps you might be able to help us.
—I understood that we are now debating Senator Evans's composite amendment. The composition is that Senator Evans's amendment is effectively part (a), which actually gives us some specifics as to what this quality control is. Part (b) has been lifted from Senator Harradine's amendment and that talks about the reviews conducted by the Commonwealth. How the Commonwealth wants to conduct these, I do not know. It may be that they are going to require some input; it may be that they attach a Medicare tag on these procedures so that they can simply read it off their statistics. How the Commonwealth gets this information is surely over to them, but I think it is important that today we ask that those utilisation reviews be the responsibility of the Commonwealth.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-03-24,"—I rise to indicate that I support handling the issue in the way that has been suggested by Senator Evans—that is, we deal with an amended Labor amendment. I also indicate that I share the concerns that have been expressed that, with any of the states that have gone to the trouble of getting a higher standard of day surgery, the people in those states may be singled out for poorer treatment than they currently have, and that 
 they may be under pressure to accept poorer standards than exist, if we go along with Senator Tambling's rather odd suggestion that somehow we cannot suggest that the standards that exist in the states and territories are the ones that ought to be complied with. What the minister has said makes no real sense in terms of patient care. I am prepared to accept the approach taken by Senator Evans. I certainly accept the amendment, as amended by Senator Harradine's amendment.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-03-24,"—It is clear to me, and I would think it is clear to the whole of the Senate, that the proposition that has been put forward by Senator Evans really improves the position. My amendment about the establishment of quality protocols says:
Guidelines made under subsection (4) must include a requirement for an approved procedures facility to be subject to accreditation procedures that include:
(a)	 the establishment of quality protocols;
Senator Evans's proposal is:
Guidelines made under subsection (4) must include a requirement for an approved procedures facility to be subject to accreditation and quality assurance procedures that are at least equivalent to the minimum accreditation and quality assurance procedures that apply to a day hospital facility or day procedure centre under State or Territory laws.
That is clearly more specific. When we are making laws, as we are in this particular case, the clearer they are, and the more specific they are, the better. On the second point, and I am pleased that Senator Evans picked this up, we are talking about health insurance. One of the aspects and factors influencing the price of health insurance is the degree of utilisation in particular procedures.
I have had representations to my office, and no doubt other honourable senators have, from people who are concerned that there may be a degree of overservicing and that there are a large number of unnecessary tests or procedures. Therefore, in my view, it is essential that the Commonwealth conduct utilisation reviews to ensure that best practice medicine, or better understood as evidence based medicine, is conducted through health insurance. That is the reason for the amendment I suggested.
The parliamentary secretary, Senator Tambling, has suggested that there be certain guidelines under section 4. I am not sure of the sorts of guidelines that he has in mind. Would they be guidelines to qualify that the annual utilisation reviews be conducted by the Commonwealth? What are the guidelines that will be used? I would be interested to hear from Senator Tambling about this. When these are clear and before us, they may be more specific and better for the legislature to adopt.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1999-03-24,"—The Commonwealth is keen to insist on, and to obtain, high consistent standards. At the same time, we recognise the important role and function of the state and territory laws in this regard, and what is correctly their prerogative in dealing with that area. In order to achieve high consistent standards, with appropriate accountability mechanisms, it would of course be one of the issues that would subsequently be addressed through regulation.
The debate here of course is one largely of how we achieve this. Senator Harradine did not indicate whether, if we proceed with Senator Evans's amendments, he would be forgoing his subsequent amendment or whether we are going to revisit the debate.
Senator Harradine interjecting—
—Okay, I accept that. I believe that it is an issue and accept that there will be a will of the Senate in this regard.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-03-24,"—I do not wish to delay the Senate; I think it is important that we move on. I wanted to reiterate the point made eloquently by Senator Harradine that the opposition's amendment refers to `at least equivalent' and is about the government drawing up regulations. It seems to me that the government has the capacity to draw up those regulations in a way that meets the intention clearly expressed by the Senate if this is carried. I do not see that there is a problem. The guidelines will need to ensure that those accreditation and quality assurance procedures are at least equivalent. The stand 
 ards and the methods are left to the terms of the regulation, which will be drafted by government.
—The question is that amendment No. 4 as amended and amendment No. 3 be agreed to.

"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-03-24,"—I think we might take them separately, Madam Temporary Chair. I was not aware that we were going to take them together. It was my intention just to move Labor amendment No. 5 at this stage.
—Yes, they can be taken separately.
—The substance of the amendment to be moved by the opposition seeks to omit a paragraph and substitute the words:
that it is a procedure that, before the commencement of this subsection, was performed exclusively in a hospital or day hospital and involved an episode of hospital treatment.
The reason for doing that is to clarify that the procedures that can be carried out in approved facilities are limited to ones relocated from a hospital or day surgery. I think the government was arguing that that was in fact the case in their bill, but the opposition is concerned that the wording of the bill at present would allow procedures which are done in a doctor's surgery to now be done in an approved facility and to attract the facility's fee, provided that the procedure could also be done in a hospital. For a public patient, this would mean that they would get only 75 per cent of the schedule fee rather than the 85 per cent they would get now.
The transfer of procedures from a doctor's surgery to an approved facility would also increase the total cost of providing health and would cancel out the savings from relocating procedures from hospitals. This would therefore wipe out the economic justification the government has made for this bill, which is based on procedures being carried out at the 
 venue that is most appropriate and that comes at the least cost to the government and to the consumer of the service.
The government indicated to us earlier that this amendment was unnecessary and that they had some problems with the use of the word `exclusively'. I am not sure what the government will be doing. Obviously we will hear from Senator Tambling. All I want to indicate is that the opposition is willing to participate in getting the best possible wording to achieve the intention of our amendment.
Clearly what we want to see ensured is that this is not a recipe for increasing costs either to the health system or to the patients, and that these approved facilities provide alternatives to procedures that are carried out in hospitals or day surgeries now rather than move the other way. The argument is quite clear. I am not sure that we are in any disagreement with the government about the policy outcome, so I would move our amendment with that argument and perhaps see what other senators had to say.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1999-03-24,"—The government would not object to the substance of this amendment. However, I would like to suggest a modification to the amendment so that it would read:
(a) that this is a procedure that, before the commencement of this subsection, is usually (not exclusively) performed in a hospital or day hospital facility and involved an episode of hospital treatment; but
Technological advances are such that a number of procedures that might still be carried out in hospital or day hospital facilities could, in the very near future, be safely undertaken elsewhere. If Senator Chris Evans was prepared to agree to those words, I could indicate the government would support the amendment.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Lees, Sen Meg",AD,1999-03-24,"—I understand what Senator Tambling is doing and I agree that technology is racing ahead, probably ahead of most of us, but my problem is that we are reducing from 85 per cent 
 to 75 per cent the actual Medicare rebate that people can claim back. That is no problem for those people who are privately insured, but for public patients it is going to be a very different issue.
In the past public patients who went along to a doctor's surgery—perhaps they had some major package of stitching or something that could just as easily have been done in casualty but they did not go to casualty because their local 24-hour clinic had all the facilities to do it there—would get 85 per cent back. But we have a situation now where the public patients are going to suffer. Presumably these new facilities are going to be established in some of the clinics. Perhaps they are going to be established in nursing homes. We have not had any indication from the government as to exactly where they see these new facilities being established.
If the opposition's last amendment had got up—the one relating to taking it back up to 85 per cent and looking after public patients—then I would be happy with what the government was doing. But at the moment my concern is that we are again leaving behind the public patients and only looking at people with private health insurance. I do not think we should continue down this road, with all the advantages going to those who are privately insured when the people who want to look after themselves are left behind.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Harradine, Sen Brian",IND,1999-03-24,"—As it presently stands, the uninsured—that is, the public patient—has to pay all the costs when they have a procedure in a private hospital. The government covers their medical costs of up to 75 per cent of the medical benefits schedule.
This bill attempts to maintain the 75 per cent coverage for public patients receiving procedures out of the hospital that they normally receive in the hospital. This is in contrast to the normal situation where, when they are attending a medical practitioner, they are reimbursed 85 per cent of the MBS for medical costs. To raise the MBS to 85 per cent will only encourage state governments to push some hospital procedures into approved facilities so that the Commonwealth pays rather than the state.
I raise this issue preparatory to asking a question of the parliamentary secretary because, as we all know, this is a difficult and complex issue of health financing and it is unclear whether public patients will necessarily face higher out-of-pocket expenses through these changes. I would like to hear from the parliamentary secretary what the government's response is on this particular issue. It seems to me that raising the MBS to 85 per cent only further increases Commonwealth expenditure on private health services without necessarily adding any substantial funding to public services. I would be concerned that leaving the MBS at 75 per cent may set a precedent for other areas of out-of-hospital care to be reduced to 75 per cent from 85 per cent.
Consequently, can the government assure us that the 75 per cent rebate will only apply to certain procedures and that the Commonwealth will guarantee that it will not apply more broadly in the future? I would like to hear the government's response to what I have just said.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1999-03-24,"—I appreciate the comments that have been made by Senator Harradine. They probably impinge more directly on the next amendment that we will be addressing in committee as opposed to Senator Evans's amendment that is currently before us. We will certainly go into the detail of that on that next amendment. However, I indicate that where a facility is essentially the same, the procedure is the same: the benefits will not alter and will be the same.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Evans, Sen Chris",ALP,1999-03-24,"—I want to `fess up' to the committee and indicate that I might have misled them on the basis that I was working off the opposition's first draft amendments and not the revised amendments. When Senator Tambling proposed to amend our amendments it became clear to me. Perhaps the first question to ask is whether people have a list of revised opposition amendments before them or the original list. I have a document titled, `Opposition amendments revised'. Is that before the—
—Yes. Senators should have revised copy 1279.
—As I indicated in speaking to Labor amendment No. 5, there had been some discussion with the government because the government had indicated, basically, acceptance of the policy direction but had raised concerns about the question of exclusivity that was contained in our original amendment. Only after I spoke to our amendment did I realise that I was operating from the old amendments as well. So I thought it important to clarify where we were at.
I am not sure that Senator Tambling formally moved his amendment but, for the record, I think it is important that I now move revised opposition amendment No. 5. I move:
(5)	 Schedule 1, item 21, page 13 (lines 18 and 19), omit paragraph (a), substitute:
(a)	 that it is a procedure that, before the commencement of this subsection, was performed usually in a hospital or day hospital and involved an episode of hospital treatment; but
We have made an attempt to meet the government some way in reaching a compromise on that provision.
I must admit, after I heard Senator Tambling, I thought I preferred his, but so as to not confuse the chamber any further I intend proceeding with our revised amendment. I do not want to stifle a debate which can move on to other things. I thought we needed to be clear what we were considering. The opposition has moved the revised amendment which includes the word `usually'.
I take Senator Lees's point, too. I actually dealt with the amendments separately, but I think Senator Lees made a valid point when she said that her attitude to this was based upon the attitude to the second issue which Senator Harradine also raised. I suppose for the purposes of the debate we could make those points now and then vote separately. I thought it important to clarify the record.",SENATE,<title>HEALTH LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 2) 1999</title>,<title>In Committee</title>,Bills,3,1
"Tambling, Sen Grant",CLP,1999-03-24,"—It is regrettable I did not have in front of me the revised sheet, and for that I am sorry because 
 in that case it would not have been necessary for me to have foreshadowed the amendment I was proposing, which I do not think I moved, so that can lie on the table.

"Tierney, Sen John",LP,1999-03-24,"—I have spoken twice in the Senate recently about an issue of immense concern to me. On 17 February I rose to inform the Senate of a meeting that I convened in my home town at the Newcastle Workers Club. It was an appropriate venue for a meeting about drugs. People will remember the great tragedy suffered by Newcastle during an earthquake a decade ago. This time, the tragedy is not so much a natural disaster but more a human disaster. The meeting was about the drug scourge that has been tearing apart my home town of Newcastle and, in fact, the whole of New South Wales.
The Workers Club is home to the office of Bryce Gaudry, state Labor member for the electorate of Newcastle for the past 11 years. He did condescend to attend, at the 11th hour, the drug crisis meeting, not realising the depth of the drug problem in his home town. Nor did he realise the depth of the drug problem in his own state. That was to be expected, given the Carr government's failure in every 
 aspect of dealing with the drug crisis in New South Wales.
New South Wales is the crime capital of Australia. New South Wales is the drug capital of Australia. The public has been kept in the dark with regard to the problem, thanks largely to the Carr government's inconsistent, ambiguous policy. It is a do-nothing policy, akin to their do-nothing election campaign.
Everywhere, we are reminded of the ineptness of the Carr government's approach, which has left dealers to prosper and develop in hot spots like Kings Cross and Cabramatta. Now, half of the nation's heroin overdoses occur in New South Wales. The figure of 600 deaths per annum is a 13 per cent increase on last year and a 73 per cent increase since 1989.
Bob Carr and his ALP government close their eyes, and in the meantime the purity of street heroin has risen threefold since he came to power. An addict dies every 16 hours in Australia. Twenty years ago, the figure was one every five days.
The Carr ALP government has, for two years in a row, cut funding for drug treatment and rehabilitation. That is an absolute disgrace. According to the Alcohol and Other Drugs Council of Australia, it is the worst performing state in this regard. The cost of drug and alcohol programs to taxpayers in New South Wales in 1996-97 was $6.60 per head of population. In the previous year, it was $7.06.
What New South Wales addicts and their families need is a bipartisan approach to investigate the crisis and formulate policies and legislation. We have no chance of this under the Carr ALP government, which has refused steadfastly to have a bipartisan inquiry before the election. They say they will do it after the election. But they have been in power for four years. We are only now starting to hear of measures that appear to be serious about starting a war on drugs. Why now? Why not four years ago?
I remind members of the Senate and the general public of the disturbing crime statistics raised by the Hon. Amanda Vanstone in question time yesterday. In the time that 
 assaults have risen by 2.8 per cent in Victoria, the figure has risen by 44 per cent in New South Wales. The armed robbery rate per 100,000 of the population in New South Wales is 79.3, which is three times the Victorian figure. Under the ALP Carr government, the rate of armed robbery has risen by 105 per cent in five years, compared to 15 per cent in Victoria over the same period.
The unarmed robbery rate per 100,000 of the population is 121 in New South Wales, which is more than four times that of Victoria. Under the Labor government in New South Wales, this rate has risen by 97 per cent, compared to 35 per cent in Victoria over the same period. Those figures are a damning indictment of the Carr government and their record on the prevention and treatment of drug abuse.
Let us look at what they have done in New South Wales. There is an acknowledged link between crime and drug use. There is also a link between unemployment and drug use, but thanks to this federal coalition government, the unemployment rate in New South Wales is now under 6½ per cent.
Let us consider the Carr government's record on drugs, based on figures from the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence Report on illicit drugs for 1997-98. In 1997-98, the Victorian police force arrested 1,900 heroin dealers, while the New South Wales police force arrested 685. In real terms, New South Wales police made one-third as many arrests for heroin dealing. This is particularly appalling when it is considered that New South Wales accounts for 62 per cent of heroin seizures by Customs, nearly half the national death toll for drug overdoses, and has nearly half the nation's drug addicts.
Premier Carr's flawed and failing policy is not attacking the drug menace at the supply level, which would make economic, social and common sense. Instead, he is leaving the dealers to infiltrate the streets and focusing on the users, who are the victims, the weakest link in the deadly drug chain.
This is a view shared by the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence. New South Wales has the lowest rate of finalised investigations for armed robbery of any state in 
 Australia. Eighty-seven per cent of armed robbery investigations are not finalised after three months. New South Wales proceeds against only 10 per cent of offenders in unarmed robbery investigations, compared to 26 per cent in Victoria. If you are a criminal in New South Wales, you have a 90 per cent chance of not being taken to court.
An effective drug policy would see the average age of regular users of drugs rising. The younger generation would not be taking up drugs and policy attention could be focused on the older, hard-core, life users. In New South Wales, the average age of users is 27 and falling rapidly. In Sweden, the average age of users is in their late 30s. Sweden is recognised as having the toughest drug policy in the world. Premier Carr has come to government and ignored the Swedish experience, preferring instead to let the muck run free in hot spots like Kings Cross and Cabramatta.
The Swedish experience makes interesting reading for anyone who has a compassionate interest in drug policy. Obviously Premier Carr and his policy `makers', so to speak, have not done very much research on what is effective in terms of drug policy. In the meantime, the number of heroin related deaths has risen by 50 per cent in NSW. The Swedish government experimented with a similar policy in 1965 to 1967 when they adopted `harm reduction'. But unlike here, they moved away from that fairly quickly because they found that it was a complete disaster. In providing regular drug users with narcotics, the government unconsciously installed and supplied a new black market. Instead of waiting for change, as Carr and his cohorts have done, they realised the need for intervention and conducted an inquiry into the drug problems in Sweden.
With swallowed pride and apologetic regret, the Swedish government took a prohibition approach. Police were granted wider powers to stop, search and detain suspected users of cannabis, heroin and amphetamines. Obligatory urine tests were conducted at police stations and hefty fines were introduced, payable on a PAYE system. By the late 1970s, the government realised that their 
 approach targets, as does the NSW system, the victims more than the dealers. So they changed their approach. Residential treatment centres were increased, outpatient units established and information campaigns introduced. I mentioned in my earlier speech the terrible lack in New South Wales of treatment centres. If there is anywhere the state government should be directing its resources it is to get rid of the disgraceful situation where the units available in most centres are very small or, as I mentioned last time, on the Central Coast nonexistent.
Police in Sweden took a tougher stance on street trading to prevent the wedging in of heroin. Their new focus was on all forms and sizes of trafficking. The number of arrests tripled in the early 1980s as the Swedish government and a willing general public worked together to become a drug free society. The public meeting in Newcastle is the start of that sort of cooperation. Let us hope it spreads to other cities.
The guiding principle of the Swedish drug free society was to show distinctly and unambiguously that all non-medical use of drugs is unacceptable. Methadone maintenance and needle exchanges in Sweden are restrictive and cautionary. As part of what became known as the `caring chain', medical facilities such as methadone clinics were aided by social welfare counselling and a caring base that was the government's social services infrastructure. In Sweden, the interlinked caring chain ensures that 100 per cent of users get into non-government treatment centres within a matter of weeks. In NSW, the figure is 28 per cent. Now the caring base of Sweden is looking into new drug treatments that seem to work. At present, the Swedish government spends $220 million directly on drug treatment and rehabilitation. This is, in real terms, nearly triple the figure spent in NSW under the Carr government.
In the meantime in New South Wales, social indicators of harm remain consistently high. Assaults, rapes and domestic violence are on the rise. Welfare departments are becoming backlogged and social security payments are increasing. The victims of Premier Carr's penny pinching are not just the 
 users themselves, but any member of the public who has their home broken into, is accosted walking down the street or feels unsafe in the streets. There is sadly no caring base in NSW at present. The Carr government's policy reeks of duality. Methadone centres are closed down ad hoc. Needle exchanges are created ad hoc without caring and support and then closed down ad hoc. Shooting galleries are left to conduct their business ad hoc and then shut up again, ad hoc.
Twenty years ago, Sweden had one of the highest suicide rates in the world. Now New South Wales has one of the highest in the world. It raises the question: where would you rather raise your kids—Stockholm or Sydney?",SENATE,<title>MATTERS OF PUBLIC INTEREST</title>,<title>New South Wales: Drug Crisis</title>,Matters of Public Interest,4,1
"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-03-24,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Assistant Treasurer (Senator Kemp) in response to questions without notice asked by Senator Cook, Senator Carr and Senator Lundy today relating to the proposed new tax system.
My question to Senator Kemp today about the GST went to—
—Madam Deputy President, could I take a point of order? Yesterday afternoon when a motion was moved to take note of answers, you stipulated that in fact the motion could take note only of one particular answer to a minister. In this case Senator Cook said he wants to take note of all of the answers en masse. Why is it correct for him to do it today if it was not possible yesterday for others to speak on those matters?
—There is no point of order, Senator Ferguson, for the very simple fact that yesterday Senator Forshaw moved to take note only of one particular answer. Senator Cook is moving to take note of three answers today.
—My question to Senator Kemp today concerned evidence given by the Insurance Council of Australia to the Senate inquiry into the GST. The Insurance Council of Australia is a body that represents Australian insurance companies. It gave evidence to the inquiry that the transitional cost of the introduction of a GST into the Australian taxation system for insurance companies in Australia adds up to $2.5 billion. It said that it had made representations to the Australian government—in particular to Mr Costello, the Treasurer—seeking relief from that $2.5 billion cost that would go to it.
The council said further that if the government would not grant that relief they would pass on $2.5 billion in extra charges to their 
 policyholders, which is to say that Australians who take out insurance will pay in total $2.5 billion more than they now have to pay in order to meet their insurance premiums. That was the evidence given to the Senate committee inquiring into the GST.
They said further that this was an unintended consequence, that the government had not allowed for this, that the government had made a mistake and that was what caused these charges to arise. They said that because the government was not counting on the extra $2.5 billion—although they would levy it—the government should wipe the slate clean and therefore not interfere with the tax concessions that it was going to give—simply wipe it off. They said that they had not received an answer from the Treasurer about this. Today, my question to the Assistant Treasurer gained no answer either. All he said was that there will be further consultations. What we have now is a chorus from the government about ongoing consultations while major flaws in this GST package have been brought to light and remain unanswered and dangle over this Senate as questions to be resolved in time for our debate on these bills when they come forward.
We are witnessing the age-old practice of a government keeping major organisations on the line by consultations which never reach a conclusion in order to ambush them at the last minute and ram through the legislation. That is what we are witnessing. Australians are not compensated for this extra cost in the compensation package that the government has announced. This extra cost of $2.5 billion would make Australians poorer, not richer, because the compensation package is not there.
This question requires an answer immediately because, as I say, the costs to be borne by ordinary Australians will make them poorer under a GST than they ordinarily would be. The evidence that we have is that most Australians, economically and financially, in doing their household budgets will be worse off—not better off, worse off. This will make them even more worse off.
Another respected independent body, the Institute of Taxation, is comprised of experts 
 who compile tax returns around Australia. What do they say to us? They say, `We don't take a view about the desirability or not of this tax. We are tax experts. We will say whether the law as proposed by the government will work or won't work. Bringing our expertise to look at the 16 bills that encode this law, we say if the government wants a GST it should defer the debate for six to 12 months because, when looking at the detail of the legislation, we see there are lots of devils in that detail.'
When you look at the fine print you discover problems that have not been examined or understood by the government that will create impositions on ordinary people and small business and make the law administratively impossible. This is not a group that takes a partisan view in this debate, but an expert group that says, `Does the law work or not?' What is the answer from the government to them? We have not heard it—we are still waiting. And we will not hear it.

"Patterson, Sen Kay",LP,1999-03-24,"—It is quite interesting that the Labor Party, when it discusses the tax reform package, continues to focus totally on the GST and the impact it says it will have on various sectors of the community and business at large. The opposition has chosen, as I said, to focus narrowly on the GST and it has chosen to forget—or on purpose it is denying to acknowledge—that there is a much wider tax plan. It is denying and trying to hide that this is not just the introduction of a new tax but rather the reform of a ramshackle tax system it created during 13 years in office.
I would suggest that the opposition have forgotten this fact and are remaining quiet on it—as with other aspects of the tax reform—because, unlike their former leaders, they do not want to acknowledge their mistakes of the past. I could go to a number of quotations back in 1985 of the former Prime Minister, Mr Keating—if we can believe what he said—when he went on ad infinitum about the importance of reforming the taxation system. But he did nothing about it.
Bob Hawke at the same time went on and on about a consumption tax. He said that it would force the rich to pay their share and that if we did not have a consumption tax the poor would be hit the hardest. They were the catchcries of the Labor Party in 1985. They did not have the gall or the internal fortitude to actually do something about it.
Let me review some of the reform measures that will be introduced in order to clear away the remains of Labor's decrepit taxation system. Wholesale sales tax is the main area in which Labor continued to place their faith while in government. Obviously, that is the only policy they have got now. They have not put up an alternative. So what they are proposing and supporting is a ramshackle wholesale sales tax system. Despite continually promising to reform it, they never, ever reformed it. Wholesale sales tax increased and increased; in fact, it went up by 10 per cent during the period from the financial year 1987-88 to the end of the financial year when they left office.
The system is now so complex that wholesale sales tax rates differ between 22 per cent and 45 per cent, with no less than six different rates. It is crazy. How can you justify a system that has wholesale sales tax on toothpaste and not on toothbrushes and—this is the example I give again and again in this chamber—wholesale sales tax on strawberry Quik and not on chocolate Quik? It is a ramshackle, out-of-date system.
It is also a system in which rates have been surreptitiously put up. In 1993, there were significant increases in wholesale sales tax, with not one cent of compensation for anybody. For the people whom they are now claiming that they want to represent and support, there was not one cent of compensation when that wholesale sales tax was put up by stealth.
Taxation reform is needed to help provide jobs, stimulate business growth, cut red tape surrounding tax legislation and prevent loopholes from appearing and being used. The reforms that we are putting in place, if we do not have obstruction from the opposition parties in this chamber, are reforms of the whole taxation system. They include remov 
 ing the disincentives for low and middle income people to work and save. We are reducing personal income tax rates, reforming and simplifying income support payments, providing extra assistance to social security recipients and ensuring that the impact of tax reform does not disadvantage pensioners, the unemployed, low income families and so on.
What we have now is a system—which, obviously, the Labor Party wants to support—which provides that when low income earners go over a certain income level, they lose significant parts of their welfare benefits or family allowances. It means there is no incentive for them to get a pay increase or to work overtime. That is the poor interaction we have now between the income tax system and the social security system. We are reforming that.
This is a total package. Australians should not be fooled into thinking it is just about the GST. It is about reducing income taxes to a level unheard of in Australia and making sure that we have a tax base that will provide sufficient money to the states and ensure that we have welfare and health systems that can provide support into the next millennium for the young people who are currently growing up.
That is what we are putting in place—a taxation system which is sustainable. Labor has no policy. Labor is clinging to a taxation system which is ramshackle, out of date and cannot be supported into the future. This will mean that we will not have a health system or a social security system underpinned by increasing revenue to the government to be able to support those—(Time expired)",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Insurance PremiumsGoods and Services Tax: EducationGoods and Services Tax: Sporting Organisations</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1
"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1999-03-24,"—Today we have heard yet again a series of bland assurances from a government that clearly does not appreciate the damage that it is doing to the Australian community by this ill-considered tax proposal which will wreak havoc on many sectors of the Australian economy.
It will wreak havoc particularly on the education industries. We are told that education will be essentially GST free. Nothing could be further from the truth. We are told that Australians will be some $40 to $50 a 
 week better off as a result of this package. Nothing could be further from the truth. We are told that there will be a $240 million saving to the education industries as a result of this government's actions. Nothing could be further from the truth.
When we look at the detail of the legislation, no specific assurances match up with specific proposals within the bill. There are bland assumptions made by members of the government as to the impact of this proposal. When you look at the detail, you see that those assumptions are not borne out by the facts.
What we see, for instance, when we look at the information provided to us by the education department, is that, in regard to the estimate of the additional cost to parents as a result of this tax proposal, and including the government's proposals for reductions in income tax and the alleged increases in family assistance and other compensatory measures, parents will be much worse off. The government, of course, does not have any information—no empirical information—to back up its claims that they will be better off.
The department has acknowledged that it has not undertaken any modelling or detailed study of the impact of these proposals on average families with children at school or involved in other educational institutions. For instance, in regard to studies of fundraising for schools, no specific information has been gathered by the government to indicate the impact it is likely to have on the annual turnover of school fundraising activities.
The government has not undertaken any detailed study of the effect of the compliance costs that will be involved and the additional administration costs for schools. So when the principals told the parliament, through the Senate committee, that up to one additional person would be required in every school to meet the compliance requirements of the government's legislation, and that that was likely to come out of the teaching budgets of every school across the country, we did not hear anything from the government to refute that, because they cannot refute it. They simply know that they do not have any studies, any advice, to contradict the princi 
 pals who, on a day by day basis, take responsibility for running schools in this country.
When the principals tell us that the additional costs will be up to $35,000 per year for an average high school in the state of Victoria—or any other state, for that matter—we are told that the government cannot reassure people about the details of this proposal. What we are told is that there is $500 million available—the great magic pudding—and that all the businesses in this country, all of those tens of thousands of small businesses, the 84 TAFE colleges, the several thousand schools and the 38 universities can rely on this magic $500 million. It amounts to a couple of hundred dollars per applicant, should everyone seek to apply for it. 	We know that the administrative costs will be much higher than that. We know that there will be a dramatic impact on the administration of our education system, the parents and students involved in the education system and the institutions as a whole.
We are told that they will be $40 to $50 a week better off under this arrangement. When you ask for details, as I have done, about the way in which this figure is calculated—since the government constantly spruiks this figure—we cannot get the answer because the government has no answers. We are told that $240 million will be saved by the education industry. How is this figure derived? What assumptions are made by the government in preparing this figure? Again we are told that the answers are not available.
These are questions that have been put to departmental officials and questions that are on notice. These are matters that we expect answers on. We expect to know precisely what assumptions the government uses as the basis for its claim. We expect to know what assumptions underlie the cost savings that are allegedly to be passed on. To what extent? What protection will there be that any reductions in any taxes will in fact be passed on to consumers? We do not get any answers on that front. We have to work on one simple assumption. Most of the education industry today is tax free.

"Chapman, Sen Grant",LP,1999-03-24,"—Labor's miserable scare campaign on the government's tax reform package and the goods and services tax has failed dismally. That is very clear and that is why we now see them embarking on another scare campaign in regard to the administrative detail and the transitional arrangements for the introduction of the GST. Their campaign on the overall principles and policy has failed, so now we see them diverting to a new scare campaign regarding the administrative detail and the transitional arrangements. This scare campaign is equally doomed to failure as was their campaign with regard to the overall issue of tax reform because Australians know only too well that our current tax system and structure is broken. Australians know only too well that we urgently need tax reform. Australians know very well that the goods and services tax offers a fair, simple and efficient indirect tax system. They know that it removes the complexities and the inconsistencies of our current wholesale sales tax structure. On that basis, this new scare campaign that Labor has embarked upon falls absolutely flat.
The case for the government's tax reform package is overwhelming. That is why none other than Bob Hogg supports the package. Let us remember that Bob Hob—
Senator Calvert interjecting—
—Hogs have been in the news lately, so we might get a bit tongue tied about them. Here I am talking about Bob Hogg and not piggeries. Bob Hogg is no junior insignificant member of the Labor Party. Bob Hogg is the former National Secretary of the Labor Party. He was the senior campaign strategist for the Labor Party in the 1980s and the 1990s—a man who is highly regarded and highly respected in the Labor Party.
—Is that all you can do—talk about Bob Hogg?
—What has Bob Hogg done? He has called upon the Labor Party to support the government's tax package. It is clear from what we have heard from Senator Cook, Senator Carr and Senator Lundy—with her question that she did not even know the 
 details of and her interjection a few moments ago—that Bob Hogg's call is falling on deaf ears as far as the other side of the chamber is concerned. Of course it is no wonder that, on this issue, the Labor Party is becoming an embarrassment to itself and an embarrassment to this chamber. Today we had question after question on the goods and services tax. The questions were completely ill-informed and the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Kemp, had absolutely no difficulty in knocking them down one after the other as they were put forward because they were based on false premises and misinformation. In fact, they were informed by Labor's determination to conduct this unjustified scare campaign.
We heard questions asked about the insurance industry, about education, about Queensland and about sporting groups. None of them was based on facts. And now in this debate following question time Senator Cook has the gall to criticise the government for engaging in consultation with various groups in the community about the details of the implementation of the package. Well he might criticise the government for consultation—it was something the Labor Party never engaged in when they were introducing change. Never did they consult with groups and organisations of significance in the community that were going to be affected. Their legislation was introduced time and time again without any consultation whatsoever. That is in marked contrast to this government, which has developed a fine reputation in the community for its consultation with interest groups and community groups that are going to be affected by legislative change.
The case for tax reform is clear; the need for tax reform is evident. It is evident when you look at our income tax structure, as I remarked a couple of days ago in another of these debates. We have an income tax structure which is grossly unfair to people on all income levels and which has resulted in an unfair burden of the overall tax take being moved to income tax. We have an indirect tax structure that was designed in the 1930s and based on consumption patterns of the 1930s and not of the 1990s or the 21st century. It taxes goods only and not services, which are 
 now a significant element of people's consumption. So there is clearly a desperate need for tax reform. There is a need for low income tax rates to be considered.

"Lundy, Sen Kate",ALP,1999-03-24,"—Isn't it interesting that all Senator Chapman can find to talk about is Bob Hogg. What we are really talking about here is the devastating impact of the government's GST package. With reference to the question I asked earlier in question time, it is patently clear that Minister Kemp was not only not prepared to answer the very specific questions about the status of grants that provide services to sporting organisations, he was incapable of even providing some form of description as to where the government was heading with that issue.
This issue is indicative of the challenge that has been presented to the Australian community by this government. How on earth is the community going to decipher the complex administrative arrangements that the GST brings with it? This is part of the problem. This is the reason we have heard so many community groups, sporting groups, volunteer organisations and not-for-profit organisations come before the Senate inquiry over the last few months and state their case very plainly that the GST is going to unfairly shackle them with increased costs in ways that will mean that they will not be able to glean any benefit from any compensation package.
With respect to sport, there is absolutely a very clear and concise case against the GST. We know through evidence from New Zealand that in fact the level of voluntaryism in sporting organisations drops by about half, because the GST imposes an extraordinarily unfair administrative burden and liability upon those people who take their own time to participate actively in the aspirations of their sporting club—usually the sporting club that their own children are involved in. We also know that, as a result of the introduction of the GST, every family with a child involved in a sporting club is likely to suffer a cost imposition—for example, an increase in costs of around $90 per annum for a child playing soccer—as a result of the GST being imple 
 mented. That is not a cost that can be adequately compensated for by the esoteric claims by Senator Patterson and others that somehow the government's compensation package will deal with all of these unfair impositions.
There are two levels of negative impact of the GST with respect to the community. One is the hip pocket of the families themselves. The cost impositions through sporting expenses, for example, will not be dealt with adequately through a compensation package. The second level—and this is where the government has completely misled the Australian community—is where the organisational groups, the community structures, will be at such a significant disadvantage under the GST that it will actually start to undermine our social fabric to the point where voluntaryism will be affected and these organisations will find it very difficult to survive.
In Adelaide, as part of the GST inquiry, we heard from arts organisations that the first thing to go under the GST will in fact be extra activities such as taking arts performances to schools and to nursing homes. It is that kind of value added special service provided by community based, not-for-profit organisations that is an added benefit for the community that is almost impossible to quantify. How do you quantify that in raw dollar terms on the books? The problem is that you cannot. This is part of the unquantified price that Australians will pay if the GST comes into force.
The last point I want to make goes back to contempt by the minister. Today in question time we heard his responses to a series of detailed and specific questions presented to him by the opposition about the operation of the GST. There are claims that have been unanswered about the status of grants to organisations where services are involved. Until the government answers these very specific questions, the Australian community will go on being uncertain about the future and being very concerned and afraid that in fact their future is at risk if the GST comes into force.",SENATE,<title>ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title>,<title>Goods and Services Tax: Insurance PremiumsGoods and Services Tax: EducationGoods and Services Tax: Sporting Organisations</title>,Questions Without Notice,6,1
"Lightfoot, Sen Phillip",LP,1999-03-24,"—I might tell Senator Lundy that 
 the government has answered most of the significant questions that have arisen as a result of this new tax system. The detail of it will be debated in this chamber, but what we must not lose sight of is that the government has introduced a tax that is fair to all Australians. It is a user-pays tax. You cannot describe the wholesale sales tax system in such terms. You cannot tell me what taxes are on specific subjects in any detail. Yes, you can tell me some of these things, but you cannot tell me that you are not going to put up the wholesale sales tax if you get back into power again. What we do know is that you cannot be allowed to put your fingers in the till again. Right from the Whitlam years through to the Hawke years and the Keating years, you have had your fingers in the till and you cannot manage money. You simply cannot manage it.
But let me get onto the subject matter. It is not good enough to say that Senator Chapman spoke about Mr Bob Hogg and to dismiss that as if it were not important. What is important about Mr Bob Hogg? He is the former ALP National Secretary. He is the one who was given credit for the 1983 election win by Mr Hawke. He is the one who has been given credit for the 1990 win and again for the 1993 electoral win. Again, he is not just an insignificant member of the Labor Party. He was the intellectual brain behind the very success of those elections that I just mentioned.
This is what Mr Hogg said, if it is quoted correctly in today's edition of the Age. It said that Mr Hogg has also urged the opposition leader, Mr Kim Beazley, `to break the cycle of organisational venality and stupidity of the ALP in South Australia and Victoria'—and he is talking about the GST. He is saying break the cycle of stupidity and let us get back to some decency and honesty. What the GST does is to bring decency and honesty and user pays to the tax system. We have never denied that people are not going to say, `I want to pay tax. I want to pay a tax of any kind. I want to pay a GST.' We have never denied that. No-one likes paying tax. But what this does, and the fairness that it promotes before 
 the Australian people, is bring in a user-pays system.
What would have happened if you people had won the election last October? You would have introduced a capital gains tax going right back from 1985, backwards as far as you could go, to the point where if you inherited an heirloom from your great-aunt you would have had to get that valued and pay tax on it. We are not saying anything about that with respect to our GST. We are saying that we are going to lift the tax threshold for people who pay tax—from $6,800 to $7,500. We are actually going to lift the threshold. Where have you said that you were going to lift the tax threshold for low income earners?
We have also said that we are going to fund people who will suffer from the GST. We have never pretended that some people are not going to suffer from the GST, but they are going to be compensated for that suffering. We have said that we are going to compensate those people—
—At least be consistent with your party's rhetoric.
—I did actually hear you in silence, Senator Lundy. What you are saying is incomprehensible to me. If I could quote—
—Order! Senator Lightfoot, would you like to address the chair, please, and ignore the—
—Yes, Madam Deputy President. I may say that Senator Lundy is being venal and stupid, and she should change—
—Order! Senator Lightfoot, I would like you to withdraw that reflection upon another member of this place please.
—I will withdraw, Madam Deputy President, and say that Senator Lundy is part of the organisational venality and stupidity of the ALP.
I will continue with respect to the insurance. We spoke about insurance today but we also said that the GST is still the subject of a Senate inquiry. We had all sorts of accusations about the $2.5 billion extra that 
 people that took out insurance would pay. No mention was made of the fact that a GST is going to make, for instance, motor vehicles cheaper and therefore their insurance would be cheaper. You did not mention that. What we have said is that the Treasury have absolutely funded and taken down into detail precisely what would—

That the Senate— 

(a)	 recognises that statistics show that in the State of New South Wales, currently under the Australian Labor Party Government of Premier Carr, rates of crime are worse than in any other state in Australia;
(b)	 notes that:
	 (i)	 statistics from the Director of the Australian Institute of Criminology reveal that in New South Wales assaults have risen by 44 per cent in the period that they have risen by 2.8 per cent in Victoria,
	 (ii)	 the armed robbery rate per 100 000 of population is 79.3 in New South Wales and that this is equivalent to triple the rate in Victoria, and
	 (iii)	 the rate of unarmed robbery in New South Wales is 4.3 times higher than that of Victoria and that it has grown by 97 per cent since Premier Carr came to power, whilst the unarmed robbery rate in Victoria grew by only 35 per cent in the same period;
(c)	 further notes the 105 per cent increase in armed robbery in New South Wales since Premier Carr came to power, compared to a 15 per cent increase in Victoria in the same period;
(d)	 recognises that Premier Carr acknowledges the link between drugs and crime, but that New South Wales police still managed to arrest only 685 heroin dealers in 1997-98, whereas the police force in Victoria arrested 1 901 heroin dealers in the same year; and
(e)	 acknowledges the incompetence of the Carr Government in a state which has 33 per cent of the population, attracts over 60 per cent of the nation's heroin, is populated with nearly half of the nation's dependent drug users, accounts for half of the national death toll from drug overdoses and has only arrested, in real terms, one-third as many heroin dealers as the Victorian police force.
—Senator Tierney, that is a very long notice of motion and I think it is very close to being out of order as well. I will in fact be asking the President to review the order of that notice of motion.
—Madam Deputy President, I would like to know on what grounds you would rule that out.
—I would suggest you read standing order 76, and I will refer it to the President for her assessment.
—I would suggest you read it—
—Order! Senator Tierney, would you please withdraw that reflection upon the chair.
—I do not believe, Madam Deputy President, it was a reflection on the chair. I just suggested you read it more carefully. This is a matter of drugs. It is a state and federal issue.
—Order! Senator Tierney, I have said I will refer this to the President to review under section 76 of the standing orders. That is my judgment and I do not appreciate the comment that you made. I do regard that as a reflection on the chair. I take it that you have withdrawn it.
—Yes.
—Thank you.

	 (iii)	 protect the viability of aged care facilities in rural and remote regions, and
	 (iv)	 address the wage disparity for nursing staff that exists between the acute and aged care sectors;
(b)	 notes the failure of the Minister for Health and Aged Care (Dr Wooldridge) to resolve the:

"West, Sen Sue",ALP,1999-03-24,"—I present the first report of 1999 of the Procedure Committee, relating to the use of unpublished documents in dissenting reports, the appearance of private witnesses with departmental officers, notices of motion, postponements and formal motions, and divisions.
Ordered that the report be printed.

That the Senate
(a)	 in relation to the use of unpublished documents in dissenting reports, adopts the amendment of standing order 37(2) at pages 1 and 2 of the report;
(b)	 in relation to the appearance of private witnesses with departmental officers, adopts the views expressed by the committee at page 2 of the report; and
(c)	 in relation to notices of motion and postponements, adopts as temporary orders ceasing to have effect at the expiration of 30 June 1999 the amendments of standing order 76(1) and 67 at page 4 of the report.

"Carr, Sen Kim",ALP,1999-03-24,"—I support the motion that Senator West has moved. In particular I draw the attention of the Senate to those matters relating to the appearance of private witnesses with departmental officers, which are outlined on page 2 of the committee's report. The Senate will be aware that this is an issue that came about as a result of deliberations of the Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education Legislation Committee, which was inquiring into provisions of the unfair dismissals legislation.
Concern was expressed by members of the committee that the actions of the minister in arranging for private witnesses to appear 
 before the committee under the cloak of departmental witnesses was of course totally inappropriate and, in the judgment of many members of the committee, outside the standing orders. It was felt that this was a particularly inappropriate action to take because it was the view of the committee—and it has traditionally been the view of this Senate—that bills committees would be able to provide an opportunity to examine the witnesses that appear before the committee on the basis of the legislation that is there and in particular, when official witnesses are present, to provide opportunity for senators to question officials as to the nature and the effects of any proposed government legislation.
In this particular case there were plenty of opportunities for private witnesses to appear. Just about every major employer group and many groups of individuals appeared before the committee to provide the committee with the views of a range of people about the nature of this particular legislation. However, when it came to the question of the department's witnesses appearing in the very limited period of time that was allocated for consideration of departmental witnesses, officers from the department turned up with four private citizens in tow. What was disturbing was that the department had taken upon itself to fund the expenses of those witnesses to appear before the committee to the tune of $2,268.60.
What occurred was that this had been arranged as a way of providing a paid cheer squad before the committee so as to support the views of the minister, Mr Reith, and of course as part of his campaign and his leadership squabble with Mr Costello.
I am deputy chair of this committee. So I can assure the Senate, and I express the view strongly, that this action was totally inappropriate and that this was a fait accompli presented to the committee by the chair of the committee, insofar as there was no private meeting of the committee to consider the witness list or to consider the appropriateness of the action. The secretariat, under the direction of the chair, at no time took into account that these witnesses should not appear with departmental witnesses.
Clearly, we are not opposed to private witnesses appearing. There are provisions in the standing orders for that to occur. Furthermore, there are provisions in the standing orders for expenses to be paid upon application to the committee. What you see here in these circumstances is that this arrangement was made as a direct result of the intervention of the government into the provision of witnesses before the committee.
This is a serious matter. It gave us a clear insight into the way in which this government is prepared to manipulate the Public Service and squander public resources to frustrate the legitimate workings of a Senate committee. Once again, it demonstrated that, via his maverick activities, this minister, Mr Reith, is determined to push his ideological agenda on the Australian public. I think all senators should be clear that this was a sham. It was a political stunt and it was designed and instigated directly by the minister, not by the department.
In the evidence at the Senate additional estimates hearing held on 10 February, the department outlined the events that led to these non-departmental witnesses appearing with the department. The minister's senior adviser, Mr Anderson, acting on the instructions of Minister Reith, approached the secretary to the department, Dr Shergold, about the appropriateness of bringing non-departmental witnesses to the hearing. Mr Anderson suggested to Dr Shergold that—and I quote Hansard—`The minister thought that this was a valuable idea.' Dr Shergold confirmed to the committee that it was his belief that it was the role of a senior public servant to provide support to his minister. So in true Yes, Minister style, Dr Shergold agreed that he thought it was appropriate for the department to pay for and bring non-departmental witnesses to attend the hearing.
We understand that under this government senior public servants worry more about collecting performance bonuses and having their contracts renewed than adhering to Westminster traditions or the principles of public administration. We have seen the steps that this government will take to frustrate the will of the Senate. In this episode, it is quite 
 clear that the minister is intent upon misusing public trust in one way or another.
The entire episode represents a direct intervention from what I say is a maverick minister; I do not believe that these views are widely held within the government. Clearly, it is not appropriate that they should be. It is apparent that this minister is quite prepared to pursue the strategy of `whatever it takes', as we saw with the dock dispute and the various matters which are still actions before various courts in this country. I will not go into the conspiracy matters that relate to those. If it is left unchecked there will be no guarantees in the future about the way in which governments will use the resources of their departments—and any other attempts that they might make—to manipulate Senate committees, to frustrate and ultimately thwart legitimate bases for Senate inquiries into what is the work of government through the various bills that it is putting before this parliament.
What this report draws to our attention is that Public Service witnesses and private witnesses have different roles, and those roles should not be confused. It says that it is inappropriate for actions to be taken by departments in this manner and for expenses to be paid by the department without advising the committee that such actions have in fact been taken.
This report allows for the Chairman of Committees, the Deputy President of the Senate, to be allowed to confer with all departmental secretaries and advise them of the views of the Senate on this matter. Hopefully, through this action, we can prevent this sort of behaviour occurring again. Hopefully, it will send a clear message to all ministers in this government that it is not their job to interfere in the work of Senate committees in this way. There is ample opportunity for citizens to appear before committees and provide their views. In this case, the witnesses who appeared were people who did not currently have matters before Commonwealth jurisdictions: some were making complaints about state matters, some were involved in cases that were currently before courts of law and others, of course, 
 paid their witnesses, but they had nothing to say when they got here.

"Cook, Sen Peter",ALP,1999-03-24,"—I move:
That the Senate take note of the document.
The Australia-India Council is chaired by an eminent Australian, the Hon. Jim Kennan QC, who was for a time Attorney-General in the state of Victoria and Leader of the Opposition in that state. He is someone who, since his retirement from politics, has played an important role at a business level in building stronger commercial and other ties between Australia and India.
India is an important nation for Australia from a trade point of view. It is not a nation that ranks highly in the order of Australia's most senior trading partners. It is a nation in which a large part of the English justice system, civil service and structure of law has been transplanted with, of course, local refinements. Australian business people feel at home in India because the legal requirements which they must meet are not at all strange to them and the circumstances of doing business are quite compatible with those of this nation. Despite those things, the business relationship has not been strong in the past.
However, the relationship is growing. During the period of the previous Labor government, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade brought down a major report on Australia-India relations with a view to developing further strategies to bolster and improve commercial contacts. Since then there has been an initiative to involve Australia with nations in the Indian Ocean littoral region to examine and promote further trade issues.
I think it is a great shame that this business relationship has not flourished more strongly. 
 It is not a question of blame; it is a matter of observation. A number of things can be done to represent the opportunities for Australian entrepreneurs in India more strongly than has been done in the past. Certainly, the Australia-India Council is a mechanism for that. I acknowledge and applaud the work that it has done in promoting closer relations between our two countries.
As you know, Mr Acting Deputy President, the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee has inquired most recently into the detonation of nuclear devices in India and Pakistan. While I understand the committee's report has not yet been tabled, it is close to finalisation. The relationship between India and Australia has become more strained now than it was before those tests were undertaken. A view has been put from the Indian side that Australia overreacted in expressing its protest and opposition to those nuclear tests when they occurred.
Whatever the truth of that assertion is, nonetheless there was bipartisan support for the opposition expressed to nuclear weapons testing when it did occur. But there now seems to be a chance, while maintaining a principled position on nuclear weapons, to pursue actively and sensibly stronger commercial and industrial ties. Indeed, by doing that at a commercial business level, there would be greater strength and acceptability for any views that Australia might put at a Foreign Affairs level or at the level of the nuclear issue.
We have a strong sporting tradition with India. We do not have a strong business tradition. I would applaud any steps that the Indian side would take to open up market access for Australian goods and services. But there is no replacement for Australian business people going to the subcontinent, trying to establish business contacts themselves and building a mutually beneficial trade between our two nations. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

"Margetts, Sen Dee",G(WA),1999-03-24,"—I rise briefly tonight to beg the Senate's indulgence. I have received two lots of petitions which are not precisely in the normal format. The first is entitled `Stop uranium mining—care for the future'. The other also relates to uranium mining in Australia and the United Nations World Heritage Committee. The petition states:
. . . that the current mining operation at Jabiluka cease until agreement has been reached with the World Heritage Commission on it's safety in respect to the Kakadu national park.
The petition continues:
We also request that a referendum or other suitable poll, be conducted on whether Uranium should be mined and it's waste stored or buried in Australia.
The referendum should include the opinion of the youth of Australia.
The petition contained 1,495 signatures. The earlier petition contained 39. I seek leave of the Senate to table the petitions.
